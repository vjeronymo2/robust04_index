			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel's ambassador to the United States, Itamar  Rabinovich, has warned Syria that the U.S. Administration will  not in the future be as involved in the Middle East peace  process as it is now. In an interview with Qol Yisra'el,  Rabinovich -- who is also Israel's chief negotiator with  Damascus -- urged Syria to seize the moment because the  Americans will not continue to be interested in the process for  an unlimited period of time. Rabinovich says he believes U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come again to the  region in the coming weeks.    With regard to peace talks between Israel and Jordan,  Rabinovich said he does not expect a breakthrough as a result of  King Husayn's visit to Washington.    The next round of talks with Jordan is due to get under way  at the beginning of July. This, according to government sources  in Jerusalem quoted by the ITIM news agency.</p>

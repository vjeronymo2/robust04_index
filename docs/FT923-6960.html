			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Yeltsin unveils share scheme: Proposed vouchers will entitle citizens to buy stakes in enterprises PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, appealing to Russians to put up with painful market reforms on the first anniversary of the abortive coup, yesterday announced plans for every citizen to become a property owner. In an anniversary broadcast, he said vouchers entitling every man, woman and child to Rbs10,000 worth of privatised property would be distributed free from October 1 through local savings banks. 'This is a sort of ticket to a free economy for each of us. The more property owners and business people appear in Russia . . .the more benefit Russia will obtain and the more secure its future will be,' Mr Yeltsin said, warning that the country would not survive any attempt to return to Communism. In an attempt to sweeten the pill of falling living standards, he also announced a 50 per cent pay increase for teachers, health workers and other public service employees. He said the voucher plan would entitle every citizen to buy shares 'in any enterprise anywhere in the country'. He said voucher holders would also have the option of entrusting their vouchers to funds which would buy shares on their behalf. This is the latest step in the government's laborious privatisation programme, which is one of the reasons why many state-owned enterprise managers are clamouring for the resignation of the cabinet headed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister. Mr Gaidar, who will be strengthened by this new show of support from the Russian leader, yesterday defended his reforms with a warning that the only alternative was dictatorship. 'If you are not ready to go towards a market system swiftly and with determination, introducing emergency rule is the only way out,' he wrote in Izvestia yesterday. 'On August 19 (1991), the coup plotters tried to cut through a Gordian knot of social and political problems by reverting to discipline based on orders and detention camps'. Underlining the split in the country's 'democratic' forces, vice president Alexander Rutskoi repeated calls for an 'economic state of emergency' - an ill-defined recipe which he denies has anything to do with the state of emergency sought by the coup leaders. He said urgent action was needed to stop a free-fall in industrial production. Meanwhile, Mr Telman Gdlyan, a militant anti-communist who made a name for himself investigating high-level corruption under President Mikhail Gorbachev, claimed yesterday that a 'fifth column' was preparing a new coup. The anniversary was marked by a rally for those who ringed Mr Yeltsin's White House this time last year to defend it against Soviet army tanks. The rally attracted just a few thousand people - fewer than the organisers had hoped for but enough not to call it a failure.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES markets ended the week aimlessly showing no strong inclination to move out of the trading range of the past fortnight. The June FT-SE 100 index contract finished 2 points lower on time last week at 2,536. On the day, June was off 25 points. Depressing the market yesterday was a large rights issue from Granada. The equity market is showing signs of indigestion and some fund managers are becoming reluctant to commit themselves to fresh issues. With US equities weakening and the Bank of England making clear to the money markets that it does not want an immediate cut in base rates, dealers say there are few compelling reasons for shares to move higher. On the other hand, there has been little profit-taking by institutions. In the futures market there was some institutional selling this week and this has given derivatives a slightly more bearish tone. This was reflected in the premium June FT-SE commands to the spot index. Yesterday, it finished at just 12 points against 21 in the previous session. This compares with fair value of 15 points. In traded options, Sears remained an active market following the disappointing final results. The December 100 calls were the busiest as a a total of 3,080 lots changed hands.</p>

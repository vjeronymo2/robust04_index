			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Power Corp passes final dividend POWER Corporation, the Dublin property developer, saw its pre-tax profits fall from IPounds 15.6m in the year 1990 to IPounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.6m) for the 15 months to March 31 1992, and confirmed the market's worst fears by passing the final dividend. The profit for the period was up to IPounds 3m below forecasts. Mr Robin Power, chairman, said the dividend was waived 'because of the depth of the property and financial recession' and because the company's gearing was 'temporarily high' following the acquisition of the outstanding 50 per cent stake in the Trocadero Centre and Island Site in Piccadilly, London, from Brent Walker. Dividends will be renewed 'when the board considers it prudent to do so, which should occur in the reasonably near future.' The interim dividend of 2p already paid becomes the total for the period, and compares with 5.76p for the previous year. Gearing was 74 per cent, with balance sheet borrowings of IPounds 166m. The Trocadero Centre and Island Site had off-balance sheet borrowings of IPounds 256m, which would increase gearing to 180 per cent if consolidated. Power was in discussions with an institution to dispose of a 50 per cent interest in the Trocadero; if that failed the centre's borrowings would be consolidated, Mr Power said. Turnover in the 15 months was IPounds 32.3m (IPounds 35.1m) and earnings per share were 9.15p (10.54p). Net asset value rose to 202p (198p). Power owned 1.3m square feet of predominantly retail space, of which 1.1m square feet was leased or under offer. Power currently had no material capital expenditure commitments. Its only new development was in Beverly Hills, California, where it had been granted planning permission to redevelop a 30,000 square foot site. On prospects Mr Power said there should be some recovery in property values in the latter half of the current year.</p>

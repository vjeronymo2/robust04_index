			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fayzah Sa'd] </F>   [Text] Some Western countries have tightened control  measures around Libyan opposition figures living there, asking  them to be more careful and cautious in their movements,  particularly after the mysterious kidnapping in Cairo of former  Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya. The security agencies  in many countries have started to take seriously Colonel  al-Qadhdhafi's threats to liquidate the regime's opposition  abroad.    Following complications in the Lockerbie file and evidence  of  the opposition factions' ability to infiltrate Libya and ignite  rebellion similar to what happened in Misratah, al-Qadhdhafi  made changes in his security apparati to protect his regime,  assigning all these jobs to his family members.    Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has issued a document, entitled "The  Revolutionary Legitimacy," which for the first time contains no  slogans but rather sets out strict security instructions. The  document was distributed among the big five in Libya:  'Abd-al-Salam Jallud, Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, Colonel  Mustafa al-Kharrubi, Abu-Bakr Yunus, in addition to al-Qadhdhafi  himself. It was a big surprise when 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fadil,  director of al-Qadhdhafi's bureau, was told that the document  ordered the reorganization of the security organs as a  precaution against the difficult days to come due to the  repercussions of the Lockerbie issue. Accordingly,  al-Kharrubi's authorities were withdrawn and he was appointed as  inspector in the armed forces, Defense Minister Abu-Bakr Yunus  was "given no responsibilities," nor was Major al-Khuwaylidi  al-Humaydi, who was formerly responsible for foreign, domestic,  and military security. They were all put at the disposal of the  colonel, who is to assign them specific tasks.    'Abd-al-Salam Jallud's role in the people's congresses was  restricted. He is said to live in a private house on the Canary  Islands. His tribe, the al-Mafarihah, has been disarmed, thus  making them vulnerable to rival tribes like the Durfillis and  al-Buray'isat. The colonel has succeeded with his  divide-and-rule policy and in taming the tribal factor and  exploiting it to serve his regime.    Al-Qadhdhafi has set up a security team that supervises all  security apparati, foreign and domestic, operating in Tripoli.  Known as the Leader's Information Bureau, the team is comprised  of presidents of apparati and security consultants. Captain  Ahmad Ramadan al-Asabi'ah supervises the bureau and he is  responsible for security, second only to al-Qadhdhafi. He  studied security in East Germany and Bulgaria and mastered the  art of planning and preparing.    The name Mas'ud 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Qadhdhafi, of the al-Hazrah  clan--a branch of the al-Qadhdhafi tribe--is prominent as head  of the "security battalions," selected military units composed  of airborne troops that surround the big cities. They are  prepared to abort any rebellion or coup attempt. People close  to Mas'ud say that he has recruited many young people in the  cities and that he has strong ties with Rome, Madrid, and  Ndjamina.    According to reports from Libya, 12 personalities are  threats  to lead coups against al-Qadhdhafi. These include Mansur  al-Kikhya and Muhammad al-Maqrif, who resides in America.    Reports indicate that the names listed in that (?document)  will tell the security agencies who kidnapped al-Kikhya in  Cairo, particularly because al-Qadhdhafi had given instructions  to kidnap three of his major opponents: Muhammad al-Maqrif, who  lives in America; Mansur al-Kikhya; and 'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Huni,  who is living in Cairo at present.</p>

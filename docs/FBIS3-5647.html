			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 8 KYODO -- U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor Tuesday [8 March] raised the  possibility that up to eight Japanese industries would be  subject to retaliatory action under the so-called "Super 301"  trade law.    Kantor identified wood, paper, flat glass, computers,  supercomputers, telecommunications, medical equipment, and  insurance as business areas where he said U.S. firms face  barriers in penetrating the Japanese market.    President Bill Clinton reinstated the Super 301 trade  provision by executive order last week, setting in motion a U.S.  policy of removing foreign trade barriers by targeting offending  trading partners for retaliation.    Under Clinton's executive order, U.S. trading partners  accused of maintaining trade barriers against U.S. goods have  until September 30 to avoid being singled out for possible Super  301 action.    Testifying before a House Appropriations Subcommittee that  handles trade matters Tuesday, Kantor named the eight Japanese  industry sectors as areas which he said do not meet U.S.  market-opening criteria.    Kantor in particular cited wood, paper and flat glass as  three Japanese market sectors where he said U.S. firms have seen  a decline in their market share.    The U.S. Government is scheduled to issue an annual review  on  foreign trade barriers by the end of March, setting off a  six-month process of preliminary negotiations to remove what  Washington views as the "most egregious" practices.    Kantor indicated that U.S. jaw-boning is unlikely to resolve  all trade disputes, telling the U.S. legislators that it would  be "quite unusual" if the Super 301 priority list turns up empty  on September 30.</p>

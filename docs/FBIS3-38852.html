			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eva Backstedt report: "United Support for UN Action"] </F>   [Text] The Nordic defense ministers have lent their  unanimous support to the call that the Nordic UN battalion in  Bosnia should be given air support when the need arises. The  ministers have also demanded that the United Nations should, as  soon as possible, see to it that the Danish tanks, which are  part of the Nordic battalion, arrive at their destination, Tuzla.    This was the outcome of an extraordinary meeting of the  Nordic defense ministers at Rosersberg north of Stockholm  yesterday. In addition to host Anders Bjorck, his counterparts  Hans Haekkerup from Denmark and Jorgen Kosmo from Norway were  present at the meeting.    Not surprisingly, Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn  had  indicated that she was prevented from attending. Finland was  represented instead by ministry counselor Hannu Toivola.    The call for air support has been voiced in robust terms by  the head of the battalion in Tuzla, Colonel Ulf Henricsson,  among others.    The idea that the defense ministers have now expressed their  support for is that, if UN personnel are attacked by any  fighting unit, this unit must be quickly knocked out in a  targeted air attack.    "Of course it means risks for personnel if the United  Nations  decides to adopt a tougher line against the warring factions,"  Anders Bjorck said.    "But after the briefing we received today from Ulf  Henricsson, we share his view that the risks are probably even  greater if nothing at all is done."    Anders Bjorck and his colleagues stressed that it is  important that possible future air operations are directed  solely against groups that attack the UN forces.    "We do not want to contribute to an escalation of the  fighting, and we also have to prevent other UN personnel in  humanitarian operations in the region from finding themselves in  a tough spot."    A number of Danish tanks are part of the Nordic battalion.  However, the tanks have not yet arrived in Tuzla, where the over  1,000 man battalion is stationed. At present they are in Split  in Croatia.    "There is an urgent need that the tanks get into place and  can be made use of as soon as possible," Hans Haekkerup said.    "At present the United Nations is giving priority to another  task -- that of replacing the Canadian personnel in Srebrenica  with Dutchmen, but after that we expect that it will tackle the  problem of moving the tanks. Hopefully this will be able to  happen in early March."    One of the Nordic UN force's main tasks is to open the  airport at Tuzla.    "We hope that the United Nations will be able to reach a  negotiated agreement about the airport with the warring  factions, but if this proves impossible we must give  consideration to using force to open it. Such a decision on the  part of the United Nations must of course be preceded by  consultations with us," Anders Bjorck said.    Anders Bjorck also thinks that it is now time for the United  Nations to review its military organization.    "Bosnia is probably the most difficult UN mission since the  Congo crisis. Past operations have been more like policing  actions, whereas now we are facing the prospect of direct  military operations."    The ministers consider that one of the most important  lessons  that can be learned is that peacekeeping operations must be put  in place as early as possible in a risk area.    "Just look at the Nordic force in Macedonia. Not very much  attention is paid to it in the media, but it is doing an  excellent job, in that it has succeeded in preventing fighting  from flaring up," Jorgen Kosmo said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, February 15 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliament  today approved a government bill whereby the Czech Republic  accedes to the Vienna Agreement of 1963 on civic and legal  responsibility for nuclear damage, and to the joint protocol on  the validity of the Vienna and Paris Agreements.    The agreements contain the legal regulation of  responsibility  for nuclear damage in countries which already have the relevant  legislation. Their aim is the creation of an international  system of responsibility and harmonization of nuclear  legislation, and a system offering the public protection and  ensuring fast and effective compensation to those damaged.    Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy (ODA) said that  acceding to the agreement would, among other things, eliminate  the possibility of international conflicts.    The Vienna Agreement, concluded on May 21, 1963 is open to  all UN states, and has 19 members. The Paris Agreement, valid  as of April 1, 1968, associates 16 states. The two agreements  have fundamentally the same principles, but differ in their  wording in some places. They also differ as to the amount  payable for damages.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Property: Lashings of Lutyens for country house buyers - Never before have so many been on the market BUYERS of Lutyens properties are spoiled for choice. Never before have so many works by England's greatest architect of country houses (Sir Edwin Lutyens, 1869-1944) been on the market. In recent decades, one or two Lutyens properties came on to the market annually. But now at least 16 are on sale, and five more can be rented. These include his first country house, Crooksbury, near Tilford, Surrey  - or at least the major portion of it. The Tudor-style house, built in 1890, was later extended and then, in 1970, divided into six units, while the entrance lodge and gardener's cottage were sold off separately. Since then, a buyer of part of Crooksbury has pieced together four of the other parts and 15 acres of mature gardens, which were landscaped originally by Gertrude Jekyll. All this is now for sale at Pounds 1.25m through Aylesford (tel. 071-351-2383). There is a prospect that the remaining part of the main house might become available one day. Two parts of another early Lutyens house in Surrey, also with Jekyll gardens, have come on to the market. Chinthurst Hill, near Wonersh, was built in 1893-95 and split into three in 1954. Although the main part of the house is not for sale, a five-bedroom portion called Close House is being offered with seven acres at Pounds 345,000 through Browns of Guildford (0483-31166), while the four-bedroom Gate House, with 4.5 acres, is priced at Pounds 250,000 by Hamptons of Guildford (0483-572-864). For a complete Lutyens house in Surrey, you have to look to Fulbrook House, near Elstead. Built in 1896-99, it has been restored fully in recent years by John Morris of Therm-a-Stor, who is looking for offers over Pounds 2.5m for the property through Hamptons at Guildford. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that Jekyll designed the 21 acres of beautiful gardens, although she might have advised Lutyens on the planting. On the outskirts of East Grinstead, West Sussex, however, is Barton St Mary, an eight-bedroom house that Lutyens built in 1906 for stockbroker Sir George Munro Miller. It has 20 acres of gardens for which Jekyll's plans survive (in California). Offers over Pounds 1m are being sought by Hamptons at Sevenoaks (0732-460-222). Marsh Court, a Grade I-listed 20-bedroom Lutyens house near Stockbridge, Hampshire, with 47 acres of Jekyll gardens, has been on the market for three years. It was built in 1901-04 for a flamboyant stockbroker, Herbert Johnson, who sold it in 1945. Between January 1948 and 1989, it was run as a mixed preparatory school. The asking price has been cut recently from Pounds 2.75m to Pounds 1.5m by the joint agents, Savills (0202-887-311) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171). Nashdom, near Burnham, Buckinghamshire, is a 24-bedroom mansion built in 1906-09. It was converted into a Benedictine monastery in 1926 but has been empty since the monks sold it in 1987. For sale with 17.5 acres of Jekyll gardens, offers of Pounds 1.5m are being sought by Hamptons Giddy &amp; Giddy (0628-663-596) and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith (071-405-6944). The agents are acting jointly for Arthur Andersen, the receiver of Land Leisure which had planned to turn the property into a health hydro. Planning permission has been given for the Manor House at Ashby St Ledgers, Northamptonshire, to become a hotel with a new 120-bedroom extension. Once the home of Robert Catesby, one of Guy Fawkes' gunpowder plotters, it was bought in 1903 by Lord Wimborne. Lutyens then altered and extended the 13-bedroom house over the next 35 years. It has been owned since 1989 by a Kidderminster property company, Maltsword (0562-66884), which is seeking Pounds 2.5m for it. Yet, Pounds 800,000 would buy Gledstone Hall near Skipton, North Yorkshire, which is regarded generally as one of Lutyens' finest classical houses with 10 acres of formal gardens by Jekyll. Built in 1922-25 for a cotton mill-owner, Sir Amos Nelson, it was run as a nursing home by Burley Health Care until March this year, and is now for sale through the Leeds office of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (0532-461-533) and JH Jackson &amp; Co. (0423-323-171). The cheapest genuine Lutyens house on the market (there are always some claimed wrongly to be by the master) is the four-bedroom South Sussex Lodge, one of a pair designed by him in 1890 at the entrance to the Park Hatch estate near Hascombe, Surrey. Both lodges were paid for with prize money won by Joseph Godman for his Sussex cattle - a staggering thought when one lodge is now for sale at Pounds 178,500 by Hamptons Messenger May of Godalming (0483-417-222). There is no room to mention all the other Lutyens houses on the market but it should not be thought they are unsaleable. A buyer has paid almost Pounds 1m for the Salutation, a beautiful house at Sandwich, Kent, designed in 1912 with 3.5 acres of Jekyll gardens. Nigel Colebrook, of agent Colebrook Sturrock &amp; Co., says: 'Only a handful of properties in this price bracket have been sold in the south-east in the past 12 months, and we received more than 100 enquiries and nine offers for this exceptional property.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan  yesterday denied reports Tehran had protested the arrest of  three Iranians suspected of involvement in the recent attempt to  blow up the Israeli Embassy.    Iran's Foreign Ministry "invited" the Thai ambassador to  Tehran for a meeting "to let him know" it wanted Iranian  diplomats stationed in Bangkok granted access to visit the  suspects, said Mr. Surin.    "There was no accusing, no anger or protest," he said. The  Thai Foreign Ministry has conveyed Iran's message to the  Interior Ministry, said the deputy minister.    The three suspects -- Hossein Shahriari Far, Babak Taheri,  and Basr Kazemi are being held at the police training school in  Bang Khen District, northern Bangkok. [passage omitted]</p>

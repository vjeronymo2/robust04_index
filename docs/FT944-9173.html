			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (14): Reaping rewards from catastrophes - Insurance / Richard Lapper discusses an important new development There has seen some important progress in the establishment of a market for insurance derivatives this year - even though sceptics, especially in the conservative insurance industry, are numerous. In October, for example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT) approved the wordings of four agricultural insurance contracts, which could begin trading in the first half of 1995. The same exchange has seen a steady growth in trade in its catastrophe insurance contracts, albeit from an extremely modest base. And in the over-the-counter market there has been an increasing amount of trade in reinsurance policies which incorporate some of the features of an exchange-traded catastrophe contract introduced in 1992. Perhaps most important of all, sensing the commercial potential of a new derivatives market, US investment banks are investing resources in the business, with specialists changing jobs frequently. The new agricultural contracts - Illinois soya beans, Iowa corn, Kansas winter wheat and North Dakota spring wheat - were approved by the CBoT on October 18 and must now be approved by the authorities in Washington. The contracts - known as area yield options - provide a means for hedging against shortfalls in the harvest of particular crops. Traders select a strike yield for a crop. A holder of a call option might select a strike of 100 bushels an acre. If the actual yield, as assessed by the US Department of Agriculture after harvest, was greater than the strike, the call holder would receive cash. Conversely, a put holder would receive payment if the crop was smaller than the chosen strike. Morton Lane, managing partner of Lane Financial, a company that advises brokers, says: 'It's natural for the CBoT to do this. It means we are committed to this area.' Mr Lane, one of the architects of the new insurance-related market, is also confident about the prospects for the catastrophe reinsurance contracts, launched by the CBoT in December 1992, despite a slow start. Between May and September this year some 6,000 national and eastern catastrophe contracts were traded, 10 times more than in the same period last year. 'It is not enough to satisfy anybody but it underscores there is still interest,' notes Mr Lane, who explains that most of the contracts are call spreads, used to limit and isolate a particular layer of risk. Futures contracts are priced according to moves in a loss ratio, based on figures for claims and premiums compiled by the Insurance Services Office (ISO). The settlement price of each increases by Dollars 250 for each one percentage point upwards movement in the ratio. For example, while a loss ratio of 20 per cent would give each contract a value of Dollars 5,000, a loss ratio of 120 per cent would make the contract worth Dollars 30,000. Typically, buyers pay for an option to buy a futures contract when the loss ratio exceeds 50 per cent and sell when the ratio exceeds 70 per cent. The arrangements in effect give protection in the same way as an excess of loss reinsurance contract. More importantly perhaps, the ISO loss index has been integrated into a more traditional reinsurance contract, the loss warranty. Observers believe that as much as 20 times more business has been traded in these Chicago-influenced loss warranties in the over-the-counter market than at the CBoT itself. A number of reinsurers' underwriting loss warranty products have begun to hedge their own exposures in Chicago, implying that the same interaction between OTC and exchange-rated products which has helped fuel the growth of other markets, could be beginning in this market, too. Within the derivatives industry, few doubt that a derivatives market will eventually be established, even though some believe the development could be long term. Bankers Trust, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley are looking into the potential. Most appear to be interested in trading rather than underwriting risk, but Mr Lane says a number of smaller US investors are considering investment funds which would be dedicated to selling the reinsurance contracts. In the insurance industry, too, from where, after all, most initial demand will come, there have also been some developments. Zurich Insurance, through its Bermuda-based subsidiary Centre Re, has been an active backer of these alternative products. Centre Re owns a chunk of Centre Financial Products, a New York boutique investment firm. Richard Sandor, chairman of Centre Financial, is a founding father of the financial derivatives industry and an enthusiastic fan of the development. 'It is past its infancy and is starting to crawl.' Insurance and reinsurance brokers, such as Sedgwick, Willis Corroon, Alexander &amp; Alexander and CT Bowring. are also exploring the market. Andrew Martin, managing director of Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy, concedes that trading has been slack this autumn and is keen to see modifications to some of the exchange traded contracts. In particular, some buyers would prefer to see annual rather than three-month contracts, to take into account the actual size of a loss which may not be known for more than six months after the event. Estimates of claims from the Northridge earthquake in California earlier this year have continued to climb, nine months after the event itself. This questions the usefulness of the current contracts, which cover loss events during a three-month period and are closed after an additional three-month reporting period. In the meantime, along with others Sedgwick is working on the development of a separate UK or broader European loss index, which would allow for the development of a wider range of products. And Mr Martin remains convinced that the mismatch between the insurance and reinsurance industry's capital base and the scale of potential exposures faced by business should continue to drive interest in derivatives, as a means of attracting new capital into the business. A sudden increase in the number of catastrophes could make that mismatch appear even starker.</p>

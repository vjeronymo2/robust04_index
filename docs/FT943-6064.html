			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Spanish budget battle begins Mr Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government yesterday began the tortuous process of crafting an agreement on next year's budget with the main Catalan nationalist coalition, cautious of giving too much away on home rule and of irritating its own left wing with conservative policies. The wary tone of the annual bout of horse-trading was underscored by Mr Miquel Roca, the chief budget negotiator for Catalonia's Convergencia i Unio (CiU) centre-right coalition, who said an initial meeting with Mr Pedro Solbes, economy minister, had revealed 'areas of agreement and of disagreement'. Mr Solbes' 1995 budget, due before parliament not later than September 30, requires the support of the 17 CiU deputies to pass through the legislature. The Catalan coalition backed last year's budget, following the Socialists' loss of their majority in the general election, after a concession allowing regional governments to control 15 per cent of the income taxes raised in their territories. CiU, the main political grouping in wealthy Catalonia, also brought the government round to spending cuts and to overhauling the rigid domestic labour legislation. This year it has raised the stakes: it wants power sharing between Madrid and the regional executives over the distribution of European Union funds to Spain, and is seeking lower social security contributions by employers, as well as further easing of hiring and firing procedures. Officials are concerned that the EU funds issue could be contested by other regions and fuel claims that the CiU is bent on gaining advantages for Catalan nationalism at the expense of the principle of national solidarity. In Andalucia, Spain's most populous region where the Socialist party lost its majority in local elections in June, opposition parties joined forces in the regional parliament last month to reject the 15 per cent tax concession in this year's budget. They claimed it favoured Catalonia over poorer regions where fiscal revenues are much lower. The Socialist party's left wing and the 18-strong Communist contingent in the Madrid parliament are meanwhile certain to oppose both cuts in social security contributions and increased deregulation of the labour laws.</p>

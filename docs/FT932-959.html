			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Weathering the storm in plastics  -Statoil and Neste have created a new force AN IMPORTANT step towards remedying the ills of Europe's petrochemicals industry was taken yesterday through the planned merger of plastics businesses of Statoil and Neste Corporation. The aim of the deal and other similar moves is to create a competitive company with sufficient backbone to emerge from the industry's depression in shape to benefit from an upturn expected during the second half of the decade. Earlier this year Shell, the world's biggest petrochemicals producer, and Himont, the big Italian producer, announced plans to merge part of their operations. EniChem and BP Chemicals are seeking to merge styrene production; at BASF and ICI it's polypropylene production. The two Nordic groups say the aim was to build further on the best areas in the two groups to attain a stronger technological, market and organisational position. 'Specifically, marketing structures will be co-ordinated to avoid duplication of effort, operations rationalised at production plants . . . administrative costs reduced by taking advantage of economies of scale, and research development activities integrates,' they added. Demand is set to rise and annual polyethylene and polypropylene sales will grow by between 1 and 4 per cent and 5 and 7 per cent respectively, the companies forecast. They also believe the pace of capacity expansion in Europe has slowed. 'Without new capacity, polypropylene could reach market balance by 1996 and polyethylene a few years later.' According to Mr Jaakko Ihamoutila, Neste's chairman, the merger is an example of how restructuring of Europe's petrochemicals industry should be undertaken. 'But other players in the market must also take action,' he says. The rationale for the merger is that it is their best chance to become more cost-effective, better-sized and stronger in terms of marketing and technology. This, they believe, is crucial to their survival. It also removes the fierce competition which exists between them, and eliminates Statoil's upper hand over Neste as its main supplier of feedstock in Sweden. Mr David Glass, director of London-based Chem Systems, consultants, says this is an important development as it reduces the number of players, which will benefit the industry at a time when profitability is 'at an all-time low'. 'The deal also reduces the number of low-density producers from 13 to 12; the number of high-density producers from 15 to 14; and polypropylene producers from 17 to 16,' Mr Glass said. A recent report by Chem Systems claims that cash costs for a competitive European ethylene producer are roughly 30 per cent above the US level, and even higher than in the Middle East. Statoil's ethane feedstock supplies will give the new company a competitive edge over its European rivals, which mostly use naphtha. 'Statoil, as an international oil company, has made a clear decision that petrochemicals and plastics will remain an important part of its business in the future,' said Mr Harald Norvik, chief executive of Statoil. 'In a very competitive business environment we need a solid strategic platform to meet our objectives. The new company creates this base.' Statoil's petrochemicals and plastics business account for 7 per cent of the group's annual turnover. In 1992, the division's sales fell to NKr5.51bn (Dollars 773m) from NKr6bn in 1991 as operating losses widened to NKr438m from NKr30m. Neste's net chemicals sales in 1992 rose 13 per cent to FM10.1bn (Dollars 1.78bn). The merged group will be Europe's largest producer of polyolefins, and is among the 10 biggest worldwide. Its annual production capacity of 1.5m tonnes is equal to 10 per cent of western European capacity. The company will have petrochemicals and/or polyolefins production in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and in the US. It will also have interests in production companies in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.</p>

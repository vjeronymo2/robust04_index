			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LUCK FREES FIREFIGHTERS FROM JULY 4TH FEARS  </P> <P> Despite fears that the combination of fireworks and extraordinarily dry  hillsides could lead to a volatile July 4th, Orange County firefighters  encountered only a few small fires Wednesday.  </P> <P> "So far, so good," County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond said Wednesday  afternoon.  </P> <P> "We put on some extra units to patrol and keep an eye on things, but so far we  haven't had any real problems."  </P> <P> Firefighters across the county had been bracing for what many feared would be a  dangerous Independence Day. The region's hills have been parched by the  drought, and the holiday had officials on alert for firecrackers and careless  revelers that might start fires.  </P> <P> To prepare for that possibility, extra county fire units, with the aid of  police departments, patrolled areas where fireworks are illegal, citing  offenders and confiscating any contraband. By late Wednesday afternoon, police  and fire department spokesmen were reporting few such citations. Newport Beach  police said they issued several tickets and confiscated some fireworks.  </P> <P> One of the fires occurred Wednesday morning in Stanton, when a man working on  his truck accidentally ignited a fire with his welding torch. County  firefighters responded to the call. Raymond said that it looked for a while as  if the fire would turn into something serious because the truck's gas tank  ruptured and leaked fuel. It was contained, however, before any major damage  could be done.  </P> <P> The dry brush in a creek bed near the intersection of State College and Yorba  Linda boulevards in Fullerton also burned Wednesday morning, igniting a  eucalyptus tree and burning a small area but causing no damage to homes or  property, Fire Department officials said.  </P> <P> "They had three engines out there, but it turned out to be a very small creek  bed fire, and we have it contained," dispatcher Diane Boyles said Wednesday  afternoon.  </P></p>

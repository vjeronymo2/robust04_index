After a news conference in  Bangkok, Yi To-sop, Pyongyang's ambassador to Thailand, told ORF  that Kim Il-song is the president of North Korea, but the  ambassador called the president's son, Kim Chong-il, who has  been declared dear leader by the North Korean propagandists, our  supreme leader [previous three words in English]. In answer to  several questions about an explanation of that title, Yi said  that the supreme leader determines the guidelines, not only of  defense, but also of domestic and foreign policy. He is not  only responsible for the military, but for all civilians in  North Korea.    The diplomat did not want to explain in detail the role that  President Kim Il-song is playing. [passage omitted on  background information]    The regime might have used the present nuclear crisis, which  North Korea is interpreting as a mere U.S. pretext for  preparations for a war, to complete the change of power.  Ambassador Yi To-sop claimed again today that North Korea holds  the United States alone responsible for this crisis and he  threatened North Korea's definite withdrawal from the  Nonproliferation Treaty if U.S. Patriot antimissile systems were  deployed in South Korea, the U.S.-South Korean military  maneuvers were held, and the UN Security Council were to adopt  sanctions against Pyongyang. We are prepared both for war and  peace, Ambassador Yi said.</p>

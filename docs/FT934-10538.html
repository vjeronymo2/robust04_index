			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Yeltsin lays down the law to leaders of Russia's regions PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday told leaders of Russia's 88 regions and republics to approve a new constitution stripping them of privileges and rights and asserting the power of the presidency and the federal government. In a toughly worded speech to the regional leaders, the Russian president insisted on removing from the draft constitution all reference to the republics as 'sovereign states' and to a right of secession - clauses which had been part of earlier drafts before Mr Yeltsin's hand was strengthened by his military victory over the Russian parliament a month ago. He also said the 67 regions and the 21 republics must enjoy the same rights and responsibilities - rather than, as now, a bias in favour of republics. A group of regions, including Tatarstan, Yakutia, Bashkiria, Kabardino Balkaria and Dagestan, have objected to these clauses and demanded changes. Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, president of Tatarstan, said that 'this is the constitution of a unitary state. People in the republics will not support such a draft.' However, after a day's argument, Mr Yeltsin ordered a six-man commission to thrash out an agreed position - while making it clear through Mr Sergei Filatov, his chief of staff, that he would not fundamentally alter the disputed clauses and that if no agreement was reached he would push it through in its present form. The draft constitution must be completed and published by November 10, a statutory month before elections which will also include a referendum on the constitution. The republics, especially those in most vocal disagreement with the president, have in the past two years greatly increased their powers in relation to the central government. While president and parliament were locked in a long power struggle, the ability of Moscow to govern the country, and even to raise taxes, steadily declined. Many republics - such as Tatarstan and Yakutia, rich respectively in oil and diamonds - have passed laws giving them prior rights to make deals and economic treaties without reference to the centre. In the aftermath of the suppression of parliament and a display of central authority, Mr Yeltsin is using the period before the elections for a new parliament to stamp his authority indelibly on the country - especially by putting into place a constitution which gives him more powers than enjoyed by the French or US presidents.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Labour warned to resist welfare cuts A warning to Labour not to be panicked into advocating 'ungenerous and unnecessary' cuts in the welfare state is issued today by the Fabian Society. Mr Simon Crine, general secretary of the centrist Labour pressure group, urges the body to resist 'siren voices' saying the social security system will go broke within 50 years. His call comes in a pamphlet published a month before the party's Social Justice Commission is expected to make its final report. Basing his conclusions partly on scrutiny of the US welfare system, Mr Crine strongly backs universal benefits as a way of targeting the poor. National Insurance is a better way of funding 'core social security benefits' than general taxation.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local government plans misuse resources and worry businesses (1) Sir, Martin Easteal writes (Letters, December 29) of the Local Government Commission's support for the two-tier system in rural areas. He also writes of the systematic and objective opinion research undertaken by the commission, that the commission takes into account people's expressed preferences, and that local government needs sufficient resilience to inherit functions now administered by quangos. How odd, therefore, that he should write this letter in the same week that the commission recommended scrapping the two-tier system in Somerset, one of England's most rural shires. How curious that the recommendation should go against the clear preferences of local people and those of most of the key organisations - economic, social and cultural - directly concerned with local government services. Does he really suppose that a rural unitary council serving a population of 125,000 would be an attractive agency for the next central government initiative, such as community care? Improving the two-tier system for rural communities would be a far more acceptable use of local authority resources over the next two years than the costly, disruptive reorganisation which we now face.

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Confessions of a Bovril fondler I believe everything I read about supermarkets. The way they polish their fruit to make it sparkle, the effort they put into wafting wholesome smells down the aisles to make us feel good, the cunning ploy of moving their most popular items to keep us guessing (and spending); the stories of their wiles are legion, and I swallow uncritically every single one. But unlike most of my fellow shoppers, who simmer in outrage at the thought of being constantly manipulated, I love supermarkets. There is nothing I prefer to spending a couple of hours in one of these temples of consumer irrationality, watching the new brands come and go, noting the latest trends in packaging design and watching punters whirl their trolleys around in a haze of clashing subliminal signals. Occasionally I like to pick up and fondle a supermarket design classic as a kind of tribute, like flashing your lights when you come across an Aston Martin DB5; there is nothing quite like enjoying the sleek sensuality of a bottle of Perrier, the brash self-confidence of a Coca-Cola can, tempered by the sinuous curve which represents the original bottle design, even the beefy splendour of a jar of Bovril. It must look pretty weird on the store video, but I can get lost in any of these innocent pleasures. But my favourite game is trying to guess the motivation behind changes in product packaging which seem, to my inexperienced eyes, to have no logic at all. For instance, some years ago, my favourite cereal, Coco Krispies, changed its name to Coco Pops. Presumably, it was a decision taken at a high-ish level, for carefully-considered reasons; there must have been a mountain of market research urging Mr Coco and his pals that while 'Krispies' contained a dangerously ambiguous message, the unique essence of the product was rather better conveyed by 'Pops'. Well, I, for one, was unhappy. As an act of protest, I never gave the new product a chance. I felt we had grown too far apart. The years slipped by, I grew up, and turned, as one does, to muesli, only to find that there was no escape from the packaging gurus: now they were competing for my attention with pictures of mountains. Everywhere I looked, Swiss landscapes beckoned; in fact, I am sure the air got ever-so-slightly thinner as I approached the breakfast counter. Nothing would have surprised me any more. So now I no longer worry about these things. I can confidently stride up to a counter of disinfectants and decide whether I prefer a pine toilet duck to a pot pourri one, or vice versa. I have learned to enjoy the brain-curdling dizziness of the ride, for now I know that none of it really matters. Only one thing continues to bug me about supermarkets - their misguided belief that we all crave the personal touch. I could just about put up with assistants wearing name badges, but last week I came across a truly horrific development - the personalised sandwich. Stilton and apple on walnut bread, it said, with one of those manufacturer's names which sound like a character from Brideshead Revisited, a list of ingredients and a sell-by date - and then, underneath all these, the dreadful words: 'Prepared by Frank'. Now I have got nothing against Frank; in fact it was a lovely sandwich. But escaping into a supermarket for an hour or two every week is one of the great soulless joys of late 20th century urban life, and the last thing I want to know is that there are real human beings at the other end of my consumer transactions. I want my food devised in test tubes, prepared by robots, delivered to the shelves by 40-ton trucks and checked out by electronic wizardry. I do not want to talk to anyone, and if anyone wishes me a nice day (a habit to which the British, thank goodness, seem immune) I just growl. I do not mind being hoodwinked, bamboozled, defrauded or ripped off, but give me a break, Frank. If I wanted human contact I would go to the corner shop. Except that it is not there anymore.</p>

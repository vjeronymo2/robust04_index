			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE WINS TO HONOR PLAYER  </P> <P> Playing hard-charging defense to honor a sidelined friend, Woodbridge High  School defeated Irvine, 19-7, Friday at Irvine High School.  </P> <P> As Bron George watched from the sideline wearing a neck brace, the Warriors'  defense, from 5-foot-5, 180-pound linebacker Dae Kim to 6-2, 220-pound  defensive end Trent Bordok, played with an aggressiveness that flustered  Irvine.  </P> <P> George, a junior linebacker, injured his neck on a tackle in the fourth quarter  of Woodbridge's game against Trabuco Hills last Friday. He was told by doctors  Saturday that, because he was born with an abnormally narrow spinal cord, he  should no longer play football.  </P> <P> Woodbridge coaches and every Warrior -- under his uniform -- wore T-shirts  Friday that read: "Woodbridge Football is made of Bron."  </P> <P> In winning their second consecutive game, the Warriors (2-2) played up to that  slogan. The defense pressured Irvine quarterback Jason Minici nearly every time  he dropped back to pass. Minici completed only 12 of 33 passes for 92 yards.  The Warriors also intercepted two Minici passes, including one by Tyrelle Ash  with 49 seconds remaining to seal the victory.  </P> <P> Irvine (3-1), which entered the game ranked 10th in Orange County, scored first  on a three-yard quarterback dive by Minici late in the first quarter. The  touchdown was set up by a Woodbridge pass interference penalty on third and  goal at Woodbridge's 5-yard line.  </P> <P> It was to be the Warriors' first of five pass interference penalties, the price  of their aggressive defense. Woodbridge was penalized 15 times for 127 yards.  </P> <P> But the Warriors' defense held off all scoring opportunities and Bob Lee  returned the ensuing kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Brian Nurick's extra  point tied the score, 7-7.  </P> <P> Then on the first Irvine play after the Woodbridge touchdown, Minici fumbled  the snap from center and John Rozelle recovered on the 18. After Woodbridge  stalled at the 12-yard line, Nurick kicked a 27-yard field goal.  </P></p>

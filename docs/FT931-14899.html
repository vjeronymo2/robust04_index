			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Securicor sharply up at Pounds 54.5m - Strong growth from Cellnet gives a fillip to outcome SECURICOR, the security and communications group, yesterday announced a sharp recovery in profits thanks to improved margins and strong growth from Cellnet, its 40 per cent-owned mobile telephone network. Pre-tax profits for Securicor increased by 65 per cent, from Pounds 33m to Pounds 54.5m, in the year to September 30. Profits at Security Services, its 50.75 per cent-owned subsidiary where most of the group's operating companies are held, showed an 81 per cent improvement, from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 37m. Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said the improved results partly reflected cost cutting since 1991. But he said 'there is no room for complacency' in returning businesses like security and parcels to previous levels of profitability. Cellnet, the smaller of the UK's two mobile networks, increased operating profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 151m in the year to end-September, of which Securicor's share is some Pounds 60m. Cellnet is 60 per cent-owned by BT and its financial year runs to the end of March. Mr Wiggs repeated previous statements that any 'sufficiently attractive' offer for the Cellnet stake would be put to shareholders. Cellnet's dividend to Securicor increased 30 per cent to Pounds 13m, he said. Securicor's turnover increased 3.3 per cent to Pounds 584m. The security division had a strong second half and the parcel division's sales were lifted by the acquisition in March of Federal Express's UK business. The communications division, which excludes Cellnet but includes cellular retailing, continued to lose money because its subscriber base remains too small. Earnings increased 46 per cent to 24.3p per share. A final dividend of 1.955p is proposed to make a total of 2.62p, an increase of 12 per cent. The same increase is proposed at Security Services to make a total of 5.03p. COMMENT Securicor's public position on selling its Cellnet stake has not changed, but analysts detected the company has at least been mulling over what to do with any proceeds. No sale is expected immediately, and it may be a couple of years before BT makes the right offer. In the meantime, Securicor's rapid growth from the depressed levels of 1991 is set to continue. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 67m, rising perhaps to Pounds 90m in 1994, partly explain yesterday's 8p rise in the A shares to 643p, where they are on a multiple of nearly 20. The company's strange structure, and the difficulty outsiders face in valuing Cellnet, may hold the shares back, but they look a reliable longer-term performer.</p>

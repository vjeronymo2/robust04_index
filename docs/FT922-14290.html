			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Observer: Steaming Sirkka Hamalainen, first woman head of the central bank of Finland, passed a testing day-one at the office yesterday calming the markka and markets following turmoil unleashed by the sudden resignation of the previous governor Rolf Kullberg. Hamalainen, who has spent most of her working life at the central bank, is sometimes said to be the only real man on its management board - all her colleagues being politicians. Given her predecessor's damaging tiff with the government about who was to blame for the country's assorted financial woes, her critics claim her non-political background may prove a handicap in forging crucial political allies. But it seems that Hamalainen has thought about that already. In a country where much essential wheeling and dealing is still done in the sauna, Hamalainen cannot exactly join the boys. That quintessentially Finnish institution remains single sex. However, the new governor, a firm advocate of sexual equality, belongs to a ladies' sauna club whose members include a politician from the Centre Party, the senior coalition partner, as well as the head of Helsinki's theatre. Networking feminists elsewhere take note.</p>

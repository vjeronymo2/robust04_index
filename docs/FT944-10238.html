			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Warner Howard ahead Warner Howard, which rents and distributes laundry and catering equipment, reported a 7.2 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.22m to Pounds 3.46m in the six months to August 31. Although investment in new equipment in its markets continued to be slow, the company said there had been progress in rentals and its new niche markets. Mr Ronald Hooker, chairman, said that the continued strength of the balance sheet enabled Warner to pursue further expansion and several possible acquisitions were under review. Cash flow was positive and period-end gearing was nil. Turnover advanced from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 11.1m, a rise of 4 per cent. Earnings per share were 9.76p (9.11p). The interim dividend is raised to 2.8p (2.27p) partly to reduce disparity between the interim and final payments and partly to reflect the company's growing cash generation and liquidity.</p>

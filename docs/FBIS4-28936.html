At a press conference after meeting Carter that day, the  puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu cried that "the UN Security  Council will take a determined measure, should the North fail to  change its attitude."    The puppets used a profusion of ugly words to bring their  sinister intention against the North home to Carter on the eve  of his visit to the North.    Kim Yong-sam the traitor even asked Carter to "particularly  guard against the smiling strategy of the North" while visiting  it, unable to conceal his extreme uneasiness and irritation.    This made it plain that the traitor was secretly vexed by  Carter's visit to Pyongyang.    Kim Yong-sam's hysteric outcry that the North's withdrawal  from the IAEA is "something abnormal" was a ridiculous jargon.  His hue and cry was, in the final analysis, a mean trash for  evading responsibility for the criminal act in having driven the  situation to a catastrophic phase by joining hands with the  United States and some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat in the  adoption of a "resolution" to stifle the DPRK. By insisting on  the "inevitability of UN sanctions" the traitor Kim Yong-sam  fully revealed the real intention of the South Korean puppet  clique to isolate and stifle the North at any cost by laying  obstacles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks all along.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Tapie to challenge bank on debt Mr Bernard Tapie, the French politician and businessman, has promised to challenge Credit Lyonnais today by launching a legal action to overturn the bank's decision to terminate his five-year debt repayment agreement. The court case is an attempt by Mr Tapie, whose Energie Radicale movement is riding high in the polls on the eve of the European elections, to prevent Credit Lyonnais from demanding the immediate repayment of a large chunk of his FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m) loans. Credit Lyonnais 10 days ago sent a bailiff to Mr Tapie's Paris townhouse to serve notice that it was revoking an agreement signed in March giving him five years to repay his debts. The bank last week stepped up the pressure by demanding that Mr Tapie repay FFr450m by next Thursday, and at the weekend, it took out a seizure order over FFr100m of cash held by one of his companies. Mr Tapie has suggested the Credit Lyonnais demands are part of an establishment plot against him. He said at the weekend his lawyers would take out a court order to force the banks to abide by the original five-year agreement. Credit Lyonnais is trying to clean up its loan book as part of the FFr44.9bn government-backed rescue package orchestrated by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, its new chairman. The bank says the move against Mr Tapie is due to concern about his financial state and the risk of claims from other creditors, notably the tax authorities, which are investigating the purchase of the Phocea, his luxury yacht. However, associates of Mr Tapie yesterday dismissed the bank's position as 'totally unjustified'. The confrontation comes during Mr Tapie's campaign for the European elections, but, so far, the legal and financial threats appear to have have boosted his popularity. His populist Energie Radicale movement still commands around 10 per cent support for the elections and he is now the leading left-wing contender for next spring's French presidential vote. An opinion poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper puts Mr Tapie in third place for the presidency with 10 per cent support, ahead of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader. The only contenders ahead of Mr Tapie are Mr Edouard Balladur, centre-right prime minister, with 19 per cent, and Mr Jacques Chirac, conservative mayor of Paris, with 13 per cent. But Mr Tapie shares first place with Mr Balladur among 18- to 30-year-old voters, among whom both men have 16 per cent support.</p>

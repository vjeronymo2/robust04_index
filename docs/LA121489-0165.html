			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME BELIEVE PLAN FOR ADDING 3RD AREA CODE IS A WRONG NUMBER  </P> <P> When the upscale magazine Beverly Hills (213) was created six years ago, its  editors never dreamed that the swanky city's area code would be changed to 310.  </P> <P> But Pacific Bell and GTE California be damned, editor Susan L. Warner declared  Wednesday. The change in area codes for Beverly Hills and dozens of other Los  Angeles County communities announced a day earlier will have no impact on the  name of her 50,000-circulation society and fashion weekly.  </P> <P> "We are Beverly Hills (213), we are not Beverly Hills (310)," sniffed Warner.  "(This is) a successful publication. We've gone beyond the reason for first  choosing our name."  </P> <P> Warner, however, seemed in a distinct minority Wednesday as businessmen and  officials of communities directly impacted by the area code switch-over  pondered the impact of the phone companies' decision.  </P> <P> Bothered that they were given no input, officials in several cities that will  now be bisected by two area codes said they are considering legal or  legislative remedies.  </P> <P> "We're in a state of shock," said City Manager Claude Booker of Bell Gardens, a  southeast Los Angeles County community where one third of the residents will  have 213 as their area code and the rest will have 310. "We will have to  evaluate it and decide if we want to fight them."  </P> <P> In West Hollywood, which will be sliced in half at La Cienega Boulevard, Mayor  Abbe Land said that unless Pacific Bell officials reconsider, "we will explore  avenues including legal avenues."  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district also includes  portions of the San Fernando Valley served by the 818 area code, said: "They  should have discussed this with us in advance."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said that it made more sense to keep the Miracle Mile, Beverly  Hills, Century City and Westwood together under one area code than Westwood and  Long Beach, which will both be in the 310 area code.  </P> <P> In addition to filing lawsuits against the phone companies, the cities say they  have the option of seeking special state legislation.  </P> <P> "A whole range of things could be considered," said Inglewood City Manager Paul  Eckles, whose city will be split between 213 and 310 area codes. "Legal action  is certainly one. Getting some kind of special legislation to restrict the  phone companies to do this is another."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates rates  charged to phone customers, said the agency does not interfere with phone  company decisions to split area codes.  </P> <P> In the plan due to take effect in February, 1992, a U-shaped portion of Los  Angeles County, stretching from Malibu south to Long Beach and east to  Whittier, will be incorporated in the new 310 area code. Downtown Los Angeles  and some surrounding communities, such as Hollywood and Montebello, will remain  in the 213 area code.  </P> <P> Phone company officials said the split is necessary because they are running  out of phone numbers for Los Angeles due to the region's bustling economy and  increasing reliance on such new technology as fax machines and cellular phones.  </P> <P> In all, eight communities will have customers in both area codes, phone company  officials said. They added that there was no need to consult local officials  because they were determined to make their decision based on technological  factors rather than geopolitical guidelines.  </P> <P> Their primary concern, they said, was to split the 213 district into two  regions of similar projected growth so that any further area code subdivision  can be postponed as long as possible.  </P> <P> By doing so, Los Angeles becomes the first major city in the nation to have  three area codes. The 310 area code will also be the first that divides a major  city along artificial boundaries rather than by geographic or political  guidelines.  </P> <P> When the 818 area code was introduced to Los Angeles in 1981, the phone company  chose a north-south division that coincided neatly with the ridgeline of the  Santa Monica Mountains. In San Francisco; Dallas; Newark, N.J.; Boston, and  Chicago -- where area codes have been split up in the past few years -- the  integrity of city boundaries were maintained.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell media relations manager Kathleen Flynn said that the new Los  Angeles division is different because Los Angeles itself is different.  </P> <P> "Has any city grown and changed as much as Los Angeles?" she asked. "And we  have so many surrounding communities that make up the global and nebulous term  that is Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Countered Yaroslavsky: "What's the old story about Los Angeles being a series  of suburbs looking for a city? I think this is a reflection of that  characterization.  </P> <P> "No question about it, it's almost as if it doesn't matter where you draw the  line to the phone company."  </P></p>

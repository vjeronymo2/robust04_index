			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (25): Good profits - yet unlimited local calls cost only 3.5p - The board even considered providing five years of free calls / Guernsey Telecoms GUERNSEY'S ability to function efficiently as an international offshore finance centre depends on its telecommunication links with the outside world  -and their reliability. Charged with providing them is Guernsey Telecoms, a trading board of the States (Parliament) of Guernsey which has been independent since its formation on July 28 1898 to serve just 70 customers wIth 15 staff. Since then, it has developed as a commercially-run, financially self-sufficient organisation meeting the needs of 36,000 customers in the Bailiwick. The board has just had to halt installation of optical fibre links between the exchange and customers because technology has not kept pace with its development plans. And that, in turn, has helped to leave the board with a surplus of funds. The finance sector-led growth in the 1980s - and high interest rates generated by surpluses from its Pounds 10m-a-year turnover - left Guernsey Telecoms with Pounds 4m more than it needed for capital developments. So it decided to give some of it back to customers. 'The board was of the opinion that to continue to hold such surplus funds, especially with today's economic background, would not be to the best advantage of either Guernsey Telecoms or the people of the Bailiwick,' says Mr Barry Lovell, board president and Deputy (member of the States' Parliament), whose staff totals 285 with a payroll of Pounds 5.26m. Commercial and private line rental charges have been held at just Pounds 6 a quarter, for the past 16 years. Local calls cost 3.5p for an unlimited time and prices were last increased eight years ago. The board wanted to release about Pounds 3m to the States of Guernsey to use in projects to stimulate the economy. It hoped to use the remaining Pounds 1m to give its customers free local calls for a year. The board did toy with the idea of using the whole Pounds 4m to the benefit of customers by providing free local calls for at least five years - but decided that would be politically unacceptable. In the event, after much debate, the States decided to appropriate the whole amount for local economic development. Until 1973, Guernsey Telecoms solely provided a telephone service for the Bailiwick and the connections with neighbouring Jersey. In that year, however, it added to its responsibilities the trunk system connecting Guernsey to the UK, which was previously managed by British Telecom. Inter-island links are provided by microwave radio and communications with the rest of the world are through two submarine cables, one analogue and the other a digital optical fibre cable, which came into service in 1989. They connect the islands to the UK and are jointly owned by Guernsey Telecoms, Jersey Telecoms and British Telecom. 'If any one of these systems is damaged, this network provides a diverse route for all our links to the UK, thus ensuring that communications both with the UK and internationally are maintained,' says Mr Ken Guille, Guernsey Telecoms director. 'Should all else fail, a 'hot standby' microwave radio link between Guernsey and Britain provides an emergency back-up service,' he says. Planning is well advanced for installing two more fibre optic submarine cables. 'This will ensure that both growth and security of digital services between the islands and the mainland are adequately catered for,' Mr Guille says. 'One of the proposed cables will be routed from Goonhilly in Cornwall to terminate in Jersey. The second cable, which is the first ever to be wholly-funded by Guernsey and Jersey Telecoms, will be provided between the islands. 'This will complete a fibre ring between the UK and the Channel Islands, thus improving the security of communications between us,' he says. Mr Len Le Page, Guernsey Telecoms network services controller, says that the importance of continuity of service cannot be over-emphasised, especially for financial sector customers. 'For them it is vital. There are now so many computer links between Guernsey and the UK that the service has to be completely reliable. 'Under international targets for telephony, we have to achieve 99.997 per cent reliability and we hit it. We are there.'</p>

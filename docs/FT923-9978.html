			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Brussels clears Twyford Down M-way scheme THE 20-YEAR battle to save Twyford Down in Hampshire ended in failure last night as the European Commission gave the go-ahead to the government's controversial scheme to extend the M3 motorway. Brussels dropped legal actions against the Twyford Down project and four other UK building projects for alleged breaches of EC environmental rules. The move should reduce UK accusations that Brussels interferes too much in environmental policy. Brussels officials denied the decision marked a climbdown to avoid embarrassing the UK during its presidency of the EC. The other four projects are: the Channel Tunnel rail link, including the King's Cross terminal in London; the M11 link road at Hackney, east London; an incinerator at South Warwick Hospital; and a soft-drinks plant and can-making factory at Brackmills, Northampton. Last October the then-EC environment commissioner Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana provoked a row between Brussels and London when he said work on the five projects should be halted because surveys on the environmental impact, required by a 1985 EC directive, had not been done. The UK has since convinced the Commission that the environmental impact had been adequately considered. Mr David Croker, chairman of the Twyford Down Association, who has campaigned to preserve the beauty spot, said :'It looks like the end of an era.' The European Commission still disagrees with London over the scope of EC rules and yesterday moved toward bringing legal action against two other construction projects where it says Britain did not follow proper procedure  - the East London River Crossing through Oxleas Wood and the extension of a British Petroleum refinery in the Scottish city of Falkirk. Brussels will now issue a Reasoned Opinion  - the second of three steps leading to a court case  - and will give the government two months to argue that proper procedures were carried out. It could take Britain to the European Court of Justice if agreement is not reached. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'We strongly maintain that there has been no breach of EC law.'</p>

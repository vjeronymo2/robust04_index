			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Fears for coal's long-term prospects WHOEVER buys British Coal will only have four years to make most of their money out of next year's privatisation, the corporation's former director of economics says in a study of coal prospects. Mr Mike Parker says the pressures on the industry are such that its long-term prospects are in doubt. British Coal's core business depends almost entirely on its contracts to supply the electricity generation industry. When these expire in 1998, the business becomes 'very risky' because the final stage in deregulation of the electricity market that year will encourage a switch to short-term contracts. The report, published by Oxford Economic Research Associates, forecasts that coal-fired capacity will fall from 30GW to between 6GW and 14GW by 2005. Deep-mined coal output that year will be no more than 20m tonnes, falling to 10m in 2010. Coal in the UK. OXERA, Blue Boar Court, Alfred Street, Oxford OX1 4EH. Pounds 195.</p>

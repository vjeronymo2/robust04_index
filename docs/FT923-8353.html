			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome 'floor' lowered THE FLOOR set on the Wellcome share price at the recent share issue began to suffer yesterday from wet rot seeping in from the rest of the stock market. Because of the general fall in market, the floor was lowered from 800p to 780p and shares in the pharmaceuticals group fell 18 1/2 to 782p with 7.7m traded. Wellcome Trust, the charity which has been reducing its majority shareholding, had said it would buy up to 40m shares until the issue closes. This 'green shoe' buy-back option allows the issue price to be stabilised. Robert Fleming, lead broker for the global sale, had announced that it would support a price of 800p. However, some analysts pointed out that, in this case, selling Wellcome shares provided a guaranteed exit from a falling stock market. On Monday, two large institutions offloaded large lines of stock. As a result, Fleming told Morgan Stanley, the lead US broker, to quote Wellcome at a market level in New York, where the shares are traded in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The ADRs were quoted overnight around Dollars 15, the equivalent of 782p. When London opened, Fleming followed suit, cutting its bid price, and arguing that the new level reflected the general fall in the market since the strike price was set on July 27. Fleming is believed to have bought about half of the green shoe allocation so far. The final closing date for the issue is August 26. BA declines Disappointment at a fall in British Airways' (BA) passenger yield in the three months to June 30 saw a fall in the shares after first quarter results just shy of market forecasts. By the close the shares had given up 8 to 253p in average trade of 4.4m shares. Profits for the period April to June reached Pounds 91m, against Pounds 9m in the same period last year. tA good result had been anticipated from the UK's leading airliner which led to strong demand for the stock ahead of the results, however a close examination of the figures left the market slightly disappointed with the underlying profits figure. Nonetheless, Mr Chris Will at Lehman Brothers remained positive on the stock and said he was maintaining his full year profits forecast at Pounds 400m because, 'the falls in the yield have been more than matched by the cuts in costs'. Waters easier Water shares were generally weaker amid investor concern about tomorrow's Ofwat report on quality standards in the industry. Recommendations are expected on issues including metering, leakage, and capital expenditure. Detailed costings are unlikely, however, as three other reports due in coming weeks address the sector's cost base more closely. Analysts said yesterday that the outlook for the sector remained positive and that fears had been exaggerated. Mr Stephen Doe at Smith New Court said: 'The regulatory nervousness has been overdone. Higher capital spending will prolong growth in the sector.' Among the main movers yesterday, Thames lost 12 to 385p, Welsh 10 to 413p and Yorkshire 13 to 410p. Insurer General Accident was one of the strongest performers in the FT-SE 100 index as half-year results beat most expectations. The shares were up 13 at best and closed 8 higher at 398p. The firm posted a half-year loss of Pounds 21.2m against a loss of Pounds 105.2m previously. Analysts' forecasts ranged from a loss of Pounds 20m to Pounds 52m. The group said UK underwriting losses had improved as action on premiums and cost controls took effect, helping the company to make a profit in the second quarter. Banks were generally stronger but a couple were put under pressure by downgrades. Barclays fell 4 to 300p after a sell recommendation issued by Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Analyst Mr Derek Chambers cut his forecast for this year's profits to Pounds 300m from Pounds 450m and for 1993 to around Pounds 450m from Pounds 1bn, the latter believed to be around the bottom of the range of analysts forecasts. Bank of Scotland lost 2 to 100p in early trade after Credit Lyonnais Laing cut its current year profit forecast for the group to Pounds 135m from Pounds 177.5m previously. The bank made Pounds 140m in the year to the end of February. The cut was prompted by a downward revision in net interest income. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank saw heavy turnover of 10m shares as a block of 5m was traded at 328p. The shares were unchanged at 328p. Speculation later denied that James Capel had changed its attitude to RTZ prompted the world's biggest mining group to close 25 lower at 525p. Oils were firm as investors speculated on renewed tension in the Middle East. Among the gainers BP lifted 2 to 189 1/2 p with 22m shares traded and Enterprise rose 7 to 347p. Switching out of Guinness and into Grand Metropolitan continued. Guinness shares dropped 12 to 516p, Grand Met lifted 9 to 425p. Allied-Lyons, another Kleinwort buy, added 4 to 602p. BZW's review of the food manufacturing sector continued on the back of what it considers tough trading conditions. Yesterday, the house trimmed forecasts for Associated British Foods by Pounds 10m to Pounds 305m for this year, and United Biscuits, by Pounds 5m to Pounds 195m. AB Foods shed 7 to 386p, while UB tumbled 12 to 300p. A James Capel downgrade was said to have unhinged Northern Foods, off 11 at 232p. Ranks Hovis McDougall slipped 4 to 168p as a block of 4.6m shares went through the market at 150p, taking turnover to a hefty 5.6m, Textile group Coats Viyella saw unusually heavy turnover as one institution sold 3.8m shares at 161 1/2 p through Smith New Court which placed the shares at 162p. The shares closed 6 lower at 165p with recorded turnover of 8.7m. A squeeze continued in BAA and the shares gained 4 to 629p. Rolls-Royce eased a penny to 138p.

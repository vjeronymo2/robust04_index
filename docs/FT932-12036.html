			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Corruption trial for Collor BRAZIL's disgraced former President Fernando Collor is to undergo a criminal trial for corruption which could lead to eight years in prison. The Supreme Court voted unanimously on Wednesday night to admit the charges recommended by the Attorney General against Mr Collor and eight of his associates. Mr Collor, who was suspended from office last September and impeached in December on accusations of benefiting from a massive kickback scheme, will be the first major Brazilian politician to undergo trial for corruption. Mr Collor will be tried for 'passive' corruption. The Supreme Court decision is regarded as an important landmark towards breaking the country's notorious reluctance to pursue high-level corruption. But Mr Sydney Sanches, President of the Supreme Court, warned that it would take more than a year. The others facing trial include Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's former campaign treasurer and alleged frontman, and Mr Claudio Vieira, Mr Collor's former private secretary. The main evidence in the case consists of the so-called corruptogram files stored in Mr Farias's computer, now in police custody. These contain detailed lists of kickbacks for government contracts.</p>

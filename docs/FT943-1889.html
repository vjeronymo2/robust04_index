			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Japanese race to meet global demand surge: William Dawkins and Alan Cane explain why more investment has come to Scotland NEC's investment of Y80bn (Pounds 530m) in Livingston, while smaller than expected, is the latest stage in a race by Japan's semiconductor industry to increase capacity in line with a global explosion in demand. Mr Hajime Sasaki, NEC executive vice-president responsible for semiconductors, says there is a 20 per cent worldwide shortfall in memory chips. It is affecting producers of telecommunications equipment, computer systems and consumer electronic products, all of which have a prodigious appetite for semiconductor memory. NEC's move follows a decision a day earlier by Toshiba, the second-largest Japanese chip producer after NEC, to invest Y100bn in semiconductor production in Japan. Japanese chip companies are eager not to slip behind their US competitors' aggressive expansion in capacity - NEC last year lost its position as the world's top semiconductor producer in dollar sales terms to Intel of the US, a symbolic blow which it intends to redress. The two countries excel in different areas of the semiconductor market - the US leads in microprocessors, the heart of computer systems, which command high added value; Japan in memory production, commodity products for which margins are low. Overall, Japan's six leading electronics companies plan to increase investment in semiconductor-making capacity by 15.3 per cent to a combined Y461bn in the year to next March. US semiconductor producers believe the world chip market will double from its present Dollars 100bn (Pounds 64.5bn) by the end of the decade. The Japanese are more cautious, however, believing that the market will grow only 50 per cent by then, with most of the growth coming from Asia. Taiwan and South Korea are now aggressive players in the global semiconductor business. Either way, chipmakers across the world agree that the sharp rise in demand for semiconductors - 15 per cent worldwide this year - will continue well after 1997, by which time plants announced this year will have started production. A rise in demand for personal computers is fuelling this year's growth, to be taken over in the next few years by memory-hungry multi-media machines, mobile telephones and the growing use of sophisticated software such as new generations of Windows, the leading computer operating system from Microsoft of the US. The new plants announced by NEC and Toshiba will both make 64-megabit dynamic random access memories (D-Rams), the next-generation chip after the current 4-megabit and 16-megabit D-Rams used in most personal computers today. NEC's decision to expand its Livingston plant continues the growing Japanese trend of shifting production to cheaper locations, stimulated by the yen's sharp rise. As a result, NEC's overseas production will rise from 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the total, said company officials. NEC's UK factory is the most productive of its semiconductor plants, but other factors were involved in making the finely balanced choice between expanding capacity at Livingston or at another NEC plant in California, explained Mr Sasaki. California, with its plethora of computer and telecommunications companies, had a clear advantage over Scotland in the size of the local market, said Mr Sasaki. The sites were equal on the other main criteria, infrastructure and the availability of skilled engineers. Financial incentives played a very secondary part in the decision, said Mr Sasaki. One factor that may have tipped the balance, he hinted, was the need to manufacture inside the European Union to avoid tariffs on imported chips, a problem which does not exist in the US. Another was the political support offered by the UK government to defend the interests in the EU of NEC and other Japanese investors.</p>

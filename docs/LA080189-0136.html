			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'GIVE US PROOF,' WIFE OF COL. HIGGINS TELLS CAPTORS  </P> <P> Robin Higgins called on her husband's captors today to "give us proof" of  whether he is dead or alive.  </P> <P> Robin Higgins, out of the public eye at the Pentagon, repeated through a  spokeswoman that she had viewed the videotape of the purported execution of her  husband, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.  </P> <P> However, she said, "It is impossible to make a definite determination on  whether my husband is dead or alive."  </P> <P> However, several Pentagon officials interviewed privately said they are acting  on the assumption that the tape did show Higgins.  </P> <P> "Quite a few of us believe he's gone," said one official, who spoke on  condition he not be identified by name.  </P> <P> The official said Robin Higgins has been "holding up well. She's a very strong  person."  </P> <P> Pentagon spokeswoman Army Maj. Kathy Wood relayed the comments from Robin  Higgins.  </P> <P> "I want my husband returned home," Robin Higgins was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> She also called on his captors to "give us proof of his condition," Wood said.  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Labour to demand pledge on aid and arms Labour will this week press the government for an undertaking that aid will never in future be linked to arms sales. Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, plans to use a Commons debate on foreign affairs on Thursday to urge ministers to come clean on whether the aid budget is used to subsidise arms deals. Mr Cook said yesterday that it now looked likely that the Pergau dam project in Malaysia was not 'the only case of aid following arms sales'. He added: 'There is a disturbing pattern in a number of countries of big rises in our aid to them, following big arms orders by them.' His remarks followed reports in The Observer newspaper that Britain is assembling a large arms deal with Indonesia soon after renewing pledges of aid. The Foreign Office said yesterday there was 'no basis for any suggestion of a link between arms sales and an aid provision in this case or in others'. It acknowledged that discussions on arms sales were taking place between British companies and the Indonesian government. Last week Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, admitted he had considered resigning in the light of a High Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau project. In 1989 Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, promised to provide financial help for the dam while negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal with Malaysia. Mr Cook said the aid budget was there to help the poorest countries of the world. 'If ministers believe the arms trade should be subsidised, they should say so publicly,' he added.</p>

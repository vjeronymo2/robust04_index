			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (15): When the bubble had to burst - The change of mood at the Karachi stock exchange 'BUBBLE UP' says the slogan on a hoarding outside the Karachi Stock Exchange. It advertises a popular soft drink but also captured the stock exchange's mood at the start of this year. Since then, however, political uncertainty has deflated of the market's effervescence and the street outside is no longer thronged by speculators. With a new political leader whose interests appear to lean solely towards the business community, the crowds could have been forgiven for expecting the stock market boom to continue. The corporate sector is likely to see 20 per cent earnings growth this year, and the number of foreign brokerages showing interest might have suggested another ingredient for success in a largely illiquid market. Instead, share prices have floundered and foreign institutions are having second thoughts. The latest crisis in the market resulted from an important part of the government's privatisation programme, the Rs2.05bn public offer of Sui Northern Gas, which was only 15 per cent subscribed and will create a substantial overhang. The causes for this slump in confidence which left the KSE100 index down 32 per cent in the first eight months of the year, were all apparent during its boom in 1991. Pakistan has long had a law and order problem, leanings towards fundamental Islamicism, political instability and an inadequate infrastructure. But the government appears to be at least making head-way in creating solutions to these difficulties and there are few signs that prime minister Nawaz Sharif's tenure is about to be rudely curtailed. The one positive factor in the current down-turn is that it has enabled the stock market to sort out the usual teething problems of an institution which emerged from decades of apathy and attracted millions of foreign dollars in 1991. The market capitalisation increased by 314 per cent between December 1990 and June 1992 to a total of Rs221.38bn and in the first six months there were 46 new listings which raised a total of Rs3.8bn. In spite of this barrage of new paper and investor interest, nothing had been done to update the stock markets' registration and settlement system. Initially, foreigners were obliged to register shares in a process which involved the signing of thousands of certificates and a delay of up to 90 days, during which the scrip could not be traded. The Corporate Law Authority (CLA), the stock market regulator, has reviewed the rules, allowing stock to be registered in street names, so that it need not be re-registered with each transaction; and the time-lag has now been reduced to 45 days. In addition, the IFC, Citibank and Pakistan's three exchanges, in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, are working together on a central depositary system, which should be introduced in early 1993. Mr Mian Mumtaz Abdullah, chairman of the CLA, said his priorities for developing the market were computerisation of trading, setting up the central depository and ensuring greater transparency. At present, the trading system is on an open-outcry basis, on the frenetic floor of the stock exchange. Trades are marked manually on a board, but most sizeable transactions are negotiated outside the market, so transparency is lacking. There is not even a computer link between the three exchanges, although Karachi continues to dominate trading, accounting for around 90 per cent of turnover. Mr Abdullah said computer assisted trading would soon be introduced, but the exchanges were a long way from introducing automated matching. Foreign brokerages complain that since most local broking houses are also stock jobbers, the lack of transparency in the marketplace provides ample room for abuse on the quoting of prices. With a computer-assisted trading system, the information flow would become more rapid. There have already been scandals involving inaccurate statements from listed companies, an area where the CLA is also focusing on changing the laws so that disclosure and investor protection regulations correlate with those in the US. There remain numerous anomalies which are being changed - under current law a registered stock exchange can be one person - but the chief problems are with the trading and settlement systems, which are currently being altered. There has only been one case of a brokerage defaulting, and its losses were covered by the sale of its exchange seat. There still remain the other barriers to foreign entry: the fears of political instability, Islamisation and a textile sector suffering from the worldwide recession but which forms one third of market capitalisation and 60 per cent of the country's export earnings. But with an industrialist at the helm, business sense should prevail over religious sensibilities. The textile sector may be in pain, but it has a vocal political lobby which tends to over-state the extent of its woes in order to extract greater concessions from the government, as a result of its economic importance - it has had some notable victories in this regard. With a plentiful supply of cheap cotton, it is only the small and highly-geared spinners that could be troubled, and the current low cost of yarn should provide a welcome incentive for the industry to evolve towards higher value added weaving and garment manufacturing. The market has low p/e's and high earnings growth, in an economy with falling inflation and rising GDP growth. 'If the political situation is not a problem in Pakistan, then the market is very cheap', argued Mr John Chiu, director of GT Management (Asia). Local brokers insist there is no problem.</p>

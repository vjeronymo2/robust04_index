			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 19 June editorial: "Path of Glory Along </F> Which We Have Marched on Victoriously Upholding the Great  Leader"]    [Text] Today, our party and people are vigorously waging  the struggle to consummate the cause of socialism of our own  style, overflowing with confidence in victory and grit. On the  grand march of audaciously smashing the imperialists'  antisocialist maneuvers and vigorously marching on, the  single-hearted unity around the leader [yongdoja] has been all  the more strengthened and the base of our socialism has been  consolidated impregnably.    Under such a thrilling [pokchan] atmosphere, we are  observing  a meaningful day marking Comrade Kim Chong-il's, the dear leader  of our party and people, 30th anniversary of working at the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    Our party members and people, who look back with deep  emotion  on the past 30 years of history in which they have marched  following the great guidance, are filled with great pride and  dignity of upholding the peerless man. They are filled with  firm resolve to endlessly glorify our party's leadership  achievements.    Three decades ago, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  began  to lead the party work, responding to the desire of all the  people and the requirement of the developing revolution. It was  a great event of historic significance in the development of the  party and the revolution.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The  question of inheriting the leadership has been successfully  solved in our country because Comrade Kim Chong-il wisely guided  the overall work of the party, the state, and the Army from a  long time ago.    The working class cause of revolution and party building has  been pioneered by the leader [suryong] and is inherited and  consummated by the leader [yongdoja] who is endlessly faithful  to the leader's [suryong] cause. Upholding the leader [chidoja]  who has distinguished resources and traits of leadership at the  head of the party and revolution is a fundamental problem  deciding the destiny and future of the revolution.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great leader  [yongdoja] who has a rare ideological and theoretical wisdom,  excelled in the art of leadership, and the invincible art of  military operations. He is a true leader [chidoja] of the  people who has both literary and military accomplishments.    With Comrade Kim Chong-il leading the party work, a broad  road has opened to glorify the party forever as a revolutionary  party of chuche and accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche  pioneered in the thick forests of Mt. Paektu.    We cannot think about the indomitable might of today's WPK,  the grand appearance of our ever-victorious socialist  fatherland, and the bright future for our revolution and nation,  apart from this historical event in which a great guiding hand  of our party work has reached.    The past 30 years in which our people have advanced,  following the illustrious leader, are glorious decades in which  the most brilliant era has opened in the development of the  party and the revolution and decades of victory and feats.    Our revolution's atmosphere at home and abroad was difficult  and arduous in the past and immense tasks of struggle have been  laid before our party. However, thanks to the leadership of the  dear comrade leader who has shouldered all the burdens of the  chuche-oriented revolutionary cause and the cause of party  building and led our party and people to one road of  invincibility, our revolution has vigorously marched on the one  road of chuche pioneered by the great leader [suryong] in the  thick forest of Mt. Paektu. During these days, an era of great  creation and reform that can be labelled as a heyday of the WPK  has come to this land and the question of inheriting the  revolutionary cause has been brilliantly solved in conformity  with the demand of the times and our people's ardent aspirations.    By leading the party from the 1960's to the 1990's in which  most upheaval events of the century took place, the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed immortal feats for the era  and the revolution that will shine long in history.    The history of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's  revolutionary activities is a glorious and brilliant history of  struggle of a distinguished thinker and theoretician who has  immensely exalted the chuche idea as the guiding idea of the era  with his rare intelligence.    [Text] Resolutely adhering to and enriching the leadership  ideology created by the leader [suryong] are the most important  work in completing the independent cause of the popular masses.    From his early days, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il,  with rare energy and inquiring spirit, has waged creative  ideological and theoretical activities. By doing so, he has  developed and enriched the leader's [suryong] revolutionary  ideas in conformity with the people's aspiration and the demand  of times at a time when the question of inheriting the  revolutionary cause has been raised.    This course has been the path in which the trend of all  sorts of reactionary and opportunistic ideologies have been  sharply criticized and the essence of the working class'  revolutionary idea has been adhered to. This course has also  been the days of creative contemplation in which unpredictable  new theoretical and practical questions arising in the  revolution and construction have been explained with the  iron-willed theories.    On this historic course, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song's revolutionary ideas have been formalized as a  monolithic system of the chuche ideological and theoretical  method, and all the components have been completely enriched and  developed as new principles and contents.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has published many  works  during the past 30 years, including the works published on 19  February and 2 August, 1974, "On the Chuche Idea," "Historic  Lessons From Socialist Construction and Our Party's General  Line," and "On the Fundamental Questions of Our Revolutionary  Party Building." These works are an undying banner that enables  our party and people to carry forward the revolutionary cause of  chuche to accomplishment, and a powerful ideological and  theoretical weapon that leads the socialist cause of our era  along an ever-victorious road.    Truly, an era led by the dear comrade leader is a proud era  in which the chuche idea, sowed on the soil of our people and  brought up as a dense forest by the great leader [suryong], has  been glorified as a great leading idea presenting the present  time and the future of communism.    The course in which the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has  led the party work is a glorious history of the great leader  [yongdoja], who has set examples for the era in the building of  a revolutionary party and strengthened and developed the party  into an ever-victorious chuche type party.    Our party has a long history of struggle which runs up to 70  years from the day it struck its root. The last 30 years among  the long history of struggle have been glorified as proud annals  in which the most brilliant victory has been attained and the  party's political might has been remarkably strengthened.    Raising the issue of strengthening the party and enhancing  the leadership role of the party as a basic link to leading the  revolution and construction, the dear comrade leader has for the  last 30 years put his heart and soul into promoting our party in  a revolutionary manner.    The dear comrade leader's leadership over party building and  party work is consistent with firmly adhering to the chuche  lineage and making our party have traits befitting the  chuche-type party. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's  leadership hand aimed at breaking the old flame remaining in the  party work and fundamentally innovating the party's feature has  reached every part of party building, including the building of  party organization, ideology, and the art of leadership.    Guided by the dear comrade leader, the party has been  strengthened and developed into a steel-like party with  unbreakable singlehearted unity and a solid organizational and  ideological foundation; a general staff of the revolution  leading the socialist cause of chuche to a victory with tested  leadership art; and a great revolutionary party that has struck  its roots deep among the popular masses and formed a harmonious  whole with them.    Today, the invincible might, combat capacity, and high  dignity cherished by the WPK are connected with the name of the  dear comrade leader who has led the cause of party building for  several years at the fore, under the slogan of modelling the  entire party after the chuche idea. The course of the  revolutionary activities of Comrade Kim Chong-il is proud annals  of an experienced, veteran statesman and a great strategist, who  has firmly defended the socialist cause of our own style and  powerfully displayed the dignity and honor of socialism.    [Text] Today, the imperialists are viciously maneuvering  more than ever before to isolate and obliterate socialism of our  own style. Our socialism is advancing without the slightest  wavering under today's situation in which the antirevolutionary  offensive is being strengthened. This is because of the great  leadership of the dear comrade leader, who possesses an  iron-like will and extraordinary leadership, and the most solid  political, economic, and military might achieved by the dear  comrade leader.    Under the slogan, "Modeling the whole society under the  chuche idea," the dear comrade leader called for vigorously  carrying out the three revolutions in all fields of the  revolution and construction, thus he unfolded a great flowering  period of socialism of our own style centered on the popular  masses on this land.    Socialism of our own style, which is being led and  elucidated  by the dear comrade leader, is socialism which is formed by a  strong main force of the revolution in which all the people are  firmly united around the party and the leader; socialism  endlessly developing above the firm basis of self-dependence,  self-support, and self-reliant defense; and socialism in which  the people's independent and creative lives are in full bloom.    In the long course of the revolution, the dear comrade  leader  has provided a strong and mighty national defense power that can  firmly carry out our socialist cause in any environment.    The dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is the greatest military  strategist and iron-willed commander of the present time. By  highly upholding the dear comrade leader as the supreme  commander, our People's Army today has grown to become an army  of the party and an army of the revolution in which the  revolutionary army trait is firmly standing throughout the whole  army, and a peerless strong army that is provided with both a  strong offensive and defensive means. Thus, our fatherland has  been changed into an impregnable fortress.    There has been no time as today in the history of our  country  in which the main force of the revolution has been strengthened  politically, ideologically, militarily, and technically by  highly upholding the dear comrade leader, who is a general among  generals.    Today's proud reality is that all the people and officers  and  men of the People's Army are resolutely safeguarding the  respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il by being of the same  mind. This embraces the firm confidence of a bright future of  socialism of our own style.    Today, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is receiving  absolute support and respect from the entire party, all the  people, and the entire Army due to the infinite loyalty and  devotion toward the fatherland, people, and revolution, and  immortal achievements fulfilled in the process of carrying out  the chuche revolutionary cause. He also possesses a high  dignity among the world's revolutionary people which cannot be  taken away.    Our people have no greater good fortune than to uphold the  dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is leading the revolutionary  cause toward the one road of victory by possessing a brilliant  wisdom, refined leadership, and lofty virtue, at the top of the  party, state, and main force of the revolution. We will deeply  bear in mind this good fortune and honor, and must vigorously  accelerate the onward march to achieve complete victory of  socialism, advance the fatherland's independent reunification,  and complete the chuche revolutionary cause to the end.    Consolidating airtight the invincible cohesion and unity of  the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army centered  on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the fundamental  source of all of our victories. The struggle course of the past  30 years was a process of succeeding generation after generation  the glorious tradition of the single-hearted unity of our  revolution.    Just like the youth communists and people firmly united with  faith and integrity by centering around the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song during the pioneering period of the Korean  revolution, we must put forth our dear comrade leader at the  center of unity and center of leadership. Also, since the party  and the ranks of the revolution were single-heartedly united  around him like bedrock, the life of the chuche revolutionary  cause has been firmly succeeded.    Let us unite, unite, and unite centered around the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il! This is our everlasting struggle  slogan and motto which has not changed in the past and will not  change today or tomorrow. All the functionaries and party  members must adhere to the single-hearted unity of the entire  party centered around the dear comrade leader like their eyes,  wholly manifest its might, and further consolidate the party's  organizational and ideological basis.    [Text] We should thoroughly establish a revolutionary ethos  in which the entire party, the whole country, and all the Army  move as one and unconditionally implement the party's line,  decisions, and instructions under the leadership of the dear  comrade leader. We should also enhance the sense of party  organization and further strengthen our party life. Thus, we  should demonstrate the might of our singlehearted united party.  The solidness and might of our singlehearted unity lie in the  fact that they are based on their absolute respect toward the  leader [yongdoja].    All party members and working people should entrust their  destiny to the dear comrade leader, firmly believing him as the  defender of their destiny, and should firmly prepare themselves  to become true loyalists who resolutely defend their party and  their leader [yongdoja].    We should live and struggle in a revolutionary manner with  the resolute courage and optimism that only if there is the  respected and beloved General Kim chong-il's leadership can we  be victorious without fail and sternly smash any challenge and  maneuvers for aggression by the imperialists.    Resolutely defending the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's  leadership achievement and glorifying it forever is a most  important task to constantly advance and consummate our  revolution. The great leadership achievements by the dear  comrade leader in his 30 years' revolutionary path are the most  precious revolutionary assets for the infinite prosperity of our  fatherland and for the final victory of the revolution.    For our revolutionary fighters who have grown up amid the  bosom of the party and who have enjoyed infinite happiness under  the leader's [yongdoja] great love and benevolence there is no  more sacred duty than to glorify his immortal leadership  achievements.    We should deeply cherish in our hearts the greatness of the  dear comrade leader's leadership achievements and should see to  it that all of our works and lives become a course of defending  and glorifying his leadership achievements.    The trace of the dear comrade leader's immortal leadership  is  clearly reflected in all outposts where our party members and  working people work. All party organizations and functionaries  should establish measures to thoroughly implement the dear  comrade leader's policies and remarks at his on-the-spot  guidances and should constantly carry out this work. In this  way, we should see to it that the dear comrade leader's great  leadership achievements are glorified forever.    We are faced with the heavy task of more vigorously  accelerating the general march of socialism of our own style  upholding the party's grand socialist construction plan. Today's  majestic advance is an honorable and rewarding struggle to  vigorously demonstrate to the world the indomitable mettle and  might of our people who are blessed with the dear leader's  leadership.    All party members and the working people should achieve a  decisive advance in the struggle to implement the party's  revolutionary economic strategy by displaying the revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and, thus, should enhance  the superiority of the popular mass-centered socialism of our  own style. We should accelerate the revolution and construction  with a strained and mobilized posture and should effect a new  upsurge in all sectors of economic construction and national  defense construction.    All officers and men of the Korean People's Army should  cherish deeper in their hearts the sacred mission of firmly  defending with rifle the party's cause, that is, the respected  and beloved General Kim Chong-il's cause; should thoroughly  implement the supreme commander's order; and, thus, should  firmly deepen the might of our Army. We should also lead the  laudable custom of army-people unity, which has reached a high  plane in the course of upholding the respected and beloved  comrade supreme commander, to be brought to fuller bloom in the  whole society.    Today, the enemies of the revolution are viciously running  wild. However, the future of our revolution is bright, and our  victory is certain.    Let all of us firmly unite around the dear leader Comrade  Kim  Chong-il and more vigorously advance for the final victory of  the chuche revolutionary cause and for national reunification.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in "NEGA Reports" column: "Crimea"] </F>   [Text] The current first session of Crimea's Supreme  Soviet registered a "Russia" faction on 12 May. It comprises 47  deputies, exactly half the parliament. Far from all the  deputies-members of the "Russia" election bloc, which numbers  155, joined the faction. In observers' estimates, the fact that  the Supreme Soviet chairman and his lieutenants will be backing  the faction, the deputies comprising it will be able to pass any  decisions (with the exception of constitutional ones) ignoring  the other parliamentarians' will. "Russia" is the second faction  of Crimea's new parliament. The first to have been registered  was the Crimea Tatar People's Assembly faction comprised of 14  deputies.</p>

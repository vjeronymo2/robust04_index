			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (8): Turning point for farming - Severe drought and radical reforms have transformed the sector IT HAS been the year of the drought in Zambia. But it has also been a year which has seen the most fundamental agricultural reforms since independence. Provided government implements the overall economic reform programme, farmers may well look back on 1992 as a turning point in agriculture's fortunes. Given normal weather, says Mr Guy Scott, the energetic minister of agriculture, 1993 could be the year when Zambia started to realise the potential of what Mr Scott, a former farmer, describes as the country's most valuable resource - 9m hectares of good arable land, of which only a fifth is utilised. The impact of the region's worst drought in living memory makes conventional assessment of Zambia's agricultural sector almost impossible, the minister acknowledges. But the statistics of a disaster which has brought about a 10 per cent fall in GDP this year are ready to hand. The country's staple food  -the maize crop - has been devastated and many farmers are fighting for survival. Yet Zambia has emerged remarkably well from what could have become a catastrophe, Mr Scott points out. The government and non-government organisations (NGOs) have joined forces to run a widely acclaimed relief operation which may provide lessons for the rest of Africa. Rains for the 1991-2 season were 60 per cent below normal, and the marketable surplus of maize normally around 1.2m tons, fell to 250,000 tons. At the end of February the government declared a national disaster and set in train efforts to find and distribute 950,000 tons of feed grains. By May 245,000 tons of maize had been bought by government from its own resources. Donor assistance in cash and kind ensured that the food supply target was met. However, ensuring the food reaches those in greatest need and that food aid is not manipulated by government and politicians for profit or patronage proved more difficult. The Zambian solution was 'to remove the temptation and to cut the red tape', as one official put it. An NGO was created with government's blessing to help handle the disaster. Overseeing the exercise is the Programme to Prevent Malnutrition - a committee chaired by the minister of health and including representatives of the ministries of agriculture, finance, water affairs and community development. Working with government officials are representatives of the World Food Programme, Unicef and a wide range of NGOs, churches and community organisations. But crucial to the success of the relief operation has been an NGO created for the operation, the Programme against Malnutrition, whose staff backs up the aid organisations, reports on the use of donated food to the World Food Programme and accounts for aid funds to the ministry of finance and donors. Committees covering the drought-affected areas include community leaders drawn from churches, hospitals and schools. The PPM provides money to NGOs to subsidise transport costs of taking food to remote areas. Families unable to pay for maize participate in food-for-work schemes, ranging from mending rural roads to repairing schools desk. The old and the sick receive free food. It is, say donors, one of Africa's most efficient food relief projects. But equally important, says Mr Scott, are the radical changes being made in agricultural policy. According to a recent editorial in Productive Farming, the journal of the National Farmers' Union, since independence 'one of the main obstacles to farming progress was the gross inefficiency of the state marketing system. It was illegal to sell maize and other scheduled crops except to authorised government bodies'. It goes on: 'Bureaucracy, inefficiency, theft, painfully slow handling of crops, wasteful distribution and storage, failure to provide farming inputs, long delays between crop delivery and payment, all contributed to a dismal performance, costly to the tax payer and infuriating to the farmer'. To the delight of farmers - including some 400 white farmers - the government has drastically reduced state intervention since taking office. Subsidies on maize meal have been eliminated and producer prices have risen. Market forces will determine the price for the coming season. Should it prove necessary to import maize, government has undertaken not to sell it below Dollars 14 per 90kg bag. Marketing of fertiliser has also been decontrolled. Subsidies have ended, as has the state monopoly on fertiliser imports. Although the Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia is likely to stay the market leader, it has lost its monopoly. But the success of reforms will depend on how government handles credit facilities for cash-strapped farmers. All financing for 1993 domestic maize purchases will be handled by private sector. But tight credit restrictions and high interest rates, make government intervention likely, says Mr John Hudson, editor of Productive Farming. Mr Scott acknowledges that credit facilities for agriculture will be a crucial issue in the months to come. But he knows it will be no easy task to strike the right balance between helping the farmers and persisting with tough economic reforms.</p>

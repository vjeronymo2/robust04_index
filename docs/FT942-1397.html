			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Management: Families' foreign assignments - Richard Donkin on the main issues when sending staff abroad Roger is a senior manager in a large multinational energy company. A qualified petroleum engineer, his job had frequently taken him to many parts of the world but his suitcase-lifestyle had not interfered too greatly with his domestic arrangements. His wife Ann, and three-year-old daughter, Bridget, were settled in their four-bedroomed house on a new estate near Kingston, Surrey. Today they are in a new home - a rented bungalow with gardeners, a maid and a guard that is nearer Kingston, Jamaica. The posting was as sudden as it was unexpected. The job offer came and Roger accepted. Then he told his wife. To say she was unhappy about the prospect of uprooting everything to start afresh in a different culture would be an understatement, but marital loyality overcame her resistance. The move meant she had to give up her own job as an oil company geologist. Her position is less senior than Roger's but only, perhaps, because of her decision to start a family. And although Roger's posting is ostensibly for two years, her company refused her request for a career break. Roger is a big fish in his new job. His Caribbean island status, where he is frequently in the newspapers and mixing with government officials, is a world away from his previous life. But the letters home from Ann to her parents demonstrate that there is a cost - their daughter is not easily adapting to her new surroundings. The difficulties associated with conflicting career paths of men and women are increasingly recognised as one of the biggest obstacles to international job transfers. A study by Monks Partnership, remuneration advisers, looking solely at job transfers in Europe, has found that partners' dual careers are seen by their employers as the most common difficulty to overcome before transfers can take place. An increasing number of companies are responding by providing career counselling for the spouse, says the report. Researchers discovered some examples of executives moving close to airports so they could commute to work abroad. Companies tend to be against splitting families because it often leads to assignment failures. The greatest difficulties, says the report, arise when both partners have jobs of equal status. The survey, covering 1,000 work transfers among 30 multinational companies, found that employers put dual-career families ahead of children's education and language barriers in their perception of problems that needed to be overcome. The results show a marked change from those in a similar survey last year which found that cost of living considerations dominated company concerns. David Atkins, the report's editor, says: 'As inflation has gradually been reduced in European economies the fear of rising prices and different costs of living in these countries has disappeared.' The report found that 40 per cent of the companies were willing to assist with boarding school costs in the home country and, depending on the length of the assignment, more than 60 per cent of the companies surveyed would assist with day school fees in the new country. Nearly all companies would pay for language training for the executive and 90 per cent would pay for lessons for the whole family. More than half the companies said they would also provide some cultural familiarisation training. The findings are supported by recent research at Shell International which found that dual career considerations were a growing issue, particularly among employees aged under 30. 'The trailing spouse makes the sacrifice and all the satisfaction lies with the working partner,' said Mike Coughley, a Shell human resources manager.

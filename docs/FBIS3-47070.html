The Foreign Ministry aims to boost Japan's ties with NATO  this year by cosponsoring a seminar in Europe and hosting a  high-level political and security dialogue in Tokyo, they said.    Japan's increasing interest in ties with NATO reflects  concern over the strong showing of nationalists in Russia's  recent elections, the problem of control over nuclear weapons in  Ukraine, and other uncertainties in the political situation of  the former Soviet Union.    The officials said the two forums will focus particularly on  the unstable situation in Russia, which is the most crucial  issue commonly facing Japan and NATO.    In addition, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is expected to  reschedule his postponed trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels  for July, just prior to the annual summit that month of the  Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in Naples.    Hata was originally scheduled to make the visit this month,  but postponed it due to the extension of the current Diet  session.    Japan has also begun participating in meetings of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) with a  special status short of full membership.    The officials said closer ties with such European bodies, in  addition to expanding opportunity for dialogue on issues of  mutual concern, will be of benefit to Japan as it considers how  to enlarge its contribution to international efforts now under  way in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

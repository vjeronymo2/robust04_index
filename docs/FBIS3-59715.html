			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) has decided to cancel as of 1 April 1994 the development  of the 150-seat next-generation mid-size passenger aircraft, the  ``YXX.'' MITI has been conducting a feasibility study jointly  with the United States on the aircraft. MITI will soon send this  message to their project partner, the Boeing Company, and  expects to receive agreement. This is because Boeing had  received an order for 63 ``737X'' aircraft from a U.S. aircraft  company, and therefore decided to develop the ``737X,'' which  has the same number of seats as the YXX, in preference to the  YXX. Therefore the project could not possibly be continued. MITI  had promoted the next-generation small passenger aircraft, the  YSX and the YXX as two major projects for fostering the Japanese  aircraft industry. The YSX will be the only project from now on.    The YXX project started in 1984 as an international joint  development project with the Boeing Company. A U.S./Japan  bilateral memorandum was signed in 1986. The memo stated that  Japan would be responsible for 25 percent of the project. Both  sides have so far prepared marketing surveys and operational  arrangements, and conducted investigations of design technology.  The development of new airframe structure design concepts  including engines and main wings had been under way.    Meanwhile, Boeing has been studying the ``737X'' on their  own  in addition to the YXX for the development of next-generation  mid-size passenger aircraft. The 737X is an offshoot of the 737  aircraft, and therefore the fuselage and engine are similar.  This is an advantage in terms of cost reduction. Boeing has  proposed the 737X to aircraft companies. Southwest Airline  responded by ordering 63 aircraft, and therefore Boeing decided  to develop the 737X.    As a result, MITI has been holding discussions with the  project's contact point, Japan Aircraft Development Corporation  (JADC), and aircraft manufacturers. As long as Boeing has  decided to put the 737X on their priority list, they have  realized that it is not realistic to develop an aircraft that  would compete with the B737X in the mid-size passenger aircraft  market. In the meantime, they feel that Japan has gained enough  technologies while developing the YSX and producing the B777  under contract. Therefore, MITI will pursue an aviation policy  that focuses only on the YSX.</p>

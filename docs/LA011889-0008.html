			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBYA PLANT POISONS U.S.-BONN TIES;  </P> <P> W. GERMANS SEEN AS INSENSITIVE TO CONCERNS OVER FACILITY  </P> <P> The row over West German companies' involvement in building a controversial  chemical plant in Libya has soured Bonn-Washington relations more than any  event since Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted that President Reagan visit the  military cemetery at Bitburg in April, 1985.  </P> <P> This was the general impression shared Tuesday by diplomats, political  observers and editorialists as the Bundestag (Parliament) prepared to debate  the affair at a session today.  </P> <P> And the scandal over the Libyan plant, which the United States says is designed  to make chemical weapons while Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, maintains  it is for pharmaceuticals, is considered by many to be the most serious during  Kohl's six years as chancellor.  </P> <P> Kohl had publicly criticized the U.S. government and media for making an issue  of alleged West German commercial help for the Libyan project, saying that  German investigations had not corroborated what inadequate evidence the  Americans had offered. Then he was embarrassed when West German officials  admitted that they had come up with evidence of involvement.  </P> <P> "It is all the more mystifying because it was all so unnecessary," commented  one editor, noted for his conservative views. "The government could have said,  'Yes, we have a problem with these chemical companies. Let's attend to it.'  </P> <P> "Instead, they bumbled, denied the facts, temporized, became legalistic and  then admitted the Americans were right -- that West German firms were connected  with the Libyan complex, and it was intended for poison gas. This all shows  Kohl at his insensitive worst."  </P> <P> Kohl has not been helped by his chief spokesman, the stolid, pipe smoking  Friedhelm Ost, whose phlegmatic about-faces have added to the skepticism shown  by a wide range of critics over government policy on the Libyan issue.  </P> <P> At a news conference Tuesday, for instance, Ost said the regular Kohl Cabinet  meeting had not discussed the controversy, and when asked why not, responded  testily:  </P> <P> "I do not have to explain why they didn't. I don't have to explain why they  didn't discuss the mild winter."  </P> <P> One veteran journalist walked away from the conference declaring, "I don't  think these people realize how serious this is -- how people in the U.S. and  elsewhere are reacting to the news that the Germans are again engaged in  manufacturing poison gas."  </P> <P> Sources close to Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher believe the flap over  West German complicity in building a poison gas factory for the erratic Kadafi  can jeopardize his energetic foreign policy.  </P> <P> "Genscher is trying to sell the rest of the world on an absolute ban on  chemical weapons," said one associate, "and now everyone can point the finger  at West Germany and say: 'What are you up to with these chemicals?' "  </P> <P> The opposition Social Democratic Party has seized on the opportunity to  castigate Kohl and his colleagues for their insensitivity on the issue, just as  they did in 1985 at Bitburg, when the chancellor insisted that Reagan visit a  military cemetery even after it was discovered that Nazi SS (elite force)  troops were buried there.  </P> <P> Social Democrat leader Hans-Jochen Vogel charged the government with "leading  the public around by the nose" and purveying "untruths and deceptions."  </P> <P> Vogel declared that Kohl's handling of the Libyan affair was damaging the  traditional close links with Washington, at a time when large segments of West  German public opinion are questioning traditional ties with the Atlantic  Alliance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Intolerable' Thought  </P> <P> "With our past in mind," said Vogel, "the very thought that a West German  government has tolerated or even connived in the production of poison gas that  could be used against Israel is intolerable."  </P> <P> The West German national media, at first echoing Kohl's statements that the  West German chemical companies were simply victims of Washington's rash and  unproven charges, have abashedly now lined up almost unanimously against his  position -- and expressed the fear that it could harm relations with  Washington.  </P> <P> Many editorialists criticized Kohl for his excessively legalistic approach to  the charges that German firms like Imhausen-Chemie were involved in the  chemical plant when he said more proof was needed, as in a court of law.  </P> <P> "Kohl speaks and acts as though he were not the head of government but a judge  in the high court," commented the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. "Because he has lost  political control of the Imhausen scandal, he keeps repeating the formula about  proof which can be used in court."  </P> <P> And the Munich paper's respected foreign editor, Josef Joffe, commented:  "What's going on between Bonn and Washington? Kohl should have realized when  first being presented with the information during his visit to the U.S. that  Washington by no means wanted to publicly compromise the Germans, let alone to  accuse them.  </P> <P> "Bonn's actions do not demonstrate greater self-confidence, as the departing  U.S. ambassador to the federal republic, Richard R. Burt, recently stated. The  shrill tone revealed old reflex reactions that appeared to have been long  overcome: whininess, paranoia and aggressiveness, as they used to surface in  the past whenever the Germans felt prosecuted."  </P> <P> And calling attention to how newspapers had at first been deluded by Kohl's  statements, commentator Georg Streiter wrote in the Hamburger Morgenpost: "We  were willing to join Kohl and his friends in their bitching about the evil  Americans who were making us look impossible with their allegedly hair-raising  and unjustified accusations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enough Potential Friction  </P> <P> "Now we look even more impossible. All those of us who issued the big denials  will now have to eat their words, one by one. And what about us?  </P> <P> "We would like to sink into the ground: once again the Germans, once again  weapons, and, on top of it all, once again poison gas."  </P> <P> That Kohl let the controversy with the United States over the Libyan chemical  plant get out of control worries many pro-American Germans.  </P> <P> They point out that there is enough potential friction with the United States  anyway: the row over the European Community's decision to ban American  hormone-fed meat; an upcoming decision on modernizing short-range nuclear  weapons; plans to curb low-level military training flights, which are dangerous  and highly unpopular in the countryside, and differing views on developing  relations with Moscow.  </P> <P> As one respected official, both a conservative and a friend of America, put it  Tuesday: "Part of the fault lies in that we Germans have become a major world  economic power, without assuming the political responsibilities to go with that  status.  </P> <P> "We are going to have to come to grips with the fact that we are a major nation  again and begin to treat our actions accordingly -- to do our share in making  the world more secure, not just through NATO (North Atlantic Treaty  Organization), but in other areas of world affairs, even if taking on such  responsibilities may be initially unpopular."  </P></p>

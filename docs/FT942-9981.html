			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei back over 20,000 as region reviews its appeal Further strength in the dollar against the yen took the Nikkei 225 average above the 20,000 level for the first time since April 19, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index advanced 232.35, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,150.13. It opened at the day's low of 20,001.10 and reached a high of 20,219.84 just before midsession on active buying by foreign investors and arbitrageurs. Overnight gains on the US stock and bond markets, and the dollar's rise above the Y104 level against the yen, heartened investors. Rumours of credit tightening in the US and a cut in interest rates in Germany prompted buying of the dollar, while active dollar purchase intervention by the Bank of Japan also helped the yen to weaken. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 17.21 at 1,635.04 and the Nikkei 300 rose 3.29 to 299.59. Advances led declines by 795 to 226, with 158 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.44 at 1,341.98. Some analysts said that yesterday's easing of the yen was not enough to boost prices further. Mr Rod Smyth, strategist at Baring Securities, said that the Nikkei would remain within a range of 18,500 to 21,000 in the short term. 'We need something more significant for the Nikkei to break that range,' he said, adding that evidence of a sustainable economic recovery in mid to late summer would support equities. High-tech stocks firmed on the lower yen, with Hitachi moving up Y16 to Y974 and Sony Y250 to Y5,890. Car issues were also higher: Toyota Motor rose Y40 to Y2,010 and Nissan Motor Y13 to Y863. Fuji Bank advanced Y60 to Y2,380 and Bank of Tokyo added Y30 at Y1,640 on arbitrage purchases. Non-life companies gained ground on reports that they would lift rates later this year: Tokio Marine and Fire appreciated Y40 to Y1,330 and Sumitomo Marine and Fire firmed Y20 to Y1,000. Some retailers encountered profit-taking. Daiei, the largest supermarket chain, lost Y20 at Y1,740 and Ito-Yokado declined Y20 to Y5,410. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 248.99 to 22,327.56 in volume of 33m shares. Roundup Overnight recovery in the US equity market allowed most of the region's stock markets to look at their attractions, rather than their drawbacks. HONG KONG recalled that it was on a market price/earnings ratio of only 12 when it touched a recent low of 8,300. Institutional buying intensified and the Hang Seng index accelerated its recovery with a rise of 366.07, or 4.3 per cent, to 8,906.16. Brokers said activity in futures contributed to the rise as overseas fund managers snapped up key index components such as Hong Kong Telecom, which climbed 60 cents to HKDollars 14.70 and HSBC, up HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 85. Heavy futures turnover was echoed by a preliminary advance from HKDollars 3.09bn to HKDollars 5.06bn in the cash market. Cheung Kong, whose p/e ratio was as low as seven times recently, topped the active list as it strengthened HKDollars 2.25, or 6.4 per cent, to HKDollars 37.25. SYDNEY liked the lack of surprises in the federal budget and the All Ordinaries index closed 26.4 higher at 2,034.6 in turnover of ADollars 696.4m. News Corp improved 10 cents to ADollars 8.91 after a fall of 24 cents on Tuesday. CRA soared 52 cents to ADollars 17.14 and BHP 40 cents to ADollars 16.68 as firmer commodity prices continued to push the resource sector higher. MIM climbed by 21 cents to ADollars 3.07 and topped the volume charts with 11.16m shares changing hands; yesterday's price on the opposing page was in error. SEOUL scraped its way to a sixth successive gain, the composite index closing 1.51 ahead at 948.91 after a day's peak of 955.59. TAIPEI ended above the 6,000 resistance level on late buying in industrials, the weighted index adding 87.10, or 1.5 per cent, at 6,024.47 as turnover expanded from TDollars 57.05bn to TDollars 61.96bn. MANILA was led higher by the US-quoted telephone stock PLDT, and while profit-taking pared its gains the composite index ended 38.82 stronger at 2,952.27. PLDT finished 30 pesos up at 1,860 pesos, after a high of 1,880. WELLINGTON put in a notable rally in line with other world equity markets, gains in US treasuries, and Australasian debt markets after the Australian budget. The NZSE-40 index closed 33.26 ahead at 2,063.84. KARACHI dropped sharply, down for the fourth straight session on nervous selling by short-term players. The KSE 100 index finished 55.65, or 2.5 per cent, lower at 2,182.37.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Michaelmas daisies make the border - A look at a variety that is now a curiosity Gardeners are having a heavenly autumn, but Michaelmas daisies are not in everyone's heaven. By now, we all know that the famous varieties catch mildew; the little ones look like pillows for a garden gnome; the reds are not a true red and the blues are not always true blues. Sometimes they flower well, but then they start to go back. At the turn of the century, Michaelmas daisy borders were planted with fondness in Edwardian walled gardens. Nowadays they are curiosities, and I seldom see a garden where this family is used well. In one garden, though, they have been bred and admired continuously. At Colwall, west of Malvern, first-class asters go back through three generations on the same plot of land. Their story began with a skilled amateur named Ernest Ballard who became a nurseryman when passers-by wanted pieces of his best varieties. Many of his winners are still ours, named after ladies in the Ballard family. He died in 1906 but, by a happy sequence, a family named Picton bought the nursery and continued to improve it with excellent trees and shrubs. Percy Picton had worked as a gardener with the great William Robinson, author of The English Flower Garden, and lived until the 1980s. He was also a great plantsman and, unusually, he encouraged his son to be the same. Paul Picton now runs Old Court Nurseries and looks after the national collection of asters. It is open until October 31 from Wednesday mornings to Sunday evenings; and although Michaelmas Day is the inevitable high point, other varieties prolong the season beyond September 29 and still reward an intelligent visit. As we walked round the remarkable colours in his borders, Picton revealed exactly how to cope with mildew. We should spray asters in May, using Tumbleblight, and repeat the spraying once a month until September. I saw no mildew in the huge national collection, although it grows dozens of the modern varieties which go powder-grey for those of us who ignore the little Tumbleblighters. I have no 'organic' scruples whatsoever: plants produce chemicals, too, so why not use more chemicals to make them happy if these do not damage the soil? The aster family has always been a complicated tangle, but the biggest and brightest are straightforward. They are all Novi-Belgi forms which are prone to mildew and much happier on heavy soil. Picton recommends them on clay and advises us to dress them with hoof and horn, a general fertiliser, each spring. Among the white varieties, Mount Everest is tall, but the best. The pinks and reds appeal to me less but the shades of blue are irresistible. Viewing Picton's collection, we singled out a short-list of Ada Ballard, Blue Eyes, Helen Ballard and the late Blue Gown, which is reaching its peak only now. This list would give you flowers from mid-August until late October. All these varieties, and many others, can be ordered direct from Old Court Nurseries for delivery in May. Since they are best planted as small, young plants late in spring, this delivery time suits them. If you have established asters of this type which no longer flower well, they need to be divided. Throw away the centres of the old plants during next spring and replant the young shoots from the outer margins. This simple attention is essential for good results. Those of us who funk the mildew usually turn instead to the Novi-Angliae group because its members are immune. Six years ago we turned to them in Oxford but, with one exception, their colours and shapes are definitely second-best. The exception is the amazing Alma Potschke, which is a brilliant cherry-red: she is no bother and I love her, but her flowers have hardly opened this year. Picton explained that she prefers a sunny September and that this wet autumn has held her back. Recently, my personal interest has come to rest on what books have described as the also-rans. So often, there are forgotten winners among the great mainstays of the Horticultural Index: pokers which are not red-hot, agapanthus which are not Headbourne hybrids, dahlias with flowers that are not shaggy. Among the asters, I have come to prize the forms with small flowers or Italian origins: the Picton collection shows dozens of them, which will be at their best in the next fortnight. They include Amellus asters, which I first came to know years ago when they were growing in my rock garden. They have one huge advantage: they like dry, well-drained soils - a necessary fact of Cotswold living - and they are never very tall. The best of them would adorn my personal turf altars every autumn. In Germany, their resistance to dry weather suits the local steppe gardens and has caused the breeders to develop new varieties which will be reaching the UK soon. Meanwhile, the winners are violet-blue King George, pale lavender Sternkugel, and the finely-cut flowers of the deep pink Jacqueline Genebrier. None catches mildew and I cannot think why gardeners do not plant them more often. The one trick is to plant them out in spring and to split them into clumps, not the single shoots which are enough for the tall varieties. On other fringes of the family, the late Royal Horticultural Society flower shows soon teach you where to look: the best cordifolius and laterfolius forms extend the season right through October and remain worth cutting until the middle of next month. The National Trust is making widespread use of one variety called Little Carlow, with sky-blue flowers. It is excellent, as the Picton collection will show you, but is surpassed by a taller form - the remarkable Calliope, with lilac-blue flowers that appear above black stems and green-black leaves. Calliope is the outstanding plant of my autumn. Unless you visit collections, you never see what lies neglected in the by-ways of these great families. The smaller-flowered asters add an entire extra month to the garden for people who do not want chrysanthemums all over their flower beds. They are pretty in leaf and wonderful for cutting and bringing indoors. But do not judge them by the flowers on the young plants with which you begin. They need a year or two in order to reach their best.</p>

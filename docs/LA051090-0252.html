			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> AFTER LOCKOUT, NO WALKOUT BY FANS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FRUSTRATION AND ANGER APPARENTLY DIDN'T LAST LONG AFTER DELAYED  SPRING TRAINING. ATTENDANCE IS CLIMBING AT A RATE THAT WOULD SET ANOTHER MAJOR  LEAGUE RECORD THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> Baseball fans have recovered quickly from the anger and frustration they  displayed during the owners' 32-day spring-training lockout. They are attending  games at a rate that would set a major league attendance record for a sixth  consecutive year.  </P> <P> Though 15 of the 26 clubs reported a decline in attendance through Sunday,  overall major league attendance increased slightly. It was up by 47,133, or  0.6%, over 309 dates as compared with the same number of dates last year. Major  league clubs drew a record 55,173,096 fans last year.  </P> <P> "Given everything, I'm pleased with the numbers," Commissioner Fay Vincent said  by telephone from Washington. "Attendance is up and that's despite numerous  doubleheaders and bad weather. I don't think the lockout caused any effect on  attendance. I didn't think it would, not since my first day in spring training  and the response I heard from the fans. They were glad to have baseball back."  </P> <P> Said New York Mets Vice President Al Harazin: "I don't doubt there are a few  people out there who are teed off because of the lockout. But I don't see that  in terms of macro numbers. There just aren't enough of them to show up in the  numbers."  </P> <P> American League attendance is up by 252,788. Virtually all of that increase is  attributable to the Toronto Blue Jays, who are playing their first full season  at the SkyDome.  </P> <P> National League attendance is down by 205,675. Much of that can be blamed on  the Mets, who have suffered the biggest decline in attendance of any major  league team.  </P> <P> "As I read the numbers, the American League has been helped by Toronto being so  powerful," Vincent said. "They weren't playing in the SkyDome at this time last  year. The National League has been hurt by the Mets, who are traditionally one  of the biggest draws, so I wouldn't worry about that. They've had some bad  weather. I know; I've sat through some of their games."  </P> <P> Here is how each California team's 1990 attendance, through Sunday, compares  with its 1989 attendance through the same number of dates:  </P> <P> Dodgers -59,353  </P> <P> Angels +103,090  </P> <P> Oakland +74,833  </P> <P> San Francisco +47,032  </P> <P> San Diego +8,935  </P> <P> Through Monday's games, Mets pitchers Frank Viola, Dwight Gooden and David Cone  ranked 1-2-3 among the National League strikeout leaders. Only once before have  three teammates finished a season in that order. That was in 1961, when Dodger  pitchers Sandy Koufax (269), Stan Williams (205) and Don Drysdale (182)  completed the trifecta.  </P> <P> That Dodgers staff produced three current major league pitching coaches  (Williams of Cincinnati, Larry Sherry of San Francisco and Ron Perranoski of  Los Angeles) and one manager (Roger Craig of San Francisco).  </P> <P> There have been only 20 cases when teammates finished 1-2 (without ties) in  their league in strikeouts, most recently in 1987 when Nolan Ryan and Mike  Scott of Houston did it. In only eight of those 20 cases did the club with the  two strikeout leaders finish in first place.  </P> <P> Expos Manager Buck Rodgers recently wrote an article for one of Montreal's  French newspapers, titled, "The Story Behind Mound Searches." He was asked to  write the article after he ordered umpires to check Houston pitcher Dave Smith  and then the Astros countered by ordering them to search Expos pitcher Dennis  Martinez. But the pitcher Rodgers most incriminated was the Yankees' Pascual  Perez, who formerly pitched for Rodgers in Montreal.  </P> <P> Rodgers made one reference to the hair gel Perez uses. Then he wrote, "To come  back to my friend Pascual, who so many managers suspected (of doctoring the  baseball), let's say I never directly asked him the question. If I don't know  something, I don't have to lie when I talk about it. Sometimes ignorance is  bliss.  </P> <P> "But according to my own observations, if he came back into the National  League, I would be the first guy to have him checked."  </P></p>

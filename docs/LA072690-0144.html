			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEUERLEIN HOLDS OUT, SCHROEDER GETS NOD;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: THE RAIDERS' OFFERED THEIR PROFESSED NO. 1 QUARTERBACK LESS THAN HALF  WHAT HIS BACKUP IS EXPECTED TO RECEIVE.  </P> <P> Steve Beuerlein says he never imagined that a salary disagreement would keep  him out of the Raiders' training camp.  </P> <P> "You always hear about the holdouts every year and wonder if you could find  yourself in that situation," the quarterback said. "But I never saw myself  having any type of a contract dispute."  </P> <P> But Beuerlein has a contract dispute.  </P> <P> While the other Raider quarterbacks have been in camp for a week, Beuerlein has  been working out on his own, along with some of the other five Raider holdouts,  including running backs Marcus Allen and Steve Smith.  </P> <P> And he has also been playing golf. In fact, the message on Beuerlein's  answering machine says: "The next best thing to being in camp is being on a  golf course, which is where I might be."  </P> <P> Beuerlein said he feels frustrated that negotiations have dragged on.  </P> <P> "It's just tearing me apart sitting here, not being able to be out there with  the guys getting ready for this year because it's going to be a great year,"  Beuerlein said. "I love the Raiders with all my heart."  </P> <P> But business is business.  </P> <P> Beuerlein, who earned $140,000 last season, is seeking a substantial raise. A  source close to the negotiations said the Raiders offered $400,000 initially  before raising their offer to $500,000.  </P> <P> Noting that NFL starting quarterbacks earn an average of $955,943 a season,  Beuerlein balked at the offer.  </P> <P> The Raiders' strategy was to sign quarterback Jay Schroeder quickly and get him  into training camp. Schroeder signed a $1.1-million, one-year contract last  week.  </P> <P> Does Beuerlein want a contract similar to Schroeder's?  </P> <P> "I'm not asking for the kind of money they're paying Jay, even though they've  come out and said that I was No. 1 at the end of the year," Beuerlein said.  "I'm not asking for $1 million a year, but they're not getting anywhere near  treating me along the same lines as (Schroeder).  </P> <P> "They basically offered me half of what they offered Jay, and it would be  stupid for me to go in and sign for half of what they're paying a guy that I'm  at least going in head-to-head with. I feel that I'm the No. 1 guy and I feel  my teammates would agree with me."  </P> <P> Beuerlein outplayed Schroeder last season, passing for 1,677 yards with 13  touchdowns and nine interceptions. Schroeder threw for 1,550 yards with eight  touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Beuerlein was 4-3 as a starter, Schroeder 4-5.  </P> <P> Although Beuerlein ended last season as the No. 1 quarterback and was listed  first on the off-season depth chart, Raider Coach Art Shell said Schroeder is  the No. 1 quarterback because he's in camp and Beuerlein isn't.  </P> <P> Does Beuerlein think his holdout has cost him his starting job?  </P> <P> "I don't know what they're saying or what they're actually meaning," Beuerlein  said. "A lot of times you can't read these things straight because people say  things to try to put pressure on you.  </P> <P> "The way I look at it is that I'm the No. 1 quarterback. And even if I come in  there and for whatever reasons they have Jay or whoever ahead of me, in my mind  it's just going to be a matter of time before I get back in there. I look at  myself as the starting quarterback for the Raiders."  </P> <P> Beuerlein hopes that his holdout isn't a distraction for the team.  </P> <P> "It hurts me a lot because I'm a team guy," Beuerlein said. "I've never been a  rock-the-boat type of guy. I would never do anything to distract from my  teammates and our purpose of winning football games.  </P> <P> "But there comes a time when you've got to stand up for what's fair. And I just  really feel that I'm not being treated fair right now. I'm not a hard guy to  please; just treat me fairly."  </P> <P> The Raiders, who say club policy forbids comment on negotiations, won't comment  on the talks with Beuerlein.  </P> <P> Beuerlein keeps hoping that the contract dispute will be settled soon.  </P> <P> "Even right up until the last day before camp (opened), I really believed that  there was some way we were going to get things worked out," Beuerlein said. "I  figured it would be straightened out within a couple days. But it seems like  things are dragging a little bit, and it's been a lot longer than I would have  liked. I'd love for it to be resolved within the next day or two because I  really belong up there."  </P> <P> Beuerlein said teammates have been supportive during his holdout.  </P> <P> "Before camp even opened, several of the offensive linemen said they support me  and told me to do what I had to to," Beuerlein said. "I respect their opinions  more than anybody because they take care of me. And the rest of the guys feel  the same way."  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Has Marcus Allen played his last game for the Raiders? The South Bay Daily  Breeze reported that Allen has asked the Raiders to trade him. "No, there was  no demand," Raider owner Al Davis said. "But it was mutually agreed to trade  him to the Rams for a certain player, but the Rams turned it down." Added Coach  Art Shell: "If he still demands to be traded, then I guess that's the way it's  going to be." . . . Before trading Allen, who earned a reported $1.1 million  last season, the Raiders would first have to sign him to a contract. One of six  holdouts, this is the second year that Allen has missed training camp. The  all-time leading rusher in Raider history, Allen was sidelined by injuries for  half of the 1989 season and rushed for just 293 yards. With the off-season  acquisition of tailback Greg Bell from the Rams, Allen became expendable.  </P> <P> Cornerback Eddie Anderson missed practice Wednesday afternoon because of a  stomach disorder.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Shapovalov report: "You Don't Play With the Son </F> of a Spy -- News About Ames, Whom Nobody Betrayed"]    [Excerpts] The jury has yet to pass its final verdict, but  the case of 52-year old Aldrich Ames, the top CIA staffer  accused of spying for the USSR and later Russia, seems to be  quietly dying. And this applying of the brakes is no  coincidence: The large-scale exposure of the Ames couple  entailed a huge scandal in the United States over how, indeed,  this was allowed to happen, and why it was overlooked.    Skillfully steering the course of events, the state has made  a move which is not without interest. The intelligence services  have been given the task of uncovering the exact extent of the  damage done by the Ames. But even a battle waged by the most  talented investigators will prove of no help if the main  defendant does not want to "own up." [passage omitted]    While Ames and the jury think things over, the effects of  the  outburst of "spy fever" are starting to be felt in the United  States, according to information from the serious newspaper THE  WASHINGTON POST. Many CIA staffers feel that they are being  subjected to a wage freeze and that rejections of promotion  requests and threats of disciplinary financial penalties and  enforced separations are becoming more frequent. Punitive  measures are primarily affecting those intelligence staffers  who, in the nature of their service, either directed or worked  with Ames.    What is curious is that these investigations were triggered  by a certain "former Communist Party official knowledgeable  about the activities of Soviet intelligence." He proffered  information to American counterintelligence bodies which  narrowed the circle of the search and put them on the trail of  A. Ames.    It is no secret that there is another version too: A. Ames  was allegedly betrayed by a Russian Foreign Intelligence Service  staffer. This information, to put it mildly, does not accord  with reality, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told at the  Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service Bureau for  Public and Media Relations. This story was told in some form by  one Lyubimov, former chief intelligence officer in Copenhagen,  and nowadays it is periodically given play by the radio,  television, and LITERATURNAYA GAZETA.    According to claims by THE WASHINGTON POST, a draft law is  currently under preparation in Congress designed to improve the  system for vetting staffers and safeguarding security in the  CIA. In contains provisions which envisage setting up a national  center for the purposes of the speedy and effective discovery of  spies, and which endow the FBI with extensive powers concerning  the counterintelligence security of the CIA, including in the  sphere of vetting its staffers. Naturally, this is opposed  vigorously by the intelligence department leadership, which is  concerned about the deterioration of relations not only with the  FBI, but also with the American legislators.

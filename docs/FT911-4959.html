			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Leading Article: The recycled Labour party THE LABOUR party's latest policy document has many flaws, but its likely appeal to the electorate should not be underestimated. Only those with long memories will equate its most alluring phrase 'to build a world-class economy', with the 'white heat of the technological revolution' as promised but not delivered by the then Mr Harold Wilson in 1964. The principal means of achieving the freshly-stated objective is to be further investment in education and training, although Labour has surrounded that strategy with a plethora of other proposals, some aimed at particular interest groups, such as pensioners, and others intended to demonstrate the party's green or civic credentials. To complete the package there is a range of constitutional proposals, from the establishment of a Scottish assembly and regional authorities to a 'new charter of rights' and a freedom of information act. London will get its own local authority. These proposals fall a long way short of constituting a restraint on the powers of the executive. This is hardly surprising, since both the Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, and his deputy, Mr Roy Hattersley, plainly intend to exercise as much central authority as any previous government. Apparent miracle There is, however, a little something for everyone. More on health, more on pensions, more on education - all are promised. This miracle is apparently to be achieved without falling into the trap of profligate spending. The constraints of Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism are recognised. Although public investment must 'have a higher claim than tax cuts', the document is peppered with statements of prudent fiscal intent. The Budget and the annual expenditure plans will be coalesced into a single document. Income will be taxed on a rising scale from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, while the ceiling on national insurance contributions will be abolished - although this latter impost will not be extended to pensioners, as it was in earlier documents. Many questions arise. The Heseltinian formula for a 'partnership with industry' is carefully circumscribed, but it is not clear where partnership ends and old-fashioned interventionism begins. The national minimum wage can hardly increase employment. The array of new quangos - from 'Skills UK' to the proposed 'National Investment Bank' - is daunting. Union practice The promised reforms of trade union legislation may reflect continental practice, but how would a Labour government stand up to a challenge on pay initiated by, say, Nalgo or Nupe? For all its moves towards the centre ground of politics, Labour remains the party of new authorities, new regulations, new taxes or charges and a halt to privatisation. Yet the Conservatives are in no position to deride any of this. They are still struggling to divest themselves of the poll tax, let alone produce a credible post-Thatcher manifesto. Some of their ideas are derived from the opposition's proposals, most notably the contemporary favourite known as 'contractualisation'. This means using individual contracts to govern the relationship between customers of public services and the providing agencies. Under Mr John Major's guidance Tory ministers are as effusive as Labour about the need to improve health, education and similar services, but, 'contractualisation' apart, they are unconvincing about how the task can be done without increasing taxes. Indeed the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, goes further. In his speech to the Adam Smith Institute last week he repeated the Tory pledge to reduce the basic rate of income tax to 20p as a 'firm objective for the medium term' and stressed that 'we do not believe that the solution to the undoubted problems of the public sector lies in ever more public spending'. During the election campaign a reasonable question for Labour to ask will be, if that is the case, how will the Conservatives further improve education, health and the other elements of public infrastructure?</p>

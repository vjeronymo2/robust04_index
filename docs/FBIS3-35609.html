He was presenting the regional  administration structure.    Belyakov recalled that the total area of the region exceeds  that of Austria, and its contribution to the national product is  greater than the total production of the neighbouring Republic  of Estonia. "We are as important a part of the Russian  Federation as the city of St. Petersburg, and we will have a  government of our own," governor of the Leningrad region said.    Belyakov spoke against giving a new name to the region which  was called, as St. Petersburg was, after Bolshevik revolution  leader Vladimir Lenin. He said that "remaking history is a  thankless business and it would offend siege veterans who  defended the city and region of Leningrad."    Belyakov said Vladimir Porotikov will be the finance  minister  of the local government. There will be four vice-premiers. One  will be in charge of the economy, another in charge of  agriculture and environmental protection, still another will be  responsible for the development of the social sphere, and the  last one will be in charge of privatisation.    The regional legislative assembly will consist of 25  deputies  who will be elected on March 20, on the same day when deputies  to the municipalities will be elected in major cities and other  residential centres of the region.    The present 230 rural councils will be replaced with 219  volosts. Villagers will elect "starosta" (village elder, or  headman). According to Belyakov, this will bring power closer to  the people, stimulate initiative and increase responsibility of  local governments by enhancing their role in the economic reform.    But the region has first to work out its own charter, which  will be put to a referendum on the election day, March 20.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Mercury to start in-flight phone lines MERCURY Communications, a subsidiary of the UK's Cable and Wireless group, plans to launch what it claims is Europe's first 'air-to-ground' telephone service later this year. If the service is taken up by airlines, it will offer air travellers telephone, fax and a range of value-added services like electronic games and in-flight shopping, using base-stations and satellites to provide the necessary links to land-based networks. The service is to be provided by a joint venture company called In-Flight Phone Europe, bringing together Mercury, In-Flight Phone International, a company providing a similar service in the US, and Irelandia, a private investment group. Travellers will access the digital network through a telephone handset in the arm-rest of their seat, selecting services from a viewing screen on the headrest of the seat in front of them. Rates for telephone calls will start at Pounds 2 a minute for non-international calls, charged automatically to a credit card. The initial cost of establishing the network, which will require 60 terrestrial ground stations to provide a complete service, is believed to be around Pounds 10m. In-Flight Phone International said it had invested Dollars 80m (Pounds 53.3m) in its similar US system, which is in the process of being installed in 400 planes operated by USAir. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said: 'the ability to make calls and receive messages in the air marks a significant breakthrough in communications for all European passengers.' The first phase of the network construction is expected to be finished by the end of this year, with all the ground stations in place by 1995. The equipment will be compatible with both European and North American standards and frequencies. With telecommunications companies seeking to maximise revenue from value-added services, innovative products like In-Flight Phone, produced in partnership with niche companies, look set to become increasingly common.</p>

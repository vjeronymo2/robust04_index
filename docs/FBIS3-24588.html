			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. V. Mikhlyayev; UDC 535.317:681.7.012] </F>   [Abstract] Geometric aberrations of a lightguide because of  a nonparallel orientation of its walls have been examined. The  lightguide consists of a transparent medium bound by two planes.  The lower plane coincides with the XY plane, the Z axis is  directed normal to this surface. The upper plane is oriented at  an angle to the lower, so that it intersects planes ZY and ZX at  angles _a_ and _g_. The incident light beam lies in a plane  x=constant, and forms an angle _b_ with the normal to the lower  plane. If the walls are not parallel, when _a_ and _b_ are  not  equal to zero, geometric aberrations are produced, which are  deviations _D_x[.sup]i[/], _D_y[.sub]i[/] of the  coordinates of the beam intersection points with the lower plane  from their value, compared to the ideal case. Computations of  _D_x, as a function of the number of reflections N for  different values of parameters _a_ and _g_ were made and the  results are shown in the graphs. Cases of the light beam  propagation through a quasi-plane light guide and a case of the  coordinates deviations _D_x, _D_y from N because of the light  beam divergence were also examined and the results are provided.

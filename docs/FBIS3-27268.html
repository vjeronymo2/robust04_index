			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Dadong (7812 1129 2639) and Liu Tongqi </F> (0491 0681 6386)]    [Text] Urumqi, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Tajik nationality,  who used to shy away from business undertakings, started to get  involved in the commodity economy in just a few short years  following reform and opening up.    During a recent trip to Taxkorgan County on the Pamirs  Highland, reporters learned that none of the county's 22,000  Tajik people was a trader in the mid-eighties. Herdsmen living  on the Pamirs Highland toiled to raise livestock throughout the  year and refused to sell them even as the animals grew old and  died. They lived a poor but contented life.    In 1986, the county's Hongqilafu border port was formally  opened to third countries. Later, a 420-km road linked it with  border ports on the highland, making Hongqilafu one of the most  important and busiest trading ports between our country's  western region and Central Asian countries. The endless stream  of visiting merchants broke the long-existing silence of the  Pamirs Highland. Seeing that businessmen of the Uygur, Han, and  Hui nationalities became well-off one after another, the Tajik  people could no longer sit still.    By the end of 1993, some 150 Tajik individual households and  private enterprises had emerged in Taxkorgan County. They  opened shops, restaurants, hotels, and video shops in towns,  border ports, as well as along the Sino-Pakistani highway. Some  of them bought automobiles especially to transport goods between  border ports and Kashi city, or directly engaged in  transnational border trade. Some people even teamed up with  Pakistani businessmen to open restaurants in towns which did a  brisk business. Farmers and herdsmen living near towns changed  their tradition of not engaging in vegetable farming, and  started to grow vegetables extensively for market sales.  Subsequently, a group of large vegetable farming households  emerged.    Today, Taxkorgan has numerous shops and stores. As reporters  went to remote villages, they frequently met Tajik merchants  engaging in various trades as well as peasants and herdsmen  engaging in precious stone mining. Some jewelers from Jiangsu,  Zhejiang, and Sichuan buy precious stones in remote mountains  and valleys here throughout the year. A group of previously  poor peasants, such as Mairepu and Tayier, have now become  specialized households and private mining enterprise owners with  tens of thousands of yuan in assets.    The first border trade company in Taxkorgan County was  established in 1992. The company actively linked peasants and  herdsmen together to participate in border trade. The export  and import value in the first year alone reached $900,000,  making it the company in the county with the largest income. To  cope with tens of thousands of visiting Chinese and foreign  businessmen, the county invested in building the Pamirs Hotel as  well as developed local tourist attractions, scenic spots,  cultural relics, and historic sites to establish a tourist  industry. In 1993, the county's income from the tourist trade  reached 750,000 yuan.    County chief Mierzhayi told reporters that village and town  enterprises have grown rapidly from nothing. The Tajik people  have shaken off the restrictions of a pastoral life and  established a group of village and town enterprises, such as a  mineral water bottling plant, a precious stone plant, an iron  mine, and a brickyard. The output value of the entire county's  village and town enterprises was 330,000 yuan in 1992. However,  in 1993, the output value of the Pamirs Mineral Water Bottling  Plant and the brickyard alone exceeded 1.3 million yuan.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (10): In the doldrums - The French outlook THE FRENCH economy may be picking up steam, but the building and construction industry is still struggling and is not expected to start reviving until mid-1993. Some analysts are forecasting a decline in volume of property construction and public works of between 2 and 4 per cent between 1991 and 1992, with new housing and office building plunging particularly sharply. 'The private sector does not want to invest in property', laments a Paris-based analyst. One clear indicator of the gloom ahead is that cement production in France is forecast to drop by 5 per cent. France exports and imports virtually no cement. Earlier this month, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the housing minister, gave details of a plan to bolster building and public works, but analysts say it is not enough to pull the sector out of the doldrums. A new housing loan scheme and assorted tax breaks are aimed to boost housing starts from the projected 290,000 this year to at least 300,000, adding a total of 35,000 by the end of next year. By the end of May, the forecast of 290,000 was already looking over-optimistic. Although not as pessimistic as some, the country's building federation, or Federation Nationale du Batiment (FNB) says that the first four months of this year suggest that turnover for residential and commercial property construction will shrink by 1 per cent this year. This compares with a forecast growth in gross domestic product of more than 2 per cent for the year, and represents the biggest gap between the two since 1984. If the government wants the sector to recover, it will have to narrow the differentials in yields on property and securities, says an FNB official. The outlook is not quite as grim for public works. The public works federation, or Federation Nationale des Travaux Publics, was very worried when the 1992 public spending programme was unveiled in December. But since then, an extra FFr1.2bn has been allocated for new motorways, increasing the networks by a total of 250 kilometres. A further FFr1bn has been earmarked for other infrastructure and public transport, which the government has promised will not be taken out of other allocations. Even so, the federation is betting only on 2.5 per cent growth in turnover in 1992, down from 3 per cent in 1991. Now that France has reached the bottom of the economic cycle, analysts expect the restructuring of the sector to accelerate for building works. It has been slow so far. The five 'majors' accounted for 11 per cent of building in 1990, only 1.4 per cent more than in 1987. Concentration has come mainly through the takeover by large groups of medium-sized rather than small enterprises, and is predicted to continue that way. 'Large groups sub-contract work to small local firms in order to keep their payroll down, which is their biggest operating cost,' says one analyst. 'Medium firms could be in difficulty in the months ahead, and may be bought up cheaply by the majors.' The public works sector, which is more capital-intensive, is more concentrated. In 1990, the majors held 26 per cent of the market and small firms only 5 per cent. About 120 companies with more than 200 employees accounted for the rest. An exception to the pattern of medium-sized firms being the takeover targets was the FFr4.5bn takeover of Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises (SAE) by competitor Fougerolle in the spring. This created a group with a turnover of about FFr31bn in building and construction last year, ranking Groupe SAE-Fougerolle fourth among the majors after Bouygues and Societe Generale d'Entreprises (SGE), a subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez. The financial position of most of the large groups is healthier than 10 years ago, even though their net margin ranges from 1 per cent for Spie-Batignolles to only 3 per cent for Fougerolle. Spie-Batignolles reported a net loss of FFr950m last year and analysts insist it will have to form a link-up sooner or later. Bouygues has attempted a takeover more than once, but the price has never been right. Brightening the picture for the 'majors' is the fact that most are active internationally. Orders are expanding overseas and margins are more generous than on the domestic market, particularly in eastern Europe, Spain and Asia.</p>

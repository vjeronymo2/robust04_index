			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Superstar route for royalty: John Lloyd has been ploughing through the torrent of books on the British monarchy OF THE books about the British monarchy published in the first half of this year, the majority advertise in their titles that they are diagnoses of sickness, even death. Two proclaim the fall of the House of Windsor. One gets 'behind palace doors.' Another borrows law court language - Diana v Charles - to emphasise the hectic distaste which the Prince and Princess of Wales conceived for each other. A fifth sees the crown as 'tarnished.' A sixth boldly psychoanalyses the family. A seventh homes in upon the royal marriages with the ruthless eye of the scandal-monger. The books are themselves a pathology, for the four journalist-authors - Nigel Dempster/Peter Evans, Anthony Holden and James Whitaker - were all scribe-courtiers of, even fawners on, their subjects. Now they take the insouciant high ground of the scornful know-all, seeing 'nothing but lechery' wherever they look. For the writer A N Wilson, the most disdainful of them, the behaviour of Charles, above all, has been a betrayal of trust. Wilson is forced to suggest an unlikely alienation of the monarchy from the Windsor family in order to preserve it. One of the two Ladies writing, Lady Colin Campbell, is a distant relation by marriage to the British royal family and to 'most of the royal houses of Europe,' and is bitchily revelatory, whisking aside bedroom curtains across a continent and four generations. The one academic, a former Labour politician turned radical, Stephen Haseler, sees the pass to which sex has brought the monarchy as the starting point for his vigorous, neo-conservative republicanism. Other critical books have been published since the second world war - that is, in the period when the royal family became the Holy Family (a myth started not by the present Queen but by her mother, that hard nut with a creamy, sweet coating). But Percy Black's Mystique of Modern Royalty and Kingsley Martin's Crown and Establishment, for example, were chiding, not radical. In the late 1980s, two books were published which, although resigned to the continuation of popular sycophancy, nevertheless began to strike chords. The doughty republican Edgar Wilson's Myth of the British Monarchy appeared in 1989. More stylish was the Scots Marxist Tom Nairn's book, The Enchanted Glass (1988). It was a meditation on royalty and its acceptance in British public and fantasy life. It was good stuff, but what else would you expect from a Scots Marxist? The fact that it attracted attention was not due to left-wing agitation but to something quite different: to the best impulses of Thatcherism - a dispassionate and undeferential questioning of the way we organise ourselves. This questioning left its mark everywhere, and has permitted some curious alliances in the 1990s - as on royalty. Linked to this was the growing lack of inhibition of the popular press. Although they prepared the ground, the Thatcherites retreated from it because deference was still too strong in their bones. The most radical of them - Keith Joseph, Norman Tebbit, David Young and Margaret Thatcher herself - all in the end were too bourgeois to press the logic they had unleashed. They bowed the knee and took the peerage route into the decompression chamber of British public life. Behind them, however, they left a right-radical popular press, led by The Sun, without the restraining influence of the leader herself. In the past two years the press has launched attacks more forcefully and promiscuously than ever before, reaching deep into previously taboo heartland. The medium for this travel into the forbidden zone was sex. These books, with the exception of that written by the Roundhead Haseler, are full of it. This is natural enough. The British monarchy has much more of a duty to reproduce than to rule. Alone among the state functionaries of Britain, the monarch's sex life can be reasonably said to be of public interest. The lamp of the media's attention has been hottest on Charles: he has melted, though not completely. Most of the books, especially Holden's and Wilson's, view the prince with real contempt, ridiculing his intellectual pretensions, his vacillation over marriage and his finally surly resignation in marrying. Whitaker, with the wariness of a tabloid reporter who cannot afford to offend a future king - although he, as the others, doubts that Charles will now make it - is less censorious. He makes the even-handed, sad comment that 'put at its crudest it came to this: he needed someone to produce a future king, she desperately wanted to be Princess of Wales.' On balance he prefers the princess with whom, on his account, he has had a number of heart-to-hearts, especially just before the wedding - conversations which were clearly of great value (financially as well as emotionally) to him. The male authors all agree that the princess was ready to love, but that she ran up against Charles' desire to carry on with a routine of duty, philosophising, polo, fishing and, ultimately, adultery. In a soupy pre-marriage interview, both Charles and Diana were asked if they were in love. She simpered assent. He gave his, then added: 'Whatever love means.' Since that was not part of the wedding-of-the-epoch script, it was made little of. However, today's republicans-come-lately see it as the emotional viper in the bosom of the marriage. Diana, already sanctified by Andrew Morton's Diana - a powerful and mythic work - has a much better time of it from the authors. All note her dimness, her ambition and, by far her most important characteristic, her chameleon-like nature. With tabloid economy, Whitaker puts it best: 'She had a knack for picking up the gestures that define a personality.' Holden, quoting the US author Camilla Paglia, says that Diana 'may have become the most powerful image in the world today, a case study in the modern cult of celebrity and the way in which it stimulates atavistic religious emotions.' And he lists the stereotypes at which she now takes a turn: 'Cinderella, betrayed wife, princess in the tower, mater dolorosa, pagan goddess, Hollywood queen and beautiful boy.' Lady Campbell is the notable dissenter from the general view that the princess is the more sinned against. She has written a magnificent book whose veracity it is completely impossible to determine, though her blood ties to the royal families of Britain and Europe would in nobler times have removed any doubt as to her word. She is in every bed chamber, including that of the queen and the many occupied by the Duke of Edinburgh. Of Charles, she believes that a man in his position will, after the duty is done, take a mistress or mistresses. Diana's inability to tolerate this appears to her 'irrational and childish.' She presents the princess as a tantrum-prone bully without the intelligence to grasp what was expected of her and the stakes for which she was gambling. Of course, the famous 'Camillagate' (Prince Charles) and 'Squidgy' (Diana) tapes are represented in both Dempster's and Whitaker's book. The tapes' contents are well known. I found the Prince's conversation touching to the point of feeling a stab of sympathy for him, and Diana's deportment while she was being grossly flattered by James Gilbey unnervingly self-controlled and narcissistic. Can the greatest surviving monarchy on earth live through this? As rational British citizens, we must hope not. But we must also - knowing the depth of its cunning, the rotundity of its purse and the reserves of popularity it still commands - fear that it can. The answer to its survival lies with Diana. In her embrace of stardom and in her ability to lend herself to a series of pre-determined images  - especially of the 'caring' sort now so much in vogue - she has mapped out a route that her sister-in-law, Princess Anne, has already discovered in a lower-key way. The British royal family can survive as charity superstars. They must be ruthless with their ceremonial, trimming it to what is amusing and splendid on occasion. They must open up not just Buckingham Palace but all the palaces, including the so-called 'private possessions' like Balmoral and Sandringham - in reality, as Holden writes, the product of Queen Victoria's adroit begging for public finance. And they must open all the art and other collections. They must create, probably outside London, the largest and best designed royal museum-cum-funpark in the world - a royal Disneyland. They must accept that clever accountancy is not the option for them that it is for most of the rich. They must eschew the marginal controversies which they have stirred up in the past in favour of being deeply, broadly, constantly caring. It will be pretty sickly, but it might keep the show on the road, sparing us the horror of having to vote for a head of state like lesser races do.

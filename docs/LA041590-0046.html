			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MANY SYMPTOMS OF LUPUS CAN KEEP DOCTORS GUESSING  </P> <P> The diagnosis was made just eight years ago, but looking back, 34-year-old  Annemarie Casey can remember a variety of symptoms that appeared while she was  still in high school and college.  </P> <P> She had a recurrent rash on her face, for instance. But her mother had rashes,  so she was not concerned.  </P> <P> Her joints ached. But her grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis, and she figured  she was just following in the family footsteps.  </P> <P> She had chronic coldness in her hands and feet from constriction of blood  vessels -- a condition known as Raynaud's phenomenon.  </P> <P> She had kidney infections, also recurrent, and high fevers.  </P> <P> "But each time I just bounced right back," she says now.  </P> <P> After a miscarriage when she was in her mid-20s, however, Casey did not bounce  back. She felt constantly ill. She lost weight and developed ulcers on her  hands and feet. Blood tests showed altered liver function. She was told she  might have cancer.  </P> <P> But then her internist called in a rheumatologist, who added up all the  symptoms and ran some more lab tests.  </P> <P> The determination that she had lupus came as something of a relief.  </P> <P> "I was so happy," she said. "I didn't have liver cancer. I wasn't going to  die."  </P> <P> On the other hand, she wasn't going to have an easy time of it. Chronic and  incurable, systemic lupus erythematosus is an auto-immune disease, meaning it  occurs when the immune system goes haywire and makes antibodies against certain  components of all the cells in a person's body.  </P> <P> The main targets are women in the childbearing years, and experts believe  hormonal balance is somehow involved. Just how and why are not yet known. Of  the estimated 500,000 Americans who have lupus, 90% of them are women.  </P> <P> "The pattern of the disease is exacerbation and then relative or complete  remission," says Dr. Barry Handwerger of the University of Maryland Medical  System.  </P> <P> In some people, sunlight causes a flare-up of disease. Others get sicker after  periods of stress, or after viral illnesses. Lupus sometimes becomes apparent  for the first time during pregnancy, or a quiet case will flare at that time.  Other times, the disease will go into remission then, and rebound after  delivery.  </P> <P> "The obstetricians are often the first to recognize it," said Dr. Michelle  Petri, co-director of the lupus pregnancy center at Johns Hopkins.  </P> <P> Because it can cause inflammation in the joints, lupus is considered similar to  arthritis. And, according to Petri, pregnancy in lupus patients is considered  high risk.  </P> <P> Two forms of lupus are known. In "discoid lupus," antibodies against the skin  cause lesions, mainly on the face and other areas exposed to the sun. Other  organ systems are not involved.  </P> <P> "Systemic lupus" is more dangerous. A rampage of antibodies can damage blood  vessels and blood components, skin and joints, internal organs, the central  nervous system. Brain and kidneys are especially vulnerable.  </P> <P> In the past, when diagnosis lagged far behind damage and medicines were more  limited, patients died of infections, strokes, organ failure. "Now," Handwerger  said, "we have survival rates approaching normal."  </P> <P> Annemarie Casey, of Columbia, Md., had a successful pregnancy two years after  her diagnosis. Gale Mangini, who lives on Maryland's Eastern Shore, was  diagnosed after her first pregnancy; she subsequently has had a second child.  </P> <P> But the disease has taken its toll.  </P> <P> "I was a secretary," Mangini says. "Now I can't work because of (arthritis in)  my fingers. My son is in the second grade and can help take care of himself,  but my 2 1/2-year-old is a problem. I have to struggle to keep up with her."  </P> <P> "Lupus," from the Latin for "wolf," was named because of the butterfly-shaped  rash that appears on the face. According to one story, the pattern resembles  the markings on the face of the wolf.  </P></p>

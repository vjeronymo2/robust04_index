			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> AMERICAN CONTINENTAL GIVES UP ITS FIGHT TO KEEP BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS  </P> <P> American Continental Corp., the parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine,  has given up its fight to keep its bankruptcy lawyers. Federal regulators have  been trying to disqualify the two firms on grounds of conflict of interest  because they represent the same regulatory bodies in cases involving other  troubled S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> In their place, Phoenix-based American Continental has hired the Los Angeles  firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert.  </P> <P> That is the same firm that American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr.  turned to earlier this month when he retained Howard L. Weitzman to protect the  company's interests in ongoing criminal investigations.  </P> <P> American Continental, Arizona's fourth largest company, filed a U.S. Bankruptcy  Court petition on April 13 to reorganize its debts under Chapter 11 of the  bankruptcy laws. The next day, regulators seized Lincoln Savings, alleging that  it was being operated in an unsafe manner.  </P> <P> American Continental's original bankruptcy lawyers, the Houston firm of  Sheinfeld, Maley &amp; Kay and the Phoenix firm of Bues, Gilbert, Wake &amp;  Morrill, were being challenged by regulators, who oppose the bankruptcy,  because the same firms represented regulators in litigation involving other  financial institutions.  </P> <P> "It was obvious we were going to fight this issue over and over again," said  Mark M. Connally, an American Continental spokesman. So the company decided to  bring in a new law firm.  </P> <P> James J. Feder, head of Wyman Bautzer's bankruptcy department, will oversee the  bankruptcy case, while Weitzman will handle civil litigation.  </P></p>

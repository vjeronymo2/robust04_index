			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCATION, POLLUTION RAISE LEVEL OF VALLEY WATER BILLS;  </P> <P> SERVICES: WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION, HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENTS MEAN INCREASED COSTS  FOR UTILITIES AND CONSUMERS.  </P> <P> Soon after Carol Thompson moved to La Verne seven years ago, she received  something shocking in the mail: her water bill.  </P> <P> Thompson immediately called La Verne Public Works Director Brian Bowcock to  demand an explanation. "She almost choked," Bowcock said, recalling her  frustration.  </P> <P> But Thompson, a water engineer herself, quickly adjusted to the fact that she  had left behind moderate water bills when she moved from Arcadia to La Verne.  </P> <P> "There's really not an awful lot you can do," Thompson said. "You want your  water!"  </P> <P> Thompson's situation is not unusual in the San Gabriel Valley, where water  rates vary widely from community to community.  </P> <P> A Times survey has found average residential rates ranging from a low of $18.40  every two months in parts of Irwindale, Baldwin Park and West Covina to $65.35  in La Verne.  </P> <P> There are about 55 water suppliers in the valley, ranging from tiny "mutuals"  serving a handful of families to large city-run water agencies. The Times  surveyed the 21 largest suppliers, each serving 5,000 or more residences and  businesses. Companies provided average figures for a household using 3,500  cubic feet -- 26,250 gallons -- of water every two months.  </P> <P> Water officials attribute the rate variations to many factors, including the  high cost of purifying water from the contaminated San Gabriel Basin, which in  1985 was designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund  site. Officials also cite the expense of pumping water to higher elevations,  and of buying it from the Metropolitan Water District.  </P> <P> In La Verne, Bowcock said, the problem is nitrates. Because all eight of the  city's wells yield water with excessive nitrate levels, the city must import  70% to 80% of its water from MWD at $228 per acre-foot; one acre-foot equals  about 326,000 gallons. La Verne will have to buy at least 6,300 acre-feet of  MWD water in 1989-90 to mix with its well water to make it drinkable, he said.  </P> <P> "It's going to cost me a lot of bucks," Bowcock said. If it weren't for the  nitrates, which come from fertilizer and are a legacy of the area's  agricultural past, the city could provide water to all 7,907 households and  businesses it supplies at just $70 per acre-foot, he said.  </P> <P> "That's hard for residents to understand," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, the city is still paying off construction costs for reservoirs and  "booster stations" that pump water to the growing population living at higher  elevations toward the north end of town. And an annual $1-million payment  toward a treatment plant built three years ago shows up in customers' bills as  $16 every two months.  </P> <P> The Walnut Valley Water District also has high rates because of nitrates,  Finance Director Norm Miyake said. As a result, the district, which serves  Diamond Bar and portions of Walnut, Industry, Rowland Heights and West Covina,  relies completely on MWD water, he said. He added that treatment of the water  is too expensive to be considered.  </P> <P> In Covina, concerns about high water bills recently prompted the City Council  to take the first step toward slashing rates by more than 20%. The proposed  changes, recommended by a citizens committee and endorsed by the council Jan.  22, would bring rates down from an average of $45.88 to $36.02.  </P> <P> At the other end of the spectrum, cities with the cheapest water rates tend to  draw most of their water from the ground, not the MWD. But the bargains may dry  up as contamination spreads.  </P> <P> The Valley County Water District, supplier to parts of Irwindale, Baldwin Park  and West Covina, said its prices may be going up in order to fight the problem.  </P> <P> Eight of the Valley County Water District's 10 wells are plagued by  contaminants, General Manager Stan Yarbrough said. And the contamination is  spreading toward the two remaining clean wells.  </P> <P> The district has installed an aeration tower to clean water from two wells, and  plans to begin construction of additional treatment facilities for two more  wells this month.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately 1,000 feet west of this is another (well) site," Yarbrough said.  "We're very concerned about the plume (of contaminants) moving further west."  </P> <P> As a backup in case the two good wells become contaminated, the district has  arranged to start buying additional water starting in June, 1991.  </P> <P> District officials on Tuesday asked their board of directors to authorize rate  increases to help fund the measures. The board approved the increases, to begin  today  </P> <P> "We're going to have to recoup that money in increased rates," said Clinton  Nixon, district vice president. "We intend to still be among the lowest in the  area."  </P> <P> Consumers have little say in the selection of a utility because water mains  usually are already laid when they move in, said Tom Shollenberger, water  division general manager in Alhambra, which pumps 85% of its water from the  ground and had the second-lowest rates among the agencies surveyed.  </P> <P> Just as residents have little control over who provides their water, suppliers  face restrictions on how much water they can draw from the ground. The  administrator of water rights in the valley is the Main San Gabriel Basin  Watermaster. The agency follows a Los Angeles Superior Court decision that in  1973 allocated each supplier a certain proportion based on historical usage.  Every year, the agency determines the amount of water that can be withdrawn  without depleting the basin, then allots each supplier its share.  </P> <P> The basin that supplies the area's water is bounded on the west by South  Pasadena, Alhambra and Monterey Park, and on the east by Glendora, Covina and  West Covina. It slopes north to the base of the San Gabriel mountains from its  southernmost border at Whittier Narrows.  </P> <P> The watermaster has determined that San Gabriel Valley water agencies will be  allowed to pump about 180,000 acre-feet from the ground this fiscal year. If  they pump more, as they usually do, they will be required to buy extra water  from the MWD to replenish the basin.  </P> <P> Robert Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water  District, which brokers the sale of MWD water to 45 local agencies, said it has  to buy an average of 40,000 to 50,000 acre-feet each year for replenishment.  </P> <P> Berlien, also a watermaster executive officer, noted that 80 of the 400 wells  in the valley are contaminated. He predicted that local water rates could go up  significantly, perhaps in as little as two years, because of the high cost of  cleaning up ground-water contamination.  </P> <P> "It's been expected the EPA will do the cleanup," Berlien said, noting that  local water suppliers until now have not invested much in decontamination. "It  appears now a lot of local funding will be necessary to build treatment  plants."  </P> <P> By late summer, the watermaster plans to release recommendations on possible  solutions.  </P> <P> Some water agencies are already tackling the problem.  </P> <P> To lower concentrations of nitrates, and of trichloroethylene (TCE) and  perchloroethylene (PCE), both possible carcinogens, Arcadia blends water from  four wells. In addition, since 1984, the city has been aerating water from two  wells in a process that turns contaminants into gases that escape into the air,  Water Manager Eldon Davidson said.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, where four wells have been closed since April because of high  levels of carbon tetrachloride, Water Systems Manager Bill Bangham has decided  that it would be cheaper to treat the water. The city now buys 50% to 60% of  its water from the MWD.  </P> <P> The four contaminated wells, which produced 30% of the city's water, will be  able to begin operating again when a treatment facility is built within five  years, he said.  </P> <P> Bangham also noted that there is a constant tightening of water purity  standards set by the EPA and state officials. That necessitates more testing,  the cost of which is passed on to consumers.  </P> <P> "There are a host of things related to quality that will pressure us to  increase costs," he said.  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY WATER RATES  </P> <P> Average bills for residential customers using 3,500 cubic feet -- 26,250  gallons -- of water every two months.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.09IN:5.08IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS"

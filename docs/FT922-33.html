			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Ronson raises possibility of new equity for Heron MR GERALD Ronson, chairman and chief executive of Heron International, the private property, housebuilding and automotive group which is undergoing a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing, said yesterday that 'some form of equity' might form part of the solution to the group's debt problems. Mr Ronson, his family trusts and charitable foundations are the current shareholders in Heron. They have told banks and bondholders that they are not in a position to inject new equity. However, in a letter to holders of the group's Pounds 500m worth of bonds yesterday, Mr Ronson raised the possibility of equity being issued. This could be part of an exchange offer to be made to bondholders. The letter was part of a document outlining a report on the group produced by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, for the group's 80 banks. The report was presented to the banks earlier this month. Heron has extended the standstill agreement with its lenders from today until the end of July. The KPMG report concluded that the best chance for lenders to the group to recoup their loans would be an orderly sale of properties over four to seven years, rather than an immediate liquidation. Liquidation would result in an estimated loss of Pounds 550m to lenders. Bondholders and banks which had lent to the head office company would recover between 28 per cent and 59 per cent of their money, with most getting towards the lower end of that range. There are four sub-groups within the Heron empire, the report said. Two - Heron Corporation, which includes the housebuilding and automotive activities as well as property companies in the UK, France and Switzerland, and the European property division, covering Spain, Portugal, Germany and Belgium - have positive net assets of Pounds 318m and Pounds 363m respectively. Lenders to these two sub-groups 'should be capable of being repaid as properties are realised over a period of time', the KPMG report said. The other two - the head office company, which is the guarantor of all the company's bonds, and the US division - have negative net assets of Pounds 607m and Pounds 283m respectively. Both have suspended interest payments on Pounds 700m of debt.</p>

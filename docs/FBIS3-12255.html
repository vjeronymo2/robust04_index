			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Tunis by Orli Katz-Azulay] </F>   [Excerpts] Despite PLO leaders' declarations that "there  will be no talks with Israel until it reviews its stands,"  efforts are being made to arrange an 'Arafat-Rabin meeting in  Washington tomorrow. This was learned last night from  unofficial sources in Tunis.    Beginning at 1700 yesterday, the bureaus of Rabin and  'Arafat  exchanged messages containing the two sides' questions and  answers. One of the central issues addressed in the messages was  the number of detainees the PLO wanted to see released at once,  compared with the cabinet decision yesterday to release only 800.    Apparently the exchange of messages will be continued only  following the PLO leaders' meeting with Yasir 'Arafat at his  Tunis headquarters tonight. The fate of the Rabin-'Arafat  encounter will be also decided after the PLO meeting. [passage  omitted]    Yesterday 'Arafat convened the nucleus of the PLO leadership  to decide on future steps with regard to the peace negotiations.  The PLO top echelons demand that the following terms be met:    -- All Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israel are to  be  released at once, and the deportees are to be permitted to  return.    -- The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will begin withdrawing at  once from Gaza and Jericho, and the vacuum will be filled by  armed Palestinian policemen.    -- The negotiations will address the settlement issue.    -- Armed settlers will be banished from the area, and weapon  stockpiles will be removed from the settlements.    Until all this happens, the PLO leadership wants an  international force to enter the territories to protect the  Palestinians. Senior PLO officials announced yesterday that  they will resign if 'Arafat returns to the negotiations with  Israel before the new PLO terms are met. [passage omitted]</p>

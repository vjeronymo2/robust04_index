			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan and South Korea have agreed to cooperate in  building a next-generation information network. This was  finalized during the recent Japan-ROK summit talks. ROK  companies will be allowed to participate in the multimedia  experiments at the Kansai culture and science town, the  preparations for which are being conducted under the initiative  of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT], and  experiments on a link-up with the ROK will be undertaken.    While the private sector has taken the lead in the  information superhighway program in the United States, Japan and  the ROK chose to conduct their program under government guidance.    South Korea is working on a next-generation communications  network with the installation of optical fibers and other  equipment, dividing the period from 1994 to 2015 into three  phases. It plans to build a main state communications network,  linking mostly public institutions, and a public communications  network linking South Korean homes.    The ROK expressed interest in a briefing from Japan on the  information network experiments at the regular Japan-ROK  telecommunications consultations last October. President Kim  Yong-sam formally asked for Japan's cooperation during his Tokyo  visit at the summit talks on 26 March. Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa basically agreed to the request; he stressed the  importance of an international communications network linking  Tokyo, Seoul, and other cities.    South Korea expressed its desire to participate in the "new  generation communications network pilot model project" combining  communications and broadcasting going on at the Kansai science  town. The MOPT accepted the request.    The project calls for installation of an optical fiber  network in private homes in the science town to conduct  experiments on "video on demand"--providing video programs  whenever the consumers want them--and television shopping  services, which will start in July. This communications network  will now be linked with South Korean companies and private homes  to experiment with international communications.    If the experiments are successful, the two countries may  cooperate in developing new applications for multimedia, such as  remote medical treatment, or working at home.    Right now, a total of around 100 companies are participating  in this project, including the British communications company  Cable and Wireless, Canadian communications equipment maker  Northern Telecom, and another foreign company. Asian companies  are yet to take part in the program.    As a result of the bilateral cooperation agreement, Korean  Telecommunications (KT) and electric machinery makers of the  major business conglomerates are expected to participate in the  Kansai science town experiments.</p>

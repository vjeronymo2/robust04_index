A  batch of townships, towns, and farms achieving rapid economic  development, that are making hundreds of millions and even  billions of yuan per year, has appeared. These advanced models  have written magnificent praise of the reform and opening up  policies of the party, and set new examples for the further  development of rural China.    China is an ancient country with a long history of  civilization. The formation and development of villages,  townships, towns, and farms in China went through a long  process. According to relevant historical material, villages  formed during the Paleolithic period at the beginning of  primitive society. The original meaning was "several families  facing the water naturally forming a village." In order to hunt  animals and prevent invasion from outside, primitive groups  settled around forest streams, and that formed the prototype of  villages. After man turned from hunting to animal husbandry,  farming, and a settled life, numerous villages appeared.    Townships and towns are the result of village development.  With the development of productive forces, a surplus was  produced and slave society farms appeared. The location of some  large slave owners became the political, economic, and cultural  center of surrounding villages, i.e., the township. As the  grass-roots administrative institution, the township can be  traced back to the pre-Qin ancient book Zhouli [a Confucian  classic]. But as real grass-roots administrative institutions,  townships germinated during the Spring and Autumn Period, took  shape during the Warring States Period, and reached their final  form during the Qin Dynasty. The town is the result of the  division of labor between villages and the development of a  market economy, and appeared much later than the township. As a  state administrative unit, towns first started during the reign  of Northern Wei Emperor Xiao Wen Di. But what can really be  called the prototype of the town did not appear until the Tang  to Ming and Qing period. Agricultural, forestry, and animal  farms germinated during the early years of the Republic of  China, and large numbers of farms were set up after liberation.    China currently has 804,153 administrative villages and  58,185 township and towns. Among these, 43,660 are townships,  2,421 are national minority townships, 11,882 are towns, and 222  are national minority towns. There are 2,149 state-owned farms,  4,212 forestry farms, and 8,200 state-owned and collectively  owned animal farms. With reform and opening up, a batch of star  villages, townships, towns, and farms appeared. According to  1992 statistics, the number of villages with total industrial  and agricultural output value exceeding 100 million yuan reached  430. Among them, the output of 10 villages exceeded 500 million  yuan, and that of 70 exceeded 200 million yuan. There were  4,255 townships and towns whose total industrial and  agricultural output value exceeded 100 million yuan. Among them,  55 exceeded 1 billion yuan and 10 exceeded 2 billion yuan.  There were 125 agricultural farms with total output exceeding  100 million yuan, among which 9 exceeded 500 million yuan.  There was one forestry farm whose total output exceeded 100  million yuan.    Although these star villages, townships, towns, and farms  are  still a minority among all the villages, townships, and towns,  and their proportion greatly differs in different places--among  villages they only occupy 0.00053, among township and towns they  occupy 0.073, among agricultural farms they occupy 0.049, among  forestry farms they occupy 0.024, and among animal farms they  occupy 0.018-- however, they are like glistening pearls  distributed all over China, shining on the extensive land,  attracting and encouraging the hearts of 800 million farmers,  and making 300 million city dwellers look at them in a new light.    The reform and opening up of more than a decade is but a  moment in the long river of time. What has enabled these star  villages, townships, towns, and farms to take an early start, to  cross over the stage of having enough to eat and wear and  advance toward the well-off stage, and to climb into the  international economic arena? What characteristics and secrets  do they have? The book Shining Stars has selected  over 500 villages, townships, and towns, and over 200 farms.  The book has approximately 2.7 million characters (with over  1,500 photographs). All those selected are the best in current  reform, opening up, and the construction of two civilizations.  Their practice answers the questions people are concerned about.    These star villages, townships, towns, and farms basically  have the following characteristics: 1) They grasp opportunities  with an emancipated mind, and create miracles in pioneering and  advancing; 2) they rely on their own resources for survival, and  work hard to seek development; 3) they begin from reality and  come up with their own road for developing the local economy; 4)  they respect knowledge and talent, and become rich by relying on  science and technology; 5) they take the market as their  orientation, adjust the structure of their industries and  products in a timely manner, and take the road of  industrializing the countryside.    Another characteristic of these star villages, townships,  towns, and farms is that they do not blindly seek output value  and speed. This point is very important. To develop township  enterprises one must forcefully push forward technological  reform and scientific management and develop brand-name  good-quality products and products with high added-value and  high-technology content--products that can yield high foreign  exchange earnings. One must pay attention to product quality and  strictly ban fake and shoddy goods. On no account must one seek  product value and speed blindly. On the contrary, one must  actually raise economic efficiency. These they have all done  well. They have also strengthened the building of the party,  and given full play to the function of grass-roots party  organizations as a fighting force and the exemplary vanguard  function of party members. The key to the success of star  villages, townships, towns, and farms is in having a good  leading body, especially a good leader. It is because they have  a large number of hardworking, self-sacrificing socialist  grass-roots leaders that these formerly poverty-stricken  villages, townships, towns, and farms are able to emerge in  intensive market competition, under the heavy onslaught of the  commodity economy, and first realize "well-off" standards and  get rich, becoming brilliant stars in the land of China.    Sparks of fire can spread all over a grassland. We wish for  the old star villages, townships, towns, and farms to continue  to progress, and we hope more new stars will appear!</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Market gives Ebner first round in battle for UBS The prices of the bearer and registered shares of Union Bank of Switzerland displayed rare volatility on Friday as investors struggled to guess the outcome of the war that had just been declared between the directors of one of the world's most highly respected banks and Mr Martin Ebner, a little known Zurich broker-fund manager. At the close, the market seemed to be backing Mr Ebner, no small tribute to the immense resources and influence this intense man has accumulated since setting up his BZ banking group nine years ago. However, the unavoidable final showdown at a UBS extraordinary general meeting on November 22 is still seven weeks away. The main issue is whether a group of shareholders representing only a minority of the capital should be able to control the board. But the battle is also part of an ongoing struggle between an old, self-serving Swiss financial establishment and a new generation of asset managers who want better performance from their Swiss investments. And it is a personal confrontation between Mr Nikolaus Senn, the garrulous UBS chairman who cannot conceal his distaste for a cheeky upstart, and a successful outsider who resents the posturings of someone whose stewardship of Switzerland's largest bank has been undistinguished. Mr Ebner's interest in UBS dates from 1991, when he launched BK Vision to invest in financial equities. It was apparently set up in part to accommodate the wish of some of his clients to shift their less liquid holdings. UBS registered shares suffered from a small float and a restriction permitting only Swiss nationals to vote them, and traded at a substantial discount to the bearers. From the start, these securities have been among BK Vision's largest holdings. Mr Ebner made clear that BK would be an active shareholder - nudging directors towards greater transparency and sensitivity to shareholders - and has been particularly aggressive in needling UBS. In its latest dig, BK Vision put a motion on the UBS AGM agenda in the spring proposing that the number of board members be reduced from 22 to a maximum of nine. Mr Senn resisted it with a farrago of pretentious arguments about UBS's responsibility for the whole Swiss economy and, armed with the usual fistful of proxies, he carried the day. But Mr Ebner, to his immense surprise, attracted some 40 per cent of the votes, and it now looks as if he interpreted this support as a wider mandate to challenge the bank's basic policies. According to Mr Senn, Mr Ebner told him he was trying to corral a majority of the votes with a view to installing a new board at the next annual general meeting and directing UBS to abandon its universal strategy and concentrate instead on investment banking and asset management. As UBS has a market capitalisation of over SFr30bn, it would normally be extremely difficult for anyone to accumulate enough votes for such a cause, especially as the bank's performance, while mediocre, is not distressing. But those registered shares that BK Vision holds have five times the voting power of bearers. Claiming it would be unfair for investors representing only a minority of its capital to take control, the UBS board last Thursday proposed splits of both the bearer and registered shares, giving them equal voting power. The registered shareholders' aggregate voting power would fall from 50 per cent to 20 per cent, in line with their capital commitment. Predictably, BK Vision cried foul, saying the bank would take away the registered shareholders' property rights without compensation. The registered shares have been trading at a substantial effective premium to the bearers in the past few months, but only because Mr Ebner and his allies have been buying them. Mr Ebner is on stronger ground when he argues that his goal is to focus the bank's efforts on profitability, which he says is in the interest of all shareholders. UBS directors face a tough struggle. They must win two-thirds of the votes at the EGM plus a majority from each share class. That means they must convince many Swiss registered shareholders, including UBS employees, it is in their interest to see those shares lose a quarter of their value. If investors thought UBS was going to win, the premium on the registered shares should have disappeared on Friday. But at the close, it still stood at 26 per cent.

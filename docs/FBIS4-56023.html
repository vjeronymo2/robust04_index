			<p>BFN     [Text] Konstantin Trenchev, chairman of the Podkrepa Labor  Confederation, today met with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the  Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], and informed him that  continuing support for this cabinet is politically damaging and  that the cabinet has clearly demonstrated its inability to rule  the country.    After the meeting Konstantin Trenchev told reporters about  this position. The meeting was requested by Ahmed Dogan.  Probably at its next Federative Council Podkrepa will review  its relations with the DPS, because it appears that the movement  is cooperating with the Communists in its decision to support  the cabinet, Dr. Trenchev said.</p>

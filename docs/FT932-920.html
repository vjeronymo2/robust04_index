			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cuts come into prospect INTEREST rate cuts came into prospect again in most bourses, and happened in Copenhagen. In Frankfurt, however, depression seemed to be setting in on this score, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS climbed on rate cut hopes and foreign buying, even although today's meeting between French and German monetary authorities was postponed. The CAC 40 index rose 20.89, or 1.1 per cent to 1,963.30, turnover holding at a high FFr4bn. But it was not all plain sailing for interest rate sensitive stocks. In banks, BNP certificates fell FFr14 to FFr513 as it forecast a slump in first half profits for 1993 and blamed provisions against both sovereign, and small business loans. Other news was better, Alcatel Alsthom gaining FFr11 at FFr667 as it confirmed that it expected to maintain profits this year. Peugeot extended its gains after Wednesday's agm, rising FFr10 to FFr559. The strength of the dollar, meanwhile, lifted Lafarge and Saint Gobain, up FFr14.50 to FFr388 and FFr6.40 to FFr499.90 respectively. But Canal Plus continued to fall, losing another FFr21 to FFr1.250, this time after rumours that it will lose the privilege of broadcasting films only 12 months old. FRANKFURT fell on the poor state of German economy and on receding rate cut hopes, the DAX index closing 13.10 lower at 1,686.29 as turnover declined from DM7.7bn to DM6.9bn. Banks fell in unison, Deutsche Bank losing DM10.80 to DM676.20. However, the weakness of the D-Mark now extends back to mid-April, and banks have been relatively poor performers over that period. The most interest rate-sensitive, Bayernhypo and Bayernverein, dropped DM5 to DM393.50 and DM9.50 to DM415, down by 8.1 and 9.9 per cent respectively since last March 31. There were still one or two winners. Lufthansa climbed DM3 to DM113 after a large foreign order. In a mixed automotive section, Volkswagen rose DM5.30 to DM356.30. MILAN lost ground, disappointed at the failure of unions, employers and government to produce any deal on labour costs. The Comit index shed 2.77 to 534.63, but selling pressure was light as the the market began to concentrate on the prospects for a further cut in Italian interest rates. Olivetti put in a strong performance, rising L85 or 6.5 per cent to fix at L1,385 on news that its L903bn rights issue had been fully taken up by investors. It was also boosted by hopes that it will be successful in its bid to manage cellular telephone operations once the state telecommumications sector is opened up. RAS, the insurer, dipped L200 to L27,313, its 73 per cent fall in profits proving in line with market expectations. BCI was L62 easier at L4,882 although it said that first half profits were much better than those for the same 1992 period. ZURICH's consolidation proved short lived, the market returning to a record high after Wedneday's dip. The SMI index finished 13.2 ahead at 2,336.1. Early hopes for lower rates were reinforced by reports that France and Germany would meet on Friday to discuss co-ordinated interest rate cuts, but the meeting was postponed. Nevertheless, banks were beneficiaries of the focus on rates. UBS bearers, which topped the active list, rose SFr22 to SFr1,072. Bearer shares in Baer Holding firmed SFr35 to SFr1,315 after the bank said that its consolidated profit in the first half of 1993 would equal the profit for the whole of 1992. AMSTERDAM was mixed, disappointed that there would be no concerted Franco-German move on interest rates, but still supported by the strength of the dollar. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.2 to 110.7. The publishing sector was in demand. VNU added 60 cents to Fl 113.60 on news that it has taken a 38 per cent stake in a Dutch commercial television station. Elsevier gained Fl 1.00 to Fl 136.20. Chemicals issues were mixed, DSM losing Fl 1.00 to Fl 89.60 after news that it will curtail its plastics and hydrocarbons production. But Akzo added 50 cents to Fl 151.00 on plans to double production capacity at two of its Dutch fibre producing plants. COPENHAGEN shook off its recent lethargy as the central bank cut its 14-day repo rate by 15 basis points to 7.95 per cent. The KFX index closed 0.88 higher at 88.94. Danisco rose DKr24 to SKr735, while Moeller's D/S 1912 A and B rose DKr1,412 and DKr2,000 respectively DKr108,000 and DKr107,500. ISTANBUL took its series of consecutive all-time highs to its sixth in succession and the eleventh this month, the market index rising 195.4, or 1.7 per cent to 11,607.5. TEL AVIV dropped for the fourth consecutive session, mutual funds acting for the general public selling while provident and pension funds were the dominant buyers as the Mishtanim blue chip shares index lost 2.07 to 196.20 in turnover of Shk210m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 24                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1200.18   1200.91   1199.98   1198.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1251.49   1252.53   1254.44   1251.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1197.54   1197.34   1197.81   1199.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1248.70   1250.77   1250.28   1251.56  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 23    Jun 22    Jun 21    Jun 18    June 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1197.17   1198.69   1193.31   1186.72    1182.69 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1249.23   1253.34   1250.44   1242.58    1238.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1201.26; 200 - 1255.67 Low/day: 100 - 1195.90 200 - 1248.35  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

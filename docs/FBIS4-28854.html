			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Chong-mun] </F>   [Text] As the ROK-U.S. Economic Council meeting scheduled  for 24 June in Washington draws near, the government has set out  the work of lowering tariffs on foreign cars and improving  related systems. However, the government is in trouble due to  differences of opinion between government offices.    As a result of a series of recent policy meetings, the  government made a rough decision to present to the United States  our initial proposal for a package solution that includes the  ROK's promise to lower tariffs at the minimum level and to  improve related systems. However, it is undergoing difficulties  in mapping out a final draft for the solution to the issue since  government offices, such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs  and Finance, failed to narrow differences of opinion on the  scope of tariff reduction and on the necessity of lowering  domestic duties.    A Foreign Ministry official said on 13 June: "As the  scheduled 24 June Washington meeting of the ROK-U.S. Economic  Council headed by both countries' deputy foreign ministers draws  near, related government offices held discussions on measures  for it, such as lowering tariffs and domestic duties. However,  they have only agreed to the necessity of a small-scale tariff  reduction and the improvement of related system and failed to  prepare concrete measures."    This official also said: "It is inevitable for us to show a  sincere attitude by making some concessions in the upcoming  Economic Council meeting because the United States considers the  car import issue as a pending core trade issue between the ROK  and the United States, and because of the serious imbalance  between the ROK's car exports to the United States and U.S. car  exports to the ROK."    The official said that the Foreign Ministry, as the office  in  charge of negotiations, is in trouble since, as the Ministry of  Finance noted, it is in fact impossible to simply change the  system of domestic duties -- such as special excise tax,  acquisition tax, and education tax.    He added: "I am very much concerned about the possibility  that, if we do not propose satisfactory compromise terms in the  upcoming meeting, the United States will use it as a ruse for  invoking the Super 301 provision, regarding the ROK's attitudes  toward the car import issue and the sausage clearance issue as  unfair trade practices.</p>

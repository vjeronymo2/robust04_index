			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> BREAKAWAY BROKERAGE SEEKS A TURNAROUND OF ATROCIOUS TIMING  </P> <P> Two Newport Beach stockbrokers, facing an industry with fewer customers and  smaller commissions, figured that they could come up with a better idea.  </P> <P> Gerald H. Klein and Charles G. Salisbury left their jobs at Prudential-Bache  Securities to start Holford Securities Inc., a discount, full-service brokerage  in Irvine, on Aug. 1.  </P> <P> The next day, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, sending the stock  market in a tailspin and nearly destroying Holford.  </P> <P> Many of Klein's and Salisbury's former Prudential-Bache customers were nervous  over the invasion and decided that they did not want to switch to the new firm.  And, of course, some customers even left the market.  </P> <P> Salisbury acknowledged this week that Holford Securities was hit harder than he  and Klein anticipated, "and the market has not cooperated with us at all."  </P> <P> Fortunately, he said, the company has enough capital to weather the storm and  expects to break even by the end of the year, which is about twice as long as  the two had anticipated it would take to reach the break-even point.  </P> <P> Klein, Salisbury and three other sales people are promoting Holford in Leisure  World, the gated retirement community in Laguna Hills, and elsewhere in South  Orange County. By offering discounts of 40% to 70% on commissions, they hope to  attract customers to their offices in the Irvine Spectrum.  </P></p>

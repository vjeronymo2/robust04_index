			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- The bill "on the state support  of small businesses in the Russian Federation," which was  discussed by the Russian Government today ahead of its  consideration in the parliament, is designed to give more  freedom to the Russian people in the use of their  entrepreneurial abilities. This was said by Chairman of the  Russian Anti-Monopoly Committee Leonid Bochin during the  government meeting on Wednesday.    The number of employees of a small business in the industry  and construction was fixed at 200 people, in agriculture and  other branches of production, wholesale trading, science and  scientific services at 50, and in retail trading and the  non-production sphere at 15.    Natural persons engaged in entrepreneurial activity without  obtaining the status of a legal person are also regarded as  small businesses.    Leonid Bochin said the state support of small businesses  will  take the form of a simplified procedure for registering and  licencing their activity, support for their foreign economic  activity, the organisation of training and retraining, as well  as the provision of easy access to financial, material,  technical and information resources.    The new law stipulates that no state support will be  extended  to small businesses in which one or several legal persons hold  shares of the authorised capital in excess of 25 percent.  Annually at least 0.5 percent of the total spending from the  federal, regional and local budgets will be alloted to support  small businesses. Taxes will be levied on small businesses in  the five first years of their activity, but some tax breaks are  envisioned.    The government approved the bill on the whole and decided to  send it to the State Duma after putting final touches to it,  taking into account critical remarks and proposals made during  the discussion.</p>

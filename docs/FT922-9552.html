			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Big players sink in the pool THOUSANDS of smaller pension schemes which cannot economically justify their own segregated investment portfolios are clients of the life companies and other investment houses which provide pooled investment products. Top performer last year was Lloyds with a rate of return (given full investment discretion) of over 20 per cent. But curiously the big contenders in the field - Scottish Widows, Provident Mutual, Confederation Life and Scottish Amicable - were well below average. The Caps survey suggests that the median return was 17.4 per cent for 1991 (a little below the median of 18.3 per cent for segregated funds), while the WF Corroon performance evaluation service reports an average of 16.2 per cent. On a long-term view, Confederation Life stays top of the 10-year rankings, according to Caps, returning 18.4 per cent a year on average.</p>

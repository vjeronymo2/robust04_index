			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The compartment may be inaccessible, but must be equipped with a fire detector system that warns the pilot station, and the compartment must have ceiling and sidewall floor panels constructed of materials that have been subjected to and meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F to part 23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The compartment must be constructed and sealed to contain any fire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA cannot predict the designs of cargo and baggage compartment for future airplanes. If manufacturers choose to use smoke detectors, however, no more than 2 smoke detectors would be required per airplane. An aerospace engineer could determine the most appropriate location and design the smoke detector system in approximately 30 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $1,800 per certification. Two detectors, including wiring and installation, are estimated to cost about $4,550. Maintenance costs for the smoke detectors would cost approximately $100 per year. Materials that would meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F (see option 2 in the discussion above) would result in incremental costs of less than $200 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that it would cost $500 to construct a sealed compartment, or a total of $1,000 for 2 compartments, if the manufacturer chooses that method of complying with the proposed requirement (see option 3 in the discussion above). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Irrespective of the individual compliance method, the benefits of the proposed provision would come from the increased likelihood that a cargo or baggage compartment fire would either be extinguished or contained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1303&blank;Flight and Navigation Instruments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Revised &sect;23.1303(d) would add the requirement for a free air temperature indicator for those airplanes whose performance must be based on weight, altitude, and temperature. This requirement already applies to turbine powered airplanes. The proposal would extend the requirement to reciprocating engine powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds. Industry sources estimate that the proposed requirement would cost an incremental $500 in engineering design per affected airplane model and $350 per production airplane. Any additional weight would be negligible. The potential benefits of the proposal would accrue from the requirement that the information necessary to determine the performance envelope of the airplane be available to the pilot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1303(g) would identify specific instruments, and limits of those instruments, required for commuter category airplanes. Proposed &sect;23.1303(g)(1) states that if airspeed limitations vary with altitude, the airspeed indicators must show the variation of the maximum operating limit speed (V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) with altitude. Industry sources indicate that an airspeed indicator with V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``pointer'' would cost $1,000 more than one without. Two airspeed indicators are required on commuter airplanes, therefore, the incremental cost of this requirement would be $2,000 per commuter category airplane produced. The potential safety benefit of the proposal would derive from the requirement that the information necessary to determine the maximum operating limit speed be available at all altitudes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1303(g)(3) would require (for commuter category IFR-approved airplanes with passenger seating configurations of 10 more) a third, independent, attitude indicator (AI). Industry sources estimate that an aerospace engineer could design and document a third attitude instrument system in 100 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $6,000 per certification. It is estimated that an AI would cost approximately $8,000, including a standby battery, and that the installation would cost $2,200 for 40 hours of a mechanic's time at a burdened rate of $55 per hour. However, proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5), discussed below, would delete the requirement for a rate-of-turn indicator when an independent attitude indicator is installed. The costs associated with a rate-of-turn indicator include: 40 hours of design and documentation costs, $1,000 per indicator, and 40 hours of installation. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> incremental  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> cost for an IFR-approved airplane with a passenger seating capacity of 10 or more would be $3,600 for 60 hours of engineering (100 hours for the AI, minus 40 hours for the rate-of-turn indicator); $7,000 for the instrument ($8,000 for the AI, minus $1,000 for the rate-of-turn indicator); and no additional cost for the installation (40 hours for the AI, minus 40 hours for the rate-of-turn indicator).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential safety benefits of a third, independent attitude indicator would derive from the reduced potential for erroneous attitude information. Currently, two attitude instruments are required for a ten passenger, IFR approved commuter category airplane. Service experience has shown that a failure can occur whereby an attitude indicator can appear to be working when it is actually providing incorrect information. During such a failure, pilots may have difficulty determining which instrument to follow, and hazardous flight attitudes may result. A third attitude indicator would allow the crew to retain reliable attitude information even in cases where one instrument is not operating correctly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23. 1326&blank;Pitot Heat Indication System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new G23.1326 would require the installation of a pitot tube heat indicating system on those airplanes required to be equipped with a heated pitot tube. Heated pitot tubes ensure that moisture will not freeze in the tube and block or partially block the airspeed system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A pitot heat indicating system, including an in-line current sensor, panel light, and associated wiring, would cost approximately $500. According to industry sources, an aerospace engineer could design and document such a system in 20 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $1,200. A mechanic could install the system in 20 hours at a burden rate of $55 per hour, totalling $1,100. The estimated non-recurring cost per certification, therefore, would total $2,800 ($1,200 for design, $500 for the certification airplane's indicator, and $1,100 for installation of that indicator). The estimated cost per production airplane would be $1,600 ($500 for the system and $1,100 for installation). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The SDP chief made the pitch when he and SDP Secretary  General Wataru Kubo met with Hosokawa at the premier's official  residence for almost an hour.    Murayama said he spoke of the need for the cabinet to be  united to tackle economic issues and expressed his opposition to  an early cabinet reshuffle.    "We think something that creates a crack in the cabinet  should be avoided," he asserted.    Hosokawa explained he wanted to focus on pressing economic  issues such as strained trade ties with the United States and  deregulation and sought the SDP's cooperation, Murayama said.    The SDP chairman reiterated that the government must  concentrate on passing the fiscal 1994 state budget as early as  possible as a way to breathe life into the ailing Japanese  economy.</p>

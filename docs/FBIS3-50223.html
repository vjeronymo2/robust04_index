The delegation is made up of Sandor Lezsak,  executive chairman of the governing MDF and the party's deputy  chairmen -- Peter Nahimi and Tamas Szabo, who is also Hungarian  privatization minister.    In an interview with CTK Lezsak said that cooperation  between  Hungary and Slovakia could not be developed in a confrontational  atmosphere. He said the current visit had been prepared for  half a year and was taking place at the invitation of the  chairman of the Egyutteles (Coexistence) Hungarian minority  movement, Miklos Duray, who is also accompanying the delegation.    The delegation met with representatives of the Hungarian  minority living in the Mezibodrozi region in the morning. Later  in the day its members visited Kosice to hold talks with Kosice  Mayor Rudolf Bauer who acquainted them with a proposal for the  future administrative division of Slovakia drawn up by the Club  of Mayors. The proposal envisages the establishment of 16  historical counties. The MDF delegation expressed "sympathy"  with the proposal.    In the remaining days, the Hungarian guests will visit  individual towns in southern Slovakia to meet with  representatives of local administration and of political and  civic organizations of the Hungarian minority. They are also  expected to meet church representatives before travelling home  on Sunday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds tonight  welcomed Britain's response to Sinn Fein's clarification request.    He saw the document as comprehensive and positive and  believed it should enable the Ulster peace process to move  forward. The onus for creating peace in Northern Ireland was  firmly back with Sinn Fein and their IRA allies.    Deputy premier Dick Spring said: "I welcome this document --  and Sinn Fein should, too. It has to potential to end the  logjam to the peace process thrown up by clarification.    "There is a great deal of explanation that should be helpful  to Sinn Fein, and others as well.    "I would hope that it provides that clarification that was  expected, and that the same consideration the British Government  gave the issue will now be given by Sinn Fein as quickly as  possible." He described the document as "a very serious  attempt...to answer the Sinn Fein questions." He went on: "The  leadership of Sinn Fein said they wanted matters clarified.  That challenge was taken up by the British Government. Matters  have now been clarified and that should put at end to that  particular debate." Mr Spring stressed the British reply did  not amount to a negotation of the peace declaration.    A source close to the Reynolds government said: "It is now  up  to Sinn Fein to decide what to do -- they have a choice.    "They can decide to enter into the political process on the  basis of the peace declaration -- or continue with the  violence." [passage omitted]    Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux said there was now no  excuse for the IRA to continue its campaign of violence. He  said the Government had to refute the allegations and innuendoes  which had been raised by the questions from Mr Adams. There  was now "no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and  there is no need for any further clarification." But he did not  think it would clear up the issue of clarification in the mind  of the Sinn Fein president. "He will go on rabbiting on until  he devalues that device just as he has devalued the phoney  ceasefire.    "He now has run his course, he will not now be able to say  to  America or any other nation that he is in any sort of puzzlement  or any misunderstanding about what was meant -- he has got it  all set out there.    "I think it is a very good thing that the Government refuted  and rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr  Adams' paper because if that not been done it would have given  encouragement to republican terrorists and would have made the  law abiding people of Northern Ireland uneasy. Now it has all  been cleared up."    The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist  Party, was outraged at the response.    He said the Government had produced a 14 paragraph  declaration and now a 20-page clarification.    "The thing is not finished at all. It means the British  Government has been in cahoots with Dublin while Dublin is in  cahoots with the murderers." And he accused the Government of  "lying through its teeth" about a border poll. It was only a  "red herring" which he claimed would be held only if it ran  concurrently with one in the Irish Republic.    Mark Dirkin, chairman of the nationalist Social Democratic  and Labour Party said: "I would hope that people would find no  more need for clarification. I hope they come to that  conclusion by reading the paragraphs provided by the British  Government today."    He said the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] had always  encouraged Sinn Fein to accept the Downing Street Declaration  and continued to do so. [passage omitted]    Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said:  "The Labour Party for some time has called on Sinn Fein to  specify points of clarification and for the British Government  then to respond to such points."    "Sinn Fein can no longer use clarification as an excuse to  prolong their support for and justification of the use of  violence for political ends.    "Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter  political negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on  the basis of Irish self determination as specificed in the  Downing Street declaration."

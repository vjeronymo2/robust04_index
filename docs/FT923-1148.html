			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: BSG reverses trend and advances 31% BSG International, the Birmingham-based motor components, vehicle distribution and consumer products group, lifted pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Pounds 6.51m to Pounds 8.57m for the first half of 1992, reversing the trend of the last two years. The result was achieved on a reduced turnover of Pounds 297.4m compared with Pounds 287.3m. Earnings per share rose from 1.92p to 2.57p, and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p. Both the profits growth and the decline in turnover followed changes in BSG's Birmingham vehicle distribution, where it has stopped fleet sales with an automatic buy-back guarantee and extricated itself from a high volume, low margin business. At the same time the group is reducing its Birmingham sites from three to two and dropping its Iveco truck sales operation. BSG lifted its automotive components trading profits from Pounds 3.85m to Pounds 5.45m. They increased in the UK, where the group has started supplying Japanese car manufacturers, in France and in Australia. There was a small loss, however, in the US where a new mirror plant is being built in Michigan. Nevertheless, BSG expects US mirror turnover, on the basis of contracts already signed, to rise from Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.3m) this year to Dollars 96m in five years time. Trading profits and turnover were lower in the consumer products division, which makes children's car safety seats, push chairs and nursery furniture. This reflected the recession but was offset partly by a strong performance in Germany.</p>

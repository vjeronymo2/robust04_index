			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Donelon Tyson falls to Pounds 0.44m DONELON TYSON, the Cheshire-based building and civil engineering company, reported pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30 sharply reduced at Pounds 439,000, against Pounds 1.02m. The company said that apart from private housing the 'much talked about recovery has not evidenced itself across the construction sector'. The company continued to operate in very competitive markets. Turnover rose Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 34.5m. Net interest payments fell from Pounds 663,000 to Pounds 125,000. Earnings per share came out at 0.66p (1.55p). The directors said that for the rest of the year while the company continued to benefit from the spread of its activities the core construction businesses would have to continue to contend with difficult markets in the year ahead.</p>

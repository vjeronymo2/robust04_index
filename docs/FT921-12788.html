			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Life assurance faces difficult journey across EC borders BUYING life assurance across EC borders will be no easy matter even in the post-1992 single market, according to a study by the main European consumers' organisation. The task will still be hampered by linguistic difficulties, lack of information and inconsistent customer protection rules. The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) yesterday called on the European Commission to amend its draft legislation on liberalising the life assurance market and bring contract law into line in the 12 member states. However, as one Commission official commented: 'We tried harmonising contract law at the end of the 1970s and got nowhere, because member states weren't able to agree.' The third life assurance directive, which is being discussed, would enable insurance groups to operate freely throughout the EC from the end of this year according to their home countries' rules. The same official stressed yesterday that national authorities' ability to veto 'foreign' contracts would be limited. Beuc points out that fixed-term life assurance in Portugal can cost eight times more than in the UK. Britain, Ireland and France sell the cheapest life assurance; Greece, Belgium and Portugal the dearest. According to the Commission, the discrepancies are partly due to differing national tax regimes, which will not be affected by the draft legislation. Beuc also found that insurers were reluctant to adapt to the demands of the single market. Lex, page 16</p>

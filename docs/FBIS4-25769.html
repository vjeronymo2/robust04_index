			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472) and Zhang Yi (1728 </F> 5065): "Li Qiyan, Mayor of Beijing Municipality, Investigates  the Electronics Industrial Trade for the Third Time"]    [Excerpts] On 2 June, Mayor Li Qiyan went to Beijing  broadcasting equipment plant to conduct investigations and  study. It was the third time for him to investigate the  electronics industrial trade. He pointed out: The electronics  industry conforms to the special characteristics of Beijing.  Thus, the municipal government should vigorously support the  development of the electronics industry. Enterprises should  have accurate ideas, foster lofty ideals, enhance internal  strength, and strive to make the electronics industry become  Beijing's pillar industry.    Li Qiyan and other leaders inspected this plant's  videocorder  production line, general outfitting workshop, and showroom;  cordially talked with workers and technicians; and asked them  about the production, technical, and marketing situation.  [passage omitted]    Li Qiyan said during the talks: As the capital of a country  with a population of 1.1 billion, Beijing, under certain  conditions, should make faster development and stride forward  toward the orientation of building itself into an  internationally large, modern city. Beijing should bring its  role as a political and cultural center into better play. To  develop the economy, Beijing should develop high technology as  well as products without contamination and with less energy  consumption so as to suit the special characteristics of the  capital. The electronics industry, conforming to the special  characteristics of Beijing and being listed as one of the  municipality's three major pillar industries, will become  increasingly important in the future.    Li Qiyan said: Beijing has the conditions for developing the  electronics industry. Beijing's electronics industrial trade,  with a good foundation, made great contributions to the country  in the past. This trade has a comparatively powerful science  professional and technician contingent and an appropriate  equipment foundation. In particular, plant directors and the  broad masses of staff members and workers have a good attitude.  With confidence and prospects, the leading body of the  municipal electronics industrial office is able to undertake the  task for rejuvenating the electronics trade. We should stand  higher, widen the field of vision, foster higher aspirations,  and make Beijing's electronics industry stand among the best in  the country and march toward the world. We should use this  target to encourage the leading bodies and the staff and workers.    Li Qiyan stressed: The key to tiding over the electronics  industry's difficulties and rejuvenating the electronics  industry is to have accurate ideas. We should further  emancipate the mind and change ideas. Targets should be higher  and attainable. In the next one or two years, we should  specifically make efforts, do solid work, and solve the problems  one after another. We should treat the money-losing enterprises  by looking into both their root causes and symptoms and make  real efforts to resolve their problems. It is not easy to  eliminate the root causes of the problems. To eliminate them,  we must make several years of effort. We should also pay firm  attention to eliminating the symptoms and appropriately solve  the problems related to the livelihood of the staff and workers.    Li Qiyan said: The transition from the planned economy to  the market economy is a great transformation. So, it is  impossible to smoothly realize this transition. There will be  enterprises with vitality and ones with deficits through this  transition. The municipal government and various overall  departments should help enterprises overcome difficulties and  solve problems, and push enterprises to markets. We should  vigorously help rejuvenate the electronics industry, try every  possible means to create a good environment, appropriately  provide preferential policies, properly inject working funds to  the production enterprises with markets and efficiency, and give  them necessary assistance. We should give awards to the plant  directors with good performances and the specialists with  contributions so as to bring into play the functions of  intellectuals. Enterprises should have good leading bodies  unite with the science professional and technician contingents  and guide all staff members and workers. Simultaneously, the  electronics industry should make efforts, work hard to enhance  its internal strength, and make itself actually become Beijing's  pillar industry.    Li Runwu, vice mayor of the municipality; and Fan Yuanmo,  secretary general of the municipal government, joined the  investigation and study activities.</p>

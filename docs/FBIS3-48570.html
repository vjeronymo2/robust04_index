Sison. The  Netherlands-based Sison, in his renewed attacks against his  critics, also accused columnist and University of the  Philippines professor Alex Magno as being hired by the  government to write anti-communist propaganda.    In a statement faxed to the INQUIRER yesterday, Sison said  groups like the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino, Demokratikong  Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, and the Kapatirang Anak Pawis  [Union of Filipino Workers, Democratic Peasants Movement of the  Philippines, and the Brotherhood of Laborers] are being used by  the government for propaganda against the Communist Party of the  Philippines [CPP] and the National Democratic Front.    Magno laughed off the accusation, saying Sison should learn  to be more tolerant of outside comments. "What does he want, no  one comments on the CPP internal debate?" he asked, adding the  debate has become a public issue.</p>

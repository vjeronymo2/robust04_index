			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ MAY HAVE A-BOMB IN YEAR, CHENEY WARNS  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait  would not solve the Persian Gulf crisis because it is "only a matter of time"  before Iraq acquires the ability to threaten the world with both nuclear and  biological weapons.  </P> <P> Suggesting that Iraq may be less than a year away from manufacturing a "very  crude" nuclear device, Cheney said that "aggressive" sanctions will have to be  maintained against the regime of President Saddam Hussein even after the  question of Kuwait is resolved.  </P> <P> "If he (Hussein) were to come into compliance and withdraw from Kuwait, you are  still going to have to worry about the problem of his acquisition of  sophisticated weapons," Cheney said in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation."  </P> <P> "That's going to require a far more aggressive set of sanctions than we've seen  up till now," the secretary added. "That means the sanctions won't go totally  away."  </P> <P> Echoing the new emphasis that the Bush Administration is placing on Iraq's  attempts to acquire nuclear weapons, Cheney and National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft both suggested in separate interviews Sunday that time may be working  against the coalition opposing Iraq.  </P> <P> "It's not clear whose side time is on," Cheney said, adding that economic and  political pressures could begin to affect the anti-Iraqi resolve of financially  hard-pressed coalition partners such as Egypt, Turkey and the governments of  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody's eager for military action, but neither are they eager  to have this drawn out over an indefinite period of time," Scowcroft said on  ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." "There's a common feeling . . . that it  needs to be brought to an end."  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III is going to the United Nations later this  week to seek Security Council approval for a resolution authorizing the use of  force to compel Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh warned that the resolution would  be "a very dangerous development that would threaten the entire region," the  Washington Post reported. Yemen assumes the council's rotating presidency  Saturday, putting it in a position to use parliamentary maneuvers to stall  consideration of the resolution.  </P> <P> Also this week, hearings on the Administration's gulf policy will be held on  Capitol Hill, where Democrats have voiced growing concern at what appears to be  President Bush's increasing impatience with sanctions and his willingness to  consider using force to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Appearing on the same program with Cheney, Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.) said he is alarmed by the "attitude of inevitability" that  appears to be spreading through Washington concerning the possibility of war  with Iraq.  </P> <P> Arguing that more time is needed "to determine whether or not the sanctions  will have their desired effect," Mitchell said that "the best course is to stay  the course" originally set out by Bush when the United States organized the  world community behind sanctions after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Scowcroft, however, argued that Iraq's attempt to acquire nuclear weapons poses  too great a risk for the world to wait the one or two years that most experts  say will be required for sanctions to really work. Letting sanctions "run a  year or two years or whatever raises the possibility that we could face an Iraq  armed with nuclear weapons, which would dramatically change the character of  any conflict," Scowcroft said.  </P> <P> Cheney said intelligence reports indicate that Hussein is working "very hard"  to become a nuclear power, and that "it's only a matter of time until he  acquires nuclear weapons and the capability to deliver them." That has to be  "an element of concern as we decide how to deal with the problem," he added.  </P> <P> Most experts estimate that Iraq is anywhere between two and 10 years away from  developing a nuclear device. Cheney conceded that experts disagree in their  estimates of how long it will take Iraq to develop a bomb, but he said  "worst-case" intelligence assessments indicate that Iraq could be less than a  year away from developing a "crude" nuclear device.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't be anything you could deliver from an airplane. It wouldn't be  anything that would be weaponized in the sense that we think of a nuclear  weapon. But it would be capable of doing some damage, of producing some kind of  a yield," Cheney said.  </P> <P> Bush first raised the specter of Iraq posing a nuclear threat when he visited  U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia over Thanksgiving. Since then,  Administration officials, stung by criticism that they have not been doing a  very good job of articulating the reasons for the troop buildup or of  convincing the American public of the need to confront Iraq, have been  stressing the more ominous threat that Iraq could pose if it is allowed to  obtain nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> Mitchell, however, noted that the United States has long known of Iraq's  nuclear weapons program but always looked the other way because of Iraq's value  as a counterweight to Iran.  </P> <P> The majority leader, who in recent days has emerged as one of the leading  Democrats urging restraint in the crisis, also criticized Bush for meeting with  Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva earlier this week.  </P> <P> "It was clearly a mistake . . . a serious misjudgment by the President,"  Mitchell said of the meeting with Assad.  </P></p>

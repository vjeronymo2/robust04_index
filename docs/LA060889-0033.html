			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRATEGIES FOR DECREASING THE RISK OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS  </P> <P> In the last few months, a wide variety of foods has been implicated as a source  of outbreaks of food-borne illness. It's important that consumers understand  what they can do to decrease their risk of infection through improper storage  and poor preparation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHICKEN  </P> <P> Although as much as 40% of the nation's uncooked chickens may contain  salmonella, this bacteria is killed by thorough cooking. Coupled with careful  handling of the raw product, the risk of infection can be almost totally  eliminated. Follow these recommendations:  </P> <P>  -- Store raw chicken in the refrigerator for no longer than one to two days;  whole chickens may be frozen up to one year, parts up to nine months.  </P> <P>  -- When refrigerating raw chicken, make certain it does not come in contact  with other foods.  </P> <P>  -- Rinse chicken with cold water before cooking.  </P> <P>  -- Thoroughly wash anything that comes in contact with the raw poultry using  hot soapy water.  </P> <P>  -- Cook chicken to an internal temperature of 180 to 185 degrees, using a meat  thermometer.  </P> <P>  -- For stuffed birds, lightly spoon the dressing into the cavity just before  roasting. To be fully cooked, the dressing must reach an internal temperature  of 165 degrees. Remove all dressing from the bird before carving.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MEATS  </P> <P> Salmonella in beef and trichinosis in pork can be rendered harmless by thorough  cooking.  </P> <P> Health officials say that current levels of growth hormones used on American  cattle are safe.  </P> <P> The following guidelines should be followed:  </P> <P>  -- Most raw meats may be stored in the refrigerator from three to five days.  Exceptions are ground or stewed meats, variety meats and fresh sausage. These  should only be refrigerated one to two days.  </P> <P>  -- Beef roasts and steaks may be frozen six months to a year; lamb roasts, six  to nine months; pork and veal roasts, four to eight months. Pork chops, ground  and stew meats may be frozen three to four months; sausage one to two months.  </P> <P>  -- Use a meat thermometer when cooking all meats. Be aware that cooking beef  rare, to only 140 degrees, means that some food poisoning organisms could  survive. Fresh pork must be cooked to 160 degrees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FISH AND SHELLFISH  </P> <P> Many of the bacteria found in seafood are killed by adequate cooking. To guard  against risks of parasites and chemical pollutants, consumers should:  </P> <P>  -- Purchase seafood from stores with proper storage and handling facilities.  </P> <P>  -- Keep all fish and shellfish refrigerated. Do not store unfrozen seafood  more than a few days.  </P> <P>  -- Use frozen seafood within two to three months.  </P> <P>  -- Rinse seafood with cold water before cooking.  </P> <P>  -- Avoid eating raw or partially cooked seafood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EGGS  </P> <P> We can't be certain the eggs we buy are not contaminated with Salmonella  enteritidis bacteria, but there are precautions we can take to prevent  food-borne illness:  </P> <P>  -- Purchase eggs graded AA or A with clean, uncracked shells. It's an  additional plus if the market has stored eggs under refrigeration.  </P> <P>  -- In the home, refrigerate eggs in their original carton. Since the eggs have  been washed during processing, it's not necessary to wash them again.  </P> <P>  -- Use raw in-shell eggs within five weeks from the time of purchase. Once  eggs are hard-cooked, they should be used within one week regardless of whether  they are in the shell or peeled. It's recommended that any egg yolks or whites  left over from recipe preparation be used within four days.  </P> <P>  -- Consumers, especially those at risk such as the elderly and those with  impaired immune systems, should avoid eating raw eggs and foods containing raw  eggs. This includes foods such as Caesar salad, homemade blender hollandaise  sauce and mayonnaise, and homemade ice cream containing uncooked eggs.  </P> <P>  -- Cook eggs thoroughly, until both yolks and whites are firm. There may be  some risk in eating eggs lightly cooked, such as soft-cooked, soft-scrambled  and sunny-side up.  </P> <P>  -- Realize that eating lightly cooked foods containing eggs, such as soft  custards, meringues and French toast may also be risky for people with weakened  immune systems and other high-risk groups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PRODUCE  </P> <P> Although some pesticides, such as Alar used on apples, penetrate the food, many  do not. Consumers can protect themselves by:  </P> <P>  -- Scrubbing fruits and vegetables with a clean brush to remove pesticides  </P> <P>  -- When feasible, peeling fruit and vegetables. This also eliminates wax  coatings that many people find undesirable.  </P> <P>  -- Removing and discarding outer leaves of vegetables such as lettuce and  cabbage, then washing what remains.  </P> <P>  -- Another item that has recently caused problems is chopped garlic in oil.  The Food and Drug Administration warns consumers may risk potentially fatal  botulism food poisoning from some commercial and homemade chopped garlic and  oil mixes if they are left at room tempeature instead of being refrigerated  from manufacturing to consumption. In particular, garlic and oil mixes  containing little or no acidifying agent such as phosphoric or citric acid  should be kept refrigerated at all times.  </P></p>

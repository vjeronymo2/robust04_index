			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CPRF Denounces Arms Buildup and War Exercises of U.S. </F> Imperialists and Kim Yong-sam Puppet Clique" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- "It is a foolish  daydream if the United States and the South Korean puppets think  they can threaten and bring us to our knees with sophisticated  weapons of mass destruction.    "We set greatest store by peace, but, if any enemy dared  provoke a war by challenging our sincerity and efforts, we would  sweep away the aggressors from this land for good and  demonstrate once again the mettle and honour of heroic Korea."    The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful  Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] says this in its  information No. 646 published on March 31.    Noting that the United States and the South Korean  authorities have staged war exercises almost every day,  massively introducing various kinds of war materiel and a large  number of aggressor troops, the information goes on:    "If the reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists and  their  stooges are overlooked, the train of a nuclear war would  inevitably be lighted, and then, the territory of our country  would turn into a barren land and the whole nation suffer an  irretrievable holocaust.    "The South Korean people of all walks of life should fight  more daringly to check and frustrate the planned deployment of  Patriot missiles and new war provocation moves of the U.S.  imperialists and their stooges."</p>

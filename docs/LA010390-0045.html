			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR TELLS TALES OF JOY AND DESPAIR  </P> <P> The Mirror Maker: Stories &amp; Essays by Primo Levi, translated by Raymond  Rosenthal (Schocken Books: $16.95, 176 pages)  </P> <P> A radio talk show on KCRW-FM recently devoted two hours to a debate on Woody  Allen's eminently debatable film, "Crimes and Misdemeanors." The participants  included a film critic, a rabbi and a New York psychoanalyst who appears in the  motion picture in the role of the immigrant professor who delivers a message of  courage, dignity and hope in the face of a cruel and senseless world -- and  then, tragically and inexplicably, takes his own life by jumping out the  window. All of the panelists referred to the figure of the doomed European  intellectual as "the Primo Levi character."  </P> <P> The real Primo Levi, of course, was an Italian-Jewish chemist who survived  Auschwitz, chronicled the experience of the Holocaust in a series of brilliant  memoirs and novels, and then, only three years ago, threw himself down the  stairwell of his apartment building in Turin, Italy. And so we approach "The  Mirror Maker," a posthumous anthology of Levi's poems, stories and essays, with  both reverence and deep, urgent curiosity: Is there a clue in these pages to  the suicide of a Holocaust survivor whose work came to be regarded as a  stirring affirmation of life in the face of death and despair?  </P> <P> In no sense, of course, did Levi intend the "The Mirror Maker" to be a suicide  note. These short pieces first appeared in "La Stampa," a Turin newspaper to  which Levi contributed from time to time over the last 25 years of his life.  And so the book, by its very nature, is modest in scale and ambition; few of  these pieces exceed two or three pages in length, and many of them are simply  the author's passing reflections on the headlines -- an early Apollo mission,  the scandal over the spiking of Austrian wines with antifreeze, the publication  of a book about gossip, the negotiations over nuclear disarmament -- or his  musings on Horace, Kafka, Jack London, the importance of rhyme in poetry.  </P> <P> "I beg the reader not to go in search of messages," Levi writes in the  introduction to "The Mirror Maker," which was published in its original Italian  edition during his lifetime. "I'm a normal man with a good memory who fell into  a maelstrom and out of it more by luck than by virtue, and who from that time  on has preserved a certain curiosity about maelstroms large and small,  metaphorical and actual."  </P> <P> But Levi's memory is too powerful, too vivid, and too persistent for us to  dismiss even his most ephemeral writing. Aside from the occasional piece that  may be regarded as inconsequential or merely unsuccessful, the book is nothing  less than a contemplation of moral order in the universe. In that sense, it is  a fitting coda to such enduring and important work as "Survival in Auschwitz"  and "The Awakening."  </P> <P> Indeed, the memory of Auschwitz -- that is, the memory of suffering, both  spiritual and physical -- haunts all of Levi's writing, and flashes of the  Holocaust illuminate "The Mirror Maker" like heat lightning. Thus, for example,  Levi is referring to the Apollo mission and Auschwitz when he writes, both in  joy and despair: "We are driven by atavistic impulses, and by reason, and at  the same time by a 'cheerful strength,' so that, if an enterprise can be  accomplished, be it good or evil, it cannot be set aside but must be carried  through."  </P> <P> His stories of fantasy and science fiction, I felt, were the least successful.  Levi gives us a comic encounter between an Earthling and a visitor from another  planet ("He wanted to know at what age clothes begin to develop"); he devotes  several short pieces to imaginary interviews with animals: a gull, a mole, even  a form of intestinal bacteria called E. coli ("Now bear with me for a moment,  I'm in mitosis. . . ."). But even these stories offer moments when Levi's  horrific experiences in the real world add a kind of poignancy and resonance to  his wildest imaginings -- a young girl who sprouts wings and learns to fly; or  an imprisoned alchemist who discovers how to pass through solid matter and then  merges with the body of his lover "into a perpetual night of impossibility."  </P> <P> Several of the essays in "The Mirror Maker" are explicitly concerned with the  meaning and memory of the Holocaust. Levi eulogizes the fighters of the Warsaw  Ghetto: "They have demonstrated that even when everything is lost, it is  granted to man to save, together with his own dignity, that of future  generations." And he condemns the revisionism of contemporary German historians  who seek to minimize the crimes of the Holocaust by comparing Nazi genocide to  the Soviet gulag:  </P> <P> "That 'the gulag came before Auschwitz' is true; but one cannot forget that the  aims of the two infernos were not the same," Levi retorts. "The first was a  massacre among peers; it was not based on racial primacy and did not divide  humanity into supermen and submen. . . . This contempt for the fundamental  equality of rights among all human beings is shown by a mass of symbolic  details, starting with the Auschwitz tattoo and going all the way to the use in  the gas chambers of the poison originally produced to disinfest the holds of  ships invaded by rats."  </P> <P> As in his other recent writing, Levi invokes his own career in the field of  chemistry as a context in which to consider the morality of science, the  possibility of miracles, and the order -- or lack thereof -- of the universe.  "It seems strange to me that varnishes are displacing Auschwitz as the 'ground  floor' of my memory," Levi writes of his special expertise as an industrial  chemist. "I realize this from my dreams, from which the Lager has disappeared  and in which, with increasing frequency, I am faced with a varnish maker's  problem that I cannot solve."  </P> <P> Here, I believe, may be a clue to Levi's decision to take his own life. Despite  his strongest instincts and loftiest aspirations -- "In my writing, for good or  evil, knowingly or not, I've always tried to pass from the darkness into the  light" -- Levi, at the age of 67, despaired at finding himself in a world where  the lapse of collective memory threatens to obliterate even Auschwitz. Perhaps  it was that "varnish maker's problem" that drove the survivor to suicide.  </P></p>

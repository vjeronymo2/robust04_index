			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The nation weeps I ALMOST didn't watch last Saturday's Grand National steeplechase at Aintree racecourse, what with the cruelty angle - the propensity of all racing over jumps to smash and batter the animals. The unintelligent, which includes everyone associated with jumps racing - owners, breeders, trainers, jockeys, stable staff, officials, Jockey Club, vets, farriers, horse-box drivers, bookmakers, sponsors, newspaper hacks, TV commentators, paying customers and the man who holds the gun ready to shoot the horses that are damaged beyond repair - have an excuse for watching the Grand National. Their unintelligence. In the end, though, I relented. I skimmed the form-guide hurriedly, scuttled to the betting shop, placed Pounds 20 worth of bets, scuttled indoors again and turned on the BBC. I am glad that I did so because as everyone now knows, last Saturday's Grand National produced the biggest cock-up - a spectacularly British cock-up - in the history of professional sport. I laughed until the tears ran. I haven't felt so uplifted since the fall of Saigon. I loved every minute of it, especially the way that the BBC anchorman - Des or Les or something: the one who stares out at us as though he personally owns the TV rights to all major sports events - slipped deeper and deeper into the vocabularly of petulance as the magnitude of the fiasco impressed itself upon him. At one level, Saturday's cock-up, which provoked a gale of world-wide mockery, ought to prove a morale-booster for the animal rights and anti-cruelty protesters. As they are doubtless aware, the fiasco has played into their hands by spotlighting the rotten foundations with which the Grand National, an anachronistic hold-over from the 19th century, is underpinned. The protesters have got the toffs who rule and run racing firmly in their sights. But they must squeeze the trigger carefully. They must woo public opinion by concentrating on the hundreds of racehorses (no-one knows how many) that die prematurely as a result of injury at the racetrack. Much more importantly, the cock-up supports my belief, advanced two weeks ago, that the events of recent months - above all, the recession - have exposed our institutions to such ferocious scrutiny that life in Britain will never be the same again. It may not get much better. But I believe it will be different. Take the Grand National, which is an institution of a sort. It is probably the world's most famous horserace. But it is really made of cardboard. If you watched TV last Saturday you will have noticed, in the background, a succession of ashen-faced toffs, resplendent in trench-coats, hatted and binoculared, marching backwards and forwards, deeply and bitterly ashamed of the fiasco they had caused - but powerless to halt the crashing juggernaut. Naturally, the spin-doctors at the Jockey Club and the hapless managers of Aintree racecourse are trying to put a constructive gloss on things. And there will be a vicious competition to pass the blame. But they won't fool anyone - not when the BBC broadcast is flashing, at the speed of light (6 trillion miles per year), out into the galaxy, so that all those extraterrestrials who live near far-flung stars will eventually enjoy the spectacle we enjoyed last Saturday. 'Great show from Earth tonight,' says a four-headed version of Des or Les, 'the 1993 Grand National from Aintree, England, on planet Earth. Make sure you stay tuned, it's out of this world.' So far, the only major British institution to have undergone at least minor reform is the monarchy, at whose apex Queen Elizabeth II, that well-known racehorse owner, has graciously consented to pay a dollop of income tax. But the House of Windsor has lost its mystique. With luck, the monarchy will be modernised further, and greatly cut back. I have no religious beliefs whatsoever. But I do have an Easter message, which goes like this: do not cast yourselves down, or weep and rend your clothes; reform is in the air; the recession is lifting, at least momentarily; things will get slightly better before they get far worse; our institutions are teetering. If you enjoyed the Grand National, you will love what is to come.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELLING DEFUNCT SAVINGS AND LOANS AT BARGAIN PRICES  </P> <P> The defunct savings and loan properties are to be sold at virtually "fire sale"  prices, which will result in potential billion-dollar losses. Where's the  hurry?  </P> <P> I am no real estate expert, but we all expect some inflation in the years  ahead. The purchasers of the properties at bargain prices, reselling them  several years hence, will surely profit handsomely, if for no other reason than  inflation.  </P> <P> We know that the government does not want to be in the business of real estate,  but surely ways can be found to market these properties over the years on a  selective basis.  </P> <P> Perhaps a highly respected figure in the private sector of real estate can head  a specially created department to manage and dispose of these properties at the  right and earliest time to minimize the final losses, if any.  </P> <P> JACK BLANKLEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / US group buys gas interests from Chevron to boost UK role ENRON EUROPE, a subsidiary of one of the largest gas companies in the US, signalled its intention yesterday of becoming a significant player in the UK gas market by purchasing substantial North Sea gas interests from Chevron UK, the oil company. The deal will allow Enron to market large quantities of gas to power generators and big industrial users in north-east England, where it is leading a consortium to build one of the largest power stations in the UK. It already had plans to market surplus gas from this project. Enron, a subsidiary of Enron Corporation, acquired Chevron's 25 per cent share in the so-called J-Block, in the central North Sea, comprising the Joanne and Judy fields. This will give it about 190bn cubic feet of gas and 12.5m barrels of natural gas liquids. The deal also provides for Enron to purchase Chevron's 25 per cent interest in North Sea block 30/7b. The purchase price was not disclosed. 'We view this as our first big step into the gas marketing and natural gas liquids arena in the UK,' said Mr Raymond Kaskel, Enron's president and chief operating officer. Enron is building a 1,725 megawatt gas-fired power station at Imperial Chemical Industries' Wilton site in Teesside, north-east England. The Pounds 800m plant is due to come into operation in April 1993. Gas for the plant will be transported to Teesside from the Amoco-operated Everest and Lomond fields in the North Sea via the new 255-mile Central Area Transmission System (CATS) pipeline. The interests acquired yesterday will be tied into the CATS pipeline and be a big boost to Enron's marketing ambitions when the two fields, operated by Phillips Petroleum, come on-stream, probably at the end of 1995. According to an agreement with the Office of Fair Trading, British Gas, the privatised former monopoly supplier, pledged to surrender 50 per cent of its share of the industrial gas market to independent marketers by 1995. The threshold above which consumers can buy gas from independents was also recently lowered from 25,000 therms a year to 2,500 therms. However, those agreements are being reviewed as part of a comprehensive study of the UK gas market by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Kaskel said Enron was keen to acquire other sources of gas but would initially concentrate on marketing only to the biggest gas consumers. He said Enron would later consider building its own pipelines and marketing to smaller industrial and commercial consumers. 'We will use big consumers as the base on which to expand our marketing activities,' Mr Kaskel said.</p>

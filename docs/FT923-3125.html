			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Democracy parties ahead in Thai poll: Anti-military candidates win support PARTIES opposed to military interference in Thai politics appeared to have won a slim parliamentary majority in yesterday's general election in Thailand, four months after troops killed at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok. With most of the votes counted, Mr Chuan Leekpai, leader of the Democrat Party, was preparing an attempt to form a coalition government. His party won about 80 seats, the largest bloc in the 360-seat House of Representatives. With the support of three other members of a loose pro-democracy alliance  - the New Aspiration Party, Palang Dharma (Moral Force) and Solidarity  - Mr Chuan is expected to form a government with at least 185 seats. One or more of the other parties may be co-opted to strengthen the coalition, but Mr Chuan has promised to exclude politicians accused of corruption from his cabinet. Businessmen and parliamentary colleagues regard 54-year-old Mr Chuan as a responsible if uninspiring politician. He has won his seat in the Democrat stronghold of Trang in south Thailand nine times in a row, and has served in various governments as minister of agriculture, education, commerce, justice and health. Mr Chuan, who heads Thailand's oldest party, won widespread support in the election because he opposed the military during the demonstrations in May but attempted to resolve the conflict in parliament rather than on the streets. Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist known as Mr Clean who heads Palang Dharma and led the street protests, lost support to the Democrats in his Bangkok stronghold but made gains elsewhere. Politicians sympathetic to the military did well in rural areas, and Chart Thai (Thai Nation) won about 72 seats, the second highest number, followed by about 60 for the Chart Pattana (National Development) party of the former prime minister, Mr Chatichai Choonhavan. In spite of the strong showing of the pro-democracy parties yesterday, the campaign was marred by the widespread corruption and violence which have long been a feature of Thai elections. At least seven canvassers were shot dead by political rivals on the eve of the poll, and wealthy politicians paid out what Pollwatch, the independent monitoring agency, described as 'a huge sum of money' to buy votes in the poorer rural areas. Thai politics have been shaken up since a group of pro-military parties won the previous election in March this year. Thousands of demonstrators, many of them middle-class professionals, took to the streets of Bangkok in May to protest against the military.</p>

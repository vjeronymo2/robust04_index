			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Many options, no favours: Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, spells out his plans for government Striving for office has matured Mr Neil Kinnock. The leader of the Labour party has spent eight years preparing for the forthcoming general election, and it shows. When we went to interview him in his office at the House of Commons yesterday we found him in good humour, confident, in control of his responses. His many detractors will regard this as a revelation. This is understandable. The Labour leader will never be accused of pithiness. He is by nature loquacious. Yet he seems to be aware of the huge effort of self-mastery that he must undertake if he is to stand a chance of winning. Yesterday he gave full answers, but he did not ramble. He avoided more than a modicum of sub-clauses and dialectical by-ways. His language was in better focus than on many past occasions, public or private. He is still quite capable of living down to his poor image. But equally, if he performs on TV as he has demonstrated he can do in small gatherings - and sporadically in the Commons - he will be no easy mark for the Conservatives. To the extent that they are banking on the windbag image to see them through the campaign they may be in for a surprise. What, we asked as a starter, are the positive reasons for supporting the Labour party? Mr Kinnock loved that question. 'We alone among the parties have a strong commitment to the development of the supply side of the economy,' he replied. Britain had to match its major competitors in this area. He cited Labour's oft-promoted policies on training and education. 'The major determinant of investment decisions and industrial location is the skills and potential capacities of the workforce, at every level.' Labour would provide 'a national framework that can be delivered locally in a partnership between training and educational elements and those who employ and will employ people'. Sounding a bit like the Labour leader of 1964, he alluded to the promotion of 'discovering and innovating' - to be achieved through direct inducements for research and development. Tax incentives would be introduced to bring forward new investment, 'so that the recovery is investment-led'. The improvement of the 'commercial and social infrastructure, particularly transport' had long been needed. This would include bringing private financing in to the railways. But given Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism and Labour's promise not to go on a spending spree, how would Mr Kinnock's economic management differ from Mr Major's over, say, the next two years? 'People are regarding the participation in the ERM as a curtain drawn down on all options - and it isn't,' replied Mr Kinnock. He sat forward and used his hands for emphasis. 'The argument we made for going in and the argument that we make for staying in is that it is the real world. It's the place where we have to trade, make a living, win new markets, be successful.' The question was not whether the ERM forbade action, but what action was necessary to make a success of the economy within the ERM. The government was using membership of the ERM as one of its reasons for not doing anything but hanging around and hoping. The arguments for Labour's supply-side measures to facilitate greater convergence with Europe's stronger economies were even more powerful as a result of participation in the ERM. Ever the practised salesman of his party's policies, Mr Kinnock once again chanted the training-education-investment mantra quoted above, with a few additional items, such as technology trusts, thrown in. But would anything much change in the short term? 'By doing the things that will combat recession in the short term, especially in the construction and manufacturing industries, we build the basis for future economic success.' As to the rapidity of recovery, 'is anybody going to try to tell me that recovery dependent upon a rising tide of consumption, which is what the government hopes for, is going to be a quick way out of recession?' Nobody could argue that consumption-led recovery would be any quicker than investment-led recovery. The contrary was the case, Mr Kinnock said. Relying on consumption would mean a rerun of the two circuits of boom and slump experienced in the 1980s, with the net result in the end of a weaker economy. We moved to expenditure and taxation. Here an effort was made to pin Mr Kinnock down. It was not wholly successful. 'No opposition in history has ever been as candid as we are,' he said. Pensions and child benefit would be raised, he affirmed. This would be done at once, in Labour's first Budget. Those on the very highest incomes were going to have to meet the bill for this. Mr Kinnock assured us that Labour's income tax changes would only apply to people earning 'well in excess of Pounds 30,000'. Labour had taken the precaution of saying in successive policy documents that it had to retain the option - if it proved to be possible when the party had full access to the details of the exchequer  - to introduce the changes in a way that would minimise the impact on personal and business budgets. Pressed for details, Mr Kinnock insisted that the final decisions would have to be made by Mr John Smith when in office as chancellor. Further pressed, he agreed that phasing-in of the proposed 50 per cent top rate tax was an 'option'. It turned out that 'option' is a useful little word. It was also applicable to phasing-in of the plan to lift the ceiling on liability for national insurance contributions. The ceiling would certainly be lifted, but not necessarily all at once. 'We're only going to open the door,' said Mr Kinnock, apologising for his mixed metaphor, 'but there will be a choice, as to whether we open the door wide, or we open the door a little'. The matter would be settled when Labour had the full access to complete information - ie when it was in government. Phasing-in the limitation of tax allowances to the basic rate, also a Labour policy, seemed also to be in the area of options, although on this Mr Kinnock appeared to be less at ease, or perhaps less rehearsed, than on the other tax questions. Overall he spoke as would any shadow chancellor or opposition leader. It was unrealistic 'to assume that I can be explicit in all detail when we're not yet in government, we haven't yet seen the 1992 Budget, and there are substantial areas in which we could at best be guessing'. As to the government's forthcoming Budget, 'we do not believe that the standard rate should be either increased or decreased. The consequence is that if the standard rate was in this Budget . . . to be cut by 1p we would reverse that.' The resources were necessary for the improvement of the public services. But what if the same amount of public money was used to lower tax thresholds? It could not be said that it was policy to reverse such a change. As to what Labour would in fact do, we had to wait for the information in the forthcoming Budget. 'All else would be speculation.' A little more pressure on expenditure was applied. Training would be allocated an extra Pounds 800m of public expenditure. A total anti-recession package including training support, investment support and the like would cost at a round figure Pounds 1bn. 'We're also talking about drawing down the capital assets held by local authorities in order to stimulate the construction industry and get some homes built and improved,' said Mr Kinnock. He acknowledged that the size of this injection of expenditure could be enormous, but it would be phased in line with the capacity of the industry to respond. The skill shortage was one constraint. We turned to the unions. Would the public sector unions not expect a Labour government to reward them for their good behaviour while the party was in opposition during the past few years? 'I've been saying . . . since early 1984 . . . that a Labour government would not be offering favours to anybody, on any side.' Second, the unions 'don't expect to get what they know they're not going to get'. Third, 'everybody understands that it's not possible for a government, or anyone else, to provide out of both pockets'. People had to take account of the way in which the trade unions now approached the basic economic questions. The constantly repeated and strong emphasis was on investment, not consumption. This, he said, was a recognition of where the emphasis must be in pursuit of the welfare of working people generally. It was understood that without strong economic performance there would not be significant rises in the standard of living. But what about Mr Kinnock's many complaints of 'underfunding'? Would not the public sector unions quote these at him? Naturally incomes would be a part of the improvement of these services, he replied, but the unions faced the choice between a government that would maintain the underfunding and one that would constantly reduce it 'by the proper use of resources'. But what if some unions nevertheless failed to be reasonable? Would a Labour government face down industrial action? 'You're asking me to plan for next Christmas on the basis . . . that our water tank is going to burst.' Yes, that had been the experience of previous Labour governments. 'The plumbing that we've got is superior to anything that anybody has had before,' responded the Labour leader. We tried another tack. Mr Kinnock, we said, you don't believe in competition, you believe in intervention. 'I look at the most competitive economies in the world and I see that competition or competitiveness is not contradicted by intervention.' The basic question was not whether to intervene or when to intervene but to what degree, and to what purpose. As among EC competitors, the purpose was to create an environment for productive business to flourish. 'We are introducing policies which enable, not control; policies which facilitate and not prescribe.' Labour put forward this view 'because it works'. This was evident elsewhere. It appeared that Mr Kinnock had Germany much in mind, although he did not specify which competitor countries inspired Labour policies. Asked about sectoral intervention, taking steel as an example, Mr Kinnock replied 'it isn't intervention that the steel industry needs. What the steel industry needs is a more vibrant domestic market, specially in the manufacturing sector and a chance therefore to make even further increases in their productivity and be more competitive in difficult international markets.' The industry did not need 'some civil servant or minister sitting on their shoulder saying to them well, strategically this is what we think you should do, or in the micro economy, you'd better use this spanner instead of that spanner'. That would be 'absolutely ridiculous'. Finally, constitutional change. Labour would introduce a Scottish parliament at once. Wales, whose assembly was based on local government change, could probably be tackled within the lifetime of a full parliament. English regions, it appeared from Mr Kinnock's replies, would take somewhat longer. Pressed on House of Lords reform, Mr Kinnock said that in terms of time scale we would have to say unknown. As to electoral system changes, he spoke confidently of Labour's preparation of the analytical ground for an in-party and a national debate. Was all this not just a ruse to con the Liberals into voting Labour? Ho ho ho said Mr Kinnock. He had stimulated what had been a formless debate, 'completely apart from any consideration of the Liberals whatsoever.' Since his parting shot was a prediction of a Labour overall majority of 20, this was hardly surprising.</p>

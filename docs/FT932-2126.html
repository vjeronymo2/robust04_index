			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Turn-out down in Italian cities THE VOTER turn-out yesterday, in the run-off to elect mayors in 145 Italian cities, looked set to be lower than in the first round. This suggested that a proportion of the 6.7m voters had decided to stay away, unwillng to endorse either candidate in each run-off. By early evening, only 32 per cent of the potential electorate had voted, compared to 38 per cent in the first round on June 6. This is the first time that Italy has used new laws, approved in March, introducing the direct election of mayors. In only two instances did the first round yield absolute majorities; the other cities were obliged to try again. The main interest yesterday was in the outcome in the two big northern cities of Milan and Turin. The populist Lombard League of Mr Umberto Bossi has staked its prestige on being able to win Milan outright. Mr Marco Formentini, League candidate, obtained the largest vote in the first round, with nearly 39 per cent. Opinion polls have suggested he is ahead of his rival, Mr Nando Dalla Chiesa, supported by a broad alliance of the left, who won 30 per cent in the first round. The final stages of the campaign were marred by provocative statements from Mr Bossi, directed against Mr Dalla Chiesa and his supporters. The League has also been vociferous in Turin, where it claims the first round vote was irregular, depriving its candidate of the chance of a run-off. The run-off in Turin yesterday could yet be annulled as the League has sought an injunction. This suit is unlikely to be heard before next week. The contest in Turin is between two candidates of the left - Mr Diego Novelli, a former communist mayor, and Mr Diego Castellani, candidate of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The once-dominant Christian Democratic party is in only five out of 16 of the most important mayoral contests. This underlines its waning fortunes. By contrast, the Christian Democrats' old rivals, the communists now transformed into the PDS, could turn a system of alliances into a large number of mayoral wins.</p>

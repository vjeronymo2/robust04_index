			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Goodyear to take one-off charge of Dollars 1bn GOODYEAR, the last surviving big US-owned tyremaker, said yesterday it would take a one-time net charge of Dollars 1.01bn because of the early adoption of two non-cash accounting changes related to retiree non-pension benefits and income taxes. The special accounting charge, which a number of US companies will be taking, will cause a full-year net loss at Goodyear, since it will be retroactive to the start of 1992. The Ohio-based company has already restated its net earnings for the first nine months of 1992, which now show a net loss of Dollars 746.1m, having last October been reported as a net profit of Dollars 279.3m. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said the company decided to take the one-time extraordinary debit rather than spread the amount over 20 years because of strong sales and operating earnings. He said that even with the new charge, the company would achieve its planned debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of 40 per cent by the end of 1993. On Wall Street, Goodyear's share price fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 70 5/8 yesterday. AMR, parent company of American Airlines, announced yesterday it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 525m, against 1992 profits, as a result of adopting two new accounting standards, adds Nikki Tait. The first relates to Financial Accounting Standard 106, requiring companies to accrue future pensioners' medical and life insurance benefit costs over the working lives of eligible employees. AMR said this meant 1992 expenses would be around Dollars 60m (after-tax) higher than under the old method, and there would be a further one-off charge of about Dollars 600m as result of applying the new standard to previous years. The effect of FAS 106 will be partially offset by FAS 109, which changes the way companies account for income taxes. This will produce a one-off benefit, after-tax of Dollars 135m.</p>

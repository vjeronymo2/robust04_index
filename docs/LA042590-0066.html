			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATWATCH: ANTELOPE VALLEY RESTORES ORDER TO ITS LINEUP  </P> <P> A little reorganization can do wonders.  </P> <P> A case in point is the Antelope Valley High baseball team, which has won seven  of its past nine games -- including four of five in Golden League play -- since  Coach Mike Van Cheri shuffled his lineup three weeks ago.  </P> <P> With the Antelopes' batting average hovering at .270, Van Cheri used his eraser  as well as his pencil while filling out the lineup card for a showdown with  Saugus.  </P> <P> The changes: Chad Eberhardt was moved from No. 2 to the leadoff position, David  Cooke went from first to third, Jeff Bishop from third to seventh and Jeff  Whiteford from eighth to second.  </P> <P> Jack Cox and Jade Freeman remained in the fourth and fifth positions.  </P> <P> The result: The Antelopes banged out 16 hits and a 13-12 victory over Saugus.  </P> <P> "Ever since that game, we've been on a roll," Van Cheri said.  </P> <P> Heading into Tuesday's game, the Antelopes had batted .364 (78 for 214) during  the stretch and had raised their average to .310.  </P> <P> Some individual averages: Cooke .429 (27 for 63); Freeman .385 (20 for 52);  Whiteford .381 (16 for 42); Eberhardt .304 (17 for 56).  </P> <P> Pitching: Hart senior left-hander Andrew Lorraine turned in perhaps the finest  performance of his career last Friday, hurling a two-hitter with 15 strikeouts  in a 5-0 Foothill League win over Burroughs.  </P> <P> Lorraine, who has committed to Stanford, made only 97 pitches and allowed just  two singles. He began with four perfect innings before yielding an infield  single to begin the fifth.  </P> <P> Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield, Birmingham's righty-lefty starting rotation,  have thrown 17 complete games between them. Brown (10-2), a senior, leads  region players with 10 and Mansfield (3-3) has seven.  </P> <P> North Hollywood's Erik Martinez has not allowed an earned run in his last 25  innings and has pitched back-to-back shutouts, a 1-0 win over San Pedro and a  one-hit, 7-0, Valley Pac-8 Conference win over Monroe.  </P></p>

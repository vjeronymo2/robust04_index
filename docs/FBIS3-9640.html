			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mihai Mihailescu editorial: "To the Ballot, Folks"] </F>   [Text] Indeed, the modern government party wants, from the  bottom of its heart, "to bring about change, provided everything  stays the same..." [quote from playwright Ion Luca Caragiale].  The rulers do not accept that the time has come for them to  either retire or reform. They are clinging to power for the  sake of being able to do their deals while they enjoy immunity  and for the sake of power in itself.    The ruling party is at the stage of total failure: Failure  at the national level, through a disastrous government; failure  in the negotiations with its satellites, which want to partake  in the government, but the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR] realizes that, if it ever allows this to happen, it will  be submitted to huge pressure from abroad; failure in the  negotiations with the opposition, because the PDSR does not want  to make any concessions and, as usual, it is not playing fairly  (How serious can a political partner be, when it reshuffles the  government at the Cotroceni Presidential Palace while it is  engaged in negotiations with other parties for a new government  formula?); and failure in its own strategy, since it cannot even  reform itself for the sake of appearances.    In this situation, it is hard to avoid a collapse into total  parliamentary incoherence. The satellite parties may withdraw  their support for the ruling party or a group might split from  the PDSR. Anyhow, if any of this were to happen, the legislative  branch will enter into a conflict with the current government  and government program. It becomes increasingly more clear that  we will have early elections, which the PDSR fears so much.    In the case of elections, the confrontation will be between  several political forces represented in Parliament. The  extraparliamentary parties, except for the National Liberal  Party [PNL], have been left only with their names. An analysis  of the likely political spectrum of the future does not reveal  any spectacular developments.    The Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR] has taken  its  leave from a political position of rank. It tried to save  itself through a merger with the Romanian National Unity Party  [PUNR], which was a rather poor move per se, as the PUNR is  going downhill. Nothing will probably be left of the PDAR in  Parliament, other than the picturesque presence of [PDAR  President] Surdu, who will run on other electoral lists.    The Greater Romania Party [PRM] can only rely on the readers  of ROMANIA MARE, whose number has obviously decreased. This  party will find it hard to win enough votes for another  parliamentary representation, unless it allies itself with other  political groupings.    The PUNR is moving toward a fiasco. What damaged it a lot  was its bombastic jingoist attitude, unsupported by a coherent  program, and, of course, the Caritas affair. The replacement of  some of its eccentric leaders might save it, to a certain extent.    We do not believe that the popularity of the Socialist Party  of Labor [PSM] is growing at such a dizzying pace, as it claims.  However, it has managed to secure for itself a certain segment  of the electorate. It might start growing if the party  renounces [PSM President] Ilie Verdet and other leaders from the  old guard, and if [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu's temper  could be somehow restrained and his skills at organizing an  electoral campaign properly exploited.    The Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] is  relatively stable. Some of its electorate -- although not too  large a part of it -- might nevertheless be drawn (by force)  toward the ruling party. Anyhow, the PD(FSN) cuts quite a  sympathetic figure, thanks to its able and young leaders.    The PDSR is right when it fears the elections, since it is  burdened by the catastrophic Vacaroiu governance.  Theoretically, President Iliescu cannot interfere and support  this party. We are sure that he will do so anyway; but, even  so, he cannot help much, since he himself is registering a  decrease in popularity.    The grouping best situated for the elections is the  Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. The people want change,  even though they do not hope for miracles, and they perceive the  CDR as the political force capable of making this change. One  should also not forget the personality of Coposu [president of  the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, PNTCD], which  is increasingly winning over the electorate.    As one can see, the major confrontation will be between the  PDSR and the CDR. Of course, the PDSR will employ all its  battle arsenal -- promises, threats, unfair electoral campaign,  and particularly fraud -- since it is the ruling party that will  organize the elections. In this respect, the CDR should take  protective measures and not rest on its laurels before it has  them.    Maybe the ruling party will realize at the last moment the  extent of the damage that early elections at this time might  cause, given the general misery prevailing in the country.  Hopefully, it will engage in serious negotiations for a change  that cannot be delayed any more. Otherwise, to the ballot,  folks! Unless, of course, we are so hungry that we are going to  faint on our way to the voting stations....</p>

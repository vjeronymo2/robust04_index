			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY SATISFIED WITH ANTI-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT;  </P> <P> AVALON LETS TUNA CLUB OFF THE HOOK  </P> <P> Avalon city officials, after months of inquiry, have accepted assurances by the  all-male Tuna Club that the club does not discriminate against women.  </P> <P> At an Avalon City Council meeting attended by Tuna Club President Jim Martin  and other club members, City Atty. Michael Jenkins told the council that  letters to the city from the Tuna Club, most recently on June 9, had resolved  the issue.  </P> <P> In an interview, Jenkins said the city had requested assurances that the club  "will not discriminate in their membership policies, business practices and the  operation of their facilities. We asked them to affirm that that would be their  policy, and they have done that, and we are satisfied."  </P> <P> Jenkins said the club "has taken a position consistent with the position that  we asked them to take."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discrimination Statement  </P> <P> In a letter to the city March 14, Martin had said the club did not discriminate  "on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in its membership  policies and practices."  </P> <P> But city officials insisted that the club's nondiscrimination policy must also  extend to the operation of the facilities.  </P> <P> City Manager Chuck Prince said the June 9 letter "basically says uncle. It says  we assure you that we don't discriminate in our practices and in our  membership. The council and city officials felt that the letter was  satisfactory."  </P> <P> In the letter, Martin said that although the club's board of directors  considered the use of club facilities a private matter, the board had  nonetheless directed him to assure the city that the club "does not and will  not discriminate in the operation and utilization of the club facilities  (except for restrooms, shower rooms and changing rooms) on the basis of sex,  race, religion and national origin."  </P> <P> Martin was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Club Leases Building  </P> <P> The 91-year-old private sportfishing club, on Santa Catalina Island ocean-front  property, leases its facilities from the city for $4,800 a year under a 10-year  lease that expires in December.  </P> <P> The city's inquiry into the club's operation began last October, when City  Councilwoman Irene Strobel asked that the city investigate whether the club  restricted its membership to men and, if so, whether leasing publicly owned  land to such a group would violate state and federal laws.  </P> <P> In a series of letters sent to the city, club officials said the club does not  prohibit women from becoming members.  </P> <P> To join the club, prospective members must be nominated for associate  membership by a current member, club officials said. To advance to active  membership, an associate member must catch a fish exceeding a certain weight,  depending on the kind of fish.  </P> <P> The club has fewer than 200 members, most of whom live on the mainland, club  officials said. Some members maintain vacation homes on the island, officials  said.  </P> <P> Strobel said the city and the club had come a long way toward resolving the  issue but that she was concerned about how the city would monitor whether the  club restricted women.  </P> <P> "I guess I'm going to have to keep trucking forward on this," said Strobel, the  only female council member. "They have agreed not to discriminate, and that's  an important step forward. I'm hoping there will be a mechanism to allow the  city to monitor and enforce this nondiscrimination requirement."  </P> <P> Prince said the city would investigate any reports of sexual discrimination at  the club.  </P> <P> Club officials have notified the city of their intent to renew the lease for  another 10 years, Prince said.  </P> <P> Prince, Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith and Councilman Hal Host plan to meet with  club officials within the next few months to discuss the terms of the lease,  Prince said.  </P> <P> "We want to talk to them a little about the price, who maintains the club in  case it's damaged by a storm, and access, being open on a from time-to-time  basis for community groups and citizens to use," Prince said.  </P> <P> The white, New England-style building was heavily damaged in a storm in  January, 1988. Club members are paying for those repairs, a member said.  </P> <P> Strobel said the opening of club facilities for some city-sanctioned functions  would be a good-will gesture that would serve the community and the club.  </P></p>

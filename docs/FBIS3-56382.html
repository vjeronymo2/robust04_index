"This is a historic moment," he said at a news conference at  the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, noting that "Ukraine, along  with other states, is marching along the road of nuclear  disarmament."    In Kravchuk's opinion, the joint Russian-American-Ukrainian  agreement, signed in Moscow, on the withdrawal of nuclear  weapons from Ukraine gives it a guarantee of security and will  help to receive compensation in nuclear fuel.    The agreement will also help to step up economic relations  with other countries. The withdrawal of strategic nuclear  weapons from Ukraine is based on the Russian-Ukrainian treaty.    As for tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from the republic,  Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian experts will have to determine their  value, the Ukrainian president stressed.    Later, Ukraine will be compensated in the form of  subtraction  from Ukrainian debts to Russia for energy carriers.    Noting that Russian-Ukrainian relations were given a new  impetus, Kravchuk expressed confidence that the problem of the  Black Sea Fleet will be settled in 1994 and "then our countries  will have a good prospect for the future".    "In geopolitical respect, we have to live on this earth of  ours, and there is no other way out," the Ukrainian president  stressed.</p>

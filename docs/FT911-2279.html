			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: An alternate route in the paper chase - Why beverage carton manufacturers are claiming that recycling is not all it's cracked up to be Consumers throughout the world are discovering an interest in their dustbins. As the environmentalist wave gathers momentum, consumers from Adelaide to Anchorage are paying increasing attention to the domestic waste they produce and are peering into the smelly depths of their rubbish bins to discover what lurks within. Even though consumer rubbish represents only a small proportion of the total waste generated by modern industrial economies, it has become a high environmental and political priority because of its visibility and immediate connotations with a 'throw-away society'. Something must be done, the environmentally aware voters cry, and the politicians respond by introducing legislation to address the problem. Last month , for example, the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, passed a complex law drawn up by Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, to introduce a 'dual waste' system which forces industry to recycle rubbish. The system is known as 'dual waste' because industry has been charged with recovering from the consumer all waste materials that can be reused, while municipal authorities retain responsibility for collecting and disposing of the remaining rubbish. Products which have to be taken back and re-used by industry will be marked with a green dot. The law requires that this should apply to 65 per cent of all packaging by 1995. 'Sorting rubbish is suddenly becoming a more popular pastime than jogging,' says one rather jaundiced observer of the waste industry. The lead the Germans have taken with the dual waste system has rattled many in industry who fear that its philosophy may be reflected in the European Commission's packaging directive which is currently wending its way around the corridors of Brussels and is due to be published in the autumn. The logic for recycling seems compelling: it has been estimated that in the UK, for example, about 90 per cent of the packaging bought during an average family shopping trip goes straight into a landfill rubbish site after a single use. This is a waste not just of material but also of money: the costs of packaging Pounds 65 worth of grocery products amount to about Pounds 10. What could be more sensible than encouraging industry to re-use waste material as many times as possible? But some members of the paper and packaging industry fear that the obsessive interest in recycling could well lead to undesirable and self-defeating results. They argue that different packaging materials should be treated separately to ensure that their impact on the environment is minimal, particularly on a cradle-to-grave basis rather than just at the point of disposal. Take, for example, the case of beverage cartons, which are widely used for packaging milk, juices and soups. The environmental case against such forms of packaging is clear: they represent a wasteful use of raw materials - mainly paper and aluminium  - which when combined in six layers of packaging sheet, as is the case with the widely-used Tetra Brik Aseptic packaging, cannot be recycled easily. This has led to their being a prime target of environmental campaigners and has even resulted in some US states, such as Maine, banning them altogether. Rather than use such products, the environmentalists argue, it is far better to use refillable glass milk bottles or, as Migros, a big Swiss supermarket chain has done, to introduce lightweight polyethylene milk bags which can be slotted into a more robust re-usable plastic jug. The makers of beverage cartons have become increasingly alarmed at such arguments and, not surprisingly, have challenged the environmentalists' claims. The big suppliers and manufacturers of these cartons, including International Paper and Weyerhauser, of the US, Elopak, of Norway, Tetra Pak, of Sweden, and Enso-Gutzeit, of Finland, have formed the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment, which promotes their case. The alliance argues that its products, which are safe, lightweight and energy efficient, come out on top when its environmental effects are compared with other packaging systems on a life-cycle basis. Less energy is used to manufacture beverage cartons than other forms of packaging, the alliance claims, and less energy is also required to transport and store them. For instance, a one-litre beverage carton weighs less than 30g compared with 400g for a comparable glass container and because it can be stacked up easily accounts for only 5 per cent of the volume of a delivery compared with 40 per cent for other materials. Although this may not make a great difference in small countries, such as the Netherlands, it can have a profound implication in terms of costs and environmental effects in countries where goods have to be transported long distances, such as Sweden or Australia. The fact that beverage cartons can be hermetically sealed also counts in its favour, the alliance suggests, because this obviates the need to refrigerate products such as UHT milk, reduces wastage and prolongs shelf-life. The great problem with beverage cartons, however, is what can be done with them after use. The alliance has been investigating the possibilities and has come up with two solutions, although neither is wholly satisfactory. The first is to attempt to recycle the product. Tetra Pak, the Swedish liquid packaging group which sells 57bn cartons a year (which works out at more than 10 cartons for each inhabitant of the planet), has invested DM 2.5m (Pounds 845,000) in a recycling plant in Diez, Germany to investigate the technical and commercial possibilities. The theory is simple. The plant takes the polyethylene coated board used for cartons, shreds it into strips about 5mm long, spreads the strips on a metal plate and heats and presses them for about 10 minutes. The polyethylene in the strips acts as a binding agent allowing the material to be thermoformed. The end-product is a dense board that is waterproof, fire-resistant, and has good insulation properties. So far the company has investigated using the recycled material to replace chipboard in a number of options ranging from floor tiles, pallets, exhibition stands and loudspeaker boxes. Tetra Pak is also working with Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, to use the material in its furniture designs. Other companies in the alliance are investigating ways of repulping beverage cartons. In Canada and the US cartons are mixed with household plastics to produce plastic lumber which can be used to produce garden furniture, fence posts and road cones. The paper content in a carton can also be separated from the aluminium foil and polyethylene by applying hot water and can then be recycled as kitchen or toilet paper. Although the alliance points out that it is technically possible to recycle its cartons it questions whether it makes commercial sense to do so. The alliance does not believe in recycling purely for the sake of it and argues that recycling must be economically viable to ensure its long-term continuation. It is, as yet, far from clear whether companies could collect and re-use beverage cartons on a commercially viable scale. The other recycling option, which the alliance prefers, is to incinerate the used cartons to recover energy. Beverage cartons have a high energy content  -two tonnes of cartons have the equivalent energy value of one tonne of oil  -and the alliance suggest that beverage cartons could be used as a fuel for industrial boilers, cement kilns or generating plants. Beverage cartons can also be burnt as part of the general waste stream to provide energy to heat homes. One example of where this is done is at Sysav, the South West Scania Solid Waste Company, based in Malmo in Sweden. The company, which is owned by nine municipalities, collects 500,000 tonnes of waste a year. Roughly two-thirds of the waste comes from the region's industry and the rest is produced by its 455,000 inhabitants. The waste is sorted at source and recycled wherever feasible. But about 220,000 tonnes of waste is incinerated and the energy produced is supplied to the district's heating system and is sufficient to satisfy 25 per cent of the needs of Malmo city's 250,000 inhabitants. Although the Swedish government has greeted the system favourably some environmentalist groups and other European governments are still opposed to incineration, arguing that any gas emissions - even if they have been rigorously filtered as they are at Sysav - are undesirable. Incinerator waste is also highly toxic and difficult to dispose of safely in landfill sites, they say. Whatever arguments are advanced by both sides it is clear that there are no simple solutions to the problems of waste management. Evaluating the total environmental impact of various packaging products is an immensely complicated business; all life-cycle analyses are to some extent based on a set of subjective premises. Recycling offers no panacea. But ultimately it will be the market which resolves this dilemma. Consumers will have to evaluate which packaging materials represent the best solutions for them. They will have to decide whether they are prepared to use heavy refillable glass containers or flimsy polyethylene bags; or whether they opt for plastic packaging or cartons on the basis that the material is only marginally more damaging to the environment. In the process they will also determine which packaging solutions - and companies - survive. No wonder that the battle for the shoppers' hearts and minds is hotting up.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Of the 10 Bell-212 helicopters donated by the U.S.  State Department to the National Police for interdiction  operations against drug trafficking in the Peruvian jungle, five  are broken down in Pucallpa. National Police sources provided  this information. They indicated that antinarcotics operations  in the Upper Huallaga as well as in the mountain ranges of the  central jungle have been temporarily suspended because of a lack  of these helicopters.    Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said the  helicopters are a great help in transporting police personnel,  as land transportation is very difficult in the jungle due to  ambushes by narcoterrorists. A spokesman for the National Police  said that despite this inconvenience, operations are carried  out, but not as many.</p>

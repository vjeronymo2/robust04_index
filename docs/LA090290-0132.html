			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FARRAKHAN RAPS BUSH ON OIL INTERESTS  </P> <P> Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan equated President George Bush with a  "warlord" Saturday, saying that the "vital interest" and reason for the U.S.  presence in the Middle East was oil.  </P> <P> Farrakhan, speaking to reporters at a press conference in San Diego, said he  hopes it is not "the intent of Mr. Bush and the warlords to destroy Saddam  Hussein."  </P> <P> The outspoken Chicago-based minister said the deployment of more than 50,000  U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia could present that country with long-term social  problems because Muslims worldwide are afraid that Western values could replace  Saudi mores and laws, which are derived from the Koran.  </P> <P> "The Muslim worry is that the American lifestyle will change Saudi (Arabia)  forever," he said.  </P> <P> "I am a Muslim and I do not want to see Saudi Arabia turned into a bloody  battleground," he added.  </P> <P> He said he would withhold further comment on the U.S. deployment to the Middle  East until after returning from a visit to Saudi Arabia, which begins in a few  days.  </P> <P> Farrakhan, who preaches the teachings of the late Elijah Muhammad, began the  press conference with remarks about the violence among blacks in America's  inner cities -- "black on black" violence.  </P> <P> "Although black people account for 12% of the population," he said, "they  account for more than 50% of (murder victims)."  </P> <P> "Black leaders, black teachers, and black politicians have to be concerned  about this," he said.  </P> <P> He said he has figures that show more blacks will be killed in inner-city  violence in the next two years than the entire number of blacks who died in  Vietnam during a nine-year period there.  </P> <P> He also said that while a white man in America stands a 1 in 186 chance of  being murdered in a lifetime, the corresponding figure for a black male is 1 in  21.  </P> <P> Calling it "fratricide,"LAT  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORTS TEST FOR SENIOR DISCOUNTS  </P> <P> In reference to the Torrance user fee services article (Times, Feb. 10.), I am  a strong believer in the 100% individual fee-for-service concept. Some examples  are the utilization of national parks, private aviation and boating, etc. Also  a surcharge should be assessed for excessive library use. In regard to senior  discounts, I heartily approve of those by private enterprises, such as coffee  shops, restaurants, beauty and barber shops, etc. However, for public  facilities, such as adult education, there should be a means test similar to  those for school lunches. I question the 50% discount for affluent seniors over  the age of 62 1/2 years old, provided by the Torrance Unified School District  for Adult Education. Similarly, after observing many expensive autos parked at  surplus cheese distribution locations, a means test should be applied. I  (would) rather see this surplus cheese given to the poor and homeless.  </P> <P> JIM NISHIZAKA  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

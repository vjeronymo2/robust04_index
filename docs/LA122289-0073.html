			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION CHANGE IN CARSON IS DEFEATED  </P> <P> An attempt by Carson Councilwoman Vera Robles DeWitt to have the council  elected by districts and the mayor elected by voters fell flat this week, but  not before accusations of self-interest and spite enlivened an otherwise  routine council meeting.  </P> <P> DeWitt, who wanted the issue put before voters in the April 10 municipal  election, said at-large elections have been successfully challenged elsewhere  as discriminatory against minorities and that district elections would cut the  cost of campaigning, reducing the need "to rely on special interests to finance  campaigns."  </P> <P> Her motion to have city staff prepare the ballot measure died without a second,  but several residents and council members commented on the proposal.  </P> <P> Mayor Michael Mitoma countered one of DeWitt's arguments by saying that the  two-man, three-woman council, which is composed of a black, two Anglos, an  Asian and a Latina, already is balanced ethnically.  </P> <P> Carson resident Roy Goodson accused DeWitt of sponsoring the move because she  is "a little perturbed" that she was not elected mayor by the council early  this year.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Sylvia Muise disputed DeWitt's statement that $25,000 is needed to  campaign in Carson. Muise said she had spent $2,000 in her first campaign and  $14,000 in her second.  </P> <P> DeWitt retorted that Muise had needed more funds the second time "because you  were under investigation" for allegedly concealing campaign funds.  </P> <P> Muise heatedly responded, "In 1978, I reported money inaccurately. I didn't  hide it. I called the (district attorney) myself. Ignorance is no excuse, but I  did not know the law." George Stein  </P></p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Venables: the questions - Former Spurs boss Terry Venables is a leading candidate to take over as England's football manager. Martin Bashir and Mark Killick raise disturbing concerns over his business dealings Mr Terry Venables, the controversial former chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, stands on the verge of the promised land. According to the headlines, he is about to become the next manager of England, the most important job in British football. He is the choice of much of the football establishment, the media and of fans desperate for success after England's ignominious exit from the world cup last year. But the delay in making the appointment indicates unease at Lancaster Gate, the home of the Football Association: Mr Venables may be a tainted man. Among other things, the FA has been considering allegations made four months ago by Panorama, the BBC current affairs programme. Panorama said that some of Mr Venables' business activities were 'unlawful' and that he had 'abused his position' at Tottenham Hotspur, one of Britain's top football clubs. While Mr Venables has threatened to sue Panorama, he has failed to deal with substantive charges made in the programme. Since the BBC investigation, there has been a number of additional charges made across the media. The charges might not matter if the England manager were responsible only for picking the team. In fact, he assists in scheduling matches, appoints coaching staff and is involved in commercial activities such as sponsorship. He is also England's most important football ambassador. As a result, there is pressure to choose someone whose reputation is beyond reproach. The task of reaching a judgment on Mr Venables has confused the football authorities. On the one hand, he is widely regarded as a first class, internationally-experienced coach. He is also available. On the other hand, there are the doubts about his business life. So far, Mr Venables has responded to the charges with general denials which leave questions unanswered. Sir Bert Millichip, the FA chairman, was quoted at the weekend as referring to Mr Venables' 'funny reputation'. Also, the fact that Mr Venables still has an unfair dismissal action pending against Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman of Spurs, raises the uncomfortable thought that the next England manager could be locked in litigation against the boss of a leading club. The most damaging allegation against Mr Venables concerns the way that he raised Pounds 1m to pay for part of his Pounds 3m stake in Spurs. Mr Venables, along with Mr Sugar, bought control of the club in June 1991. Prior to this buyout, Mr Venables was being paid Pounds 175,000 a year as manager of Spurs. He is not a rich man. Official documents show that Mr Venables had to borrow heavily to finance the deal - Pounds 2m from Norfina, a finance company, Pounds 250,000 as an unsecured loan from a friend and Pounds 750,000 'from his own resources'. A year later, he was in trouble with his loan repayments. A letter from Norfina in August 1992 pointed to outstanding interest payments of Pounds 36,301.37 and threatened to call the loan into default, demanding full immediate payment. But the most searching questions surround the Pounds 1m Mr Venables raised from Landhurst Leasing, a company which went bust, also in August 1992 and which is now the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. This deal appears to have involved Mr Venables pledging assets of another company of which he was once a director, Transatlantic Inns. Prior to its collapse in 1992, Transatlantic managed a handful of pubs. Its main assets were the premises' fixtures and fittings. Mr Venables, through his personal company Edennote, entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with Landhurst, in which he in effect 'sold' the pub fixtures in return for the Pounds 1m, and then leased the fixtures back, making regular payments to Landhurst. This type of deal allows a business to raise money against the value of its assets while continuing to use the assets to trade. A document signed by Mr Venables and two Landhurst directors on August 30 1991 confirmed the deal. The agreement names Edennote as the lessee and refers to an attached schedule of equipment. The schedule refers to 'all structural fixtures and fittings, bars, kitchen equipment, audio equipment, furniture and carpeting' from four pubs: Maceys in London, The Cock and Magpie in Epping, the Granby Tavern in Reading and the Miners in Claremount Road, Cardiff. An obvious point is that Pounds 1m is a large sum to set against some worn pub fittings, which a professional valuer has suggested were worth in the region of Pounds 100,000. Such valuation gaps, however, are not unknown in sale and leaseback, where the leasing company believes a business is trading well enough to meet its payment terms. What cannot be so easily explained is why the fourth pub on the list, the Miners in Cardiff, does not exist. Nor has an explanation been offered for the fact that, according to Transatlantic's accounts, filed at Companies House, Mr Venables resigned as a director of Transatlantic Inns on June 28 1991, two months before he entered into the transaction. Mr Colin Wright, a director of Transatlantic, said yesterday: 'We were horrified when we discovered that all of the assets of Transatlantic had been used by Mr Venables to raise a Pounds 1m loan. None of the directors of the company had authorised such a transaction. The implications were terrible for us. We could have been looking at a massive tax liability and to the outsider it could appear that we were involved in this deception, which we knew nothing about.' The cash, meanwhile, had gone into Edennote just six days before most of it was used to buy shares in Tottenham. To help the leaseback deal along, Landhurst was paid an arrangement fee by Edennote, and also received a perk. Mr Venables instructed Spurs' marketing department to provide Landhurst with a Pounds 20,000 executive box at Spurs, free for the entire season. Panorama tracked the flow of cash into and out of Edennote, using bookkeeping data prepared for the company, copies of which have been given to the programme. These show that the quarterly leaseback payments of Pounds 55,812.50 to Landhurst specified in the original lease document were made as agreed, for example on November 8 1991, and January 15 1992. Mr Venables has declined to be interviewed about these matters either by Panorama or the Financial Times. According to a letter from his solicitor, Burton Copeland, to the FT: 'It is neither right or appropriate for Mr Venables to enter into a detailed dialogue of matters that will, in due course, be fully ventilated before the court.' Mr Venables' solicitor did address in the letter, however, the question of the lease agreement on the pubs, with the comment: 'It is not accepted that Mr Venables signed the lease that you refer to as being dated August 30 1991.' However, a director of Landhurst at the time of the deal confirms that Mr Venables signed it and that the deal was a sale and leaseback undertaking of the kind outlined, based upon the assets of a number of pubs in which Mr Venables had an interest. A copy of the document is in Panorama's possession. The general picture painted appears clear. Mr Venables urgently needed cash to buy his shares in Spurs and he raised it, at best, without regard to legal niceties. Others familiar with the Landhurst transaction say that it was a deal based essentially upon personal trust between Mr Venables and Mr Ted Ball, the founder of Landhurst. Since the programme, the Inland Revenue has been examining Mr Venables' affairs. The Department of Trade and Industry has also expressed an interest in Edennote, though its concerns are wider than the lawfulness of the sale and leaseback deal. It has examined Mr Venables' offer documents for Tottenham Hotspur, in which Mr Venables claimed that Edennote 'will have equity of Pounds 1m' and that Pounds 750,000 would come 'from his own resources'. In fact, the Pounds 750,000 had been raised from the pubs deal and the company's file shows no record of any increase in its authorised share capital from the Pounds 12,500 at the time of the offer. Panorama's second tranche of business-related allegations revolved around Mr Venables' financial adviser, Mr Eddie Ashby. According to the programme, Mr Ashby used a venture capital company called Elite Europe to try to build an apparently wide-ranging business group. It was partly financed by money from companies in which Mr Venables had a significant interest, including Glenhope and Scribes West International, a club in Kensington, now the subject of a winding-up order. Mr Ashby prepared a balance sheet for Elite Europe, apparently showing assets of Pounds 597,000, and then used it to try to borrow substantial sums from at least two finance houses. This scheme failed when one of the companies featured in Elite's bid to raise funds realised its assets had been grossly overstated and promptly severed all contact with Elite. While Mr Venables had some knowledge of Mr Ashby's activities, it is not clear that he knew of Mr Ashby's ultimate plan. What Mr Venables indisputably did know was that Mr Ashby had been made bankrupt in 1992, with debts of Pounds 443,212. Mr Ashby also had 39 business failures to his name. Despite this, Mr Venables appointed him as Tottenham Hotspur's general manager shortly after the takeover and he remained in post until Mr Venables was dismissed. Mr Venables' persistent relationship with Mr Ashby has been a source of acute concern to some of those responsible for making the decision about the England managership. There has even been talk that Mr Venables could be offered the job, so long as he agrees to sever links with previous business associates. For many of England's long-suffering fans, Mr Venables' behaviour as a businessman is irrelevant. Some argue that his record as a soccer manager is unblemished. However, a number of serious questions have also been raised about his dealings within the game. Panorama examined the sale of Paul Gascoigne to the Italian club, Lazio. The selling process began in March 1991, some three months before Mr Venables and Mr Sugar bought Spurs. Mr Dennis Roach, a football agent, was employed to find a buyer and Lazio was persuaded to pay Pounds 6.7m for England's most talented player. But, during the FA Cup Final in May, Gascoigne suffered the worst injury of his career and the deal had to be renegotiated. Lazio still wanted Gascoigne, but not at the old figure. Negotiations recommenced and in early June revised terms began to take shape. On June 20 1991, one day before the Venables-Sugar takeover, Lazio's lawyers sent a fax to Spurs offering Pounds 5.5m for Gascoigne - the price at which the deal was ultimately done. The player signed for Lazio on August 1 and according to board minutes a payment of Pounds 27,500 was made to Roach for his services in the deal. However, Spurs paid a much larger sum, of Pounds 200,000, to Anglo European, a Swiss company, which acknowledges that it was only employed by the club from July 12, to assist Mr Venables in the negotiations. Mr Venables has admitted that Mr Gino Santin, a friend and London restaurant owner, helped in the transaction; Mr Santin has described himself as an employee of Anglo European. Panorama asked why Mr Venables persuaded the Spurs board to agree such a large payment when the deal appeared to be virtually complete. Mr Venables' solicitor told the Financial Times that the payment was made with the approval of the directors on the grounds that Mr Santin had 'given considerable value in the form of the services that he had rendered in connection with the transfer of Paul Gascoigne'. Mr Venables has also said in other press articles that Mr Santin was crucial in adding a number of valuable elements to the deal, apart from the price. These include the proceeds of interest payments on an escrow fund established during the negotiations and the proceeds from two Spurs-Lazio matches, including TV rights. A detailed inspection of the club's records, however, has revealed that the escrow account interest payments were agreed in May, the games in early June and Sky TV has confirmed that TV rights were negotiated directly with Mr Sugar. The programme also uncovered a number of payments that contravened Football Association rules. One invoice, for example, came from First Wave Management, an agency which lists a number of professional footballers as its clients. It sought Pounds 58,750 for 'the assistance in arranging a distribution and merchandising network on behalf of Tottenham Hotspur'. In reality, it has since been admitted by Mr Frank McLintock, the former Arsenal player who runs First Wave, that part of this payment was for assisting in the transfer of a player from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham. The FA stipulates that clubs should not pay agents for procuring players, but Mr Venables signed the invoice and it was paid in cash. Despite the seriousness of these allegations, Mr Venables remains the favourite to lead England out of the international wilderness. In narrow footballing terms, appointing him may be the correct decision. But the job of England manager demands more than just soccer skills and the FA has a responsibility to ensure the highest standards off, as well as on, the field. Unless Mr Venables can answer these outstanding questions, the FA may have no alternative but to rule him out of the game. The authors work for Panorama. Additional reporting by Bronwen Maddox.</p>

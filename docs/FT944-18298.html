			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Exchange of shares helps Arnault to rationalise Arnault and Associates, part of Mr Bernard Arnault's French luxury goods and retailing empire, yesterday took a further step in the rationalisation of the group's complex structure, announcing a share exchange for investors in Financiere Agache and Au Bon Marche, both members of the group. Under the terms of the offer, Arnault and Associates has offered minority shareholders of Financiere Agache one share in LVMH and one share in Dior, the fashion group. Separately, Financiere Agache is proposing that Au Bon Marche shareholders exchange four of their shares for five Dior shares and two LVMH shares. Both Financiere Agache and Dior are part of the LVMH empire, which spans luggage, Cognac and champagne. Arnault and Associates, a subsidiary of LVMH, is one of the companies through which Mr Arnault controls the group. Mr Arnault said the aim of the exchange was to simplify the legal structures of the group, while giving minority shareholders of Financiere Agache and Au Bon Marche direct access to LVMH and Dior, which are both listed on the Paris bourse. He said the offer would be submitted to the market authorities for approval by Lazard Freres, Cie and Credit Lyonnais.</p>

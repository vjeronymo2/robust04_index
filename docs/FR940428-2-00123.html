(``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposal to amend Exchange Rule 4.18, ``Prevention of Misuse of Material, Nonpublic Information,'' to provide that a CBOE member who is a lessor of a membership and is not registered, not required to register, as a broker-dealer under section 15 of the Act, is not subject to the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting the misuse of material, non-public information. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On April 11, 1994, the CBOE submitted a letter indicating that the exemption from CBOE Rule 4.18 would not apply to a broker-dealer once the member is registered as a broker-dealer. Since the exemption ceases to apply once the member is registered or required to register as a broker-dealer, there should be no gap in the application of CBOE Rule 4.18 after the member is required to register as a broker-dealer. See Letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite, to Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, dated April 7, 1994 (``April 7 Letter''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33425 (January 5, 1994), 59 FR 1573. No comments were received on the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, CBOE Rule 4.18 requires every CBOE member to ``establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of such member's business, to prevent the misuse, in violation of the Act and Exchange Rules, of material, nonpublic information by such member or persons associated with such member.'' The CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership, and who is not registered as a broker-dealer or required to be registered, and who performs no other function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting the misuse of material, non-public information. The Exchange believes that lessor members that do not conduct any securities business in respect of their membership, and, as a result, are not required to register as broker-dealers under Section 15 of the Act, should not be subject to the written policy and procedure requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18. Accordingly, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 4.18 to clarify that members who perform no function in respect to their membership except as lessors, and that are not otherwise required to register as broker-dealers under the Act, do not have to establish, maintain or enforce written policies and procedures precluding the misuse of non-public information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest by eliminating unnecessary costs and burdens without impairing the CBOE's capacity to meet the requirements of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5) <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposal will benefit CBOE members who are lessors of memberships and who are not registered or required to register as broker-dealers under the Act by eliminating the costs and burdens of establishing the procedures required under CBOE Rule 4.18. The Commission agrees with the CBOE's assertion that lessor members who do not conduct any securities business in respect of their membership and who are not required to register as broker-dealers under the Act should not be subject to the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18, which are meaningful only to an ongoing securities business. Because such lessor members, unlike other members involved in the securities business, are not likely to receive material, nonpublic information from their limited role as a lessor of a CBOE membership, the Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal is a reasonable effort by the Exchange to eliminate an unnecessary burden for lessor members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the existing language of CBOE Rule 4.18, which requires members to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies ``taking into consideration the nature of such member's business. .&blank;.&blank;.'' Since CBOE Rule 4.18 is intended to require members to adopt procedures to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information, it is consistent with CBOE Rule 4.18 for the CBOE to exempt from the rule's requirements lessor members who are not involved in the securities business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the CBOE's proposal should not compromise the effectiveness of Exchange Rule 4.18. Specifically, the Commission notes that the exemption from the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18 applies solely to lessor members who are not registered, or required to register, as broker-dealers under the Act. If a member is required to register as a broker-dealer, then he must immediately establish the procedures required under CBOE Rule 4.18. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See April 7 Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;58) is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10091 Filed 4&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

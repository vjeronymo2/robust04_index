			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Export award goes to textile machine group Bonas Machine Company, a textile machinery manufacturer in north-east England, last night won the first NatWest/FT Exporter award for export excellence. The company beat six other finalists, including Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, the former ICI drugs business. Bonas, founded in 1957, is based at Team Valley, Gateshead, and has offices in Charlotte in the US, Hong Kong, Bombay, Frankfurt and Milan. It makes electronic jacquards - devices attached to looms that enable figures to be woven into fabrics. With 383 employees worldwide, it exports to more than 75 countries, but particularly to the US, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Italy and India. About 90 per cent of its Pounds 35m annual turnover is exported. The competition was organised by National Westminster Bank, the Financial Times and the Institute of Export. Winners of regional heats were announced at forums in London, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle during the last eight weeks. Unlike most other export awards, neither the size of a company's export order book nor rapid growth in foreign markets were necessarily qualifications to win. 'The excellence awards were designed to test exporting philosophy and ethos in depth, rather than just acknowledge turnover and profit,' said Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export and chairman of the judges. 'Bonas demonstrated extensive customer contact, new product introduction, staff training and an attempt to raise standards year on year.' Independent assessors from the Institute of Export, NatWest and KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, rated the finalists on efficiency, innovation, training, quality control, and whether exporting was part of each company's main thrust, rather than a bolt-on function. This enabled very small companies such as Magstim - which makes medical instruments in Dyfed, South Wales, and has only a Pounds 1m turnover - to compete with Zeneca, the north-west winner, and Richardson Sheffield, the kitchen knife manufacturer with annual sales of more than Pounds 25m. Valpar Industrial of Bangor, County Down, the Northern Ireland winner, turns over only Pounds 3m, selling a cooling system for beverages such as lager, beer or cola, between store-room and tap. The other two finalists were Apollo Fire Detectors, the Hampshire-based London regional winner, and Staffordshire Tableware, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of mugs, which won the Midlands prize. Bonas received its award at a dinner in London last night from Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, and Mr David Bell, chief executive of the FT.</p>

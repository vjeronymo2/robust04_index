Cavello claims that it owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in offshore Texas state waters to a point onshore. Cavallo seeks a declaratory order holding that the facilities meet the physical criteria for determining gathering and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the NGA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of its claim that the primary function of the proposed facility is gathering, Cavallo points out the following: (1) the length and diameter (16.4 miles of 20-inch and 21.3 miles of 16-inch) are comparable to other offshore lines previously determined to be gathering, (2) the system lacks compression because it relies on wellhead pressure to move the gas, (3) there is no central point in the field given the nature of the offshore operations, (4) location of the wells are in the producing area and the lines are designed to gather gas from the platforms to the nearest pipeline, and (5) the geographic configuration of the line is an inverted ``Y''. Finally, Cavello states that its facilities are very similar to other facilities that the Commission has found to be gathering facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make a protest with reference to said petition should, on or before December 1, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, D.C. 20426) a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bears rule in latest BT sale - But the ursine share shop symbol could be misleading POTENTIAL investors in the imminent sale of the government's third tranche of British Telecommunications stock may find its share shop symbol a little ominous: a bear is clutching the prospectus, with a bull nestling behind. Certainly, the public must be made aware that the market for shares goes down as well as up - hence the need for the services of the stock market's two best-known animals. It is just unfortunate, according to one broker acting in the sale, that the bear appears to be in a dominating position. SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator for the issue, intends to make sure the bull comes out on top. Warburg aims to prevent any institutions from trying to depress the share price before the offer. To ensure a stable market after the sale, it is prepared to buy back BT shares if there is a need to stabilise the price. The biggest advertising campaign so far to sell BT shares will start on May 25 and dealing will follow in mid-July. The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its remaining 22 per cent stake in BT - worth more than Pounds 5bn at present prices. As in previous offers, the shares will be sold in partly-paid form, with investors settling their bills by instalments. While only eight retailers were selected in 1991 when the second tranche in BT was sold, more than 150 - including the big four clearing banks, building societies and stockbrokers - will be taking part in this year's initiative. Anyone interested in buying can still register with the share information office, along the lines of previous government privatisations. But there are two main advantages of registering with one of the share shops. First, if there is strong demand for shares, people applying through the shops will be given greater preference in allocation. Second, the shops are expected to send information on their products and services, which may include special cut-price deals, with the BT3 offer information. As part of the government's initiative to widen and deepen share ownership, ministers are hoping the share shop symbol will outlive the BT3 offer. It is by no means certain they will succeed. The National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog, raised doubts recently about whether the government's special efforts in BT2 to boost the number of long-term small investors had worked. The NAO reached no judgment on the success of the share shop scheme - intended to make it easier for small investors to deal - beyond noting that 59 per cent of the shops' transactions in the three-month special dealing period after the sale were on behalf of individuals disposing of BT shares.</p>

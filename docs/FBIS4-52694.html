			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Naoko Iwasaki, economic reporter: "Themes of </F> Budget Compilation"]  <H5>  [9 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>   [Text] Need Bold Rethinking of Allocations; More  Clear-Cut Reflection of Policy    The fiscal 1994 draft budget has been submitted to the  Diet and deliberations on it have started. The coalition parties  have hyped it as "a challenge to create a new policymaking  system" (Policy Deliberation Council Chairman Nobuyuki Sekiyama,  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]); but the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] criticizes it as "having merely  strengthened bureaucratic leadership." Here we will try looking  into the topic of how the budget is created on behalf of the  public.  <H5>  Solidarity Within Ruling Parties </H5>   In the LDP era, each subsection of the Policy Affairs  Research Council had solidarity with each ministry and agency.  They listened to the wishes of business circles and sometimes  put pressure on the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. The coalition  parties hold that such an arrangement lent power to "zoku  [special-interest] Diet members" and are focusing power in  policy planning board. Specifically, they created budget  working groups with a member from each of the five party  factions and built a new system for also drawing out the views  of each ministry and agency.    Yet, at the same time, taking a cue from the LDP, each of  the  ruling parties has also tried expanding such subcommittees as  their agricultural and forestry subcommittees. As the linkages  between policy planning board and these subcommittees were not  made clear, complaints were heard from ministries, agencies and  business circles such as that "right to the end, we did not  understand well" where the shortcuts were for closely linking up  to have our wishes heard or to collect data.    The confusion might have weakened the collusion of  "politicians-bureaucrats-business sectors" some, but the  mechanism for putting together the appeals and wishes of  pressure groups that are one expression of the popular will also  has weakened. In short, budget allocations are almost entirely  entrusted to adjustments between the MOF and the ministries and  agencies making requests.    To block the creation of zoku Diet members, other ways can  be  devised such as preventing Diet members staying in one field  many years. In the future, in order to form solidarity within  the coalition government, the government should establish a  system that Diet members study at each party's subcommittees,  and based on that information, the coalition government reflect  its ideas in the budget at the policy planning board.  <H5>  Fences of Ministries and Agencies </H5>   In the fiscal 1994 draft budget they have somewhat altered  the allocation ratios for public works, cut back on slim  subsidies and to some degree promoted the transfer of subsidized  projects to the provinces. Such changes are in line with trends  from the era of LDP regimes and may be said to have been  somewhat expanded in the adjustments between the MOF and the  ministries and agencies making requests.    Nevertheless, what is called for hereafter are such bold  policy changes as terminating ongoing projects and advancing the  fusing and abolition of bureaucratic structures. As it is quite  impossible to push this forward through coordination among the  ministries and agencies, it will become the turn for politics.    In the budget draft, insurance rates for things like welfare  pensions are set to be raised; however, there was little debate  from the standpoint of the public burden matching that to taxes.  If, for example, meshing with tax increases and cuts, the higher  tax receipts are shunted into the national treasury's  obligations for pensions, increases in insurance rates could be  reduced. It is a political task to go beyond frameworks such as  pensions in the Ministry of Health and Welfare and taxes in the  FOM and to consider the overall burden on the public.    With allocations for public works, too, is there something  inevitable about having such beach maintenance projects as  shore-protection work divided up at almost the same allocation  rate among the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Agriculture  and Forestry, and the Ministry of Transport? Political  judgments are a necessity also in rethinking budget allocations  transcending ministries and agencies.  <H5>  Ceilings </H5>   Estimated request standards (ceilings) set in about July in  normal years (August in the case of the fiscal 1994 budget) are  what fix the framework for raising or cutting each ministry's or  agency's prior year budget rates. Setting upper limits on  budgets for the sake of fiscal rebuilding has served to give a  priority ordering to policies for the bureaucracy, but also has  had the bad effect of bolstering the sense of each ministry and  agency being on a par. Also, because of emphasis on early timing  rather than on the compilation itself, this becomes a cause for  budgets being unable to respond to change in economic conditions.    In contrast to this time, in facing the fiscal 1995 budget  compilation, the coalition regime has time to consider the needs  of this system. If these are to be kept as goals for the rough  estimate requests of each ministry and agency, it is conceivable  that--with some easing up--they will make judgments on degrees  of priority and business climate trends and will even do much  trimming.    For fiscal 1994, one day before the MOF's draft, the Fiscal  System Council (finance minister's consultative body) reported  its "rationalization policy for cutting outlays"; and the day  the draft came out, the cabinet decided on a course for budget  compilation. Such indicators, however, turned out to have come  along too late and were severely gutted. Such plans should be  accelerated and made to reflect actual compilation operations.  <H5>  [10 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>   [Text] More Effort To Supply Data; Boldly Rethink  Plans Also    Wiping the slate clean on the "national welfare tax"  concept which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had announced was  partly a result of the fact that data had not been adequately  provided on welfare and the burdens of an aging society. This is  a classic example, and even while the socioeconomic situation  surrounding finance and budgeting is becoming ever more complex,  the bureaucracies, starting with the fiscal authorities, have  been slow to show their intention.  <H5>  Intermediate Processes </H5>   As one focus of the fiscal 1994 draft budget, one can  mention  that growth in the initial sum relative to the past fiscal year  was held to a 34-year low of 0.9 percent. Although the MOF had  raised a trial balloon in the opening skirmishes with its  observation that "reductions are even possible," the self  defense agency had countered that an estimate request amounting  to a 1.95 percent increase was its limit since personnel costs  and payments on out-year obligations would consume some 80  percent.    That much was the overt tug of war, but according to persons  involved, the two agencies were negotiating while running trial  calculations on multiple cases, at growth rates of nearly zero,  1 percent, and so on. Not only with defense funds, but also in  many other instances, concrete discussion are often carried out  below the surface.    Not merely in formalized restoration negotiations but at all  times the cabinet is having debates so that the process up to  the point of decision has more persuasiveness in being visible.  <H5>  Options </H5>   The "welfare vision" that came under discussion over the  issue of raising or cutting taxes is said to be drawn up soon by  the Ministry of Health and Welfare and MOF, and they will lay  out national obligation rates through fiscal year 2025. Such  midterm and long-term planning and trial calculations change  greatly depending on what postulations are made. Annual  expenditures totally change according to the policy options.    Social security burden rates under the national burden rate  have been worked into future estimates by revising the pension  system this time, and tax burden rates will be calculated based  on things such as a set rate of growth, premised on the present  tax system.    It is good to have a number of trial estimates setting  several premises for the burdens and the benefits. For example,  such items would be worked in as circumstances altering the  ratio of the national treasury's burden for medical costs and  pensions, situations raising the current consumption tax, and  highs and lows in future economic growth.    The bureaucracy is negative about premising such things as  undecided policies or growth rates conflicting with present  perspectives. However, if the supply of data for broadening the  range of options is inadequate, it is criticized as "arbitrary,'  as it was with the national welfare tax concept.  <H5>  Midterm Planning </H5>   It is not that there were no changes whatsoever in positions  on compiling the fiscal 1994 budget. It was unusual for  standards for rethinking allocations for public works to emerge  at midpoint in the form of a report of the Fiscal System Council  (finance minister's advisory body).    Also, the same council's study objects had been only the  issues wrapped up in the budget compilation at hand; however,  this time it took up as a midterm item for deliberation the  disposition of the obligations of the Japanese National Railway  Settlement Corporation. Nevertheless, the outcome of the  deliberation did not go beyond stating, "Given the importance of  this matter, we should broadly seek the public's understanding."    For disposing of long-term bonds amounting to some 26  trillion yen, by fiscal year 1997 the sale of land and Japan  Railways stocks will be done and the burden of obligations  remaining at that time will be considered. Chances are high that  the state will take on most, in short making it a public burden.  So, the issue is merely being deferred.    As a sort of midterm financial plan, the MOF has its  `midterm  outlook" which it submits to the Diet each fiscal year; however,  it was this month that they decided even this would put off the  four-year-old goal for making the rate of dependence on  government bond issues (ratio of government bond issues to  general accounts revenue) within 5 percent. It has done nothing  but climb because of recession countermeasures and long has been  a "castle in the air."    Total national bond issues are forecast to exceed 200  trillion yen by the end of fiscal year 1994. Moreover, there is  the lending and borrowing across fiscal years called a "hidden  debt" and the National Railways' long-term bonds. The midterm  plans should be asked to say how these are to be handled. In  order to conform to the realities, they should be become bold  enough even to take the intermediate rethinking.</p>

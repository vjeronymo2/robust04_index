			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 2 May on  the nature and characteristic of the new diplomacy-security team  in the ROK Government and on the prospect of their policies.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word  article by reporter Kim Cha-su, under the headline, "What are  the contents of the policies to be implemented by the new  security team?" The article points out that the very "difficult"  impending problems facing the new diplomacy-security team are  the North Korean nuclear problem, the North Korean escapees from  logging sites in Siberia, and the important task of deciding  "the method and form" of North- South dialogue to be held in the  future. The article notes, however, that the government's  position is that it will not "unilaterally decide" the form of  dialogue, but will make the decision after "sounding out" North  Korean intent through the United States, which began holding  working-level contacts with North Korea in New York. The article  predicts that the issue to which the government will pay primary  attention to is the resumption of the North-South Joint Nuclear  Control Committee and to review the possibility of resuming  contact between delegates to North-South high-level talks.  Concerning the time of resuming dialogue, the government  stresses that the North Korean side should be the "first to  propose" dialogue because North-South dialogue should be resumed  without fail before a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks,  which North Korea "eagerly desires."    The article notes that the new diplomacy-security team will  review the issue of North Korean escapees from logging sites in  Russia wishing to defect to the South, adding that the  government will not decide "hastily" but will "calmly" resolve  the issue because the Russian Government complained over the  "hastiness" of the ROK Government and stressed appropriate  "legal procedure" be used in handling the loggers. Pointing to  North Korea's "strong rejection," the article notes that the  government decided to reveal its position to handle the issue of  North Korean loggers from the viewpoint of a "human rights  issue" of compatriots.    The new diplomacy-security team will work out "measures" to  cope with the North Korean proposal for changing the Armistice  Agreement into a peace agreement but, the article writes, the  government has had no "effective means" to counter such a  "propaganda offensive" by the North, except the principle of  solving the problem by "the parties concerned in the North and  the South." Thus, the team will again "intensively study" the  plan to "annul" the Armistice Agreement "after" building a peace  system according to the North- South Agreement, as well as other  issues that have been discussed within the government. It is  highly likely that to answer the people's comment that previous  policies on the North Korean nuclear issue and other diplomacy  and security-related issues "lack consistency," the new team  will "intensively review" means to make "one harmonized voice."    The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 2 a  1,600-word article by reporter Ko Tae-song entitled, "Prospect  for New Policies by Diplomacy-Security Team Headed by Deputy  Prime Minister Yi."    Describing new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku as a widely  recognized "expert in reunification and diplomatic affairs," the  article predicts "no drastic change" in the diplomatic and  security policy pursued by former Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok. The article, however, notes that there will be "some  changes" in details in implementation methods. The task  presently facing the team after withdrawal of the North-South  envoy exchange-first policy is the North Korean nuclear issue,  which is advancing in "a new direction." The article assumes  that the new team will "refrain" from "impulsive [kamjongchok]  means" in solving the North nuclear issue but will seek  "reasonable ways" that represent new Deputy Prime Minister Yi's  work style and that represent the position of Foreign Minister  Han. Observing that the new team will have to take "considerable  pains" in deciding "when" and "in what degree" it should propose  resumption of North-South dialogue in the course of dealing with  the North Korean nuclear problem, the article writes that new  Deputy Prime Minister Yi stressed "implementation" of the  North-South agreement and joint denulcearization declaration,  and notes his position expresses "the will" not to be  "alienated" from resolving the nuclear issue.    Another issue for the new team to deal with is "accepting"  the North Korean escapees from logging sites in Russia for  settlement in the ROK. The article predicts that the new team  will try to resolve this issue in a "quiet" manner without  "irritating" China, Russia, and North Korea by carefully  reviewing and discussing it with relevant government offices.  The new team will "effectively operate" the recently formulated  "Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council" in its  future endeavors.    The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 2 a  1,200-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon, under the  headline, "The new reunification-diplomacy team will seek  middle, moderate- progressive policy on North Korea." The  article notes that the new reunification-diplomacy team will  attach great importance to the "international cooperative  system" and "dialogue" in resolving the North Korean nuclear  issue, and stresses that the attempt to define the new security  team only as "conservative" or "progressive" is "unreasonable."  The article concludes that although key members of this team  have some personal preferences in playing their roles, the  team's overall "team work" will work effectively.</p>

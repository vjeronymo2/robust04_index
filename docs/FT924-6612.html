			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: CE Heath cuts dividend after decline to Pounds 8.9m CE HEATH, the insurance broker, has cut its interim dividend after announcing a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 8.9m for the six months to September 30 1992. The group was badly affected by the weakness of the dollar earlier this year, low interest rates and recession in the UK, which depressed demand for commercial insurance, explained Mr Michael Kier, chairman. Earnings per share were 7.6p compared with 12.1p. The interim dividend is reduced to 5p, compared with 7.5p last time. Mr Kier said the 'prudence dictated that the group pays a dividend which it can sustain from its operating cash flow.' He said the final dividend will not be less than 11p, making a total of 16p. Income from brokerage fees and commissions rose to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 46.1m), an increase of 11 per cent. Computer services generated income of Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 18.7m). But expenses were also higher at Pounds 74.2m and investment and other income fell to Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.7m). Mr Kier said London market non-marine broking, as well as UK corporate risks and wholesale operations had performed well, although lower business volumes had held back growth of UK retail operations. He attributed the higher expenses to the cost of starting new broking operations, such as the group's US wholesale network, and the costs of new head office accommodation at Houndsditch. Currency movements cost the group Pounds 1.2m. After adjusting for these factors brokerage increased by 14 per cent in underlying terms. Profit from underwriting amounted to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 6.9m). COMMENT After briefly dipping in early trading, Heath's share price rose sharply yesterday to close at 308p, a response indicating that investors had already anticipated a cut in the dividend. The markets appear to be impressed by management's determined focus on the core broking business, whose prospects seem reasonably good, especially now that exchange rates are moving in the group's favour. Nevertheless the UK recession, lower interest rates and the tightness of international reinsurance markets could dampen brokerage growth, while underlying continuing exposure to aviation liability claims via its Australian underwriting subsidiary, is also perceived as risk. Even so, the group is well on the way to recording full-year pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 24m and earnings per share of about 22p. On yesterday's closing price that gives a prospective p/e of 14. Heath seems relatively good value, especially in comparison to its bigger rivals, Willis and Sedgwick, both of which are on ratings of over 17.</p>

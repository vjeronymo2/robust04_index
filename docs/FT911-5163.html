			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: OFT extension for Coats bid The Director General of Fair Trading has extended its period of consideration of the proposed acquisition by Coats Viyella, of Tootal, the textile group, before deciding whether to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The OFT extended the period by 15 days to May 10. Tootal has rejected the hostile Pounds 194m offer, saying there was no 'compelling logic' and claiming that Coats was trying to buy Tootal on the cheap.</p>

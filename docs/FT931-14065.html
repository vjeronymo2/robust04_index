			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / JAL passes payout and warns of higher loss (261) JAPAN Airlines, which last week announced a radical restructuring programme aimed at reversing pre-tax losses, forecast at Y50bn (Dollars 398m) for the year ending March, yesterday announced that it would not be paying a dividend. The airline said it expected to make a parent company net loss of about Y40bn for 1992-93. In November, JAL warned that parent company net losses for this year would total Y29bn. JAL, which plans to cut investment by Y100bn and other costs by Y100bn in the coming year, said the rise in the net loss for the year was partly due to the cancellation of plans to sell securities and property due to weak asset prices. The airline made a pre-tax loss of Y6.4bn last year. It plans to cut back investment in new aircraft and hiring of ground staff. Under the restructuring plan announced last week, investment between 1993 and 1997 will be cut back from Y1,600bn to Y1,000bn. JAL and All Nippon Airways have applied for new routes to Italy and China, Reuter reports. JAL is seeking to operate two return flights a week on its own from Tokyo to Rome via Milan. It currently operates the Tokyo-Milan-Rome route jointly with Alitalia of Italy. All Nippon has applied to operate three weekly return flights between Tokyo and Shanghai. CHRYSLER, the the US car maker, expects fourth-quarter earnings to exceed Dollars 300m, according to a company share offer prospectus, AP-DJ reports.</p>

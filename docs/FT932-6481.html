			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Jobs end for 420 at Swan Hunter SOME 420 Swan Hunter employees, many of whom spent their entire working lives at the Tyneside shipbuilder, were made compulsorily redundant yesterday and left the yard without any immediate pay-off. Because the company is in receivership, they must apply to the Department of Employment for their pay-offs under the state redundancy fund, which pays a maximum Pounds 6,150. The department confirmed that payment is 'normally' made within 13 weeks. In addition they will receive up to 13 weeks' wages in lieu of notice, also delayed. Tyneside Labour MPs Mr Steve Byers (Wallsend) and Mr Nick Brown (Newcastle East) met the prime minister at Downing Street yesterday and stressed the need for Swans to be allowed to complete the three frigates it is outfitting. Afterwards Mr Byers said that the prime minister had listened carefully. 'I got the impression there's a recognition shipbuilding is crucial to the manufacturing and industrial base of the north-east,' he said.</p>

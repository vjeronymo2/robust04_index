			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Leyland Trucks to invest Pounds 25m in new range Dutch and UK truck companies created out of the collapse of the Daf group last year are increasing their profits and making a first significant investment in a new range. Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the UK truck maker rescued by a management buy-out last year, says it will spend Pounds 25m (Dollars 38.25m) to design and develop a medium-sized truck range to be built at its Leyland, Lancashire, headquarters. Most of the new vehicles will be for delivery to Daf Trucks, the Dutch truck maker also revived - with Dutch and Belgian government finance - from the Daf collapse. The UK company has a long-term contract with the revived Dutch manufacturer under which Daf Trucks sells and services all Leyland-produced trucks in Europe. The new truck range, to be called the 55 Series, will replace the Dutch-built Daf 1300 and 1700 vehicles, providing Leyland with its first-ever continental sales in the medium, 11-15 tonnes sector of the European truck market. The announcement came as Daf Trucks reported a net profit for the first half of Fl 39.2m (Dollars 22m) on turnover of Fl 924.2m. Daf in March reported a net profit of only Fl 10.8m in a truncated first financial year. Mr Cor Baan, Daf chairman, told a meeting of the company's 3,654 employees in Eindhoven that the results 'are in accordance with the general lines of the business plan and they also reflect the growing confidence in the company'. About a week ago Leyland Trucks' chief executive, Mr John Gilchrist, also reported that the UK company had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.4m for its first 11 months to end-April on a turnover of Pounds 148.6m. Daf delivered 7,282 trucks in the first half of the year; 4,607 from the Eindhoven plant and 2,675 comprising 45 Series vehicles from Leyland. Mr Baan said Daf had marginally increased its share of the European truck market over 6 tonnes to 6.8 per cent.</p>

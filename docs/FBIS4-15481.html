			<p>BFN     [Text] "With deep bitterness and indignation," Moscow  received the reports on the attack on Israeli citizens in the  city of 'Afula. "We harshly condemn this terrorist act, which  led to human victims and express our condolences to the families  of those killed," the head of the information and press  department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigory Karasin,  told a briefing in Moscow Thursday.    Karasin said "the event again raises the need to immediately  carry out the measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian  civilians in the occupied territories agreed on at the  Palestinian-Israeli talks."    "Russia proceeds from the fact that this terrorist act  should  not distract Palestinians and Israelis from their main goal,  this being to continue negotiations on the temporary  introduction of Palestinian self-government on the occupied  territories in accordance with the Declaration of Principles,"  Karasin was quoted as saying. "Once again, we call on both  sides to show the maximum restraint, self-control and political  will to achieve mutually acceptable agreements within the  framework of the Middle East peace process."</p>

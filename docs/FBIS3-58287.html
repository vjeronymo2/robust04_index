			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Back Door for East European </F> NATO Membership"]    [Text] Brussels, 9 Jan -- The formula Partnership for  Peace, which allows our East European neighboring states to  enter the NATO waiting room, has at least been accepted on this  side of the Oder and Neisse. It has never really been  controversial among the 16 Western member states that are  starting a summit in Brussels today. Not one of them presently  knows how the security needs of the East Europeans can be met in  a satisfactory manner. Thus, all rely on the old saying: Time  will tell.    However, some European allies believe (or are afraid) that  the problem concerning the alliance's expansion will worsen in  the United States because Congress is likely to reject  additional assistance guarantees. At this point, however, one  country -- France -- views itself as the winner of the current  discussion about the eastward expansion of the alliance. It  advocates the establishment of security links with the East  European states in a roundabout way: Once they are members of  the European Union, it would be possible for them to join the  Western European Union [WEU], a purely Western assistance pact.    German Defense Minister Ruehe hinted at the meeting of the  NATO planning committee four weeks ago -- was it furtively or  roguishly? -- that the West Europeans, the members of the  European Union at least, are not really free to decide whether  they want the East Europeans to be their allies or not.  Moreover, the West is not really seeking this option. Those  East Europeans to whom the European Union has opened up the  possibility of membership will be invited to actively  participate in the WEU. Once they are accepted by the European  Union, they are also entitled to become full members of the WEU,  an alliance that -- even if not formally -- is part of  European-American NATO.    From this perspective, the current discussion about NATO's  eastward expansion is a great deal of fuss about little. In  fact, British and French NATO officials occasionally voice their  unease. After all, their countries were dragged into World War  II through alliances with East Europe. At present, however,  these reminiscences are no longer very important. The large  states of the European Union, England, France, Italy, and  naturally Germany welcome the membership of the East European  states. Yet the United States is maneuvering itself into a  homemade dilemma, as some at the Brussels headquarters claim  with malicious joy and others with concern. In the long run,  Congress will not be able to reject additional assistance  guarantees for Europe. NATO and the position of the United  States as a world power would be undermined if the Europeans  should only belong to the WEU in the future. Thus, the  initiative would silently pass from the Atlantic parent company  to the European branch.    This would even be too much for the French, who have always  criticized the fact that the United States naturally plays the  major role within NATO. French security policy is also aimed at  keeping the United States in Europe. Yet the French are not  really sorry that Washington's seeming distance vis-a-vis the  old continent forces them once more to become active. They will  use this opportunity and raise their voices more often on  security issues than in the past, and they will passionately  advocate WEU membership for the East European states. Paris  welcomed the proposal by NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner  to grant the WEU access to NATO infrastructure through a task  force that is independent of the U.S. commander in chief. This  would make it possible for the Europeans to shine on the  security stage without the main U.S. actor, even though hoping  for Washington's blessing.    While respecting France's ambition, Ruehe and Foreign  Minister Kinkel would prefer both official and personal  commitment on the part of the United States. They know what  they are talking about: It was James Baker who integrated the  reunited Germany into NATO.</p>

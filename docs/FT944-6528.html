			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rodime losses deepen while US courts hold key to future Rodime, the Scottish disk drive pioneer whose business is the licensing of its 3.5 inch disk drive technology, has reported a sharp drop in revenue and a big increase in losses, while its future is heavily dependent on lawsuits awaiting judgment in the US. Losses before tax deepened from Dollars 2.14m to Dollars 7.02m (Pounds 4.28m) in the year to September 30, because of administrative costs associated with lawsuits. Rodime has increased its revolving credit with Bank of Scotland to Dollars 14m. The shares were unchanged at 11p yesterday, having peaked at 51 1/2 p earlier this year. Operating income amounted to Dollars 333,000, against Dollars 4.18m last year. Running royalty income fell because no new licence agreements were reached, and all existing agreements are with east Asian manufacturers whose business was reduced by intense US competition. Rodime suffered a setback in April when a Minnesota judge declared invalid certain claims in its principal disk drive patent in a suit with Quantum, the US disk drive maker. Rodime now hopes to hear within three to six months the outcome of its appeal, heard earlier this month by the court of appeals in Washington DC. If the appeal succeeds it will resume its action against Quantum. If Rodime loses, the case against Quantum would fail and the scope of infringement by other disk drive makers, including Seagate, would be materially reduced. Losses came out at 5 cents (1.9 cents) per share.</p>

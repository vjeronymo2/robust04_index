			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA'S PATCHWORK LINEUP FALLS TO TUSTIN  </P> <P> La Quinta High School's makeshift lineup was no match for top-seeded Tustin  Friday as the Tillers advanced to the semifinals for the second consecutive  year with a 6-2 victory in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 3-A  playoffs.  </P> <P> La Quinta played without pitcher Jon Korzen, who was suspended from school for  five days this week. Korzen's absence forced Coach Dan Demarest to move  freshman Ken Granger, the team's starting left fielder, to third base, where he  had played only four innings all season.  </P> <P> The results were predictable; La Quinta committed six errors, including two in  the decisive sixth inning when Tustin scored three unearned runs.  </P> <P> Afterward, Demarest didn't make any excuses for the loss.  </P> <P> "You can't say, 'I wonder what would have happened if we had Korzen,' " he  said. "You can sit here and go what if, what if, what if . . . all afternoon.  The bottom line is Tustin is a good team and deserved to win. They could go all  the way."  </P> <P> Tustin (25-3) took advantage of La Quinta's mistakes and used timely hitting to  complement the pitching of left-hander Dan Baker (14-1). Baker struck out six  of the first nine batters he faced and allowed four hits to gain his sixth  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> "He made some adjustments after losing to Newport Harbor and has put a little  more jump into his fastball," Tustin Coach Vince Brown said. "Usually, he  starts slowly and finishes strong, but today, he was just the opposite."  </P> <P> Tustin's hitters also started quickly. Catcher Ryan Relph gave the Tillers a  2-0 lead when he hit a two-run homer over the center-field fence in the third  inning. Tustin had at least one hit in every inning except the fourth and  finished with 11 hits.  </P> <P> La Quinta (21-9) cut the deficit to 2-1 when catcher Matt Logan's homered in  the fourth and then tied the score in the fifth after center fielder Chad Faltz  misplayed a single that rolled to the fence, allowing Granger to score.  </P> <P> La Quinta committed two errors in the fifth, which led to one run, and two in  the sixth, which led to three runs. Tustin third baseman Ben Strack's two-run  double in the sixth inning was the key hit.  </P> <P> "I was moving my infielders all around, and we stayed close for a while,"  Demarest said. "I had my closer (Jason Cherms) in there pitching in the third  inning and he did a great job. But sooner or later, things were bound to come  apart and they did."  </P> <P> Brown said the team's goal following a season-ending 7-2 loss to Kennedy at UC  Irvine last year was to return to the semifinals this season.  </P> <P> "We wanted to get back, and we're in that situation again," Brown said. "This  team has improved as the season progressed, and today, we took advantage of  their mistakes. We're getting better with every game."  </P></p>

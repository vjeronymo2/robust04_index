Nymeyer announced at this week's City Council meeting  that he will not seek reelection when his term expires next spring, nor will he  run for mayor.  </P> <P> But Nymeyer, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 65th  Assembly District this year, said he might run for office at the state or  federal level after legislative districts are reapportioned next year.  </P> <P> Nymeyer, 37, a church pastor, said that after eight years as a council member,  he no longer wants to spend the hours that the office demands. "I look forward  to some time with my family, which is growing up fast," he said.  </P></p>

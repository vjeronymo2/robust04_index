			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: Thinking on Ross Perot hard to understand Sir, It is surely of some interest that so many Americans seem to be rejecting all the established parties in favour of a 'maverick' and surely also reasonable to expect some enlightenment from the serious press. So I began reading your article on Ross Perot with some interest ('Trial by rabbit punch', June 27). I ended it wondering, not for the first time, why the liberal mind is so much harder to understand than ordinary Americans. Mr Perot is sneered at for 'frequently underwriting the missions of unsavoury soldiers of fortune to find Americans in Indochina'. What can possibly be objectionable if a private citizen finances attempts to discover some of his fellow citizens, despatched to a far country on military service, and apparently (according to your correspondent himself) abandoned there by the American government? What is 'unsavoury' about the people who do the dangerous work? I ask the questions seriously; the mind that counts this activity as something of which Mr Perot can be 'accused' is beyond ordinary sense. Later, Mr Perot is reported to have 'admitted delving into' a Republican plot about Iran in 1980 'to see if Mr Bush was personally involved'. Why does this count as an admission? If your correspondent had been delving and had found anything, it would be a scoop, but if it's Perot, something has been 'admitted'. Mr Perot is evidently a shock to the East Coast liberal establishment. Whether it can dispose of him as it did of President Nixon remains to be seen; as does whether Mr Perot is genuinely shocking or only a man of common sense. Either way, it is that liberal consensus that is really impenetrable. Ian Robinson, The Retreat, Rear 90 Bryn Road, Malvern Terrace, Brynmill, Swansea SAZ 0AS</p>

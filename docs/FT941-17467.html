			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Investors upbeat on US retail takeover Shares in Federated Department Stores rose by more than 10 per cent yesterday as Wall Street reacted favourably to its plan to take over troubled rival RH Macy through an unusual bankruptcy court manoeuvre involving the purchase of Macy's debt. Federated, with revenues of Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) annually, operates 219 stores, including the up-market Bloomingdale's chain, and a takeover of Macy's, best-known for its 111 stores of the same name, would create a retailing colossus with annual sales of more than Dollars 13bn and operations in most areas of the US. Macy's has been operating under so-called Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from its creditors since 1992 as it works on a plan of financial reorganisation. Federated, which itself emerged from bankruptcy protection last year, announced on Sunday that it had acquired for Dollars 449.3m half of Prudential Insurance Company of America's secured claim on Macy's. It has an option to buy the remaining 50 per cent within three years. The Prudential has been Macy's largest single creditor, and the deal therefore gives Federated a significant say in the outcome of the company's bankruptcy court reorganisation. Total claims against Macy's exceed Dollars 6bn. Federated said it had acquired the claim 'with the ultimate objective of working toward a combination of Federated and Macy's into a single, nationwide, multi-billion dollar department store operation, with the potential for greatly enhanced operating efficiencies'. It is extremely unusual for a company to try to take over another by acquiring its debt and pressing for a deal in bankruptcy court proceedings. Mr Allen Questrom, chairman of Federated, said that 'none know better than we that this will be a challenging process, with no guarantee that we will be successful in accomplishing anything more than having made a sound business investment'. However, the debt deal also puts it in a strong position to block any bid for Macy's from rival retail chains. To succeed with a bid, Federated will need the support of Macy's other leading creditors, such as the large fund management group Fidelity Investments, as well as the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case. Mr Myron Ullman, chairman of Macy's, said yesterday that it was still going ahead with its own reorganisation plans and 'it would be inappropriate at this juncture . . . to discuss with any particular creditor the role they would play in our reorganisation'. Shares in Federated closed at Dollars 23, up Dollars 2 1/4 , while Macy's bonds also rose significantly.</p>

For purposes of the preceding sentence, property means a debt instrument, stock, security, contract, commodity, or nonfunctional currency. But see &sect;1.988&hyph;2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the first date on which a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue is issued for traded property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other debt instruments_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an issue of debt instruments is not described in paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is determined as if the debt instrument were a separate issue.

Otherwise, the issue price of the debt instrument is its stated redemption price at maturity under section 1273(b)(4). See section 1274(c) and &sect;1.1274&hyph;1 to determine if section 1274 applies to a debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the date on which the debt instrument is issued for money or in a sale or exchange.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule for certain sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of determining the issue price and issue date of a debt instrument under this section, sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers are ignored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Traded on an established market (publicly traded)_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Property (including a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is traded on an established market for purposes of this section if, at any time during the 60-day period ending 30 days after the issue date, the property is described in paragraph (f)(2), (f)(3), (f)(4), or (f)(5) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exchange listed property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Property is described in this paragraph (f)(2) if it is listed on_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An interdealer quotation system sponsored by a national securities association registered under section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;3); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Limited, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, or any other foreign exchange or board of trade that is designated by the Commissioner in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Market traded property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Property is described in this paragraph (f)(3) if it is property of a kind that is traded either on a board of trade designated as a contract market by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission or on an interbank market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Property appearing on a quotation medium.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Property is described in this paragraph (f)(4) if it appears on a system of general circulation (including a computer listing disseminated to subscribing brokers, dealers, or traders) that provides a reasonable basis to determine fair market value by disseminating either recent price quotations (including rates, yields, or other pricing information) of one or more identified brokers, dealers, or traders or actual prices (including rates, yields, or other pricing information) of recent sales transactions (a quotation medium).

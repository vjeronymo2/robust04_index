			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most manufacturing facilities have in place central filtration systems designed to remove contaminants from and extend the life of water-soluble metal working fluids (e.g., lubricants and coolants), used in machining, grinding, and boring equipment. These filtration systems are on-site systems that filter chips, metal fines, dirt, water, and other contaminants from cutting fluids, drawing lubricants and coolants used in machining operations. The filtration of these extraneous materials is designed to extend the life of the reusable coolants and lubricants and is incidental to the production process. Today's rule clarifies that this type of filtration activity is not subject to the used oil processing standards when the generator reuses the filtered oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, during regularly scheduled maintenance of oil-bearing transformers and turbines, the oil in the electrical equipment is removed so that repairs/maintenance can be performed. In some instances, the oil is filtered prior to replacement. The filtering of the used oil is done to extend the life of the used oil, not because the oil is no longer useful, and is therefore ancillary to the equipment repair and maintenance. While, under today's rule, the owner or operator would not be considered a processor in these cases, the draining of the used oil from the transformer constitutes generation of used oil so that the facility would be considered a used oil generator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is aware that not all used transformer oil is drained and filtered in the field. Instead, the oil-bearing electrical equipment may be transported to a central location where the oil is removed, filtered, and replaced. Or, the used oil may be removed from the transformers or turbines in the field and then transported separately in a tanker truck to a central location where it is filtered and put back into electrical equipment. Under today's rule, in cases where electrical equipment containing used oil is transported to a central location, the transporter of the oil bearing electrical equipment would not be considered a used oil transporter. However, the owner or operator would become a generator at the point at which the used oil is drained from the equipment (i.e., at the site where the oil is drained and filtered).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases where the used oil is removed from the transformers or turbines in the field and then transported separately in a tanker truck to a central location for filtering prior to replacement into electrical equipment, the owner or operator would become a generator in the field (i.e., at the point at which the used oil is drained). The person who then transports the used oil would also be considered a used oil transporter subject to the transporter standards. In these cases, the location at which the used oil is filtered would be considered a used oil transfer facility subject to the transfer facility standards in &sect;279.45, provided that the used oil is stored at the site for more than 24 hours and less than 35 days. If the used oil is filtered within 24 hours of being drained (i.e., during transport) only the part 279 standards for used oil transporters would apply. This filtering activity should not raise the kind of environmental concerns that would be present at used oil processors; essentially, the filtering is incidental to the transportation and storage and should not change a facility's regulatory status. As discussed in more detail below, today's rule provides that transporters of used oil that is removed from electrical transformers and turbines and filtered by the transporter or at a transfer facility prior to being returned to the same use are not subject to the processor or re-refiner requirements in subpart F. In accordance with &sect;279.10(e), once the used oil has been reclaimed to the point where it is ready for reuse without further processing, it is not subject to regulation as used oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Separating used oil from wastewater to make wastewater acceptable for discharge or reuse. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Today's rule clarifies that oil/water separation activities designed to make wastewater acceptable for discharge or reuse are not subject to the used oil processor standards. Facilities often use oil/water separators to remove oil (which may contain used oil) from oil/water mixtures collected from the facility's storm sewer, process sewer, sumps and other wastewater containment areas. These separation systems use chemical and physical methods to break the oil/water emulsion and recover oil from the wastewater in order to make the wastewater or storm water acceptable for discharge or reuse in compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This type of pretreatment of wastewater containing oil is designed primarily to ensure that the wastewater meets established limits for water discharge to streams and POTWs, and not to produce used oil derived products or to make used oil more amenable for the production of used oil derived products. This type of oil/water separation activity is therefore not subject to the used oil processor standards as clarified under today's rule. It should be noted, however, that any used oil recovered from separator units would be subject to the used oil generator standards. It is also important to note that this provision applies only to used oil that is generated on-site. The provision would apply, for example, to simple oil water separation activities conducted (for purposes of wastewater discharge) by a used oil processor on wastewater which has been generated by that processor. However, persons who perform oil/water separation activities on oily wastewater received from off-site would be considered used oil processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

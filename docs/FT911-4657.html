			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: New York sets the pace for London THE LONDON stock market was content to follow New York's lead yesterday, and although the FT-SE Index rose sharply to close just below its all-time high, the mood was somewhat lethargic. Hints of an impending bid for a stock in the Footsie list, re-vitalised by fund-raising moves by Hanson and Roche Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, provided some impetus for gains in the blue chip internationals. However, there were worries that another large rights issue from a leading listed company could be pending. Trading volume was slow, however, particularly in the first couple of hours of the session when the big institutions usually dominate the market. Share prices were marked higher at the opening in response to Wall Street's gain of 54 Dow points overnight. In the absence of buying support the gains were soon more than halved, until London began to position itself ahead of the new Wall Street session, which was widely, and accurately, expected to open higher. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average just touching the 3,000 mark as London closed for the day, the FT-SE Index ended at 2,545 for a gain of 25.5, the best of the day, taking it to a mere 0.3 below the closing peak achieved on April 5. Seaq volume of 477.6m shares, while marginally better than Tuesday's 446m, was unexciting by recent standards. Data from the London Stock Exchange shows that on Monday retail interest in UK equities fell to 804m, the first session for some time in which the retail total had fallen below Pounds 1bn. UK economic news continued to discourage the equity market which has turned less confident on the near term outlook since the beginning of the second quarter of the year. The March Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 3.1bn, announced yesterday, was higher than expected in the City of London. Today will bring the latest numbers on UK unemployment and industrial production. Further consideration of the increase last month in UK manufactured goods also underlined concern in the market over domestic inflationary pressures. At Nomura Research Institute, which has been notably bullish on UK equities, the economics team yesterday warned that 'any further interest rate cuts will have to be reversed over the course of the next year'. It expects the fall in UK inflation to be reversed later this year and that sterling could weaken by the end of 1991. 'Indeed, after falling to 11 per cent in the summer, we expect base rates to return to 12 per cent by December.' At an investment strategy conference this week, however, Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, reiterated the firm's forecast that the Footsie will reach 3,000 by the year-end. He believes that Wall Street will be an important factor, although he also predicts an upturn in UK corporate earnings in the autumn, followed by real growth of earnings and dividends through 1992. Yesterday's gain in the Footsie Index reflected strong gains among Wall Street-influenced stocks, with BAT Industries, Reckitt &amp; Colman and Reuters all to the fore. Oil shares remained firm but a less certain trend in crude prices counterbalanced the effects of Wall Street's strength. Stock shortages inspired sharp gains among some consumer issues. In the banking sector National Westminster provided a strong feature at the close, dispelling some earlier nervousness regarding the results from the US arm of the bank.</p>

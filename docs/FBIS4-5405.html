			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 2329  GMT on 9 April, in its "News 2001" program, carries a live  20-minute interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe  by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Seiko Tomomi, political  commentator Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University professor  Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo.    Asked what he thinks of the opportunity for him to realize  the things written in his newly published book "New Conservative  Revolution," Watanabe says: "Of course, I do not think that  what I wrote in the book will be realized 100 percent." In  response to a question on whether he will run for prime minister  if asked by the ruling coalition, Watanabe says: "They have not  approached me as yet. The LDP has to do its best to regain  power. However, the best way for me is to have a comfortable  number of members of the Liberal Democratic Party support me."  He then explains the need and importance of finding coalition  members who share the same beliefs, rather than trying to find  as many partners as possible for the sake of getting sufficient  numbers.    On allying with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  Watanabe points out several policy differences between the LDP  and the SDPJ and says: "There are fundamental differences  between the LDP and the SDPJ. Although the SDPJ has been  changing recently, it is still unable to change completely. The  SDPJ is unable to respond to the changing times. Therefore, it  will be difficult for us to form a partnership with the SDPJ  unless it does something like changing the party and starting  anew." However, he says he can form a coalition with some of  the SDPJ members who are called Democrats.    On the political style of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito, Watanabe says although he does not like it, he agrees  with Ozawa's fundamental political ideas.    Watanabe rules out the possibility of forming a coalition  with Komeito under the current situation. He points out that  Komeito's fundamental policies are quite different from those of  the LDP. He said: "They said, when they formed the coalition  government, that the LDP government's fundamental policies would  be maintained but the situation was different when it came to  talking about concrete measures."    Asked what he thinks of Foreign Minister Hata becoming the  next prime minister, Watanabe explains the importance of  policies, saying: "The problem is what kind of policies he will  have, or whether or not his policies will be similar to ours."    Kobayashi goes back to the question of whether or not  Watanabe wants to become the next prime minister, urging  Watanabe to tell the people that he wants serve as prime  minister. In response, Watanabe says: "I do want to become a  prime minister, by all means, if I am allowed to do even 70 or  65 percent of what I wrote in my book."</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Pounds 2bn 'raves'pose threat to leisure spending RAVES are now a Pounds 2bn a year industry challenging established leisure industries according to a study by the Henley Centre, the research and forecasting organisation, released yesterday. Over a million young people a week in the UK are now going to 'rave' parties and spending an average of Pounds 35 a head on the activity, the study reveals. The 'staggering' spending figure - much of it on illegal drugs - is about the same size as the books or newspaper markets, and at least a quarter of the spirits market, says Henley. The study excludes unlicensed raves. The parties, which are held in warehouses and halls within easy reach of metropolitan areas, commonly attract 4,000-10,000 young people at a time, a large proportion of whom are under 21 years of age. Raves are usually alcohol-free but there is normally heavy consumption of drugs, says the centre. Raves 'pose a significant threat to spending for such sectors as licenced drinks retailers and drinks companies,' says the study. Pub visits by young people fell 11 per cent between 1987 and 1991 and Henley is forecasting a further decline of 9 per cent during 1992-97. Henley calculates that the average admission charge to a rave is Pounds 15; spending on drugs is typically Pounds 3-Pounds 5 for LSD; Pounds 15 for ecstasy; Pounds 5 for speed; Pounds 15 for cannabis; mineral water is Pounds 1 a bottle; and cigarettes cost Pounds 3. The report says it is clear that the minimum spend at a rave is about Pounds 20 and the maximum could be about Pounds 50. Henley uses an average figure of Pounds 35 a visit per person to produce a weekly spending total of Pounds 35m for the million participants. The percentage of 16-24-year-olds taking illegal drugs has doubled to nearly 30 per cent over the three years to 1992, says the report. Raves are also extremely time-consuming, displacing time and energy 'which might have been expended on other leisure activities'. Raves can last anywhere between eight and 24 hours, and a weekend rave can go on for 48-72 hours. Leisure Futures volume 3. Henley Centre, 9 Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AY. Pounds 375</p>

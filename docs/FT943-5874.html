			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: European sector waits for the Bundesbank European government bond markets were uneventful as dealers marked time before the Bundesbank's council meeting today. Most markets moved in a narrow trading range and volume remained thin. Analysts view today's Bundesbank meeting as the last chance for it to announce any changes to official interest rates before the German federal elections in October. However, apart from a possible return to a variable-rate repo, the market does not expect the Bundesbank to make any policy changes. On Liffe, the September bund future moved between a high of 91.99 and a low of 91.66 before trading at 91.79 in the late afternoon, down 0.19 points on the day. The prospect of a large supply of government bond issuance also prevented bond prices from recouping the losses they had made the previous day in the wake of the unexpected base rate rise by leading French banks. France is expected to seek around FFr20bn through an auction of 10-year paper today and Italy is hoping to raise around L14,000bn this week. Spain is also issuing paper with three, five and 10-year maturities. Dealers said the disappointing reception given to the Dutch government bond auction this week showed that investors remained reluctant to buy bonds. Sales of the Dutch 7.25 per cent bond reached Fl 6.4bn after three days of subscription, during which the government had to reduce the price of the bonds twice. On the Matif, the notional French government bond future was virtually unchanged in the late afternoon, up just 0.02 at 113.30. The UK government bond market opened with an easier bias following the early morning leak of the results of the survey of UK purchasing managers, published by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. The survey showed that the price index rose to a seasonally adjusted 73.7 per cent last month, up from 73.2 per cent in July. Although the shorter end of the yield curve remained nervous ahead of next week's publication of minutes of the monthly meeting between the chancellor and the Bank of England governor, longer-dated gilts showed marginal gains. On Liffe, the December long gilt future, which saw higher volume levels than the September contract as traders rolled their positions forward, rose  1/16 to 101. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi, said that although the undertone to the market remained bullish, higher volume was needed to drive prices higher. US bond prices ended with modest gains yesterday afternoon despite fresh evidence of inflationary pressures. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 better at 100 9/16 , with the yield dipping to 7.446 per cent and the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 6.132 per cent. It was the second straight day in which bonds reversed course in mid-stream and pushed into positive territory. Early on, the market stumbled when confronted by a mixed bag of economic indicators. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago revealed that its August prices-paid index had jumped to 79.3 per cent, from 71.9 per cent in July. Even though it also reported a slight dip in overall business activity, the market was concerned about the possibility of higher prices feeding into the consumer sector. The Commerce Department supported the suggestion of a cooling economy with data showing a 2.3 per cent drop in July factory orders. But the market seemed to ignore that news, too. However, trading conditions were thin, with many traders on holiday or waiting for the release of employment data on Friday. As a result, bonds improved gradually as the afternoon progressed although there were no additional developments to alter the mood.</p>

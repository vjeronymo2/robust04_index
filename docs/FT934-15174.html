			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Spirits market In their different ways developments at Grand Metropolitan and Guinness are reminders of how difficult the world spirits market remains. GrandMet's loss of the Absolut vodka brand shows the risk of acting as an agent for others. There will be a perceptible impact on profits from 1995, just as GrandMet is recovering from the dilutive effect of its Chef &amp; Brewer sale. But since GrandMet owns all its other brands, there is no risk of a second hit and the damage is containable. The unexpected departure of Mr Crispin Davies, Guinness's top spirits man, is harder to fathom.

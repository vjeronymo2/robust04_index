			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Defense Minister, Colonel-General  Georgiy Kondratyev said he was sure that the first Georgian  refugees would be capable of returning to the Abkhaz region of  Ghali in the near future. He admitted in an interview with  Interfax today that the refugee question was one of the main  issues in finding a settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.    Kondratyev said that during the next six months (the term  during which Russian peacekeepers will be staying in the region)  the Georgian and Abkhaz leaders would have a chance to make a  significant move forward in wide-scale settlement of the  conflict. "Servicemen have done what they were expected to do.  Now politicians must say their word," he said.    Kondratyev returned from the conflict zone on June 27. He  announced that the Russian peace-keeping troops had completed  all their tasks -- established control and set up monitoring  posts.    Kondratyev said that inhabitants of both Georgia and  Abkhazia  had welcomed Russian peacekeepers. He added that the parties  were respecting the cease-fire agreement signed in Moscow on May  14.    Kondratyev stressed that the peace-keeping operation in the  zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict was carried out under the  CIS sign, not only under that of Russia. Kondratyev said he  believed that monitors and peacekeepers from other CIS countries  would soon appear in the region.</p>

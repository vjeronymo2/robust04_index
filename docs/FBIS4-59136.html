			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F> Basindwah with unidentified correspondents in Cairo on 11  May--recorded]    [Text] [Basindwah] I was honored a short time ago to meet  His Excellency Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. The meeting  was very positive. I explained what is happening in Yemen and  assured him that we adhere to Yemen's unity. I conveyed a  verbal message from his excellency's brother President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. Events in Yemen are a confrontation of an  attempt at rebellion by a group or faction from the leadership  of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] that failed to realize that  it should have adhered to constitutional legitimacy. It tried to  defy this legitimacy and violate law and order. It triggered  fighting, which is about to end in a day or even sooner, God  willing. Then things will return to normal. I believe that the  news coming out of Aden is false. The fighting now is going on  around Aden, which is almost besieged. We pay no attention to  what is being said and will let the results on the ground speak  for themselves.    [Correspondent] Is your activity through diplomatic channels  proof that the [words indistinct]?    [Basindwah] Naturally we give special importance to all our  brothers, particularly President Husni Mubarak, the leader of  the biggest Arab country. We have an obligation to inform them  of what is happening in our country. But our eagerness to keep  them informed does not mean that we are not sure of our ability  to settle the issue within hours or in less than a day or two.  Are we required to hide things from our brothers? If this is  the case, then it is a different story. Telling our brothers  what is going on does not mean that we are uncertain of our  ability to settle the issue or that we think the fighting will  go on long. This is not true.    [Correspondent] Do you suspect that some neighboring  countries support the south?    [Basindwah] We do not suspect the impartiality of the Arab  countries or that they are eager not to interfere in Yemeni  affairs. Such accusations against any neighboring and fraternal  states are rejected.    [Correspondent] Does the Yemeni Government still refuse any  kind of mediation, be it Arab or otherwise?    [Basindwah] Of course we agree to an end to the bloodshed,  providing that those who have defied constitutional legitimacy  and law and order abide by the unity of Yemen and its  Constitution and subject the troops that remain under their  control to the authority of the legitimate leadership that  represents constitutional legitimacy in Yemen. We will allow no  organization to run militias or to control part of the Yemeni  Armed Forces.    [Correspondent] Do you believe that war is the best way to  maintain Yemen's unity?    [Basindwah] We have never believed that war is the best way  to safeguard Yemen's unity. But this war has been imposed upon  us. The war was not triggered by us, as a legitimate authority  in Yemen, but by those who have violated law and order and  constitutional legitimacy. Our consolation in confronting those  outlaws who imposed a fight on us is God's saying: "Fighting is  prescribed for you, ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye  dislike a thing that is good for you, and that ye love a thing  that is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not." [Koranic  verse]    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] non-Yemeni elements  involved in the fighting. Is this true?    [Basindwah] These are sheer lies and fabrication. The YSP  leadership previously claimed that it captured a large group  from the al-Jihad Organization in Abyan. When we ordered Aden  Governor Salih Munassar to hand over these Egyptian elements  from the al-Jihad Organization to the Egyptian consul in Aden,  he refused to hand any over, perhaps because he had none in the  first place. I tell the brothers in the YSP leadership to hand  over to the Egyptian authorities any Egyptian group from the  al-Jihad Organization that they may have.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Basindwah] This is not true. You may come and see the  positions for yourselves. This is an attempt to turn the Arab  states against us. These are lies and fabrication. We do not  need to use Iraqis, Sudanese, or others. We are absolutely not  short of men.    [Correspondent] To save the homeland could you....    [Basindwah, interrupting] This is nonsense. Things have  already been settled and are now in the final phase.    [Correspondent] Is President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih willing to  negotiate with the YSP leadership?    [Basindwah] I believe that the elements in the YSP  leadership  who are responsible for triggering the rebellion and the war  must give themselves up. They will be guaranteed a fair trial.  Thank you.</p>

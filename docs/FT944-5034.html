			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Adviser attacks town hall pay-off terms The redundancy terms an-nounced yesterday for local authority workers who lose their jobs through reorganisation have been termed 'inadequate' by the commission advising on the reform. The maximum compensation, based on age and length of service, will be 66 weeks' pay. Until the age of 50, there will be a mandatory pay-off scheme; after that, it will be discretionary. These compare with a maximum of 84 weeks' pay for those who lost their jobs when metropolitan counties were abolished in 1986, and about three years' pay for some Treasury civil servants made redundant as part of civil service restructuring. The dropping of plans to make payments discretionary for employees of all ages was a significant concession announced by Mr David Curry, the local government minister. The proposal had been opposed by both employers and unions as unworkable. Mr Alan Atherton, chairman of the Local Government Staff Commission, the quango advising the government on implementing local authority reform, last month called the compensation 'inadequate' and said councils would need funding to pay off workers. Local authorities say the terms are not good enough to encourage employees to volunteer for redundancy. They say this could create legal difficulties because employees' jobs and terms and conditions may be protected by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, known as Tupe. Ms Tina Day, of the Association of County Councils, one of England's three local authority organisations, said: 'I don't think these terms are sufficiently attractive to make people volunteer to leave. That means people will have nothing to lose in terms of creating as much trouble as possible in Tupe claims.' Authorities claim that the local government finance settlement, the toughest for a decade, will add to difficulties in funding the reorganisation, due to take place in England in May 1996. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's local government spokesman, said his party would vote against all reorganisation orders in parliament unless the compensation package was improved. He described the local government review process as a 'shambles'. In the settlement, it emerged yesterday that councils' capital spending will be cut by 12.3 per cent, from Pounds 7.3bn to Pounds 6.4bn. The local authority associations say councils will be able to increase budgets by an average of 1.6 per cent next year. However, there are wide variations, with shire districts able to raise spending by 3.3 per cent on average, but metropolitan districts only able to raise budgets by 0.5 per cent. Local authorities also claim that the tough financial settlement from the government this year, which saw a cut in all central government finance for councils of 0.4 per cent, will make reorganisation harder to achieve. Analysis by authorities since the settlement was announced shows that the proposed strict 'capping' measures to stop excessive rises in council tax will allow them to spend an extra Pounds 1.1bn in excess of the government's projected level for total standard spending of Pounds 43.5bn. Their current total spending is about Pounds 45bn, so this could be met by drawing Pounds 400m from reserves. However, this makes no allowance for the effect of inflation, wage rises, or increased numbers of clients. The shift in grants has produced other winners and losers. Grants for fire authorities will now be allocated on measures including the length of a county's coastline. Previously, the Isle of Wight had been underfunded because the allocation formula assumed that fire brigades could draft in reinforcements from neighbouring counties.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Drug clears market hurdle SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, has been given provisional clearance to sell its best-selling prescription medicine, Tagamet, without a prescription in UK chemists. The group expects to be able to market the drug by the end of the year. Tagamet is an anti-ulcer treatment which had worldwide sales last year of more than Dollars 1bn. 'This is tremendous news for SB especially given that Tagamet's patents expire in the US next year,' said Mr Paul Krikler, analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'It should add weight to the company's US application to switch Tagamet's status from prescription only to over-the-counter (OTC).' Brokers Hoare Govett estimates Tagamet could eventually generate OTC sales of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m a year, although the UK market will be a small component. Mr Jan Leschley, head of the group's pharmaceuticals division and chief executive designate, has warned that the drug will be less profitable when it is OTC because of additional marketing costs. The UK's committee on safety of medicines said the drug could be used for heartburn, dyspepsia and acid stomach (hyperacidity). The committee has decided that Tagamet is safe and effective for these illnesses, which are common and generally of short duration. The committee's approval was the most significant hurdle to switching Tagamet's status. The move now requires government approval. The company already has two OTC products in this area, Settlers and Tums, and will have to position the product carefully. It has not yet announced the new brand-name or the dosing which is likely to determine its price. Mr Nigel Barnes, analyst at Hoare Govett, said: 'The good news is that SB appears to have cracked the dosing problem. If the dose is too high it could mask serious illnesses. If too low it could be no more effective than existing treatments. It's a positive step that the committee has approved it.' When prescribed for ulcers the dose is normally 800mg a day. The clinical trials for the OTC version have been at 100mg, 200mg and 300mg. It was tested on 2,000 patients.</p>

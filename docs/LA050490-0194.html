			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DROUGHT FORCES MORE CONSERVATION  </P> <P> Your excellent editorial concerning the water shortage stated, "If Only All of  Us Would . . . " The two key words were "if all." Unfortunately, voluntarily  reducing water use is not enough, because many people either are uninformed  about Southern California's water crisis, or they are indifferent.  </P> <P> Driveways and sidewalks are still being hosed down (usually by gardeners), even  though this is illegal. New lawns are being planted. Sprinklers at parks, along  roadways, freeways and at commercial buildings are usually on timers, and some  turn on every night. Big corporations still water acres of lawns every night,  with the excess water draining into the gutters.  </P> <P> We need city/county rationing that is strictly enforced, and we need it  immediately, not at the end of the summer. Are we going to wait until the water  is nearly gone, like Santa Barbara did, and then be forced to take drastic  action? Where is a leader, when we so desperately need one?  </P> <P> GARY R.

Augustin Ngbanda, President Kolingba's former secretary of  state for public security, and Joseph Kanda "reportedly  masterminded acts of social and political agitation, as well as  creating pockets of social tension in some districts of Bangui,"  Claude Dobanga, minister of interior and national security,  asserted.    The RDC did not react to these accusations today.    On 6 March, Dobanga denounced "the detention of weapons of  war and the organization of pockets of tension in some districts  of the capital by certain dignitaries of the former regime."  According to the minister, this situation resulted in the  carrying out of "attacks against foreigners, with technical  assistants as the innocent targets."    Early February, two other RDC members, Lamido Daouda Ibrahim  and Mahamat Salle, were arrested and detained at the  gendarmerie, according to informed sources.    The two men, the president and secretary general of the  Central African Republic's National Association of Livestock  Breeders, were accused of distributing weapons to the  Zaraguinas, a local nickname given to "armed robbers."    In the middle of January, the government had announced  "coercive measures" against the Zaraguinas who were stealing,  looting, and kidnapping travelers and livestock breeders on the  roadside.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ALL-VENTURA COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM  </P> <P> TEAM CAPSULES  </P> <P> Mike Lieberthal (Westlake, 6-0, 165, senior): Lieberthal moved from shortstop  to catcher in the off-season and quickly became the most sought after backstop  in the nation. The four-year starter was drafted third overall in last week's  amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies and signed for a bonus estimated at  $250,000. Blessed with a tremendous arm, Lieberthal kept runners close by  constantly throwing to bases. He also has soft hands, enabling Westlake  pitchers to throw low curveballs without worrying about wild pitches.  Lieberthal batted third for the Warriors and belted 13 home runs, including  four in one game. He batted .438 with 43 runs batted in, 32 runs and 10  doubles.  </P> <P> Mike Eby (Westlake, 6-2, 190, senior): Eby combined exceptional poise and the  ability to change speeds to become an unbeatable pitcher. The left-hander  perfected a changeup that upset the timing of even the best hitters. Eby, who  has signed a letter of intent to attend UCLA, was 11-0 with a 1.56 earned-run  average in 14 appearances. He struck out 68 and walked only 28 in 85 1/3  innings. Eby is extremely competitive and Westlake Coach Rich Herrera  commented, "Mike has an ideal mental makeup for a pitcher." Eby did not bat  when he pitched, preferring to concentrate on beating opponents with his arm.  When not pitching, however, he played first base and batted .316.  </P> <P> Rich Herrera (Westlake): Herrera took the Westlake job in 1989 with two strikes  against him: He was young (24) and he was a walk-on. The Warriors struggled in  his first season, finishing 11-13. Herrera established his program, however,  which paid off this year. Westlake won its first 15 games before falling in a  tournament game in Las Vegas. The Warriors then reeled off 13 more victories,  including a 12-0 Marmonte League mark, and finished 28-2. The league title was  Westlake's first. Herrera, who played on a Rio Mesa High Southern Section  champion and was an assistant coach for two Spartan teams, guided Westlake to  three 5-A Division playoff victories before the team fell to Marina in the  semifinals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FIRST TEAM  </P> <P> Sam Arroyo (Buena, 6-1, 190, senior): Arroyo is a pitcher who never beats  himself, so it comes as no surprise that he never lost, compiling a 10-0 record  and a 1.35 ERA. He walked only 19 in 78 innings and struck out 75. Arroyo, a  right-hander with a deliberate delivery, had seven complete games, three saves  and batted .403.  </P> <P> David Soliz (Rio Mesa, 5-11, 180, senior): Soliz pitched in all 14 Channel  League games, posting three saves and a 7-0 record. He was 9-2 overall and  struck out 81 in 85 1/3 innings. Soliz, who has signed a letter of intent to  play at Cal State Los Angeles, also had 36 hits and batted .456. He played  first base and left field.  </P> <P> Dmitri Young (Rio Mesa, 6-2, 210, junior): Young, a three-time all-county  choice, showed an improvement in nine offensive categories over last season.  "Everything improved," Rio Mesa Coach Rich Duran said. "That's the great thing  about him." Young led county players with a .589 batting average, 50 hits and  46 runs. He also switched from third base to shortstop and made only two  errors.  </P> <P> Mike Mitchell (Rio Mesa, 6-3, 185, junior): Mitchell, in his first varsity  season, batted .457 and set a Rio Mesa single-season RBI record of 44. The  left-handed-hitting first baseman also led the Spartans with seven home runs.  Mitchell also will pitch next season.  </P> <P> Joe Gordon (Simi Valley, 6-0, 160, senior): Gordon was the state home run  leader with 15 and came within one homer of the Southern Section record. His  total tied the school record held by Scott Sharts. "Joe is dedicated to his  swing," Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said. Gordon, who played both second  and third base, batted .377 and had 32 RBIs.  </P> <P> Tim Falsken (Westlake, 5-9, 155, senior): Falsken was Westlake's spark plug,  providing excellent defense at shortstop and triggering rallies at the plate.  He batted .365 and led Marmonte League players with 37 runs. Falsken also had  18 RBIs and 14 stolen bases, but he was more valuable because of his glove.  "Tim made the clutch plays," Coach Rich Herrera said.  </P> <P> Jon McMullen (Rio Mesa, 6-3, 225, sophomore): McMullen, the son of former major  leaguer Ken McMullen, exceeded all expectations, batting .535 with 26 RBIs. "He  is a dead pull hitter with a lot of power," Coach Rich Duran said. "And his  instincts for the game are second to none." McMullen played third this season  but may do the catching next year.  </P> <P> Richard Naranjo (Royal, 5-5, 160, junior): Naranjo typified a scrappy Royal  team that finished second in the Marmonte League and qualified for the Southern  Section 5-A Division playoffs. The diminutive third baseman batted .402,  pounding out 35 hits and scoring 20 runs. Naranjo also led Highlander players  with seven doubles and 21 RBIs.  </P> <P> Rob Neal (Westlake, 6-1, 175, junior): Neal, a graceful center fielder with  great range, made several diving catches for Westlake. He combined with  Lieberthal, Falsken and second baseman Rick Wolters to give Westlake solid  defense up the middle. Neal, who batted leadoff, also had 33 hits, 31 runs, 19  RBIs and nine stolen bases.  </P> <P> Brent Christenson (Thousand Oaks, 6-0, 185, senior): Christenson, who had 10  RBIs in three playoff games, emerged as the most dependable Thousand Oaks  hitter. He batted .444 and led the team with six home runs and 27 RBIs.  Christenson also possesses a strong arm and good range in center field.  </P> <P> Ryan Denger (Buena, 6-1, 190, senior): Denger was the player Buena looked to  for run production, and the left fielder came through all year. "We pitched  around him whenever we could," Ventura Coach Dan Smith said. Denger batted .451  with 37 hits and 25 runs scored. He also had eight doubles, four home runs and  23 RBIs.  </P> <P> Jacob Cruz (Channel Islands, 6-0, 157, junior): Cruz is a three-year starter  who has improved each season. He led Channel Islands in nearly every offensive  category, batting .494 with 44 hits and 36 runs scored. He also had eight  doubles, two triples and nine stolen bases. Cruz is a center fielder with a  tremendous arm and great range.  </P> <P> Billy Hall (Thousand Oaks, 5-10, 180, senior): Hall played catcher for Thousand  Oaks, but it was his bat that gained him the most attention. He batted .449 and  led the team with 20 runs scored and 31 hits. Hall, who batted .500 last season  before an injury ended his season, bounced back and adjusted to his new  position.  </P> <P> Kenny Hood (Simi Valley, 6-5, 187, senior): Hood, who pitched and played first  base for Simi Valley, excelled in several areas. He batted .446 and led Pioneer  players with 28 runs and nine doubles. He had six home runs and 22 RBIs. The  left-hander was 7-2 and struck out 41 in 44 innings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-VENTURA COUNTY SECOND TEAM  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.77IN:2.99IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>

Ricupero recommended:  "People sometimes get more emotional over the forest because it  is more spectacular. We also want industrialized nations to  give the same attention to arid and semi-arid areas."    Ricupero participated on 9 March in the opening ceremony of  the Latin American Seminar on Desertification. The minister  today will propose to Bo Kjellen, the Desertification Convention  Negotiations Intergovernmental Committee chairman, to avoid  implementing an approach "merely based on providing assistance"  and provide support for the development of the population living  in the areas affected by this problem. Ricupero noted: "Even  though we admit that the priority is Africa, the most affected  continent, we want the donating countries' commitment to Latin  America to be mandatory."    According to Ricupero, overcoming desertification in Latin  America will require expenditures totaling $2 billion. The  minister said the outcome of the National Conference on  Desertification, which ended on 9 March, will manifest to our  country "a problem of which the people have thus far been  unaware" and yield contributions for the National  Antidesertification Program. Ricupero said: "We want to define  this policy, which does not exist yet in either Brazil or most  Latin American countries, with the exception of Mexico."  Delegates from the interested countries have to draw up a  proposal for Latin America by 11 March.</p>

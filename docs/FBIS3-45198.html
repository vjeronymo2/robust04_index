We have  talked about the need to learn more and do more research and  investigations in the last two commentaries. What was the  purpose? It is for doing practical things and doing a good job  in reform, opening up, and the various undertakings of socialist  modernization.    The advocacy of doing more practical things and speaking  less  empty words is to ask cadres of various levels to play an  exemplary role in leading the broad masses to do real and solid  work; make solid contributions to promoting reform, opening up,  and modernization construction; and prevent and overcome bad  work styles such as exaggeration, lip service, formalism, and  fancy appearances. The magnificent mansion of socialist  modernization is built by bricks and stones, not blown up by  empty puffs. Empty talk ruins the country, solid work  invigorates it, and many such examples can be found in history.  It should be affirmed that a great majority of our leading  cadres work diligently, conscientiously, and practically and  this is the important reason for the prosperous development of  our undertakings. However, we must also realize that among a  small number of comrades some bad work styles exist. They fall  to the sea of meetings and the mountain of documents, make vague  calls without giving concrete guidance, and work superficially;  or they part with reality, give promises lightly, and do not  grasp implementation; or they try to have their "names in  newspapers, sounds in broadcasts, and images on television," but  are not willing to do solid work; or they watch the upper levels  and engage in some fancy appearances which win praise from their  superiors.... These bad work styles seriously part from the  masses, hinder the implementation of the party's principles,  policies, and decisions, and must be resolutely overcome. Of  course, when we oppose empty talk, we are only getting at the  phenomenon of not doing practical things, we are not saying that  we do not have to honestly publicize development goals which we  can reach, nor are we saying that we do not have to speak some  words to encourage the masses to unite for the struggle. The  actual work is complicated, and regarding which things we should  explain first and do later, which things we should explain and  do simultaneously, and which things we should do first and  explain later, we must analyze and handle them from the  viewpoint of concrete conditions.    What is the biggest practical thing which we should do well  with all our energy at this time? It is expediting reform and  development. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee has drawn a blueprint for building  our socialist market economy system. This year, based on the  spirit of the "decision," the central leadership has been  announcing measures to reform taxation, finance, foreign trade,  investment, and planning, and various localities have been  actively implementing them. In the progress of reform and  development, we will surely run into new conflicts and problems,  which require our cadres of various levels to rack their brains  to solve them one by one in a practical manner to enable the  central leadership's measures for expediting reform and  development to be implemented one by one. Various localities  differ in conditions, and, as they propose goals and formulate  measures, they must consider their own actual conditions and  refrain from blind comparisons. They must be ambitious on the  one hand and work solidly on the other hand. When various  localities and departments find themselves upholding this  principle and properly, solidly, and fruitfully do a good job in  the reform, development, and modernization of their own places,  they have developed a good work style of doing more practical  things and speaking less empty words.    In the process of doing practical things, we must correctly  understand and handle the relationship between doing practical  things and demonstrating the merit of work. When more practical  things are done and done better, the merit of work becomes  prominent, and officials can win the support of the masses and  praise from their superiors. There is no question about this.  Some comrades set the goal that "when one takes the office of  governor of a locality, one must benefit the locality in which  he serves." This kind of ambition is worth encouraging. But we  must also prevent and overcome short-term behavior, that is, one  may be willing to do practical things which can easily  demonstrate one's work merits instantly, but he may be unwilling  to do practical things which cannot easily demonstrate his work  merits instantly but which indeed have to been done from a  long-term perspective. Much short-term behavior has brought  about many adverse effects to the extent of hindering the pace  of reform and development, and this has been proved by much  practice. The purpose of doing more practical things is to  benefit the country and the people, not to establish tablets or  create legends for oneself. It is hoped that this starting  point issue will draw the attention of leading comrades of  various levels.    Showing concern for the sufferings of the masses and  solving their difficulties is a practical thing which ought to  be done by the leaders of various levels. The purpose of our  party is to serve the people heart and soul, and the purpose of  reform and development is to let the people have a happier life.  Speaking frankly, the adjustment of the pattern of interests  and relationships during the deepening of reform will benefit  the broad masses of the people. But at a certain stage and in a  certain area, different masses will be benefited differently.  This is unavoidable. Under this condition, leaders of various  levels must always be concerned with the well-being of the broad  masses, promptly discover problems, and make prompt adjustments  to solve problems. Only by so doing can they protect enthusiasm  among the masses, mobilize them as much as possible to  participate in the reform and to support it and create a stable  social and political environment for reform and development.    To do more practical things, we must develop the spirit of  hard struggle and a scientific and pragmatic spirit as well.  Hard struggle is a precious tradition of ours. Today, while we  do pioneering work in reform and opening up, the effect will be  very different if we do not have a spirit of hard struggle. We  must closely rely on the broad masses of cadres and people, do  more practical things which require less money or do not even  require money, and do less things which increase burdens on the  masses and require compulsory appropriations. Due to limited  financial strength, there are some things which we cannot do at  this time, but we must patiently explain to the masses to win  their understanding. To do practical things, we must also seek  truth from facts and cherish scientific attitude. We must never  do things by relying only on enthusiasm or subjective wishes.  We must carry out scientific discussions and make scientific  decisions on the basis of research and investigation. We must  try hard to reduce minor errors while avoiding big ones and  enable every practical thing to obtain the biggest economic and  social returns.    Since reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  stressed that leading cadres should have a good work style.  Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly asked leading  cadres of various levels to learn more, have less social  intercourse, do more research and investigations, have less  subjectivism, and do more practical things and speak less empty  words. These three requirements are the most important contents  of improving the work style of the leadership. A new year has  just begun, and I hope that leading comrades of various levels  develop the good work style of learning more, doing more  research and investigations, and doing more practical things;  better unite with the broad masses of people and lead them in  clearing a way to forge ahead; and work diligently to enable our  reform, opening up, and modernization undertakings to proceed  faster and better in order to please the whole party and the  people of the whole country.</p>

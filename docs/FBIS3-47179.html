Meanwhile, Senator Johnston said that the relations between  the two countries have reached an important point and nowadays  the U.S. should choose either normalize of relations or  maintaining its sanction against Vietnam. He said the  normalization of the U.S.-Vietnamese relations in economic and  cultural fields will not only be in the interests of the two  peoples but also influence world and regional peace and  stability.    A press conference was held in Hanoi on Sunday afternoon by  U.S. Senator Johnston and his party. Senator Johnston commented  that the Vietnamese government and people have been cooperative  in most of the ways, and the way of the world cooperation is not  by punishment and the punishment ought to be stopped and start a  new chapter [sentence as heard].

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Swoop on BCCI leaves victims still in the dark: Depositors, creditors and employees are waiting for redress three years on On July 5 1991 customers, staff and passers-by watched with varying degrees of horror and surprise as the doors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International were closed in a sudden sweep by global regulators. Three years later many hundreds of thousands of depositors, creditors and employees of BCCI around the world are still awaiting some signs of redress following one of the biggest bank frauds in the world - totalling more than Dollars 12bn. Many of the employees have been hit three ways. They have lost their jobs, they have lost their salaries and they haved been under pressure to repay their subsidised mortgages and other loans with the bank. The stigma attached to BCCI has made it difficult for many to find other employment. For UK-based sterling customers of the bank the depositors' protection scheme provided compensation of three-quarters of their savings up to Pounds 15,000. Equivalent schemes have been triggered in some other countries. Creditors, however, are likely to have to wait well into next year for any payout from liquidators. Depending on a Dollars 1.8bn contribution under negotiation with Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, they may receive a payout of about 15p to 20p. Further payments will depend on continued attempts to trace assets and to settle litigation launched by the liquidators against bank regulators, auditors, directors and related parties involved in transactions with BCCI. The prediction remains an ultimate 30p to 40p in the pound. The primary beneficiaries so far have been the professionals - several firms of lawyers, consultants and notably the partners at Touche Ross, the accountants, who have been liquidators to the bank. For some of the main protagonists involved, criminal justice has been a little swifter. Last month the authorities in Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank, sentenced 12 former executives to pay Dollars 9bn in compensation and serve a total of 61 years in prison. One of these, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the chief executive, is now in the US where he may be tried on a series of state and federal charges. Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder who was sentenced in his absence, continues to live in Pakistan. Meanwhile, a number of changes to regulation and banking supervision have been made following the report in October 1992 by Lord Justice Bingham into BCCI's supervision. A new law in Britain has made it compulsory for the first time for auditors to report suspicions of fraud to the regulators. Under previous rules they were merely protected if they decided to do so. Draft banking legislation proposed for the EU would give supervisors power to refuse to authorise banks which are organised in a way that impedes effective super-vision. The Bank of England has set up an in-house legal unit and a special investigations unit designed to help investigate matters. It said yesterday: 'Undoubtedly there has been a change of emphasis. We have become clearer on when we need to change gear from a trusting, supervisory to a regulatory approach.'</p>

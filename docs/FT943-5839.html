			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Telia earnings increase fourfold Telia, the state-owned Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday announced a surge in first-half profits to SKr3.4bn (Dollars 441m), nearly four times the SKr865m achieved last year. It said full-year earnings would be considerably higher than last year's SKr3.95bn level even though it antici-pates greater competition and lower prices in the autumn. The group said it benefited from improved operating margins, lower capital costs and the sale of Teli AB to Ericsson. Operating revenues rose 7 per cent to SKr18.9bn while costs were reduced by a similar amount to SKr11.09bn. This left the group with operating income of SKr7.80bn, against SKr5.70bn. Telia said it had noted a marked increase in the inflow of orders from big customers in the commerce and service sector. It added that traffic revenues in the switched telephone network were 2.6 per cent higher than a year ago while the number of subscriptions had begun to rise again after a decline in 1993. 'Mobile telephony continues to experience strong growth,' it said.</p>

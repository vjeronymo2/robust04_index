After the talks, Geza Jeszenszky said that he was glad to  learn that the Serbs in Hungary do not have complaints that  could hinder long-term Hungarian-Serbian cooperation. They  agreed that settling the Yugoslav crisis is in the interest of  both countries.    Jeszenszky expressed the hope that the obstacles hindering  Hungarian-Serbian relations would disappear. He said it was  important that the Serbs in Hungary had no problems in having  contacts with the mother country despite the international  embargo on Rump Yugoslavia. According to Jeszenszky, lifting  the sanctions is in the interest of both Hungarians and the  international community. Hungary has always urged peace and a  just solution.    Answering a question put by NEPSZABADSAG, Geza Jeszenszky  expressed his hope that his visit in Belgrade could contribute  to easing the rather cold Hungarian-Serbian relations of recent  years and to moving away from the deadlock. Jeszenszky hopes  that, after the visit, the Serbian press will present an image  of Hungarian politics that is closer to reality and is able to  dissipate the prejudices and misconceptions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Muhammad Salamah] </F>   [Text] Shaykh As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, leader of the Islamic  Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis, has said that he has turned down  an offer by President Yasir 'Arafat to accompany him to Jericho,  viewing such a trip as accepting Israel's domination.    Asked by AKHIR KHABAR if he was offered a part in the  Palestinian National Authority, Shaykh al-Tamimi said that  President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] had contacted several  Palestinian figures, including his son, Nadir al-Tamimi,  offering them the portfolio of the Religious Affairs Ministry.  Nadir, he said, is now in Tunis.    Shaykh al-Tamimi added: This is a personal contact rather  than coordination between the Palestinian leadership and the  Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis.    Asked whether Dr. Nadir has agreed to participate in the  Palestinian Authority, Shaykh al-Tamimi said: Although this is  a personal affair, I oppose it because such participation in  principle means bargaining. Therefore, I urge Nadir to reject  it.    He added: If the self-rule area is expanded to include the  whole West Bank, I will agree to enter these territories to  establish an Islamic opposition party, but not to participate in  the Palestinian Authority.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities fall sharply BRAZILIAN equities fell sharply yesterday following fresh press evidence of alleged corruption involving President Fernando Collor de Mello, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. The Bovespa index ended 14.6 per cent down at 18,925 in low turnover of Cr163.4bn. Late last week the index had risen 11.65 per cent over two days, since the congressional investigation had not yet uncovered evidence directly linking the president to allegations of corruption against his campaign treasurer.</p>

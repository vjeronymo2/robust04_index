			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Electricity price controls accepted ALL 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales have accepted a new set of price controls which provide incentives for energy saving in their supply businesses, Michael Smith writes. Offer, the industry regulator which proposed the revised regime, said yesterday that the controls will also require companies to make and pass on further efficiency gains to customers. Acceptance of controls covering the supply businesses clears the way for talks on how the more lucrative distribution arms of the businesses should be regulated. The supply businesses, which buy power from the generators, account for about 10 per cent of the regional companies' profits. From next April revenue rises will be limited to the rate of inflation minus 2 per cent. At present the companies can raise prices in line with inflation.</p>

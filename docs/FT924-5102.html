			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Making Lloyd's more 'user friendly': David Rowland tells Richard Lapper about the discipline he hopes to bring to the insurance market MR DAVID Rowland is almost certain to be elected chairman of Lloyd's of London next week in succession to Mr David Coleridge. He said he aimed to make the insurance market more 'user friendly'. 'I have always worked with an open door,' said the urbane Mr Rowland, 59. 'Too often in the past things seem to have been done to separate us off from the outside world. People come to a dinner and go away wondering what Lloyd's is all about.' Mr Rowland said he would like to get closer to the market's traders than some of his predecessors. Ideally he would relocate his offices closer to the three lower floors on which the market's more than 200 syndicates conduct their business. 'I want to get as close to the market as possible - both the knowledge and the atmosphere,' he said. 'We want to persuade our visitors that the place is really humming.' Mr Rowland will work with Mr Peter Middleton, the tough-talking north-easterner recruited to Lloyd's from Thomas Cook, the travel concern, to be chief executive - and with Mr Brian Garraway, the former BAT Industries deputy chairman who will be in charge of regulation. They are offering more than changes in style. They are promising a radical reform programme to improve the market's efficiency; to make it more competitive in the international market for specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance; and above all to make it more profitable. That seems like a tall order. Lloyd's is still grappling with some of the worst trading conditions it has ever experienced. Mr Rowland will have to report losses of more than Pounds 1bn to Names, the individuals whose capital supports the market, when figures for the 1990 year become available. Lloyd's could still be in the red in the 1991 underwriting year. Thousands of loss-making Names are in dispute with their agents, and potential liabilities from North American pollution and asbestosis claims could easily offset the impact of the recent increase in rates. Mr Rowland has had a big hand in designing the reform programme. Last year he presided over a task force of 14 Lloyd's underwriters, brokers and outside experts, whose report - Lloyd's: A Route Forward - laid down 65 specific reforms and outlined a blueprint for far-reaching change. Lloyd's has implemented many of the measures recommended by the report, including modifying the market's traditional principle of unlimited liability, giving Names new powers and rights and moving to attract corporate capital to the market. The new team also plans to re-examine the market's approach to a number of problems considered to be almost intractable by the task force report. Mr Rowland says he is anxious to do more for the problems of Names who have been forced to leave the market because of past losses, sometimes suffering financial ruin. The main aim of the reform programme was to enable Lloyd's to compete more effectively in international markets. Mr Rowland is chairman of Sedgwick group, a broker which does well over half its business outside the UK, and he is more keenly aware of these realities than any of his predecessors at Lloyd's. He was a member of the Lloyd's council - the market's governing body - between 1986 and 1990 and said the council failed to 'appreciate the reality' of the way in which companies from Europe and North America were eating away at its business. He said: 'I've been very exercised by the way in which Lloyd's thought of itself. I once threatened to hold up at each meeting a placard with the annual premium income of Allianz (the German company which is the biggest insurer in the world) just to encourage Lloyd's not to look inwards.' He said he was frustrated on the council by the cumbersome way Lloyd's ran its affairs and was particularly concerned about the way the demands of self-regulation inhibited the council's ability to provide effective strategic leadership to the hundreds of separate syndicates, agencies and brokers which do business in the market. Mr Rowland confessed 'absolute fascination' with the problem of persuading a 'fiercely entrepreneurial market' to continue competing while observing enough 'central disciplines' to control the market. Mr Rowland said: 'On bad days you think it is impossible to reconcile these two things.' He takes heart from the fact that in the last few years many big corporations have sought to promote entrepreneurship within their organisations. The issue was studied in detail by the task force which recommended that the Lloyd's corporation should separate its responsibilities for regulation and for providing business services to the market's syndicates and agencies. Lloyd's agreed in the summer to do this, after much prevarication, creating a market board to spearhead business development. It was an important factor in persuading Mr Rowland to accept the chairman's job. The decision to make the chairman's post a salaried one for the first time - it will pay at least Pounds 400,000 a year - cleared a remaining obstacle for Mr Rowland, who said he needs a regular income. Mr Rowland's interest in management might mark him off from many of the insurance market's old guard, but he is still in some senses a Lloyd's traditionalist at heart. He has worked in or near the market all his working life and believes strongly in the market's historic strengths. He said: 'Until the early 1980s Lloyd's demonstrated itself as being the most efficient way of doing business.' Until the scandals of the 1970s and early 1980s 'the whole quality of the place was that business was done because of a reputation of trust for the individuals within it'. Mr Rowland said that despite all his misgivings it was ultimately a belief in these values that persuaded him to accept the job. He described his worst fear as being seen by two other players on the 18th hole of his favourite golf course missing a putt. 'One man turns to the other and says: 'Isn't he the guy who they wanted to be chairman of Lloyd's?' And the other one turns and says: 'He can't putt either'.'</p>

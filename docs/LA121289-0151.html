			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YANKEES GET LEARY FROM REDS  </P> <P> The New York Yankees, desperate to improve their pitching staff, acquired  former Dodger Tim Leary from the Cincinnati Reds today for two minor leaguers.  </P> <P> The Yankees, whose 4.50 earned-run average was the second-worst in baseball  last season behind Detroit, sent outfielder Hal Morris and right-hander Rodney  Imes to Cincinnati for Leary and minor-league outfielder Van Snider.  </P> <P> "In getting Leary, we are adding an experienced, quality pitcher to the staff  who can give us 200 innings," said George Bradley, Yankees' vice president of  player development and scouting. "Snider is a good left-handed hitter who  provides us with depth in the outfield."  </P> <P> The Yankees were determined to get starting pitching after failing in their bid  for free agent Mark Langston. In Leary, they got a 31-year-old who will be  playing for his fifth major-league club.  </P> <P> Leary was 8-14 last season with a 3.52 ERA and is 45-56 lifetime.  </P> <P> He was 17-11 with a 2.91 ERA with the Dodgers in 1988 but was just 6-7 last  July 18 when Los Angeles traded him to Cincinnati with Mariano Duncan for Kal  Daniels and Lenny Harris. Leary went 2-7 in 14 starts for the Reds with a 3.71  ERA.  </P> <P> He was a star at UCLA when the New York Mets picked him in the first round of  the June, 1979, draft.  </P> <P> The Mets brought him up to the majors to start the 1981 season. But he strained  a muscle in his right elbow at Wrigley Field in his major league debut and did  not pitch again in the major leagues until 1983.  </P> <P> Leary was 1-1 for the Mets in 1983 and 3-3 in 1984, then was dealt to  Milwaukee. He was 1-4 for the Brewers in 1985 and 12-12 in 1986 before  Milwaukee traded him to Los Angeles with pitcher Tim Crews for first baseman  Greg Brock.  </P> <P> He was 3-11 in 1987 and then had the best year of his career in 1988 as Los  Angeles won the World Series.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old Snider was 1 for 7 last season with the Reds and batted .222 at  Nashville of the Class AAA American Assn. He is 7 for 35 lifetime in the big  leagues.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old Morris was 5 for 18 for the Yankees in 1989 after batting a  league-leading .326 with Columbus of the International League. He is 7 for 38  lifetime in the majors.  </P> <P> Imes, 23, was 17-6 with a 2.73 ERA for Albany of the Eastern League.  </P></p>

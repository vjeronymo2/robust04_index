			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Hyundai workers end factory occupation Militant workers ended their occupation of South Korea's largest car plant yesterday after police threatened to storm the factory at dawn with helicopters, armoured vehicles and thousands of officers, AP reports from Ulsan. The workers took over the plant after it was closed by the company following a union strike vote. The workers were demanding special bonus payments, better working conditions and reinstatement of workers dismissed for union activity. Early yesterday, helicopters flew over the plant dropping leaflets informing workers of the dawn evacuation deadline and threatening an assault after 12,000 riot police massed around the factory compound. Some 3,000 to 4,000 car workers had been reinforcing towering barricades of trucks, cars dragged off assembly lines, vehicle parts, tyres and hijacked fire engines. Clusters of workers pounded the ground with steel pipes, keeping time with rousing pro-labour songs blasting out across a compound littered with lumps of metal and twisted parts of what had been brand new cars. At nightfall, dozens of masked and hooded workers carrying steel pipes could be seen guarding plant barricades. Hyundai officials had expressed concern about the several thousand gallons of paint thinner and other inflammable liquid kept in the plant. They said more than 20,000 cars also were on the site. The plant normally has 30,000 workers and can produce 1.1 million vehicles a year. Hyundai car workers earn an average Dollars 1,600 (Pounds 893) a month. South Korea's average wages have more than doubled in the past four years because of union pressure. The government has asked companies to keep salary increases down this year, contending high labour costs have made South Korean products less competitive internationally.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Macmillan seeks freeze on Berlitz shares A HOLDING OF 56 per cent in Berlitz, the language school, was transferred by Macmillan, the publisher, to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private company in the Maxwell group, on November 5 1990, exactly 12 months before the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr David Oliver QC, for Macmillan, the main publishing subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation, said the transfer had been instigated by Mr Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell. Mr David Shaffer, a Macmillan director and appointee to the Berlitz board, was also shown as having been present at the meeting 'but denies ever having been there', Mr Oliver said. Macmillan is asking the court to grant injunctions preventing four banks, which hold 9.6m of the 10.6m shares involved, dealing with them pending full trial in the autumn of a dispute over their ownership. The banks had taken them as collateral for loans to Maxwell entities. Mr Justice Hoffmann refused a plea by Mr Oliver for Macmillan's opposed application to be heard in private. Mr Oliver said that only the 'legal estate', not the beneficial interest, in the holding had been transferred to BIT, which had been purely a nominee. Between March 11 and October 15 last year BIT had transferred 9.6m shares into the name of Cede, nominee for the Depository Trust Company. The remaining 1m shares had been comprised in two certificates. BIT held one and had 'all but acknowledged they are ours,' Mr Oliver said. The other certificate had been transferred by BIT to Credit Suisse on September 27 1991. Mr Oliver said that of the shares transferred to Cede 1.9m had since been registered in the name of Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings, Swiss Volksbank held 2.4m, Credit Suisse 2m and Morgan Stanley Trust Company 3.3m. Mr Oliver said that Morgan Stanley itself made no claim to the shares. It believed it might be holding some for Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed certain Maxwell company pension funds. BIM had failed to claim the shares, although it had refused to acknowledge it had no claim, he said. The hearing continues today.</p>

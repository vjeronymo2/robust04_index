			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 8 Jan 94 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government has drafted an action program  presenting plans on step-by-step opening of large public works  projects to foreign companies beginning in April 1994 in order  to reach a breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. construction talks,  since the 20 January deadline for the U.S. Government making a  decision on whether to take retaliatory measures against on  Japan is soon approaching.    According to the draft program, details of which were  revealed on 7 January, open competitive biddings will apply to  central government projects worth more than 4.5 million SDR  [special drawing rights] (about 700 million yen), and foreign  companies will be granted rights equal to those granted to  domestic companies in the biddings. Projects conducted by the  metropolis, major cities and prefectures [todofuken] and  designated cities [seirei shitei toshi] will be opened to  foreign companies as well. In addition, companies'  qualifications to participate in bidding will be set on the  basis of objective assessments, and at least 40 days will be  allowed from the time biddings are announced to the time they  are conducted, so that foreign companies will have enough time  to prepare for them.    The government wants to sound out the view of the United  States on the action program in informal Japan-U.S. talks to  open next week, and to have it approved by a cabinet meeting to  be called on 18 January.    The action program calls for the opening of projects now  under direct jurisdiction of the central government, as well as  projects conducted by 84 government-related organizations, such  as Japan Highway Public Corporation, East Japan Railway Company  (JR East Japan) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation  (NTT). The central government will also request that 47  governments -- including the metropolis, major cities and  prefectures, and 14 designated cities -- open up their projects.    As far as the projects to be subject to open competition are  concerned, the program applies to central government projects  worth more than 4.5 million SDR and projects for local  government and government-related organizations worth more than  15 million SDR (about 2.5 billion yen). In the area of  construction design, instead of the conventional bidding system,  the program calls for adopting a system of publicly offered  proposals, which would require bidding companies to propose  technologies to be used. Design projects to be opened up are  those worth more than 450,000 SDR (about 70 million yen) for  government-related organizations and more than 1.5 million SDR  (about 250 million yen) for local governments. Concerning local  government projects, the United States demands that the  applicable level of the projects' value be further lowered.  Hence, the numbers are not yet definite.    The central government and government-related organizations  will start to implement the action program as of the beginning  of 1994 [April in the fiscal year] and will complete the  implementation by March 1995. The schedule for implementation  at the local government level is not given.    According to the new plan, construction companies that want  to participate in the open competitive biddings need to achieve  certain scores in the performance review process. This  performance review will entail ratings in terms of six issues,  such as net worth, years of operation, and number of engineers  employed. Records of overseas performance will be taken into  consideration so that foreign companies may not be  disadvantaged. In the open competitive bidding system currently  being used by the Construction Ministry, qualifications for  participation are limited by a rating system based in part on  subjective judgment. This will be completely replaced with a  scoring system that is objective and internationally acceptable.    A minimum of 40 days will be given from the day of the  bidding announcement to the day of actual conduct of the  bidding. In making the announcements, the names of projects and  the deadline for submission of bidding applications will be  given not only in Japanese, but also in English. This action  program is intended to apply to 24 nations -- including Japan,  the United States, and European nations -- which are parties to  the GATT's treaty on government procurement.    This action program has apparently taken many of the demands  of the U.S. into account so far, but does not refer to the  adoption of measuring indicators such as figures on the share of  business won by foreign companies.    Japan is cautious about adopting measuring indicators which  could end up as numerical targets. However, it is possible that  the matter will become an issue in the [Japan-U.S.] talks next  week.</p>

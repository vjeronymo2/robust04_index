			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Confidence in property sees upturn CONFIDENCE IN the UK commercial property market has risen sharply in the last three months, according to a poll by Gallup for CSW, a property magazine. It found that 94 per cent of the 100 property companies and institutional investors polled believed that the market would show some improvement in the next 12 months. Some 17 per cent of respondents thought that a 'meaningful recovery' had already started or would happen later this year, compared with 5 per cent in January. But 55 per cent of those polled did not expect recovery until next year and 28 per cent expected no revival to take place until 1995 or later. The survey covered 100 property investors and companies owning nearly Pounds 60bn of property assets.</p>

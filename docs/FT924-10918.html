			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Middle East selling sends gold price to 10-week low THE GOLD price slipped to the lowest level for 10 weeks yesterday under pressure from fresh Middle East selling. The London bullion market price closed at Dollars 338.25 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.90, taking the fall on the week so far to Dollars 4.90 an ounce. The New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) gold market steadied a little after London's close and in late trading the December position was quoted at Dollars xxx an ounce, down Dollars xxx on the day. But Comex analysts told the Reuter news agency that the metal was poised to make another run towards life-of-contract lows. Mr George Milling-Stanley, first vice president, bullion sales, with Lehman Brothers, suggested that speculators were targeting a further fall to the December gold contract's life-time low of Dollars 335 an ounce. 'The MidEast was a substantial seller of gold,' he said. 'It is short selling, looking to make a profit from the decline.' London dealers said the market was being kept on the defensive by the strength of the dollar and 'pre-US election jitters'. They thought prices were likely to hold within a Dollars 336-Dollars 340-an-ounce range over the next few days.</p>

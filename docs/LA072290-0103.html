			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> EXAGGERATED IMAGE  </P> <P> MBA students are not perceived as being particularly sensitive to the needs of  their community. We have tended to be very focused on getting that MBA degree  and getting out into business.  </P> <P> We have probably placed too much emphasis on career . . . but that image has  been exaggerated.  </P> <P> We are beginning to let people know that we care. Close to 500 MBA students at  USC donated time and money to community causes in 1989 and 1990. That number is  close to the entire number enrolled on a full-time basis.  </P> <P> We recently raised $1,700 for the homeless. We've done work with Big Brothers  and Big Sisters. Some students did personal finance for the rehabilitated  homeless, lending advice on financial matters to people trying to put their  lives back together.  </P> <P> MBA students are getting more involved in communities surrounding their  schools. As future business leaders, it's incumbent upon us to be leaders of  our community as well.  </P></p>

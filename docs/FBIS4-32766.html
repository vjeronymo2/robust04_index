			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 24/06/1994 -- While labelling  the opposition's no-confidence motion as "ungrounded and  unfair", the president of the Greater Romania Party (PRM)  Corneliu Vadim Tudor defined the opposition as "a pitiful brake  against the progress of the Romanian society, a ferment of  national discord." The definition goes on with describing the  opposition as "a much too burdensome moral and financial luxury  for this country."    PRM reproaches the presidency, the government and the  prosecutor general the failure to bring before court the  dignitaries who in 1990-1992 "plundered the country and now take  shelter in the clamorous choir of the contentious opposition."</p>

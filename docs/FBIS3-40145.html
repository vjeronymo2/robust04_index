So, what is the  actual restraint situation? This reporter recently learned from  relevant sectors that the so-called transportation restriction  refers only to the overall situation which varies greatly among  various transportation industries. Taking railroad and highway  transportation for example, railroad transportation  "bottlenecks" are entirely prominent, while highway  transportation is relatively overbuilt.    According to explanations by comrades related to railroad  sectors, in recent years state expenditure has greatly  accelerated railroad construction. At present 10 major railroad  projects have fully entered the design and construction stage.  In the first half of 1993 alone, investment reached 3.42  billion yuan. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang multiple track, Hou-Yue line,  Bao-Zhong line, Beijing-Zhengzhou electrification, and  Nanning-Kunming lines have all entered a high tide of  construction. However, railroad transportation still is severely  stagnant because of many factors. In the short term the conflict  of transportation capacity lagging behind economic development  still is rather prominent. There are relatively great  deficiencies, whether of freight or passenger transportation.  According to relevant sectors, the first half of 1993 was one of  the most serious periods ever for a shortage of railroad  transportation. The average rate of satisfying of applications  for rail carriages for freight use was around 40 percent, more  than 10 percentage points below a normal year. It was hard to  ensure transportation of some state plan and key commodities.  For example, in May 162,000 tons of coal was under plan contract  for use in the chemical industry nationwide. Actual arrangements  were made for 87,000 tons and the actual amount transported was  less than 80,000 tons. Transportation was a major external cause  affecting shortages of state steel contracts in the steel  industry nationwide. Economic development was unusually rapid  in the southeast coastal area in 1993, and investment has  doubled, creating a large volume of goods and passengers flowing  southward, and meaning even more prominent already over-capacity  Beijing-Guangdong and Beijing-Shanghai lines. Goods headed south  for Guangdong can only be one-forth of applications. Many mining  enterprises along some coastal lines have restricted or ceased  production because there is no way to guarantee railroad  carriages. The passenger transportation shortage situation also  is extremely serious; main trunk lines commonly are more than 50  percent over capacity. In some areas there is no choice but to  scatter passengers by using commodity cars for travelers.    According to transportation sector explanations, in recent  years the stress of highway construction mainly has been on  roads for vehicle use to realize the goal of a nationwide "two  vertical and two horizontal" network. The trend has been led by  localities with central government assistance, full utilization  of accumulated funds and loans, opening up a modernized highway  transportation network. There have been great successes.  Nevertheless, there is a relative shortage of passenger and  commodity resources, road conditions are rather poor and highway  transportation prices are too high compared to rail because of  the rapid increase of vehicles in society. Transport capacity is  relatively overbuilt, meaning severe waste.    According to statistics, in the first half of 1993 the  quantity of civilian vehicles recovered throughout society had  reached nearly 7.5 million units, a net increase of more than  1.2 million units over the same period in 1992, a 19 percent  increase rate. The corresponding passenger and freight  transportation rates were 3.63 billion people and 3.86 billion  tons, respectively, up only 5.2 percent and 6.4 percent over the  same period in 1992. On the other hand, vehicle utilization  rates dropped. According to a random survey by sectors concerned  in the first half of 1993, cargo carrying vehicles had an  average empty driving rate as high as 48.2 percent, up 4.8  percent age points over the same period in 1992. Specialized  transportation sector vehicle work rates were only 56 percent,  down nearly 10 percentage points from the same period in 1992.  Highway transport's advantages of being fast, convenient and  flexible have yet to be developed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Olayo] </F>   [Text] The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has reported  that in the current year it has seized 60,000 rounds of small  arms ammunition of various calibers. The quantity seized is  double that seized -- 28,397 rounds -- during the period  December 1988 to December 1993, according to the institution.    The two most recent PGR operations took place between 28 May  and 4 June, in which its personnel managed to seize more than  28,544 rounds of ammunition in several actions in the country.  Both reports indicate that Nogales, Sonora, is where the PGR  has arrested the most gunrunners.    During the operations, which were conducted over the period  of a week, PGR personnel managed to seize almost as many rounds  of ammunition as were seized during the past 61 months of the  current government administration.    Statistics provided by the Deputy Attorney General's Office  for Delegations and Inspection Units [Subprocuraduria de  Delegaciones y Visitaduria] also show that during the current  year, 537 weapons and approximately 800 vehicles were seized  from alleged criminals; many of them linked to drug trafficking  activities. The weapons seized have been detected at road  checkpoints (precos), airports, and during investigations of  drug trafficking groups.    Regarding the entry of weapons and ammunition into the  country, the PGR has reported that the corresponding  investigations are under way to learn the origin and destination  of the shipments, as well as the identity of the persons  involved. In most cases, the PGR has not revealed the names of  the alleged criminals so as not to hinder the investigations.    PGR statistics establish that it has seized 60,156 rounds of  ammunition during the period 1 January-5 June 1994. Up to a  few days ago, the PGR had seized 31,712 cartridges. In its two  most recent operations, however, the PGR seized 28,544 rounds,  thus, increasing the amount to more than 60,000 live rounds.    The largest amount of ammunition was seized during the week  of 28 May, when 18,385 rounds were impounded and three persons  were arrested during the two operations carried out in Jalisco  and Tamaulipas. Later, the PGR seized a shipment of 9,400  rounds loaded on a van with California State license plates, at  the 49-km marker on the Jalisco-Nogales international highway.    PGR members also managed to impound a shipment of 7,676  rounds of various calibers and seven weapons last week. The  shipment was being transported by Ramon Isordia Pedroza and Jose  Zepeda Mora and was discovered at the 21-km checkpoint on the  Hermosillo-Nogales international highway.</p>

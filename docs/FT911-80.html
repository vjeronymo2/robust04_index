			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Cardiff hospitals may lose 200 jobs SOME 200 jobs are likely to be lost in Cardiff hospitals as a result of the decision of South Glamorgan Health Authority to privatise its cleaning services, writes Anthony Moreton. The authority says the move will lead to a saving of 'just under Pounds 1m, which will be ploughed back into patient services'. The authority, which has responsibility for the University of Wales teaching hospital as well as the city's Royal Infirmary, has followed government policy by opening up cleaning services to the private sector. The service companies estimate they will need about 800 of the present 1,000 staff.</p>

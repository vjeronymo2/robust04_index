			<p>BFN     [Text] Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys says  Russia appears to have hardened its position towards Lithuania.  The foreign minister, who is visiting Brazil, told the Russian  ITAR-TASS agency on Wednesday that he knew of no reasons why  Lithuanian-Russian relations should deteriorate.    According to Mr. Gylys, Russia is halting the ratification  of  the bilateral agreement on most favored nation status in trade  signed last autumn. Russia has already granted privileged trade  terms to 130 countries, however,this does not apply to the  Baltic states. Lithuania carries out its all commitments to  Russia and would like Moscow in its turn to observe its  obligations to Lithuania, said the Lithuanian foreign minister.</p>

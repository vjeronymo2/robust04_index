			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Unions may lose role in wage-fixing AUSTRALIA'S powerful trade unions will lose their main tool of influence, the centralised wage-fixing system, if the conservative opposition wins federal elections next year. The coalition of the opposition Liberal and National parties yesterday unveiled a blueprint of a radical industrial relations policy which, if implemented, would give employees and employers the right to negotiate directly with each other, with or without union involvement. All conditions will be up for negotiation, except for four minimum guarantees: minimum hourly rates for adult and youth workers, four weeks' annual leave, two weeks non-cumulative sick leave and 12 months unpaid maternity leave. Under the existing centralised wage-fixing system, about 80 per cent of the Australian work force, whether union members or not, are covered by minimum employment standards agreed by the unions, the employers and the government through the Industrial Relations Commission. The ruling Labor Party considers industrial relations policy as another major battleground for federal elections set for the middle of next year. The opposition's intention to introduce a goods and services tax has already provided fodder for initial campaigning. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, branded the opposition a 'prices up and wages down' party. 'First they want to tax everything you can shoot with a 15 per cent goods and services tax, and now they want to cut your pay,' he said. Reaction by unions and business was predictable. Unions said the policy would leave workers with only two choices: take the employers' conditions or take the sack. Business tentatively welcomed the policy as a significant step towards a more sensible wages system.</p>

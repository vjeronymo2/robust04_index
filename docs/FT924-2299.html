			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Problem will stay on ministers' agenda  -Macedonia GREECE has temporarily succeeded in blocking European Community recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, but the problem remains on the agenda of foreign ministers. The concluding declaration of the Council on Macedonia was variously interpreted as being a victory for the Greek position or merely a postponement of a particularly delicate decision which could have scuttled the whole conference. Recognition of the former republic of Macedonia was examined by the Council 'in the context of the Lisbon Declaration and in the light of the report by the Presidency's special representative. It invites foreign ministers to remain seized of this question,' it said. The Greeks claim that to call the new state Macedonia would provoke ethnic conflict in the region, particularly by encouraging territorial claims on the neighbouring Greek province. It was agreed that the Community would provide Ecu100m (Pounds 80m) of humanitarian and technical assistance to Macedonia, half of which would be provided by the European Commission out of common funds and a matching amount from member states. Macedonians said yesterday they were deeply disappointed, but not surprised, by the EC's failure to recognise their republic, Laura Silber writes from Skopje.</p>

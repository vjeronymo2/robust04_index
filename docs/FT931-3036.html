			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Special treatment offered to voluntary scheme - Company Dividends from Abroad This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. A CONSULTATIVE document yesterday described a possible scheme for addressing the problem of surplus advance corporation tax arising on account of dividends paid by a company out of foreign source profits which have borne foreign tax. The Inland Revenue said: 'The main features of the scheme would be: It would be optional; A company could pay a foreign income dividend (FID) with special tax treatment; ACT would be payable on the FID in the normal way; If it was subsequently established that the FID had been paid out of foreign source profits, any surplus ACT in respect of the FID would be repayable by the Exchequer; In calculating any further tax due from shareholders on FIDs, they would be treated as receiving income which had borne income tax at the lower rate of 20 per cent under the Chancellor's proposals; there would be no further tax to be paid by shareholders liable at the lower or basic rate of tax, but a FID would not carry any tax credit; There would be special arrangements for intern-ational headquarter companies. 'The chancellor's intention in issuing the consultative document is to see whether an acceptable way can be found to relieve a long-standing problem for many of the companies which want to pay dividends out of foreign source profits. 'Following consultations, the chancellor intends to introduce legislation for the scheme in the Finance Bill due to be published in January 1994. The chancellor intends to legislate for a special scheme to make the UK more attractive as a location for international headquarter companies if, for whatever reason, it is not possible to introduce the full scheme. The budget also included a proposal to improve tax relief now available for expenditure incurred by enterprises before they begin trading. The Inland Revenue said this should be of particular benefit to companies undertaking infrastructure projects. First, he proposes to extend from five years to seven years the period for which businesses can claim relief for expenditure incurred before the start of trading. The new seven-year period will apply to individuals, partnerships or companies who start to trade on or after April 1 1993. Second, he proposes to extend the relief for pre-trading expenditure to certain types of interest and other expenses incurred by companies which currently fall outside the scope of the relief. The new relief will apply to companies which start to trade on or after April 1 1993. Third, he proposes to fill a gap in the relief available for expenditure on the preparation of a site for waste disposal. The scope of that relief is to be widened and, in particular, will extend to such expenditure incurred before trading begins. For anyone starting to trade on or after April 1 1993, such expenditure will be deemed to be incurred on the first day of trading. The chancellor's intention is to remove tax obstacles to the undertaking of projects, particularly those with lengthy lead times. The proposed changes should give enterprises greater freedom to structure their financial affairs before they start trading according to their own commercial considerations, rather than being driven by tax considerations.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petition would be expected to address mechanisms to establish with certainty the properties of the gasoline used in the covered area, and mechanisms to ensure the gasoline delivered for use in the covered area is not transported by a transferee of the gasoline (e.g., a truck distributor) for use in an adjoining attainment area or in another covered area. To the extent any of a party's gasoline is mixed with gasoline produced by another refiner or imported by another importer in the fungible gasoline distribution system, EPA believes the party would have serious difficulty achieving the product tracking certainties required for intra-covered area averaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes this intra-covered area averaging approach will have very limited, if any, application, because it requires precise tracking of the quality of gasoline that is produced by a single refiner or is imported by a single importer and used within a single covered area. It was the great difficulty in this type of gasoline tracking, voiced by refiners and downstream segments of the gasoline distribution system, that gave rise to the general reformulated gasoline averaging approach included in the final rule_of refinery-level averaging combined with covered area gasoline quality surveys. Having established mechanisms to accomplish averaging on a nationwide basis, EPA believes it should sanction separate, intra-covered area averaging only if there is complete certainty the intra-covered area approach can be carried out successfully and in a manner subject to full enforcement oversight. EPA further believes the petition-approach included for intra-covered area averaging is the best means of accomplishing this certainty, without promulgating an additional extensive regulatory scheme.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Conventional Gasoline Marker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposed intent to designate the chemical phenolphthalein as the required marker for conventional gasoline has been subjected to reconsideration on the basis of phenolphthalein field tests conducted using the gasoline pipeline operated by the Amoco Oil Company in Mandan, North Dakota by the American Petroleum Institute and Amoco. The results of those field tests suggest that phenolphthalein may not perform to EPA's expectations for reliably distinguishing conventional gasoline from reformulated gasoline. Specifically, the field tests suggest that phenolphthalein does not adequately mix with conventional gasoline and may act to contaminate water, metal surfaces and/or other petroleum products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, EPA has elected not to issue a final rule governing conventional gasoline markers at this time. Instead, EPA has undertaken further investigation of alternative markers with interested petroleum and chemical companies. EPA intends to publish a new proposal for the conventional gasoline marker, and to promulgate a final conventional gasoline marker rule based on this proposal. Interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Responsibilities of Refiners and Oxygenate Blenders <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The introduction to this Preamble section describes the various responsibilities of refiners and oxygenate blenders under the reformulated gasoline program. Comments were received requesting clarification of the requirements that would apply in a case where more than one party is involved in a refinery or oxygenate blending operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations define the terms ``refiner,'' ``refinery,'' ``oxygenate blender,'' and ``oxygenate blending facility.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``oxygenate blender'' includes a party that owns or controls the blendstocks or gasoline used or the gasoline produced at an oxygenate blending facility. This definition is necessary in recognition of the practice of blendstock owners to specify the type and amount of oxygenates to be added by another party. Because the blendstock owner thus exercises control over the blending operation and affects the qualities of the finished gasoline, it is appropriate to include the product owner within the definition of oxygenate blenders and to impose responsibility for regulatory compliance on that party with substantial control over the quality of the final product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 80.2(h) defines refinery as ``a plant at which gasoline is produced.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 80.2(i) defines refiner as ``any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a refinery.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 80.2(ll) defines oxygenate blending facility as ``any facility (including a truck) at which oxygenate is added to gasoline or blendstock, and at which the quality or quantity of gasoline is not altered in any other manner except for the addition of deposit control additives.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 80.2(mm) defines oxygenate blender as ``any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises an oxygenate blending facility, or who owns or controls the blendstocks or gasoline used or the gasoline produced at an oxygenate blending facility.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of these definitions, there may be situations where more than one person meets the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender for a single refinery or oxygenate blending facility. For example, at an oxygenate blending facility there may be one person who owns the RBOB and oxygenate and causes those products to be combined to produce reformulated gasoline (who also could be a distributor or reseller), another person who owns the gasoline storage tanks in which the RBOB and oxygenate are combined (who also could be a truck or terminal carrier), and still another person who operates and controls the blending equipment at the facility on a day-to-day basis. Each of the parties described in this example independently meets the definition of oxygenate blender for the oxygenate blending facility described. A similar scenario, with more than one person meeting the definition of refiner, is possible in the case of a refinery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule provides that each person meeting the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender is independently responsible that standards and other requirements that attach to a refining or oxygenate blending operation must be met. This is the same requirement that attaches in other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs. For example, under the gasoline lead phasedown program, in cases where the lead phasedown standard is violated as a result of excess average lead content of gasoline produced, EPA holds each person meeting the refiner definition liable; and under the gasoline volatility program, in cases where the volatility standard is violated as a result of improper oxygenate blending, EPA holds each person meeting the definition of oxygenate blender liable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Russia and Ukraine agree to pay ADollars 100m wool debt THE Russian and Ukrainian governments have agreed to take joint responsibility for nearly ADollars 100m (Pounds 42.9m) owed to Australian wool exporters by Vnesheconombank, the former Soviet bank for foreign economic affairs, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney. Mr James Moore, insurance division manager for the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), said the governments had pledged to repay the debt as soon as conditions allowed. Russia and the Ukraine were the main destinations for wool shipped under a ADollars 500m revolving 240-day credit facility negotiated in 1990 between Vnesheconombank and Mr John Kerin, Australia's primary industries minister. The pact was intended to help keep Soviet woollen mills running and reduce growing stockpiles of Australian wool. But no payments have been made because of the uncertainties in the Soviet financial system following disintegration of the Soviet Union. Arrears will reach just under ADollars 100m if the next payment is missed. Mr Moore said EFIC was 'optimistic the people we are dealing with are doing their best to get this issue settled'.</p>

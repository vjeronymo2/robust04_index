Yi also delivered President Kim Yong-sam's intention to  invite Jiang to Seoul.    "Chinese economy has developed remarkably because of the  reform and openness policy of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and  Jiang," Yi said.    Yi proposed to expand cooperation and technology development  in automobile and electronics between the two countries.    Jiang replied that he will visit Seoul if he has a chance  just as he had promised with President Kim at the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting in Seattle last  November.    Jiang said he had ordered the related ministries to take  measures to boost cooperation in electronics and automobile with  South Korea.    On the North Korea's nuclear issue, Jiang asserted that a  peaceful solution is desirable through negotiations of concerned  parties.</p>

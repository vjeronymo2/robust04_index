			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPOSER KNOWS THE SCORE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE OSCAR-WINNING MAURICE JARRE HAS ANOTHER HIT ON HIS HANDS WITH  'GHOST.'  </P> <P> With more than 100 major scores behind him, 66-year-old film composer Maurice  Jarre enters the fifth decade of his career with little sign of tiring. This  year, not only has he scored four new movies, but last month the sound-track  album to one, "Ghost," crept into the Top 10 of the pop charts.  </P> <P> "It's very funny. We have to compete with heavy metal," said Jarre, with a  laugh, during a break in recording sessions for the new Paul Hogan comedy  "Almost An Angel" at Columbia Studios in Culver City. "I think the success of  the 'Ghost' sound track was a combination of a lot of things. The Righteous  Brothers have done a fabulous rendition of their song 'Unchained Melody' and  also there's the success of this romantic comedy itself."  </P> <P> Jarre's most recently released sound track, for the supernatural thriller  "Jacob's Ladder," also combines an old American song -- Al Jolson's "Sonny Boy"  -- with original music, to eerie, supernatural effect. The score's mix of  electronics, strange instruments and musical styles is vintage Jarre.  </P> <P> "From the beginning, I have always liked to mix ethnic instruments in my  music," he said. "Not necessarily to emphasize the ethnicity of the film. For  example, I don't use an oud because it is an Arab film or the bongos because it  is Mexican. But I hear very interesting things in ethnic music, numerous points  of sound. In 'Jacob's Ladder,' we had an interesting sound with a Japanese  instrument called the shakuhachi. When you use that strange sound, it gives it  a sort of nightmarish quality."  </P> <P> Jarre credits Southern California for supplying him not only with the latest  technology in synthesizers, but a multicultured variety of musicians.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles is just the place," he said. "You can find anything here. For  'Jacob's Ladder,' we had this marvelous sarangi player from India who just  happened to be touring here. When these French snobs say, 'Maurice, how can you  survive in Los Angeles? It is such a cultural desert.' I say, 'Oh really? How  many times did you go to a concert last month?' And they say, 'Well, I was very  busy.' I say, 'I was very busy, too, but I went to hear an orchestra from  Cologne, one from Canada, an ensemble of Chinese instruments and dance from  Thailand.' But there is cultural snobbery everywhere."  </P> <P> Originally a composition student of Arthur Honegger at the Paris Conservatoire,  Jarre started his career as a percussionist and composer, often collaborating  on background and incidental music for the stage with composer-conductor Pierre  Boulez. His earliest sound tracks from the early 1950s include films by Georges  Franju and Alain Resnais.  </P> <P> But it was in 1962 that he became an international celebrity with his  Oscar-winning score to British director David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia." His  other two collaborations with Lean, "Doctor Zhivago" (1965) and "Passage to  India"(1984), also earned him Oscars.  </P> <P> Jarre, who has lived in Los Angeles for 26 years, has worked on films from  eight different countries, including the People's Republic of China. In  addition to masterfully written and conducted orchestral scores, his pioneering  use of electronic music makes him a significant innovator in his field -- from  the use of ondes martinot in "Lawrence of Arabia" to his finely-honed ensemble  of synthesizer wizards in movies like "After Dark, My Sweet" and "Jacob's  Ladder."  </P></p>

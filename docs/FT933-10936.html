			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Property: The beauty that makes Wales so hard to resist - Gerald Cadogan finds cottages the best bet in a country closer to England than France from middle England, especially. With a short drive, you are in a foreign country where names are hard to pronounce and people talk and sing a language incomprehensible to outsiders. Far closer to England than France, Wales is just as stimulating a change, although there is one hitch. If you are English, there is a chance that a tiny minority of Welshmen - who do not like English people buying second homes there - may burn your holiday cottage. Still, it happens less than it did a few years ago. How do you avoid such a fate? As one Welshman told me: 'Do not pay over the odds for your house so that you are contributing to a property market that many local people cannot afford. And do not arrive with a car load of groceries from an English supermarket. Use the local shops.' Occasional arson apart, the country is glorious. North Wales is like a miniature Scotland without the midges and Anglesey flat like Ireland, with low stone walls around white-painted cottages. There is a noble parade of castles, ranging from the mighty creations that Edward I built at Conwy and Caernarfon to subdue the country to oddities like the Normanesque granite pile of Penrhyn, erected last century on the profits of a neighbouring slate quarry. On the the A55 north Wales highway, it takes barely 40 minutes to reach Anglesey from Liverpool and Manchester, and the A483 connects with it to give a fast link for drivers from Oswestry, Shrewsbury and points in England via the A5 and M54. West of Shrewsbury, the Welshpool bypass is about to open, while south Wales waits for the second bridge over the Severn to end delays at the present bridge on the M4. Cottages are the best bet in Wales. Houses of manor, rectory or large farmhouse size are few and tend to be 19th century, while stately homes are still scarcer. This is because, until the industrial revolution, Wales never had the wealth that England enjoyed. Thus, grand houses were not built. For potential buyers, where better to start than the former chapel and chapel house at Dernol, between Llangurig and Rhayader in the Wye valley of mid-Wales. On offer from Morris Marshall &amp; Poole for Pounds 44,000, it could not be more Welsh. The stone chapel with slate roof has outline planning permission for conversion with the adjoining cottage as a single house. But use as licensed premises is forbidden. From the same agent for Pounds 110,000 is a 1907 Arts and Crafts-style house in the middle of Llangurig Penybont. The price includes a coach house (if that is not sold separately for Pounds 25,000). On the opposite (west) side of the Cambrian Mountains, Hafod Mansion Gardens in Pontrhydygroes 14 miles from Aberystwyth, has specimen trees and two acres of walled gardens. Price: Pounds 138,000, from Shearer and Morris. And in Cemmaes, the Machynlleth office of the firm offers the Georgian Aberhiriaeth Hall with five bedrooms for Pounds 220,000. South from Aberystwyth in the Cothi valley, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a farmhouse and two cottages at Edwinsford as three lots with fishing (two rods per property) on the river. The Cothi is especially good for sea trout. Prices are Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 250,000. In west Wales, Cliff House at Laugharne was re-built in 1986 after a fire. It has views across the Taf estuary and Carmarthen Bay to Pembrey Sands and Worms Head on the Gower peninsula while below, on the water's edge, is the Boathouse of poet Dylan Thomas. Agent Terry Thomas is selling it for Pounds 250,000. On the nearby Towy estuary, the same agent offers the Edwardian brick Pilroath at Llangain for Pounds 205,000; it also has views of Carmarthen Bay. Inland, near Abergavenny, Elstons has Pantybeiliau, an 1840 late-Georgian stucco house with eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, walled garden, paddocks, and views over the Usk valley towards the Black Mountains. Near the Roman site of Caerleon and five miles from Usk is Llwyn Celyn (also Elstons), another stuccoed property with nine bedrooms but just three bathrooms. Both houses cost around Pounds 500,000, depending on how much land is included. If you want to fish on the Usk, Mardy Cottage at Llanwenarth Citra, near Abergavenny, is not a cottage but a house with half a mile of single-bank angling. Halifax is the agent and the price around Pounds 185,000. Llanarithon, at Howey near Llandrindod Wells, is a brick and stone farmhouse on the Welsh borders. It is detached from its farmland and has only eight acres (for Pounds 225,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Russell Baldwin &amp; Bright). But up to 175 more acres, and modern agricultural buildings, are available if you want to farm. In north Wales, Hillway is a 1930s' seaside house with nine acres overlooking the Dwyryd estuary at Morfa Bychan, near Porthmadog . Gardens flourish in this sun trap and the price (from Jackson-Stops) is an attractive Pounds 185,000. If you want high ground and a studio barn, the same firm offers Creua, at nearby Llanfrothen, for Pounds 175,000. A 7.25-inch railway, built by the present owner, runs round the garden and is also available - but the locomotives are not. Further inland is Hafod Tan-y-Graig, in Snowdonia national park. This substantial Victorian gabled house in seven acres of woods and garden is offered by Jackson-Stops for Pounds 245,000. Here, you can fish for trout in the river Edno, go for walks, climb mountains - and see what a beautiful country Wales is.

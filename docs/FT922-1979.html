			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Larger Irish institutions hoped to reduce stakes IRISH institutional investors and shareholders that had together planned to dispose of some 6.5m shares in yesterday's combined offering in GPA Group, were unwilling to comment on the company's surprise decision to withdraw the offer. But there was widespread unhappiness elsewhere in Dublin. 'The signals in the London market had been there for weeks,' one banker said. 'The failure of the offer has a lot to do with GPA's own arrogance. GPA was forcing the pace the whole time over the price of the offer. You can't push institutions uphill, and GPA weren't prepared to recognise that. For years they have been promising a public offer, but then they kept turning to the institutions and asking them to keep their holdings for another year. They have lost a lot of friends like that'. Although some existing GPA shareholders were due to reduce their stakes, institutions and retail investors had been expected to buy a total of between Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.2m) and Dollars 40m of new shares in Dublin. As a result, Irish institutions would have shown a net increase of about Dollars 20m in their holdings. Mr Mike Moroney of Goodbody stockbrokers said a number of the larger institutions already holding GPA stock were looking to reduce their exposure, as once floated GPA would have represented 20 per cent of the Dublin stock market's market capitalisation. He said that the target exposure to GPA as a percentage of their Irish market portfolios that the institutions were aiming at was about 6 per cent. 'Some would have been wanting to reduce their level to that, others would have been looking to get in', he said.</p>

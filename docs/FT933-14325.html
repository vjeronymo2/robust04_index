			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Russia on alert over Afghan clash GENERAL Konstantin Kobets, the Russian deputy defence minister, yesterday demanded the right to use 'all possible force', including aircraft and rockets, in the escalating conflict on the border between the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Gen Kobets' call, which comes three years after Russian troops pulled out of Afghanistan, followed an attack on a border post manned by a joint unit of Russian and Tajik interior troops which left 20 Russians dead. The Tajik foreign ministry said a village eight miles from the border with Afghanistan was destroyed and between 100 and 200 Tajiks killed. In a second appearance before the parliament after it had postponed a decision on legalising the actions of Russian troops in Tajikistan, Gen Kobets said 'the twelfth border post fell today - I cannot guarantee that the thirteenth will hold. The way in to Tajikistan lies open.' Gen Pavel Grachev, defence minister, told the official Itar-Tass agency that extra units of the Russian 201st division stationed in Tajikistan would be sent to the Afghan border. Refugees from the civil strife which devastated parts of the republic last year are massed in camps within Afghanistan, which now function as bases for trans-border guerrilla actions supported by Afghan mujahideen. The Tajik government, formed by forces supported by the former Communists, invited Russian troops earlier this year to assist in guarding the borders.</p>

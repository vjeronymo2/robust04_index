			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Garcia Villalobos, undersecretary of </F> government, at the Government Secretariat by unidentified  reporter on 2 January; place not given; from an XEW "Special  Report" -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Would you give us a rundown on the  incidents in Chiapas State over the past 2 days?    [Villalobos] Yesterday, 1 January, the Government  Secretariat  issued a news bulletin. I would like to quote parts of that  bulletin. Throughout 1 January the Mexican Army and Police  refrained from taking any action whatsoever despite the fact  that an armed group had taken over several cities in the area of  Ocosingo, Chiapas. This armed group is endangering the lives of  the residents of these communities, and consequently the state  and municipal authorities issue a call for order to be  reestablished, for the members of the group to desist, and for a  dialogue to be held to find a solution to this situation that is  painful for all Mexicans.    Today, which is the second day of the incident, the armed  group left the town of San Cristobal de las Casas. The group  then carried out an act of aggression by heading toward a  military installation and engaging in a clash with the Mexican  Army. The military authorities already have reported on this  incident. The authorities and the residents themselves of the  town of San Cristobal de las Casas and its environs would like  this armed group to cease its activities and participate in a  dialogue with the authorities. There is a broad offer from all  three levels of government -- municipal, state, and federal --  for the lines of communication to be opened to respond to the  specific demands that the group has been making.    On earlier occasions talks have been held with groups from  this area. Important steps were taken in August regarding a  number of requests that were made quite some time ago, and we  believe that substantial progress has been made in the area over  the past five years. Nonetheless, the invitation stands for  communication to begin with authorities at any of the three  levels of government. This is a request from the people of  Chiapas, and the municipal, state, and federal authorities are  heeding this request with great interest.    [Reporter] In the past few hours there was an exchange of  gunfire between the two parties. How many casualties have been  registered so far?    [Villalobos] Several casualty counts have been provided over  the past two days. I would like to refer to some of them. So  far 26 policemen and civilians have been killed; one Red Cross  volunteer was tortured and killed; 24 civilians were injured;  and one woman was raped. Regarding the clash you mention, which  I presume is the clash with the Mexican Army in the area of  Rancho Nuevo, the Army itself has already reported that five  soldiers were killed and six were wounded. The bodies of 24  rebels were found, as well as a large amount of materiel that  the rebels had abandoned. Among the abandoned materiel there  are weapons of the type used by the armies of several countries,  as well as non-military-issue firearms, knives, and other  articles such as two tear gas grenades. This is the result of  two days of actions in that area.    [Reporter] What message can the federal government give to  the residents of Chiapas at this difficult time?    [Villalobos] This is an unusual situation, of course, so I  believe the people of Chiapas know that they should remain calm.  Civilian organizations as well as the municipal authorities have  asked for more direct action by the Mexican Army to prevent  other possible clashes. Consequently, the people should remain  calm and follow any instructions given to protect them. We hope  that this situation will be resolved shortly.    [Reporter] Would you like to add anything more, sir?    [Villalobos] I would like to ask those who have been  carrying  out these unusual actions to cease and desist.</p>

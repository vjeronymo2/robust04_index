			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Tibet has just started  eight major construction projects in three river valleys --  those of the Yarlung Zangbo, the Lhasa and the Nyangqu -- as  part of efforts to boost the economic development of this  underdeveloped autonomous region.    With an investment of 222.8 million yuan so far, these  projects, to be completed in two to three years, are mainly  small and medium- sized ones in agriculture, water conservancy,  forestry and technology-related industries needing relatively  small investment but promising quick returns.    The projects underway are two bridges, two reservoirs, two  power stations and two power transmission lines.    A local official said that Tibet plans to start a total of  58  construction projects with an annual investment of 167.5 million  yuan this year as part of the three-rivers comprehensive  development program.    According to him, the central and regional governments will  invest 2.1 billion yuan in the ten-year program, which is  expected to boost the total industrial and agricultural output  value of the valleys from 840 million yuan in 1990 to 1.724  billion yuan in the year 2000.</p>

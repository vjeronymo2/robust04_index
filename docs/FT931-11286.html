			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Electrolux cuts dividend by half on poor outlook ELECTROLUX, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers, began Sweden's corporate reporting season on a gloomy note yesterday when it announced it was halving its 1992 dividend to SKr6.25 a share. The move, which is almost certain to be followed by other hard-pressed Swedish companies, came in spite of virtually unchanged profits of SKr1bn (Pounds 87m) for the year. The company said it was making the cut because of the uncertain market outlook, particularly in Europe, and worse than expected conditions over the past year. Mr Anders Scharp, chairman, said: 'We have had three weak years, when we held the dividend, and we cannot be optimistic about the coming year. Although we are expecting a better year in the US, in Europe we are faced with declining demand in some countries, currency changes, high real interest rates, and political unrest.' It is the first time the company has cut its dividend in at least 30 years, and takes the payout back to its 1984 level. Last year profit after financial items slid to SKr1bn from SKr1.03bn as turnover rose to SKr80.4bn from SKr79.0bn. Operating income fell 13 per cent to SKr2.25bn while earnings per share after tax dropped to SKr2.50 from SKr5.20. Electrolux said income grew in North America but declined in Europe. The dividend cut pushed the group's share price down SKr13 to SKr212 and set the tone for the Stockholm bourse, where shares traded lower.</p>

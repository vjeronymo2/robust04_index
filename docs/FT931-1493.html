			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / N Sea group may halve exploration after oil tax change AMERADA HESS, one of the most active companies in North Sea oil exploration, has threatened to halve its exploration programme this year and cut jobs because of tax changes an-nounced in the Budget last week. The company, which will be one of the hardest hit in the North Sea by proposed rules on petroleum revenue tax, said it would also pull out of many applications for government licences to explore in the UK. 'This is not an idle threat, we are doing what is necessary to survive,' said Mr Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada, the UK arm of the international US oil company. Mr Laidlaw said that, even with its plans to cut exploration by 50 per cent, its profit level will still suffer. Last week, Mr Norman Lamont announced that the rate of petroleum revenue tax for existing fields in the North Sea will be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. But more importantly, for companies such as Amerada, he abolished PRT relief on the costs of oil exploration and appraisal. North Sea operators estimate that the cost of exploring will quadruple as a result of the Budget changes. Mr Harold Hughes, head of the UK Offshore Operators' Association, said: 'The proposals represent a major disincentive to future exploration activity which is the life blood of the North Sea.' A group of oil experts including several exploration directors of leading oil companies have written to newspapers denouncing the chancellor's tax changes. Amerada said the new regime would cut profits from Pounds 2 a barrel to 10p a barrel for a small discovery such as its Angus field, estimated to contain 10m barrels of oil. 'The profit under the old regime was pretty small. No one would contemplate developing a field for 10p a barrel and this is the future life-blood of the North Sea,' Mr Laidlaw said. The new UK regime would make Norway and Australasia more attractive prospects. The company is considering job cuts in its exploration department and laying off two rigs which it had contracted. Mr Laidlaw estimated that the industry could lose several thousand jobs in the short term and more over the longer term as a result of the new PRT rules. Mr Laidlaw said Amerada would pull out of applications it had already made to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to drill some North Sea blocks. Mr Richard Hardman, Amerada's exploration director, said the company would probably drill four wells next year as opposed to eight or 10 under the existing tax regime. Overall, he estimated that companies would drill 80 to 100 wells in the North Sea this year compared with 130 last year. The DTI is expected to announce results of the 14th licensing round in May. Applicant companies must commit to drill a certain number of wells within a particular time - since these will now not be eligible for tax relief, many companies are reassessing their commitments. Mr Laidlaw is lobbying for changes in the PRT proposals, arguing that only one or two large companies in the North Sea would be net beneficiaries of the new rules. Observer, Page 21</p>

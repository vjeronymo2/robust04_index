			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: The Limited slides in second quarter Continuing weakness in sales of women's clothing caused net profits at The Limited, the US retailing group, to tumble to Dollars 53.8m in the second quarter to July from Dollars 68.2m in the same period last year, the company said yesterday. However, Nordstrom, another clothing retailer, showed a strong recovery. The Limited saw good performances from its lingerie, men's, girls' and personal care products businesses during the quarter, but these were insufficient to outweigh poor results from the The Limited and Lerner New York chains, where store-for-store sales fell by 13 per cent. Group sales fell to Dollars 1.59bn from Dollars 1.69bn and earnings per share to 15 cents from 19 cents. For the half-year, sales fell to Dollars 3.07bn from Dollars 3.21bn, net income to Dollars 101.1m from Dollars 112.5m, and earnings per share to 28 cents from 31 cents. Among The Limited's best performers was the Bath &amp; Body Works personal care products business, which recorded the highest store-for-store sales increases in the company. The Limited expects to open its first Bath &amp; Body Works stores in the UK this year in partnership with Next, the British retailer. Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive, said stocks in the women's apparel businesses were planned to avoid an overhang of summer merchandise into the autumn. 'As a result, we are positioned to improve the sales and earning opportunities as our fall merchandise moves into the stores,' he said. The Limited's fall was in sharp contrast with that of Nordstrom, which lifted net income to Dollars 63m from Dollars 42.7m on turnover up 6 per cent at Dollars 1.08bn. The company said the rise was mainly attributable to better margins, particularly on women's clothing. Earnings per share rose to 77 cents from 52 cents. For the half-year, net income was 76 per cent ahead at Dollars 95m.</p>

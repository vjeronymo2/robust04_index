			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Palace guard is power behind Yeltsin's throne General Alexander Korzhakov is the most powerful secret policeman in the world. Head of President Boris Yeltsin's personal guard, he has been revealed - by the leaking in yesterday's FT of a letter he wrote to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, instructing him to review agreements he had made with the World Bank - as an official who acts on his own authority in the core decisions on the Russian economy. For a man who was until the early 1990s a middle ranking officer in the KGB, this is a remarkable rise. It is also a disturbing one. General Korzhakov's influence stems from his closeness to the president and from his command of a guard which has swollen to a force of several thousand, comprising elite detachments trained in anti-terrorist warfare and intelligence operations. All major states have such forces but they are generally distanced from ministerial decisions, are under some form of legislative oversight and are increasingly obliged to present an account of their activities to the public. General Korzhakov answers to President Yeltsin alone. If his actions are masked, his influence is an open matter. He has for the past year featured among the top 20 most influential figures in Russia, published monthly in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. President Yeltsin himself named him in his recent memoirs as his closest and most trusted aide, and as a friend. He earned that trust. Assigned to Mr Yeltsin as his KGB guard when the latter joined the politbureau in 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Korzhakov stayed with Mr Yeltsin in his wilderness years after 1988, when he was ejected from the politbureau and left the Communist party. He suffered too. He was fired from the KGB's ninth department (the politbureau guards), being promoted to colonel only when Mr Yeltsin became head of the Russian Supreme Soviet. After the latter was elected president of Russia, he was promoted again, to major general. General Korzhakov's presidential security service was then part of the main guard department, the force commanded by Lieutenant General Mikhail Barsukov. According to the Kommersant daily, which researched the force a year ago, it already comprised the presidential guard, a motorised rifle brigade, the former KGB ninth department, part of the KGB's fifth department which had specialised in spying on dissidents, elements of the KGB's technical operations department and the elite anti-terrorist forces named Alpha and Vympel. In his only (uninformative) interview, given to Nezavimiaya Gazeta on November 16 this year, General Korzhakov revealed that the presidential guard had for the past year not been under the control of General Barsukov's main guard department. 'In November 1993,' he said, 'its status was raised - the service left the main guard department and received greater independence in dealing with day to day issues which did not contradict the existing legislation, in accordance with the will of the president'. General Korzhakov did not refer to a decree or law conferring this independence on his department. Asked by the interviewer what his basic function was, he said the most important part of it was acquiring information on any threat to the security of the president. 'We invest this part of our work with the greatest importance, and we certainly pay particular attention to any information touching on the spheres of our interests.' General Korzhakov is coming more and more into the limelight - a position he will not like. It is rumoured he made the decision Mr Yeltsin should not be woken to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the then Irish prime minister, at Shannon airport in September. Earlier this month, members of his service arrested and beat up the head of the personal guard of Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, chairman of the Most finance group, outside the group's headquarters in central Moscow. The reason they gave was Mr Gusinsky's guard was armed, and travelling on the route taken by the president. The insiders' explanation was it was designed to frighten Mr Gusinsky, and through him his close ally, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the powerful mayor of Moscow, seen as a competitor to Mr Yeltsin. These palace intrigues reflect an administration with no strong centre, but with secretive barons acting in the name of the titular head. Mr Yeltsin, only just out of a clinic, is thought to work relatively few hours a day. In his absence, the running of the office falls on those who enjoy his greatest trust. General Korzhakov is chief among them.</p>

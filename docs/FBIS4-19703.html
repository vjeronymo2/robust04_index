			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood article: "Delors Vows To Ruin Hurd </F> Deal on EC Voting"]    [Text] The President of the European Commission [EC], M  Jacques Delors, vowed yesterday to use all his powers to render  worthless the limited concessions Britain obtained in the row  over voting rights.    In a debate last month, the Prime Minister staked much of  his  credibility on defending the compromise negotiated by Mr Douglas  Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, saying it would protect British  interests.    But yesterday, M Delors told the European Parliament that,  given his "constant concern to strengthen the decisionmaking of  the Union and its capacity for action" and the fact that he had  opposed the compromise, he had "embarked on a damage-limitation  exercise." He declared that the compromise agreement "is  political declaration, not legal text" and that the Commission  retained the power to declare that the "reasonable period" for  delaying decisions had been exhausted.    To force a vote to go through, with the blocking minority at  27, would require the support of only half the EC members. In  the circumstances, that would be an easy proposition.    He also stressed that the British concession will only last  until voting procedures are reviewed in 1996.    M Delors fears any attempt by Britain to slowdown EC  decisionmaking.    Britain lost its battle to freeze the number of votes  required to block EC decisions at 23 when the EC is enlarged  with the addition of four new members next year.    The "blocking minority" will rise to 27, thus making it  harder for Britain to block EC decisions.    But, as a sop to the British, the EC agreed that, in cases  where 23 votes are mustered against a proposal but not the full  27, there will be a "reasonable delay" while consensus is sought.    Even this minimal concession has annoyed federalist-minded  Euro-MPs, many of whom may vote against the treaty admitting  Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway to the EC because of it.  For them, any widening of the EC must be accompanied by  "deepening" -- further integration -- to prevent the wheels of  the Community from seizing up. Enough of these MEPs [Member of  the European Parliament] may oppose the enlargement treaty, or  abstain, to prevent it from going through, and the EC is  embarked on an attempt to persuade them to vote positively on  May 4.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kartashkov report: "Bosnia Is Only a Picnic... </F> Why Do the Crimean Tatars Need Chechen Arms?"]    [Text] A few days ago chiefs of Russia's various special  services, foreign and internal affairs ministers, and senior  staffers of the presidential administration received a fact  sheet saying that "certain groups in Chechnya have organized the  illegal delivery of small and other arms designed for the  Crimean Tatars living on the peninsula. The weapons are  allegedly to be used to carry out provocations during the  "all-people's poll" in Crimea, particularly, in order to prod  the Black Sea Fleet toward active steps to prevent disturbances  and to cause its standoff with Kiev."    Last year, when Russia halted its oil and oil product  deliveries to Ukraine, Kiev signed an agreement on fuel supplies  with Azerbaijan. Since Ukraine did not have money at the time,  it paid with weapons. Now a part of the weapons is being  returned as surplus commodities (!). One year ago, these  "surplus commodities" were used to carry out active combat  operations in Nagorno-Karabakh.    It is hard to believe that the Ukrainian leaders are unaware  of the upcoming provocations. All the more so because recently  Kiev has been replacing its troops in Crimea (primarily command  personnel): servicemen hailing from Russia and the republic's  eastern and southern regions are being replaced with those  coming from western Ukraine. Also from there, "separate groups  and formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' special purpose  units" are being moved up to Crimea.    Last week, the conflict in Odessa briefly plunged the world  into shock. The split of the fleet, which has been going on for  several years already and which is seen in Moscow as a family  dispute over property rights, has been assessed in the West as  nothing less than a standoff between two nuclear powers. Former  President Richard Nixon said in an interview for THE NEW YORK  TIMES: "A conflict between Russia and Ukraine could make us see  the events in Bosnia as a picnic organized by Sunday school  children."</p>

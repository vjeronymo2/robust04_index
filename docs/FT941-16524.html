			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / More adults attempt to slim A third of adults in the UK are trying to slim at any one time, Mintel, the market intelligence group, says today. Ten years ago the proportion was only a quarter. The slimming foods market, which Mintel calculates was worth Pounds 67m in 1993, traditionally receives a boost in January following the excesses of Christmas. Mintel highlights concerns that while some of those dieting have no medical need to slim, others who are overweight are doing nothing to shed their excess pounds. Women are more likely to be dieting unnecessarily and men to be avoiding slimming. Government research suggests that 37 per cent of men are overweight, compared with 24 per cent of women, says the study. Yet Mintel analyst Ms Helen Ruddick said that a survey of more than 25,000 adults for the report showed that nearly 41 per cent of women, compared with 23 per cent of men, said they were trying to slim. Sales of slimming foods reached a new high last year, following a slump at the beginning of the decade when the sector's value plummeted to about Pounds 25m. The decline was caused mainly by the demise of very low-calorie diets of drinks, soups and bars that were intended to take the place entirely of normal eating. These extreme diets have been superseded by 'meal replacements' which are designed as alternatives to some main meals but not as the sole source of nutrition, says Mintel. The report forecasts further growth in the sector during the next four years, partly because of demographic changes - the number of women aged from 25 to 54 is expected to increase by 4 per cent during the period. Yet some restrictions are expected in the advertising of slimming products as a result of European Union legislation. Mintel also warns manufacturers that 'dieters are notoriously fickle' and that many who regain lost weight 'may give up on products they have tried before, and will continue to look for new ways to get slim - the next miracle cure'.

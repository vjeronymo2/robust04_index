			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Life groups face compensation bills Life insurance companies could be forced to pay part of the costs of compensating people who were wrongly advised by independent financial advisers, even if the insurer did not employ the adviser directly, under proposals from a City watchdog. The Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulating body for retail financial services, yesterday set out how its members should handle claims for compensation for pension transfers from occupational pension schemes sold by independent financial advisers. Such advisers are often self-employed and have limited resources. It is feared that many could be forced into default, leaving compensation to be paid by others. The proposal is likely to anger life insurers who, although they have accepted pension-transfer business sold by independent financial advisers, have said they are not liable because they do not employ or supervise independent advisers directly. The PIA said it proposed to 'ring-fence' liabilities from pension transfer claims. In the event of default by an adviser, other independent advisers under the same regulator would be required to help meet the bill up to a set cap. If the claims were larger than the cap, then life insurers who had accepted business from independent advisers since the Financial Services Act took effect in 1988 would be required to pay the balance. The PIA also said it has addressed concerns about professional indemnity insurance for advisers who found their cover suspended following revelations of mis-selling of pension transfers. It has convened a panel of insurers who will provide cover for those who meet set standards. Those who cannot meet the standards can obtain insurance through an 'assigned risk pool' where they can remain for up to 24 months, ensuring that they are not immediately forced out of business.</p>

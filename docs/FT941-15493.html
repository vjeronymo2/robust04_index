			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bankers salvage little from late bail-out Yesterday's sale by eight banks of the operating business of Magnet ends the saga of one of the worst of the many poor lending decisions of the late 1980s, writes Maggie Urry. The business, bought by its management through a leveraged deal in July 1989 for Pounds 629m, has been sold for Pounds 56m. Senior lenders to the buy-out put in Pounds 372.5m. They were headed by Bankers Trust, the American bank which at the time was trying to make a name for itself in the London market as an innovative provider of finance. Mezzanine lenders contributed Pounds 190m, a larger than usual amount. With substantial interest on the debt being rolled up into the capital in the intervening years, Airedale Holdings, Magnet's parent company, had debts of Pounds 800m by the time it went into receivership two days before Christmas 1992. On the same day, the banks which were the original senior lenders bought the operating company from the receiver. It is these banks which have now sold to Berisford at what appears to be a knock down price. Bankers Trust declines to comment on the whole sorry episode. But one banker involved privately admitted, with masterly understatement, that 'it was a mistake'. The mbo was doomed from the start. Management, led by Mr Tom Duxbury, then chairman, launched its bid in April 1989. Pre-tax profits for the financial year just ended were estimated at Pounds 72.7m, including Pounds 12.2m of property profits. Bankers were told that profits would grow at an annual 15 per cent. As it turned out, according to Berisford, Magnet made a trading profit of only Pounds 30m, excluding property profits, in the year to March 1989, and the following year suffered a Pounds 23m loss, which rose to Pounds 26m in 1992. Delays in completing the mbo - caused by complaints from some institutional investors - meant it was not signed until July that year. By then the retail market was turning sour, as interest rates rose and housing activity fell, and other leveraged buy-outs, such as MFI and Lowndes Queensway, were meeting problems paying interest on increasingly expensive debt. So when Bankers Trust attempted to syndicate the loan in early August it was unable to do so. By October - only three months after the deal was completed - Magnet was in refinancing talks with its banks. Discussions were concluded that Christmas, and Mr Duxbury resigned. Mr John Foulkes, chief executive, was given a bonus deal of Pounds 1m in 1991 and Pounds 2m in 1992. But by June 1990 Magnet was again unable to meet interest payments and terms had to be renegotiated once more. By this time the mezzanine debt and equity were worthless. Apart from the fatal flaw of lending in the first place, the banks made a second grave mistake. They failed to take security over the trading assets of Magnet, which were held in a subsidiary company. The banks could not force Magnet to sell assets in order to repay debt. As the recession worsened, Airedale's losses rose and in the year to March 1992 reached Pounds 125.1m, by which time it had negative net worth of Pounds 591.8m. There appears to be nothing, beyond the Pounds 56m sale price, that the banks can salvage from the wreckage, although litigation continues. Lawsuits were started by GE Capital, which put up Pounds 70m of the mezzanine debt and which sued the company and Bankers Trust, and by Bankers Trust, which sued Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, over its role in the mbo. The latter suit is expected to come to court in October. The mbo backers are thus severe losers from the saga - and some would argue are now compounding their losses by selling at the bottom of the market. The winners must be the Magnet shareholders who, however reluctantly, sold in 1989, and perhaps Berisford's shareholders if Magnet's new owner succeeds in returning it to profits.</p>

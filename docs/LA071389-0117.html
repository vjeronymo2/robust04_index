			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> CHILD ABUSE EFFORT FUNDED  </P> <P> A Pasadena-based program that strives to keep abused children with their  parents rather than placing them in foster homes will continue to operate for  another year, thanks to additional funding included in the 1989-90 budget and  approved by Gov. Deukmejian last week.  </P> <P> Hillsides Home for Children is one of eight nonprofit agencies in California  that will receive a total of $1.2 million during fiscal 1989-90 to hire  professional therapists to make regular visits to the homes of abused children.  The pilot programs were started in 1984, and preliminary reports show they are  75% successful in keeping families together.  </P> <P> Hillsides' In-Home Critical Care program treats 100 San Gabriel Valley families  each year. Its staff includes four full-time therapists, one part-time social  worker and one full-time project director. The program operates on a $200,000  annual budget, 75% of which is provided by the state.  </P> <P> "We were delighted because if the governor did not extend the projects they  would have died out," said Steve Madison, president of the board of directors  of the California Consortium of Child Abuse Councils, which lobbied the  governor in support of the programs.  </P> <P> Madison said his organization hopes that the programs will be made permanent  through legislation.  </P></p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Major stresses solid opposition to devaluation: Pound's realignment would be 'betrayal' MR JOHN MAJOR last night staked his government's political authority on the value of sterling with an uncompromising refusal to contemplate devaluation in the European exchange rate mechanism. In a speech billed by Downing Street as unequivocal evidence of his determination to resist the speculation on currency markets, the prime minister said a realignment of the pound's ERM parity would be 'a betrayal of our future'. Senior aides said the comments were intended to signal that even if other European currencies were devalued against the D-mark in a general ERM realignment, the government would seek to hold sterling's central rate at DM2.95. But the speech coincided with a new survey from the Confederation of British Industry which suggested there was little chance of a recovery in consumer confidence before the end of the year. More than two-thirds of retailers, who continue to suffer from consumers' fear of losing their jobs and high levels of household debt, said they did not expect the business situation to improve over the next three months. Wholesalers and car traders expected conditions to worsen. As the pound continued to hover just above its DM2.7780 floor on the foreign exchange markets, the survey pointed to a reversal during the summer of a modest improvement in the annual growth rate of retail sales earlier in the year. Sterling closed in London unchanged on the day at DM2.7875. In New York it rose to DM2.7917, although it shed nearly 2 cents against the dollar which was strengthened by Mr Major's remarks that the ERM's problems were being exaggerated by the weak US currency. The government came under further attack yesterday from senior industrialists who urged action to help economic recovery. Mr Major's remarks came as Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, voiced concern at the same meeting about the depths of the recession. He said that, while business supported the government's stance over the ERM, he believed other measures could be taken to stimulate recovery. Elsewhere Mr Martin Laing, chairman of the building group John Laing, criticised the government's failure to stimulate the economy while unemployment figures were mounting and construction companies were going into receivership. Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, described market conditions as an 'economic desert'. Mr Major, who used the first cabinet meeting since the summer break to congratulate Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on his handling of the currency turmoil, detailed the arguments against any devaluation. Mr Lamont delivered a report to cabinet on the Treasury's strategy in countering speculation against the pound. Although there was no discussion of the strategy, senior ministers said the consensus around the cabinet table was that the government has long been too deeply committed to the present value of the pound to allow room for doubts. One senior minister commented after the meeting that: 'Even those who would have preferred not to have started from here (the present ERM parity) believe there is no going back'. The prime minister, speaking to the Scottish CBI in Glasgow, insisted that the ERM had delivered the low inflation and the relative exchange rate stability demanded by the business community. Maintaining sterling's parity was essential to ensure that Britain preserved and improved on those gains. Dismissing the inevitable 'chorus of quack doctors' calling for a reversal of policy, Mr Major said: 'As the chancellor has made crystal clear, there is going to be no devaluation, no realignment.' He continued: 'The soft option,the devaluer's option, the inflationary option would be a betrayal of our future; and it is not the government's policy'. Mr Major, who repeated that defeat of inflation was a precondition of sustained economic success, dismissed the arguments of those blaming the ERM for the depth of the recession. The painful 'problem of adjustment' after the build up of business and individual debt was apparent throughout the industrialised world. Alluding to the failure of past devaluations to deliver a sustained improvement in Britain's competitiveness, he added: 'We must bite the anti-inflation bullet or accept that we will be forever second-rate in Europe.' Ministers were predicting that the publication today of inflation figures for August would further demonstrate that price rises were being brought under control.

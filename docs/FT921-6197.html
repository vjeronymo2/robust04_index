			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Isis barge plea as conference commences Floating an idea: a barge with a plea from the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) for the assisted places scheme moored by the Houses of Parliament yesterday as Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, addressed a conference of independent school heads, Andrew Adonis writes. Mr Clarke pledged to maintain financial support for independent schools if the Conservatives were re-elected, but warned that spending on the assisted places scheme would be constrained. An Isis report this week shows that more than a third of the scheme's pupils came from families earning above the national average. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, renewed Labour's commitment to phase out the scheme if it wins the general election.</p>

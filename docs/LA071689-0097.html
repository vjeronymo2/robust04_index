			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPLOYED WOMEN VS. HOMEMAKERS  </P> <P> Wendy Leece's letter (July 9) gave me the chills -- not because Mrs. Leece has  chosen the life style of a full-time homemaker but because she and her 200  friends who "have no intention of working outside the home" appear to be  ignoring the reality that at some time most of them will be forced by necessity  to contribute to their own support and that of their families.  </P> <P> Statistics tell us that a majority of those women, due either to divorce or the  death or disability of their spouses, will need to become financially  productive.  </P> <P> Working women do not cause broken marriages, as Leece implies. Homemakers with  no marketable skills are often the victims of broken marriages.  </P> <P> Living "simply" probably means that Leece will be ill-prepared when the  "breadwinner" can no longer provide the bread.  </P> <P> I urge Leece and her 200 friends to get trained and get ready or they will  become displaced homemakers struggling to survive.  </P> <P> LINDA S.

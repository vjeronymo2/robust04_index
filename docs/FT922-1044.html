			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: SEC plans rules on proxy battles and executive pay NEW rules making it easier for shareholders in US companies to challenge management during proxy battles and forcing corporations to disclose more information about executive pay, were proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The proposals, unanimously approved by the SEC's four commissioners at a meeting in Washington, are part of a campaign by the US watchdog to give shareholders more say in the management of companies. The new rules will not come into effect, however, until the SEC has received comments from the public and corporations on its proposals. On the proxy issue, the SEC's plan is to simplify the disclosure requirements imposed on shareholders when they discuss in writing how they might vote in an annual meeting. At present, a shareholder needs prior approval from the SEC when communicating in writing with more than 10 other shareholders. Oral discussions between shareholders would be exempt from any type of filing. The SEC also proposed that big shareholders should be allowed to include a criticism of a company's performance in their proxy statements. In the past, US corporations have been against the easing of proxy rules, arguing that it would allow big institutions to organise opposition to management in secret. The SEC first proposed altering its proxy rules in June 1991, but was forced to tone down the substance of some of the changes after receiving more than 900 comment letters, many of them hostile to the proposals. Mr Richard Breeden, the Commission's chairman, said yesterday that he would like to see the changes take effect in time for the 1993 proxy season. Under the new rules on executive pay, companies would be required to provide shareholders with clear information on what executives are earning, laid out in chart form rather than in pages of dense text. Management would also be forced to show how pay relates to company performance. The United Shareholders Association, a Washington-based pressure group, welcomed the new rules.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Morland advances to Pounds 9.7m The continued success of Old Speckled Hen helped Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer, to boost pre-tax profits by 9 per cent from Pounds 8.87m to Pounds 9.67m for the year to the end of September. Production of Old Speckled Hen ale has reached 40,000 barrels, up from 5,000 barrels in 1992, when Greene King made a bid for Morland. If the bid had succeeded, Greene King would have closed the Abingdon brewery. But demand for its beer has prompted Morland to invest Pounds 5m in its brewery over three years, culminating in a new brewing stream by Easter 1996. Mr Michael Watts, managing director, said yesterday that the brewery had raised its ale production by 21 per cent in a market generally seen as being in decline. Old Speckled Hen accounted for Pounds 6m of the total turnover of Pounds 57.1m, 12 per cent ahead of a previous Pounds 50.9m. The group plans to take the ale from a national brand to international recognition. Mr Watts said that by the end of the year, the company expected to have established an export business, with the US and Italy as prime targets. Like-for-like profits on its tenanted estate were down by less than 2 per cent. Mr Watts said the business was under attack on three fronts - take-home sales, consumer imports of beer from France and the continuing effects of the recession. Earnings were 32p (29.1p). A final dividend of 7.65p (6.96p) makes 10.71p (9.74p) for the year. Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland chairman and chief executive, is relinquishing the role of chief executive in February, when he will be 60. Mr Watts will become chief executive, while Mr Clutterbuck will remain chairman.</p>

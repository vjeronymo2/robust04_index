			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> 5 HOMELESS ARRESTED AFTER POLICE RAID  </P> <P> Homeless advocates who had occupied three federally owned homes for several  days promised to take over other abandoned buildings after five people were  arrested for investigation of trespassing. "We'll definitely be taking over  other houses in Oakland," said Terry Messman, leader of the Oakland Union for  the Homeless.  </P> <P> Police raided three homes owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development to oust homeless activists who moved in five days earlier. "We feel  HUD is the real criminal here," Messman said. The owners of the homes were  evicted for non-payment of their mortgages. HUD, which had guaranteed the  mortgages, took over ownership. Two of the residences were auctioned off.  Messman said the homes should be turned over to the homeless.  </P></p>

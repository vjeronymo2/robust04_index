			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / MCI puts Dollars 2bn into local challenge MCI Communications, the US long-distance telephone company, yesterday announced a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) initiative to compete with America's Baby Bell local phone companies. It is also stepping up investment in its information super-highway - the network needed to transmit huge amounts of data at high speed. The company said that it and 'associated partners' were expected to invest more than Dollars 20bn over the next six years to deliver new long-distance and local communications services to businesses, homes and research institutions, under the brand-name networkMCI. MCI played a central role in forcing competition into the US long-distance telephone market. Its entry into the local arena could spell tough competition for the Baby Bells. Yesterday's announcement was the clearest indication so far of MCI's long-range strategy in America's information revolution, which is blurring the boundaries between the telecommunications, computer and television industries - as well as the regulatory and legal divisions between long-distance and local telephone companies. Even so, the company left many important details unclear, including the names of its potential partners and just how much they would contribute. Mr Bert Roberts, the chairman, noted that last summer's global alliance with British Telecommunications, which is investing Dollars 4.3bn in MCI in return for a 20 per cent stake, was helping MCI to finance its capital spending. The most dramatic element of MCI's strategy is its plan to compete against the local telephone companies, as one of a number of so-called Competitive Access Providers (Caps), which operate fibre optic networks in cities, creaming off lucrative business customers. MCI already owns a subsidiary, acquired in 1990 from Western Union, which has telecoms access to more than 2,000 office buildings. It is to give this business, renamed MCI Metro, a boost by investing Dollars 2bn in fibre optic cable rings and modern traffic switching facilities, initially in 20 metropolitan areas. The company may later target household consumers. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Advance at Reliance Industries RELIANCE Industries, India's second-largest company and the first to make an international equity offering, yesterday announced an 11.2 per cent rise in turnover to a record Rs23.4bn (Dollars 8.3bn) for the year to March, up from Rs21.04bn a year earlier. The textile and petrochemical company's operating profits advanced 18.7 per cent to Rs3.55bn from Rs2.99bn a year earlier, and net profits rose 30 per cent to Rs1.63bn from Rs1.25bn. Reliance claimed it continued to be among India's six largest manufacturer-exporters, with exports of Rs810m in total. Reliance this summer became the first Indian company to tap international equity capital markets with a Dollars 100m issue of global depository receipts (GDRs) through Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. The GDRs are traded on over-the-counter markets in Hong Kong, London and New York. The issue caused controversy when the share price fell sharply immediately after the offering, caused by Bombay's stock market scandal. Reliance, one of India's most aggressive companies, has set an ambitious target of reaching turnover of Rs100bn in 1995 - a five-fold increase on last year's result. Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, the group's 60-year-old founder, has struck deals with international partners including C. Itoh, the Japanese trading group, to set up a 6m tonne oil refinery in western India at an estimated cost of Rs30bn. Reliance Industries' net asset value at the year-end was Rs19.43bn and its paid-up capital, Rs2.32bn. In March, Reliance was expanded by the merger with Reliance Petrochemicals, its associate. The move was intended to give Reliance more leverage to raise funds from the capital markets ahead of its international equity offer.</p>

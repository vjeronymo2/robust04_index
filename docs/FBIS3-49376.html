Speaking to journalists upon his return from Warsaw,  Andrejcak said that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations  Madeleine Albright and Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of  Staff John Shalikashvili left the meeting convinced that "it was  important and advantageous" for them to support cooperation with  the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and  Poland). The Slovak Republic supports cooperation aimed at  ensuring better security and prosperity, Andrejcak said.    He said so-called "contact groups" would be established  after  Clinton's Prague visit to study possibilities and ways for  further cooperation. The next meeting of Visegrad defence  ministers will be held in Bratislava, he added.    He said Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys's absence from  the meeting would not hamper cooperation within the Visegrad  Group, adding that the deputy Czech defence minister, on behalf  of the Czech Republic, voiced apprehensions over the possibility  of the institutionalisation of the Visegrad Group that,  Andrejcak said, was not being considered by anyone.    The participants in the Warsaw meeting discussed the  American  Partnership for Peace initiative, which offers them closer  military links with NATO.</p>

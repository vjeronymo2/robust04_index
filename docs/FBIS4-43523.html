			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ph. L." report: "Alain Lamassoure Calls For Reduction of </F> European Commission Powers"]    [Text] An aftershock of the European election? An  acknowledgement of the supposed hostility of some 23 percent of  right-wing and extreme-right-wing French voters (those who chose  the de Villiers and Le Pen lists) toward "Brussels'  technocrats?" In any case, since recently, French officials  have appeared rather forceful in their determination to take  advantage of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on EU  political and institutional reform to reduce the powers of the  European Commission.    "The status of the Commission as de facto exempt from any  answerability" (in theory the European Parliament can censure  it, but it has never seriously considered such a move) "is  outdated, it is dead, it is no longer tolerated by the public,"  French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure told  journalists on Monday 13 June. Speaking on the occasion of the  meeting of the Twelve's Council of Ministers, Mr. Lamassoure  explained that he did not mean to have the slate wiped clean,  that there was much to preserve in the way the Community works,  including institutionally, but that the current system had  become unbearable, that it was obsolete, and that -- "a true  innovation" -- the Commission must be made answerable both to  the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.    This would not be the only reform, and the Commission's  powers would be reduced even further. The French have been  thinking of establishing, through the Council of Ministers,  another authority which would be in charge of the Union's common  foreign and security policy and would be headed by a personality  with real powers and a clear brief. According to Mr.  Lamassoure, the new treaty to be developed in 1996 as a  replacement for the one devised in Maastricht should be  subjected to a new referendum. "Only a referendum can alter  what the people have instituted by means of a referendum; the  idea is self-evident."</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers tune in to the radio GRID Computer Systems, developers of the Gridpad notepad-sized computer, has devised a version of the machine which can be used to send data across the radiowaves. The Gridpad, which uses a lightpen instead of a keyboard to input data, is used in industrial and manufacturing environments for collecting data. The new machine, which has an external modem unit attached, will mean that data can be sent back to the head office computer system using the latest data radio networks. Grid has joined up with Hutchison to develop a unit which will work on the Hutchison data network. Grid is now working on a unit with a built-in communications device which will weigh no more than the four pounds of the stand-alone computer unit sold today. Grid: UK, 081 897 6565.</p>

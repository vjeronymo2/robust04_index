			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani has said  Pakistan will continue to support United Nations' peace efforts  and will continue to give its traditionally unflinching support  to the UN's active role in the maintenance and promotion of  world peace and security. Addressing as the special guest at a  seminar on the UN role as a peacemaking body in Karachi  yesterday, he said Pakistan supports the process initiated by  the UN secretary general through his report called the peace  agenda to strengthen and bolster the actions for peace and  security. He said arrangements should be made to supply in  advance arms and equipment for the safety of UN contingents in  extremely dangerous regions and to provide information on the  use of equipment by member countries taking part in UN  operations.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Recession pushes Aer Lingus IPounds 3m into the red AER LINGUS, the Irish national carrier, reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 3.1m (Pounds 2.9m) for the year to March 31, its first deficit for 10 years. Profits last time were IPounds 6.6m. The after-tax deficit amounted to IPounds 11.8m (IPounds 8.3m profits). The airline has been badly hit by the slump in international air transport and difficult trading conditions in ancillary services. Losses on its core air transport business fell by 11 per cent to IPounds 37.9m (IPounds 42.5m). Traditionally these have been offset by profits in ancillary services but the impact of recession in the UK and the US forced the group into loss. Turnover rose by 8 per cent to IPounds 849m (IPounds 784m). Mr Cathal Mullan, chief executive, said the losses in the air transport division were 'particularly disappointing'. Revenue traffic on IATA airlines fell by 4 per cent during 1991. European airlines saw passenger numbers fall by 6.5 per cent on internal European routes. The aircraft maintenance and ground handling division saw profits fall 29 per cent to IPounds 14.6m (IPounds 20.7m), reflecting the impact of the recession in the industry worldwide. Profits at its hotel division, which includes the Copthorne chain in the UK, felt the impact of the recession and declined 3 per cent to IPounds 12m (IPounds 12.4m). The sale of the Berkshire Place Hotel in New York helped offset the poor trading results. The biggest decline, however, was in the commercial holdings division, which includes the 9 per cent stake in GPA Group, where profits fell 49 per cent to IPounds 8.2m (IPounds 16m). The group has adjusted the value of its GPA stake 'in line with indicated market value,' Mr Mullan said. The collapse of GPA's planned stock market flotation last month was a blow to Aer Lingus, which had hoped to sell 4m of its 19m shares in the aircraft leasing company to reduce debt. Total passenger numbers carried by the group in the year rose by only 1 per cent to 4.3m. Its passenger load factor fell from 71 per cent to 68 per cent and its overall load factor from 68 per cent to 66 per cent. No dividend is declared for the year. Last year the group reluctantly paid out IPounds 500,000 after a dispute with the Irish government, its sole shareholder, which insisted on a dividend despite a fall in profits. Gearing climbed from 109 per cent to 133 per cent. Mr Mullan said the international recession showed little sign of abating, and in addition price wars and excess capacity had combined to drive down revenues on some of its principal routes. Targeted improvements in air transport results would be 'very difficult to achieve,' he added.</p>

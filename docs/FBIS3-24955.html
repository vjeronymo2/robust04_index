Although Chief Beye is away from Lusaka, the  negotiators today presented their proposals. The mediator and  the troika of observers today dealt with basic issues regarding  the standpoint of the two sides on national reconciliation. The  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] was  late in submitting its proposal, thus postponing the mediator's  final draft. The draft was scheduled to be presented this  morning.    In time the government added new elements to its proposal.  This pleased the troika, and local analysts regard this as  proof that there is a will to tackle the issue at once. The  government's pleasant mood is due partly to Chief Beye's remarks  on national sovereignty.    As always, UNITA wants to deal with each point of the agenda  in order to gain time. The zigzag began when UNITA was late in  submitting its proposal. The situation worsened in view of the  need to redraft it.    Sources that asked not to be named say UNITA's document  contains more thorns than roses. In addition to the three key  ministries, UNITA has demanded a more equitable redistribution  of provincial governments, including one of the country's main  commercial ports. The news media and UNITA's members being held  in custody in Luanda are two other specific issues raised by the  organization.</p>

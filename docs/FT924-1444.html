			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Japanese party plans tax changes JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday revived tax incentives for house purchases in an attempt to stimulate the property market and lifted the tax-exempt threshold on the savings accounts of elderly people. The tax proposals were part of a much-debated package of reforms drafted by the party's tax system research council and approved yesterday by its executive council, which had an eye on an election scheduled for next year. Japanese business organisations generally condemned the proposals, having pressed unsuccessfully for income tax cuts to stimulate the economy. The Finance Ministry had opposed the income tax cuts, arguing that the economic downturn has seriously slowed the flow of tax revenues. Mr Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said his organisation would continue to push for income tax cuts and an increase in value added tax, now 3 per cent, to compensate for those cuts. But Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren federation of economic organisations, praised the proposed reintroduction of tax breaks on the sale and repurchase of housing. He said the measure would help ordinary Japanese trying to upgrade their home. The housing tax break, curtailed in 1988, is designed to stimulate the property market but discourage the rampant speculation of the late 1980s. Tax exemptions will apply to owners who have lived in their houses for over 10 years and be limited to transactions of Y100m (Pounds 530,000) or less. With votes in mind, the party decided against increases to alcohol and tobacco taxes, and lifted the tax exempt amount of bank and postal savings accounts for the elderly and the disabled from Y3m to Y3.5m.</p>

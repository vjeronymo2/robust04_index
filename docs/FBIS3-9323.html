Federal minister of environment and protection of nature,  Klaus Toepfer, said at a press release that "as far as I know  the pesticides have been illegally exported to Albania. There  derives no obligation to take them back. But we accept that it  is an inheritance from the unification of the two Germanies. In  order to avoid grave consequences in the foreign policy, we  shall make a human gesture by taking the pesticides back."    The pesticides have been brought in barrels on a train to  Albania in March 1992 and have been centred mostly in the border  railway station of Bajze, near Shkoder. Among the pesticides,  according to specialists, there is toxaphene whose usage has  been banned in the European Union countries since 10 years ago.  "The death train," as the Albanian press refers to it, has come  to Albania as an humanitarian aid from the "Schmidt Cretan GmbH"  company of Hanover. As time has passed, the pesticides have  ruined the barrels and leaked on the ground, thus threatening  for polluting the Shkoder Lake, which borders Albania and  Montenegro. The German Government has planned to take the  pesticides back by sea within May.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Verbal not oral agreements Sir, Without wishing to be pedantic may I point out that all agreements are verbal? (Financial Planning, November 12/13). The word verbal is derived from the Latin verbum meaning word, which can be written or spoken. The true distinction is between agreements which are oral and those which are in writing. This was pointed out to me very forcefully, but courteously, some 40 years ago as a pupil barrister when attempting to draft a pleading under the gimlet eye of a man who subsequently became a very senior judge. It is a lesson in logic I have not forgotten. J A G Stonehouse, Elm Lodge, 43 Upper Tilehouse Street, Hitchin, Hertfordshire SO5 2EE</p>

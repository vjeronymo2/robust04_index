			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON TARGET: NICE SURPRISE FOR A BUSY VOLUNTEER  </P> <P> Lucille Boswell was the surprised weekend recipient of the Woman of the Year  award from Women on Target at the group's annual Christmas brunch.  </P> <P> Boswell, manager of consumer affairs for the Los Angeles office of Coca-Cola,  had believed all along that Women on Target president Joan Graham was going to  get the award.  </P> <P> "We picked you," said a stunned Boswell, who even as she was receiving the  award Saturday, thought it was to go to Graham.  </P> <P> "I'm so touched, you are all my friends. Bless you -- and yes, I'm going to  cry," she said, wiping tears from her eyes.  </P> <P> Boswell was singled out for her involvement with many community groups,  including the Child Guidance Centers, the Florence Crittenton Center and for  founding Coca-Cola's Salute to the Black Family.  </P> <P> Women on Target's focus is on the community as well. This 11-year-old Los  Angeles-based organization of black businesswomen, artists and civic leaders is  dedicated to improving the quality of life in the city's neighborhoods.  </P> <P> More than 100 women attended the brunch at the Wilfandel Club on West Adams  Boulevard. It is a nonprofit clubhouse that was founded 44 years ago when  minority groups were denied access to public meeting places. It is now used for  cultural events, meetings, parties and weddings.  </P> <P> The women brought gift-wrapped toys to be distributed by Elnido Service, the  Youth and Family Center and the Los Angeles Unified School District Police  Department's Christmas Program. Representatives outlined each group's programs  and stressed the need for assistance, especially during the holidays.  </P> <P> "Women on Target will continue to benefit the youth of tomorrow," Joan Graham  said of the 150-member organization. "It's important for us to be a catalyst to  ensure a future for them and equipping them with the necessary educational  background -- that's what we're committed to.  </P> <P> "This upcoming year we will also focus on the problem the black community has  with racism," she added. "It's something we need to talk about more. We want to  try and be a little more honest with each other, to bridge that gap. Racism is  the cause of a lot of ills, and this is the core of what we need to start. And  that will be a benefit to our children."  </P> <P> Added Juanita Dudley, last year's Woman of the Year and past president of the  group: "Very few people want to hear what women have to say. People say, 'Oh,  you give to charitable groups and that's so great, but we don't want to hear  what you have to say about political issues.'  </P> <P> "But we do educate our members to what's important in the community. We started  out with basic issues like housing and education, and we bring speakers in to  tell women what's going on. And we have so many black women now who are  entrepreneurs, it's very exciting."  </P> <P> Saturday's program also included performances by the Lafayette Players-West,  directed by Virginia Capers. Cast members performed works by Alice Walker,  Samm-Art Williams and Paul Laurence Dunbar.  </P> <P> Among the guests were Ouida Gee, Betty McGill, Grace Robinson, Vera Branker,  Tanis Johns, Honora Wells, Dr. Ann Shaw, Bette Cox, Aiko Mura-Taylor, Olivia  Mitchell, Marguerite Williams, Wilmer James, Hilda Allen and Jean Sides.  </P></p>

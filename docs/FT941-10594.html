			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Japan to cut drug prices by 6.5% Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry yesterday confirmed it intends to cut prescription drug prices by an average 6.5 per cent. The cuts, part of a regular series of reductions every two years, will be implemented on April 1. The move will further undermine a sluggish Japanese medicines market, the world's second most important. Analysts believe it is at present growing at only 3 per cent a year. Japanese groups will be most affected, being so dependent on the domestic market. The cuts represent another blow for European and US companies, which over the past 12 months have endured often radical health care reforms in Germany, Italy, the UK, France, and Spain. The growth of the US market, the world's largest, is also decelerating as changes transform the customer base. Drugs groups operating in Japan have been informed how their medicines will be affected by the latest cuts. They can now appeal. The ministry expects to complete talks by the second week in March. The cuts are based on a complicated formula dependent on the levels of discounts offered by wholesalers to hospitals and pharmacists. The new price is fixed by the ministry at the transaction price plus 13 per cent. No prices will be increased. The 6.5 per cent reduction compares with a cut in 1992 of 8.1 per cent. Antibiotic prices are expected to suffer most because they are discounted more than other drug classes. The 6.5 per cent average reduction does not include additional 'special' cuts on fast growing successful medicines such as cholesterol-lowering drugs and interferons. These extra cuts have caused anger among domestic and foreign companies which believe the measures represent panic efforts to cut health care spending. 'Backsliding' on chip deal, Page 6</p>

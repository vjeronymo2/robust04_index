			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Safe-haven status gives early boost to Eurosterling THE Eurosterling bond market had an active start to 1993 with a total of Pounds 600m raised by the European Investment Bank and the Kingdom of Sweden. Sterling's unlikely elevation to the status of safe-haven currency made it attractive in a week otherwise dominated by the D-Mark and Swiss franc among European currencies. Neither of last week's issues went down well with investors, however, and the pace of borrowing may not be sustained. The EIB's Pounds 400m issue, which with a 10 1/2 -year maturity is a rarity at a time of a steep yield curve, was attacked for being too tightly priced. And Sweden, which reopened an existing five-year issue to raise a further Pounds 200m, was criticised for offering a higher spread on the latest tranche, upsetting holders of the existing paper. The use of Eurosterling in the coming months is likely to be heavily influenced by two factors: the UK government's huge gilts issuing programme, and whether arbitrage opportunities in the swap market return. Bankers report demand for maturities around the 10-year area. However, there seems little chance of substantial new borrowing while swap spreads remain tight. Swap spreads are expected, if anything, to narrow further as a result of the gilts programme and a preference by UK corporates to stay in floating sterling, taking advantage of historically low rates at the very short end of the curve. The best swap opportunities are thought likely to remain at five years, the maturity of the Swedish issue. Even without an improvement in the swap market, Japanese utilities are expected to be other heavy users of the currency as an alternative to domestic yen. The recent rally in the stock market means that the predictions late last year of heavy issuing by UK corporates are unlikely to be fulfilled. 'We would have thought that there are now strong grounds for corporates to look at the equity market rather than bonds,' said Mr Charlie Hanbury-Williams of Samuel Montagu. The gilts programme is expected to absorb the total cash flow of UK institutions this year, and the need to attract foreign investors could push yields to the point where corporate borrowers opt to tap other markets instead. 'International demand will be the key,' says Mr Simon Best of Baring Brothers, 'and that hinges on confidence in the currency.' Meanwhile, news last week that holders of the Pounds 135m debentures of property group London &amp; Provincial were to be offered 95 per cent of their money in an early repayment prompted a strong rally among other debenture issues. The possibility of a London &amp; Provincial default had hung over the market for some months, and Citibank's agreement to provide the cash to pay off the bond holders was well received - even though it was the 'first time in living memory' that a debenture issue would be repaid at less than par, said Mr Hugh Corbett of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Although virtually untraded, the bonds had been quoted at only around 80. The particular circumstances of L&amp;P are unlikely to be repeated in other cases. But the likelihood of bond holders reinvesting their money in other secured issues helped to drive yields generally lower. The yield on debentures issued by Peel Holdings, among the highest-yielding secured stocks, narrowed during the week from 289 basis points over gilts to 246 basis points. Yield spreads on longer-dated loan stocks also narrowed by around 20 basis points.</p>

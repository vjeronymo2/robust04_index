			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOP-SEEDED POLY FALLS IN 12 INNINGS  </P> <P> Taft High scored six unearned runs, including one in the top of the 12th  inning, to shock top-seeded Poly, 7-6, in the first round Friday of the City  Section 4-A Division baseball playoffs.  </P> <P> Poly, which originally was scheduled to play North Hollywood before a  last-minute switch by City officials, finished 22-4.  </P> <P> "It was North Hollywood when we left the meeting last week. It was set," Poly  Coach Jerry Cord said. "I found out Thursday we were playing Taft."  </P> <P> Brett Reisner led off the 12th for Taft (12-14-1) with a single against Raul  Torres (5-2). Reisner stole second, was sacrificed to third by John Erganian  and scored when Roy Lozano bobbled Carey Wilbur's grounder for an error.  </P> <P> Poly, which rallied for three runs in the bottom of the seventh to tie the  score, 6-6, was retired in order in the bottom of the 12th by Benji Belfield  (5-1), who allowed three hits and one run over the final 6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "This is unreal. It was nuts, absolute craziness," Taft assistant Coach Steve  Singer said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] An assistant minister for planning and national  development, Oduya Oprong, was last night shot twice in the head  by unknown assailants who left him critically wounded. He was  taken to Mater Misericordiae Hospital where he was briefly  attended to before being rushed to Nairobi hospital where he was  admitted in the hospital's intensive care unit. Sources at  Nairobi Hospital told KTN this evening that there were two  bullets lodged in the assistant minister's head but one had been  removed. The sources, however could not confirm whether Oprong  was out of danger or not. Family sources told KTN that the  minister was shot at about 9.00 PM last night as he was driving  from his Mariakani flat in Nairobi's South B area. Independent  sources said there were two loud gunshots near the minister's  compound moments before a relative rushed him to Mater  Misericordiae hospital at about 9.30 PM. [passage omitted]</p>

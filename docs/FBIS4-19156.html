			<p>BFN     [Text] The Tirana regime is escalating tension in  Greek-Albanian relations despite Greece's intentions to foster  good relations. In a provocative diplomatic note to the Greek  Embassy in Tirana, the Albanian Government asked the Greek  ambassador to reduce the embassy's diplomatic staff from 10 to  six people.    According to a REUTER dispatch from Tirana, the diplomatic  note says that, because there has been no agreement on the  question of the diplomatic staff, the Albanian side believes  that there should be a reciprocal reduction in the staff of the  Greek and Albanian diplomatic missions from 10 to six people.  The Albanian note also gives Athens a 10-day time limit to  carry out the reduction. REUTER also notes that Albania has a  four-member diplomatic mission in Athens.</p>

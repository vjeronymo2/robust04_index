			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): How a world market caught spring fever - After the carefully concocted campaign by two high-profile financiers, which sent the price of the precious metal soaring, analysts are divided over where it goes from here / Gold GOLD'S PRICE in US dollars slumped to its lowest level for seven years in London on the first trading day of 1993. Long-term gold bulls wondered, despairingly, what on earth it would take to reverse the steady downward trend. Stock market crashes in 1987 had failed to do the trick; nor had the Gulf war, with its horrific implications for oil supplies and inflation, revived North American and European investor interest in the gold market. The collapse of the Soviet Union, a big producer, and political upheavals in South Africa, the biggest, were also ignored. But in April, a carefully concocted campaign by two high-profile international financiers, Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros, sent the price soaring; and for a while gold became the hottest investment game in town. Mr Soros, whose US-based funds have Dollars 7bn invested, was in the mood to buy gold shares. Sir James had been wanting to reduce his holding in Newmont Mining, the biggest North American gold producer, and agreed to sell Mr Soros about 10m Newmont shares from his own investment vehicle, General Oriental, and funds managed by his friend, Lord (Jacob) Rothschild. Some analysts suggest that Mr Soros had bigger fish to fry. The rumour mill says his funds had been shorting the US bond market (that is, selling bonds they did not own in the hope that they could pick them up later at a lower price). The gold price tends to move up and down with the yield in bonds, reflecting the market's expectations of inflation. A rise in the gold price, of the kind which followed the deal with Sir James, gave a signal the bond market could not ignore. Bond prices followed the usual pattern and fell as gold rose. If the Soros funds had been shorting the bond market, they would have made a hefty profit. As for Sir James, apparently tired of waiting for the world's banking and financial system to collapse (a phenomenon he predicted at the time in 1990 when he took the plunge into gold shares via the Newmont purchase), he decided to give the gold price a lift. He did this by buying call options - a huge number of call options which give the right (but not the obligation) to buy gold at agreed prices and within an agreed time frame. Market rumours suggest he took options on between 700,000 and 1m troy ounces of gold. People who grant options usually buy some gold, just in case the call options are exercised and they have to deliver. If someone buys enough options, there is a lot of gold-buying and the price goes up. As the price goes up, the chances that the option writers must deliver gold increase, so they have to buy more gold. To make sure the market got the message, Sir James arranged maximum publicity for his deals. While Sir James's previous attempts to talk up the gold price had little impact, news that Mr Soros was now betting that the gold price would rise had a massive impact, because his funds are reputed to have made Dollars 1bn in the currency markets last September by betting the UK and Italian governments would not be able to keep their currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism. As other New York investment funds followed the Soros lead, gold's price rose rapidly and attracted even more players to the game. The activity boosted interest in gold-company shares and even the gold coin market picked up from exceedingly depressed levels. Analysts are divided about where gold goes from here. Some point out that nothing fundamentally has changed in the gold market since the price hit its seven-year low in January; that producers are still likely to put a 'cap' on price rises by selling, so as to guarantee themselves a profit; that central banks, which hold 34,000 tonnes of gold, equivalent to 17 years supply from mines, are likely to be net sellers; and that demand in those parts of the world where gold is in favour, because the local banking system does not work well or there is rampant inflation, simply disappears when the price rises substantially. Others liken the gold market's performance to a pendulum which swings one way until it can go no further before swinging back in the other direction. They suggest the Dollars 326 an ounce which gold touched early this year was the outer limit of one swing, and that now the pendulum is swinging in the other direction. But how far before it reaches the other outer limit? Julian Baring, who manages the Mercury Gold and General fund, suggests that, even if you think of gold merely as another commodity, 'it is by no means unusual for commodity prices to double from the bottom to the top of a cycle. But that does not happen in six months.' So there is still time for those investors who agree with Mr Baring's view of the market to profit from potential price rises. But it is not easy for the UK private investor to buy gold bullion today. Unlike jewellery, which in the UK typically would have a mark-up of more than 3,000 per cent on the gold content, gold bars and coins carry small premiums, typically between 3 and 7 per cent, but the big bullion houses have stopped selling small quantities of gold. However, Spinks and Gold Investments are still in the business. In the UK, gold attracts value added tax, currently 17.5 per cent, but both organisations have schemes which legally avoid VAT. As long as gold sovereigns are more than 100 years old, Spinks can sell them at a premium of only 4 per cent above the value of the gold content; while Gold Investments puts together private buyers and sellers, taking a small commission for this service. Investment in gold bullion means giving up interest payments, and there is a charge for insurance and storage - Gold Investments would ask for about 1 per cent of the gold's value a year. There is also a currency risk, because gold's price is denominated in dollars, and gains on its price will often be offset by losses on the dollar. Investment in gold-company shares, as a proxy for the metal, also usually involves exposure to currency fluctuations, because there are only a very limited number of UK-based gold producers and the big companies are in North America and South Africa. For those who are willing to pay someone else to make the investment decisions, there are several gold-related funds listed in Money Management, a Financial Times magazine, the biggest of which seems to be Mr Baring's Mercury Gold and General. Gold bullion has lost 60 per cent of its value in terms of dollars since 1980, and 80 per cent in Japanese yen. When insurance and interest foregone is taken into account, anyone who has held the metal since then has seen about 90 per cent of the value disappear. Mr Baring points out that gold shares have also been 'a pretty dismal long-term investment'. However, his fund appreciated by 35 per cent in May, and by mid-June was up 134 per cent since the begining of this year; and he suggests: 'These shares are one of the most exciting means of accumulating wealth over shorter periods, as we have recently discovered.'</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE OFFICER HOPES RACEHORSE WILL BECOME THE NEXT CITATION  </P> <P> He named the horse "Club Dev," after the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles  Police Department, but Officer Tom Culotta says there's nothing slow about the  2-year-old thoroughbred that he and his wife plan to enter in races at  Hollywood Park next month.  </P> <P> The couple and a professional trainer have put the horse under a rigorous  conditioning routine, preparing her for the big day when the gates open for her  first real race at the end of the park's fall-winter meeting in December.  </P> <P> It will also be a big day for Culotta and his fellow officers from the  Devonshire station in Northridge, who have been waiting for months to see Club  Dev race. The horse's name is in honor of the many Devonshire Division officers  who followed Culotta's fascination with horse-racing since he began training  another of his six horses for the races about two years ago.  </P> <P> But that horse, Christopher Jones, suffered a leg injury just before she was  scheduled to race last year, so Culotta decided to try his luck with Club Dev.  Anticipation is running particularly high because Club Dev had to be withdrawn  from a race this month when she came down with an infection.  </P> <P> "There's been guys that have discussed whether we should rent a bus and drink  mint juleps and watch the horse run for the rose," Culotta said. "I've had guys  tell me they wouldn't put down more than two bucks, and I've had others say  they'll check their pensions."  </P> <P> Whether or not they put any money on the horse, the officers will be rooting  for Club Dev with the same enthusiasm as big-time betters, Culotta said.  </P> <P> "We can't let Club Dev run alone." said Sgt. Tom Wade, Culotta's supervisor and  the head of the Devonshire station's anti-gang unit.  </P> <P> "It seems like a neat thing to do," said Capt. Mark Stevens, commander of the  Devonshire Division.  </P> <P> The division's Club Dev monicker originated about eight years ago with a group  of Devonshire officers who were trying to name a campaign to raise funds for  athletic facilities at the station, said Sgt. David Johnson. Since then, the  Devonshire division has become known throughout the department as Club Dev,  partly because of its modern exercise equipment but mostly because officers  considered it slow-paced, Johnson said.  </P> <P> But, Johnson said, "That is sort of a myth. It's not unusual for officers to  handle 20 radio calls a night. Maybe at one time that might have been true, but  with the city growing like it is, this is no longer a nice, quiet division."  </P> <P> Culotta said he got the idea for raising a racehorse after he and his wife,  Zoe, moved to Acton six years ago and started attending auctions for show  horses, which Zoe used to ride as a youngster. But the more they got into the  search, the more they became interested in racehorses, eventually buying a  thoroughbred mare for about $2,200.  </P> <P> They bred the mare with a stallion and raised the foal as a racer, saving the  expense of buying a trained racehorse, which typically costs between $50,000  and $60,000, Culotta said.  </P> <P> They managed to get around the prohibitive expense of training a racehorse by  finding a licensed trainer -- Ian Jory -- who agreed to prepare Club Dev for  racing in exchange for Zoe Culotta providing free care for other horses at  Hollywood Park, Culotta said.  </P> <P> Among other requirements, horses must have a licensed trainer before they can  work out at Hollywood Park and enter the races, park spokesman Craig Peterson  said.  </P> <P> "If it weren't for my wife and her knowledge, and the assistance of Ian Jory, I  could not afford to be here," Culotta said. Jory is in England and could not be  reached for comment this week.  </P> <P> And if Club Dev fails? "We have small children" with whom the couple would like  to spend more time, he said. "If she's not successful, we will curtail our  breeding activities until the children are older."  </P> <P> But for now, losing is the last thing on Culotta's mind.  </P> <P> "She's definitely an eye-catcher at the track," he said. "We think she has  everything it takes to be a racehorse."  </P></p>

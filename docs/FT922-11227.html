			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Post Office engineers agree 22-hour week deal A 22-HOUR working week, possibly the shortest for any group of full-time workers in British industry, has been agreed between management and union negotiators for some Post Office maintenance engineers. Volunteers from among the 800 engineers will get Monday to Friday off in return for working up to 22 hours over the weekend. A full week's pay at normal weekday rates - between Pounds 240 and Pounds 270  - will be received by the volunteers for the weekend shifts of up to 12 hours for part of the year. The short total working week, to be introduced as a pilot scheme, is designed to compensate for the unsocial hours. The deal is being hailed by the National Communications Union, which represents the engineers, as a breakthrough in efforts to reform the working week and preserve jobs. Most manual workers still work 39 hours a week, although several hundred thousand in the engineering sector have recently won reductions to 37 hours after a strong campaign by unions. Among white-collar employees, working weeks of under 35 hours are still uncommon. When overtime is taken into account, British men work the longest hours within the European Community. Mr Bill Fry, NCU president, said the time had come for unions to take a 'more imaginative approach to the structure of the working week'. He said the agreement represented an important breakthrough which would help defend jobs and assist the Post Office's own engineering and construction section to compete effectively with outside contractors. The Post Office agreement has been welcomed by management as well as union negotiators. Demand for construction and maintenance work tends to be concentrated in the last part of the financial year because of budget holders' 'natural caution' in the early months of the year, the Post Office said. At the same time, it is less disruptive for engineers to gain access to plant and premises at the week- ends when the postal operation is quieter. The combination of these two factors has meant that, until now, the Post Office has had little for engineers to do on weekdays from April to July but, at the same time, it was also having to pay overtime rates for weekend work. It is expected that about 10 per cent of the engineers will volunteer for the weekend shifts. The Post Office's move is the latest example of efforts by employers to cut down on overtime payments. Annualised hours agreements - contracting with employees to work a certain number of hours over a year, rather than a week  -are increasingly common.</p>

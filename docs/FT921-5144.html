			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Two clear frontrunners in Democratic race THE Democratic presidential campaign has entered a frenetic two-week 18 state election marathon with two runners now clearly in the lead: Mr Paul Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. Mr Tsongas, having won both Maryland and, unexpectedly, Utah dispelled the conventional notion he was simply a 'regional candidate'. Mr Clinton, by winning big in Georgia, proved he could overcome the charges of womanising and draft-dodging. Mr Jerry Brown, the former California Governor who managed a close win in Colorado, can no longer be simply a figure of fun for the political cognoscenti. However, he is still a long way from being a serious contender. The prime victims of the anti-Washington mood abroad in the electorate were the two Democratic senators - Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa. After scoring only 12 per cent in Colorado and worse everywhere else, Mr Kerrey yesterday cancelled campaign appearances in Florida and flew back to Washington to 'reassess' his campaign. Mr Kerrey has called a press conference for this morning and seems likely to announce his withdrawal. Mr Harkin, who appears to have eked out a victory in the Minnesota caucus, may hang in on the strength of his labour support. Mr Clinton's supporters are hoping Mr Harkin will quit before the race moves on to Illinois and Michigan on March 17. There the nation's economic woes are worse, and the governor stands to gain among the blue collar, urban and minority voters. In Tuesday's primaries the dour Mr Tsongas struck a chord among the more highly educated voters which enabled him to capture 41 per cent of the vote to 33 per cent for Mr Clinton with the others far behind. Mr Clinton's victory indicated that he is likely to hold on to his southern base in next week's Super Tuesday primaries. He is attracting both white working class and black votes with a proposal for 'a new covenant' to embrace all levels of society and heal the racial divisions. Mr Brown, the former governor of California, fed into the worry about the environment and a contempt for corruption of the political process. It was a narrow victory - 30 per cent compared to 28 per cent for Mr Clinton and 26 per cent for Mr Tsongas. Mr Tsongas will pick up a good share of votes next week in primaries in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and among the northern-born pensioners who have retired to live in Florida. His health could become a more prominent issue because his doctors cannot say he is completely cured of cancer. However he is doing his utmost to contradict impressions that he lacks the energy needed for months of campaigning ahead. Mr Tsongas will face a re-energised Mr Clinton, probably fresh from huge wins in the South, renewing his attack on the former senator for advocating 'a refined version of 1980 style trickle-down economics.' Mr Clinton will have to defend his record as governor of one of the poorest states in the country. His environmental record in particular will come under attack. He will also have to contend with the ever-present fear of more damaging disclosures about his past.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     'JUNIOR TUESDAY' PRIMARY RESULTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage of votes   GEORGIA    MARYLAND   COLORADO   DELEGATE TOTALS                                                           SO FAR*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Democrats                                    (out of a total of 4,287)  Jerry Brown                8           8         29               35  Bill Clinton              57          34         27              198  Tom Harkin                 2           6          2               79  Bob Kerrey                 5           5         12               22  Paul Tsongas              24          40         26              110 Republicans                                    (out of total of 2,209)  Pat Buchanan              36          30         30               20  Geoge Bush                64          70         67              148  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Delegate totals are preliminary.

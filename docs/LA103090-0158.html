			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> LIBRARY ADVOCATES TURN UP THE VOLUME  </P> <P> The tiny Moorpark Library fills up in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "After school, every table is filled, with children sitting on the floor,"  Librarian Mary Crockford said.  </P> <P> During the summer, a reading program for youngsters brought in 485 children.  </P> <P> "We like to have the programs here," Crockford said, "except it takes up the  whole library. One event had 175 children plus parents."  </P> <P> A consultant hired last year by Ventura County Library Services recommended  that the library be quadrupled in size.  </P> <P> Since 1980 the population of Moorpark has grown from 4,000 to about 26,000  residents, and a bigger library is needed, a report done by Raymond Holt &amp;  Associates of Del Mar said.  </P> <P> The 5,000-square-foot building serves all segments of the community and lends  5,000 to 6,000 books a month, Crockford said.  </P> <P> The consultant concluded that Moorpark needs a library of about 20,000 square  feet with three acres to expand even more. The report also recommends the  expansion of the book collection and a greater range of library services with  emphasis on children.  </P> <P> Originally the library was in a small store on the city's main street. In 1981,  a 2,500-square-foot library was built close to the Moorpark Community Center.  </P> <P> By 1985, the size was doubled with funding from a government grant, and the  library's collection reached 25,000 books.  </P> <P> "We don't have enough resources for the size of our community," Crockford said.  "People have to use the Thousand Oaks library instead of our library for  technical research. But I feel we are still able to do a lot."  </P> <P> Building a new library would cost an estimated $3 million, not including the  site, she said. "There is not enough room on this site. The consultant does not  feel this building would be easy to enlarge."  </P> <P> Crockford hopes that there may be a land swap with the city of Moorpark, with  the city taking the current library building and the library getting a piece of  downtown property. City and county officials have discussed the possibility,  she said, but talks are in a preliminary stage.  </P> <P> The Moorpark Friends of the Library has raised $2,500 toward a new building  through cookbook sales and a booth at Moorpark's annual County Days  festivities.  </P> <P> "The more we earn, the more we will let people know we are serious about trying  to raise money for a future library," said Martha Lepine, spokeswoman for the  organization.  </P> <P> The group is planning a murder-mystery night called "Murder in the Library"  next spring.

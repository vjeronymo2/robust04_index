			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / S African murder plot claim THE AFRICAN National Congress said yesterday that white right-wingers were plotting to assassinate its leaders and derail democracy talks aimed at ending white minority rule in South Africa, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. It said one of the conspirators had confessed to police last week he had been involved in a plot to kill Mr Joe Slovo, Communist party chairman, who is also a top white figure in the ANC. The movement accused the police of not informing Mr Slovo even though they knew of the plot. Police earlier said they believed there had been a conspiracy to kill Mr Chris Hani, Mr Slovo's Communist party colleague, who was assassinated on April 10.</p>

Many important scientific and technical questions arising in  the realisation of chuche-orientation, modernization and  scientification of the national economy have been solved in the  course of the movement.    Last year alone, more than 20,000 technical innovation  proposals including 600 odd inventions were presented.    Noticeable successes made last year were the development of  a  general diagnostic system of great importance in the advance of  the machine tool industry, the completion of a new method of  heat treatment, a steel plate processing robot controlled by a  computer, a solar heat oven and the production of ornamental  tiles from industrial wastes.    The development of medicines efficacious for malignant tumor  and diseases and an artificial skin for healing burns and the  production of new phosphate fertilizer are achievements in the  scientific researches for public health and agriculture.    The "Youth Science and Technology March" is a mass movement  of young people to rapidly develop the country's science and  technology by accelerating the technical revolution. Starting  in 1989, the movement set it as its goal to guide each young man  and woman to acquire one or more kind of scientific knowledge  and technique, elevate his or her level of technique and skill  to a higher grade and realise at least one invention or one  innovation and rationalization proposal.    Young people at industrial establishments and scientific  research institutions across the country have developed and  introduced more than 100,000 inventions and innovation proposals  in the past five years, greatly contributing to the economic  development of the country and the improvement of people's  livelihood.    The technical innovation youth shock brigade and the  automation youth shock brigade play a very big part in the  movement. More than 2,850 technical innovation youth shock  brigades and 850 automation youth shock brigades are active in  the country involving tens of thousands of young people.    Nearly 10,000 new technological successes are annually  introduced by them. Production and technical processes have  been further modernized and much workforce, materials and fund  have been saved thanks to their contributions.    The vigorous movement has produced a great many engineers,  assistant engineers and experts and more than 3,000 inventors.</p>

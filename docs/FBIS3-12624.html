			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, March 3, IRNA -- Iranian  Ambassador to the United Nations Gholam 'Ali Khoshru here  Wednesday called on the Security Council to urge for liberation  of occupied Palestine, as the only and genuine way to bring  about justice, and for the dismantling of all Zionist  settlements and return of all Palestinian refugees to their  homeland.    Addressing the session, Khoshru said that the last Friday  massacre of Palestinian worshipers in al-Khalil by the Zionists  would not be the last if the approach of the international  community towards the question of Palestine continues to be the  same.    He further noted that the circumstances surrounding the  tragic incident clearly proved the fact that the attack was  premeditated and led by the elements from Zionist army.    "That the Israeli soldiers guarding the mosque not only did  nothing to stop the massacre but as the Zionists confessed  later, opened fire on the worshipers who were fleeing the scene,  clearly indicates that the full responsibility over the massacre  lies with the Zionist regime," he added.    The ambassador also remarked that it was astonishing, while  Zionists coming from a land thousands miles away were allowed to  carry automatic guns, attack indigenous civilians in their  mosque, but Palestinians were not allowed to live in their  homeland and were subjected to continuous Zionist brutality.    Khoshru voiced solidarity of both the Iranian people and  government with the Palestinians and support for their struggles  and expressed their deepest condolences to the bereaved families  and Palestinian people on the occasion of the horrible massacre.</p>

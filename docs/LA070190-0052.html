			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCULPT THIS INTO YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT  </P> <P> What follows is a sort of modest proposal for seeing our way clear of the  current NEA debacle.  </P> <P> To begin with, though, a bit of analysis. Apparently we've come to the point in  our national political life where it is seriously being argued that if the  grant for a particular artist or artwork or exhibition could conceivably be  deemed objectionable to a single citizen -- or a small minority of citizens, or  even a sizeable plurality -- well, then, that grant must not be awarded, since  a fraction (admittedly a minuscule fraction) of his or her or their tax dollars  could then be seen to be promoting such work.  </P> <P> This is a novel theory. I notice, for example, that such logic was never  applied to funding for the Stealth bomber or aid to the regimes in El Salvador  and Guatemala or any number of other such initiatives that I and many of my  fellow citizens find obscene. By the logic applied to the National Endowment  for the Arts, none of those programs should have been allowed to proceed. But  OK. Let's assume that (astonishingly) that logic is now going to be allowed to  hold sway in the coming debate on NEA funding.  </P> <P> There's a simple solution: Currently the very first item on everyone's standard  1040 tax form reads: "Presidential Election Campaign: Do you want $1 to go to  this fund? Yes? No?" And there's a little note over to the side: "Checking  'yes' will not change your tax or reduce your refund." So, fine, let's simply  divide the upcoming NEA appropriation. The vast majority of the authorization,  the noncontroversial portion that everyone pretty much agrees on, let's just  pass outright. As for the rest, let's add two new boxes to the top of  everybody's next 1040 form. The first would read: "National Art Fund: Do you  want $1 of these taxes to go to a fund for art and artists, which would be  awarded on the basis of traditional peer review criteria without regard to  specific content?" (followed by the proviso as to how checking "yes" would in  no way affect one's tax liability). This way, nobody would be seeing his or her  moral qualms abused; such people's money wouldn't come into it and their  opinions would have no standing.  </P> <P> The second new box would read: "North Carolina Tobacco Farm Subsidy." Some of  Jesse Helm's most influential backers could expect to garner precisely as many  dollars (and not a penny more) as there are citizens who don't consider that  particular boondoggle to be a continuing national scandal.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRASH BINS PROMISE GOOD RETURN  </P> <P> Orange recycling bins have been distributed to about 15,000 Manhattan Beach  residences in anticipation of a recycling program that starts Monday.  Newspapers, plastic soda pop containers, glass, and aluminum and tin cans will  be picked up for recycling on regular weekly trash collection days, according  to David Ludwig, contract manager for the city Department of Public Services.  </P> <P> Ludwig said the city started the program to help relieve the pressure on  landfills by removing recyclable materials that normally are dumped. He said  residents now divert about 5% of their trash through recycling and the city  hopes to increase the rate to 20% with the program.  </P> <P> Residents will pay an additional 70 cents per month on their trash bills for  recycling. But if the participation rate is 50%, which Ludwig said is expected,  residents will get a credit of 50 cents per month at the end of the year.  </P> <P> Recycling has been added to the city's trash collection contract with Western  Waste Industries, which has four years to run.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> 2 Live Crude: The rap group 2 Live Crew performed their regular risque  repertoire in a packed Gainesville, Fla., nightclub Thursday, despite a  prosecutor's threats to arrest the rappers on obscenity charges if they didn't  clean up their lyrics.  </P> <P> The group had an attorney on standby during the one-night stand, and bail money  available if Len Register, state attorney, had followed up on his threat.  Register said he would have the band arrested if they played uncensored  versions of songs such as "Me So Horny," and "Move Somethin," which have lyrics  referring to sadomasochistic sex and violence against women. The prosecutor had  called the crew's songs "the most filthy thing I've ever encountered." GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

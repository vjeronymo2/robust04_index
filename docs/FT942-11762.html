			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Budget fears dampen Silentnight sales The change to a November Budget hindered recovery in the UK furniture market, according to Silentnight Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds. The Lancashire-based group said retailers found that the run-up to the chancellor's package in November created financial uncertainty during what had historically been its main selling season, before Christmas. It added: 'The announcement of tax increases to take effect in April undoubtedly hit consumer confidence and had a dampening effect on sales.' Silentnight, which issued a profits warning in March, yesterday reported a 3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.4m in the year to January 29. Sales rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 167m. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said: 'There have been few tangible signs yet of an improvement in the UK furniture market.' He added that the sale of big-ticket price items was very sensitive to changes in consumer sentiment, particularly in the middle to lower end of the market, although the top end was more stable. The group's UK beds business experienced significant margin pressure and profits declined, although sales rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 101m. Mr Davies said the production of Silentnight beds was being concentrated in one factory, with the existing plant at Sutton being closed. This would involve the loss of about 70 jobs at a cost of Pounds 750,000, which would fall in the current year. Sales in the UK cabinets business rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 43m and profits also increased. Silentnight continued to invest about half its capital expenditure of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8.8m) in the cabinets business, which increased its estimated share of the UK market from 5 per cent to 6 per cent. The group's share of the UK bed market was stable at 32 per cent. The group said overseas businesses had continued to improve. Its German manufacturer of beds and mattresses, bought in 1992, contributed sales of Pounds 12.5m and continued to provide a good return. The previously lossmaking US subsidiary was now breaking even. Earnings rose to 17.62p (17.14p). A 0.5p cut in the final dividend to 5.25p maintains the total at 8p. Mr Davies said this was intended to restore the one-to-two balance between interim and final payments, reflecting the group's strong seasonal bias to the second half. COMMENT While accepting the Budget posed a particular problem last year, analysts were surprised the group gave such a downbeat view on the trading outlook. One asked whether the continuing pressure on margins meant the strategy of having several brands in the mature market for beds was fundamentally flawed. Whether or not it signals any more rationalisation, the combining of the Silentnight plants will hit first-half profits. There is also irritation that the group will not identify the profits contribution from cabinets, in which it has been investing heavily. Forecast pre-tax profits put the shares, unchanged yesterday at 304p, on a prospective multiple of 16.1 - a 5 per cent premium to the market, which looks high enough.</p>

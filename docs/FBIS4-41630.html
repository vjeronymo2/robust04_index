			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 26 June (TASS) -- "If I am elected president  of Ukraine, I will insist on parliament immediately considering  the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,"  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an interview with  TASS on Sunday [26 June].    Kravchuk reported that he had already submitted his  proposals  on this issue to parliament.    "Joining the treaty, although with certain reservations, has  been the only correct step taken by Ukraine in this direction,"  the president stressed.    He is convinced that "the world and the Ukrainian people  itself will estimate this step at its true worth."    Kravchuk expressed confidence that the newly-elected  parliament would resume considering this document.</p>

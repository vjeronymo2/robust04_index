The synthetic SST gene was  cloned into the pBR325 plasmid vector at the EcoRI  and BamHI restrictase sites. As a result, expressing  vector systems which ensure constitutive or induced synthesis of  hybrid CAT-SST proteins at a 5-10% level of the total cell  proteins in E. coli strains with an inhibited  proteinase activity were created. The hybrid protein was  segmented by cyanogen bromide, and SST was isolated by gel  filtration and reverse phase chromatography. It is noted that  the specific biological and immunological activity of purified  and renatured SST matches that of natural SST. The bacterial  SST-producing strains developed as a result of the effort and  the methods of SST isolation from the bacterial mass make it  possible to obtain 98% pure somatostatin with a yield of  approximately 1 mg/l. The resulting recombinant SST is  comparable to the commercial product synthesized by Serva. The  authors are grateful to I.S. Komolov, A.A. Bulatov, and G.P.  Yelizarova for biological activity studies and to M.L. Khodun  for immunological testing. Figures 8; tables 1; references 24: 8  Russian, 16 Western.</p>

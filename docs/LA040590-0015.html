			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY THE DEFENDANT'S PLEA;  </P> <P> BLAME HIS DISABILITIES, NOT A COLD AND CALCULATED HEART  </P> <P> The following is excerpted from the defense petition to the U.S. District Court  for the Southern District of California that succeeded in gaining a stay of the  scheduled April 3 execution of Robert Alton Harris. The defense appeal lawyers  are Charles M. Sevilla, Michael K. McCabe and Michael Laurence of San Diego.  </P> <P>  All of Robert Harris' actions, both those "planned" and those which arose on  the spur of the moment, were filtered through a brain that had been damaged by  a sea of alcohol in utero and by fists and weapons wielded against him by his  parents in early childhood. His plan to rob a bank was not a plan to violate  social norms instinctively known to him but rejected out of selfishness and  greed. It was merely a means of survival, learned from his parents and their  associates and patterned after their behavior. Moreover, it was not even a  "plan" in the sense of behavior chosen by one who had the ability to step back,  recognize that bank robbery was socially inappropriate, and decide that he  would carry out the robbery anyway because he rejected adherence to prevailing  social mores. His "plan" was instead driven by impulse, without the mediation  of that part of the brain capable of reflecting upon and weighing alternative  courses of action in appreciation of the social fabric in which action takes  place.  </P> <P> Every sequence in the crime thereafter reflected Robert's inability to rein in  or modulate his impulsivity with rational, socially conscious judgment. He  could not steal a car, so he forced two young people into giving over their  car. They attempted to assuage his fear of apprehension for taking their car,  but as he got further and further into the events of the crime, the tension and  stress grew, and with it, his already diminished ability to apply rational  controls to his behavior became further subdued. The fear and paranoia  associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) (added to) his already  heightened impulsivity and, without apparent reasons to the outside observer --  in light of the victims' seemingly successful attempts to reassure Mr. Harris  -- he began shooting. In the extraordinary stress of the moment, Mr. Harris'  impaired ability to empathize with the victims was so reduced that he could  shoot them without having made a conscious choice to do so. Thus, the hallmarks  of his interconnected disabilities -- emotional lability, impaired rational  control processes, inability to rely on instinctive guidance by social norms,  and emotional distance from other human beings -- were, when unmasked, the  hallmarks of Mr. Harris' crimes. Thus, the true answer to why he committed this  crime could not have been more different from the answer given by the State at  trial.  </P> <P> His apparently mean-spirited and cold-hearted behaviors thereafter were just as  characteristic of his disabilities. His joking about the victims' deaths and  his eating their food were classic forms of socially inappropriate behavior  engaged in by one who has little ability to have concern for -- or to perceive  others' concern for -- his transgressions. His violence in the jail is the  violence of one (who) can be manipulated toward criminal behavior by anyone  willing to show a modicum of kindness to him, and who has little ability to  appreciate the gross impropriety of his actions -- even in the fact of the  obvious negative consequences these behaviors would have for his case. And his  lies to the jury about what happened at the time of the crime at the guilt  phase were living exemplars of his incapacity to engage in socially appropriate  behavior at the very time where there was absolutely nothing to be gained, and  all to be lost, by readily transparent dissimulation. In short, Robert Harris  couldn't make, even when his life depended on it, a judgment considerate of  social conventions.  </P> <P> Without the evidence that Robert Harris has brain damage, organic personality  disorder, fetal alcohol effects and PTSD, the jury which convicted him and  sentenced him to death was thus fundamentally misled. Without the State's  misleading evidence to rely on, the jury could not help but conclude that  Robert was, in truth, the mean-spirited, evil man which he appeared to be and  which the prosecution said he was. Had the jury known instead that multiple,  severe physical and emotional disabilities, not "a cold and calculated heart,"  produced Robert's repugnant behaviors, it would not, in all reasonable  likelihood, have convicted Robert of capital murder or condemned him to die.  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Single word that can save Denmark's bacon DENMARK yesterday received a blunt warning from its EC partners about the risks of delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty. During the opening session at the Edinburgh summit, Germany, Spain and others made clear that if the Twelve could not agree on Denmark's demands for legally-binding opt-outs on Maastricht, the others would press ahead regardless. Despite the tough talk, all parties expressed hope that a deal on the Danish question could be reached today when the UK presidency presents a third revised draft. 'A lot of this argument is inevitable theatre,' commented a British official, who also noted a more accommodating French attitude. The chief difficulty facing the Twelve is how to wrap Danish demands for opt-outs on a common European currency, common defence policy, EC citizenship and common justice and immigration policies in a quasi-treaty form. Danish prime minister Poul Schluter warned yesterday that the text must be strong enough to sway voters in a second referendum on Maastricht next April or May; if not, there would be no treaty. The UK, working closely with top lawyers in Brussels, has suggested that EC leaders take a 'decision'. Although a 'decision' would have the force of international law, it would not amount to renegotiation of the treaty or require re-ratification of Maastricht, Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal service told EC leaders. Spain, Germany, Italy, and Portugal all expressed doubts about the word 'decision", offering weaker alternatives such as a 'resolution' or a 'declaration' which they said would not have to be presented to their national parliaments. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's complaints were unexpected, but may have been intended to show the purists such as Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain that he was no pushover. After the opening session, Mr Dieter Vogel, chief German spokesman, said pointedly that he could not imagine that the Danish question 'would founder on one word'. But several members expressed irritation when Mr Schluter presented a more expansive demand for exemption from a common EC defence policy set out in the Maastricht treaty. Another potential difficulty concerns Danish demands for an agreement which is limitless in time. Luxembourg officials said this risked prejudging the planned review of Maastricht at a conference in 1996, where intergovernmental co-operation on justice and immigration might become a Community matter. On a harsh interpretation, the Danes could be accused of holding back the development of the EC, which is why a senior Brussels official said the Danish question 'all comes down to presentation - and political mood'.</p>

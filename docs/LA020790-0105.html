			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN AND VAN DE KAMP TO DEBATE  </P> <P> Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein Tuesday challenged Atty. Gen. John  K. Van de Kamp, her opponent in the Democratic governor's race, to six separate  debates before the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> "Clearly there are differences in our positions on critical issues . . . and it  is my hope that the campaign for governor can transcend the buzzwords and  whispered innuendo that have become too much a part of the political process,"  Feinstein said in Fresno and San Diego during the second day of a two-day tour  of California to formally announce her candidacy.  </P> <P> Feinstein gave reporters copies of two letters, one of them to Van de Kamp  seeking the debates and the other to state Democratic Chairman Edmund G. Brown  Jr. asking him to help set up a debate schedule.  </P> <P> Among the issues Feinstein said she would like to debate are the environment,  education, health care, crime and senior citizens.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's campaign manager, Richie Ross, said Tuesday: "We absolutely  accept and we would suggest that . . . we debate those issues where we  disagree. Have you seen her list? She calls for a debate on senior citizens.  Everybody's for it. They're both Democrats and there is not going to be a  difference. The debates instead become little candidate forums."  </P></p>

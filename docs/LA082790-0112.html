			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-GUINNESS CHIEF GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY;  </P> <P> COURTS: A LONDON JURY CONVICTS ERNEST SAUNDERS OF A STOCK SCHEME LINKED TO THE  1986 TAKEOVER OF A SCOTTISH DISTILLER.  </P> <P> Former Guinness PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Ernest Saunders and three  co-defendants were found guilty today on 19 of 20 counts of misconduct in  connection with the 1986 takeover of a Scottish distiller.  </P> <P> The jury at Southwark Crown Court, which deliberated for nearly a week,  convicted Saunders, 54, on two charges of conspiracy to contravene the  Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, eight charges of false accounting and  two charges of theft. He was acquitted of illegally destroying documents.  </P> <P> Gerald Ronson, 50, chairman of Heron International PLC, was found guilty of  conspiracy, two charges of false accounting and one of theft.  </P> <P> Former stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44, was found guilty of four charges of  false accounting and two of theft.  </P> <P> The jury convicted millionaire financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, on two charges of  conspiracy, three charges of false accounting and one of theft.  </P> <P> The defendants were convicted on 19 of the 20 counts listed on the charge  sheet. Some charges named more than one defendant.  </P> <P> Judge Denis Henry said Saunders, Ronson and Parnes would be sentenced Tuesday,  and postponed sentencing until Sept. 25 for Lyons, who is to undergo surgery  this week.  </P> <P> Four other men still face trial for their alleged involvement in a scheme to  arrange for the purchase of Guinness' stock during the takeover fight for  Distillers Co., a Scotch whiskey and gin maker, in 1986.  </P> <P> The government said there was an illegal operation to support Guinness' share  price to make its cash and stock bid of 2.7 billion pounds, or $5.18 billion,  for Distillers more attractive than a rival bid from supermarket operator  Argyll Group PLC.  </P> <P> More than 40 million pounds, or $76.86 million, of Guinness shares were  purchased during the Distillers takeover fight. The prosecution claimed  Guinness paid about 25 million pounds, or $48 million, in unlawful indemnities  against losses in share dealing and in fees.  </P> <P> Guinness succeeded in April, 1986, in what was then Britain's largest takeover.  In December of that year, the Department of Trade and Industry announced it was  investigating; Saunders was arrested in May, 1987. Other arrests followed.  </P> <P> Saunders, who has maintained he is a scapegoat, smiled as the jury foreman read  the verdicts. Afterward, as he was led away, he waved to son James and daughter  Joanna in the court's gallery.  </P> <P> In an earlier interview with Sky Television, Saunders accused the prosecution  of building "a politically based, mega-case . . . which has been hyped to an  extraordinary extent."  </P> <P> "I believe that for their own reasons a number of people have found it  convenient to blame Ernest Saunders for a number of things that have gone on,"  he said.  </P> <P> Former Guinness Director Jonathan Guinness said today that he felt sorry for  Saunders and his family but added, "I don't see how the jury could have come to  any other verdict."  </P> <P> In his closing argument, Judge Henry asked the jury to decide whether the  criminal law "needs to protect markets to try to keep them straight, or should  we simply leave it to the fat cats and the law of the jungle?"  </P> <P> The market is not a casino with the game fixed in favor of a few rich and  privileged players, he said.  </P> <P> The case was brought to trial by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, set up two  years ago to investigate and prosecute complex fraud cases.  </P> <P> In the second trial, expected to start in October, Saunders will again be a  defendant, along with Roger Seelig, 44, former corporate finance director for  Morgan Grenfell and Co. Ltd.; Lord Patrick Spens, 47, former director of  corporate finance at the merchant bank Henry Ansbacher and corporate finance  partner of the investment firm Cazenove and Co. Ltd.; and David Mayhew, 48,  senior corporate finance partner at Cazenove.  </P></p>

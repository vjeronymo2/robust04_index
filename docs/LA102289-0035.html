			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK 'N' ROIL: DEBATES ON WHO'S NO. 1, RACISM, SEXISM AND CRITICISM  </P> <P> Yes, Guns N' Roses' song "One in a Million" uses racist remarks, but it uses  them to show us how evil racism is!  </P> <P> The song does not reflect the band's opinions; they have explained that in many  heavy-metal magazines. You have to show the ugliness of hate, just as you must  show the ugliness of drugs.  </P> <P> ALEX ZARBANO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

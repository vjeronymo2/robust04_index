			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Bosnia's Moslems ask for US backing BOSNIA'S Moslem president Alia Izetbegovic yesterday prepared to take his case directly to the White House, in another desperate attempt to muster international support. In spite of their accusation that the west has abandoned them, the Bosnians yesterday did little to conceal their belief that the US remains their best hope to pressure the Croats and Serbs into more concessions. It is a belief that the US seems reluctant to quash. Last week, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, indicated that the Serbs and Croats should be blamed for the breakdown of the peace talks. Shortly after, President Bill Clinton made fresh threats of air strikes against the Serbs and Croats. Next week Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, is due to visit Sarajevo. Meanwhile, suspicions remain in some diplomatic quarters that comments from American officials at the Geneva talks last week might have encouraged the Moslems to stall the talks. American and Bosnian officials deny this. However Mr Clinton's decision to receive Mr Izetbegovic as Bosnian president at all is nevertheless seen as a significant gesture of support, though a US administration official pointed that Bosnia was a state recognised by the US and that Mr Izetbegovic had met Mr Clinton before. Mr Muhamed Filipovic, a member of the Bosnian government's Geneva delegation, yesterday said: 'We know that the Americans have been opposed to the division of Bosnia and still are. And so we have hopes.' Nevertheless, the message to Mr Izetbegovic from President Clinton last night remains ambiguous. Amid continued divisions among the allies - and within the US government itself - over what can be done in the Balkans, Mr Clinton seems neither ready to demand that the Bosnians accept the peace plan, nor prepared to impose any alternatives. The indecision reflects the dilemma which Mr Clinton now finds himself in. As American officials well know, if he fails to act over Bosnia, he is liable to face fresh charges of foreign policy weakness. But if he attempts to act unilaterally, he risks further straining the transatlantic alliance, and possibly weakening his position at home, given limited domestic support for the deployment of US troops in the Balkans. Faced with this uncertainty, the most that Mr Izetbegovic could realistically hope for from yesterday's meeting would be a better guarantee that the US will contribute to peacekeeping troops. Indeed, such a guarantee would do much to encourage the Moslems to return to negotiations - tentatively scheduled to start again in 12 days time - in spite of their insistence that they would rather fight on than accept the current peace proposals. Although military officials in Washington have indicated in recent days that America would be prepared to provide a large part of a peace-keeping force - perhaps up to 30,000 troops - uncertainties remain. Senior military officials are known to remain opposed to placing American troops under a UN command. The option that Mr Izetbegovic himself clearly hopes for - American-led air strikes in Bosnia - appears increasingly problematic, in light of the complexity of the situation on the ground. As an American official recently admitted: 'Persuading the rest of Nato to consider air strikes against the Serbs was hard enough. Persuading them to do them against the Croats or Croats and Serbs together will be much harder  -particularly with UN troops up on (Mount) Igman.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 22 (AFP)--Sino-British talks on  Hong Kong were making headway Wednesday, negotiators said, as a  top Chinese official suggested Beijing was prepared to accept a  financing plan for the colony's new airport.    "We've covered a lot of ground. The atmosphere continues to  be constructive," chief British negotiator Hugh Davies said  after the second day of Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks.    He declined to give details, but Davies and Chinese  counterpart Guo Fengmin promised to say "something more" when  their meeting winds up on Thursday.    On Friday the Joint Liaison Group's specialized airport  committee is to discuss the vexed issue of how much debt to  raise to pay for the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok  airport and related public works.    The Joint Liaison Group is the diplomatic body charged with  hammering out technical details of Hong Kong's 1997 handback to  China. This week's meeting is its first in six months.    In an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal,  Beijing's  top official for Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, said China was  "very flexible" on the financing issue.    "Britain has been indicating that it wants to cooperate with  the Chinese side on the economic front," Lu was quoted as  saying. "We are waiting to see their deeds."    The airport financing issue has been overshadowed since 1992  by Governor Chris Patten's pre-1997 democratic reform plans, the  final stage of which is to be adopted next week by the  Legislative Council.    Picking up on Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's statement last  week that China was willing to bury the hatchet when it comes to  Patten's political reforms, Lu said: "Chris Patten is someone  beyond our control."    Under a 1991 agreement with Britain, China must be consulted  if Hong Kong wants to raise more than five billion Hong Kong  dollars (646.83 million U.S.) of airport-related debt maturing  after 1997.    But Lu said Beijing now was ready to accept a debt level  "far  about five [as received]." He did not elaborate.    Hong Kong favors tapping world capital markets to help pay  for Chek Lap Kok, taking advantage of the best interest rates in  many years, but China dreads that too much debt will be left  behind once Britain departs in 1997.</p>

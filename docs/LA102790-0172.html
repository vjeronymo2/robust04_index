			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN GLASSMAKER GETS FOREIGN LOAN;  </P> <P> FINANCE: JUST ONE U.S. FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE $126-MILLION VITRO DEAL.  </P> <P> In the largest new commercial bank loan to a Mexican company since the Third  World debt crisis began eight years ago, 16 international banks and an arm of  the World Bank agreed this week to lend glassmaking giant Vitro $126 million  for up to 10 years.  </P> <P> In addition, the International Finance Corp., the World Bank unit that extends  credit to private companies, said it will invest $10 million in the company's  stock.  </P> <P> The loan and new stock issue are expected to cover most of the $150-million  cost of a new plant, which will double Vitro's production of glass for the  automotive, construction and furniture industries. Plant construction in this  city in northeastern Mexico is scheduled to take two years.  </P> <P> Vitro is Mexico's largest glassmaker, with 1989 revenue of $1.7 billion, and  owns Anchor Glass, a major U.S. bottle maker. From its Monterrey plant, Vitro  also supplies about 8% of the glass used in the windshields and windows of  U.S.-made cars.  </P> <P> Ernesto Martens, Vitro president, said the expansion is needed to keep up with  growing demand and would not have been possible without the international loan.  Long-term credit is virtually unavailable in Mexico, and interest rates on  short-term credit are 35% or more annually.  </P> <P> Already among the strongest companies on the Mexican Stock Exchange, the  corporation is considered a likely candidate to begin trading on U.S. markets  through American Depository Receipts, the equivalent of shares for foreign  corporations.  </P> <P> The loan was made to Vitro's flat-glass production company, Vitro Flotado,  which is 35% owned by Pilkington PLC of Britain.  </P> <P> The banks agreed to lend Vitro the money at a favorable interest rate of 2  percentage points over the London Interbank Rate.  </P> <P> The International Finance Corp., which organized the loan, will supply $25  million. The rest of the borrowed money will come from 15 European banks and  First City Texas-Houston.  </P> <P> In the last eight years, U.S. banks have set up reserves and written off  billions of dollars in Latin American debt, contributing to large losses.  </P></p>

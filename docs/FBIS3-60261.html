On the afternoon of 27 December, under the direction of  National Assembly Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu, the National  Assembly held a plenary session at the conference hall to pass  the Law on Environmental Protection.    The National Assembly heard Mr. Luong Xuan Quy, a member of  the meeting secretariat, read a report on behalf of the  Secretariat, the Scrutiny Committee, and the Committee that  drafted the law on the views contributed by National Assembly  deputies regarding revision of the draft law. He also read the  full text of the revised draft Law on Environmental Protection.    Next, 32 National Assembly deputies spoke on those articles  of the draft law with which they still had differences. These  deputies were: Nguyen Dinh Ngo of Thua Thien Hue; Nguyen Dinh  Giang of Quang Ninh; Nguyen Viet Dung and Mai Thuc Lan of Ha  Bac; Nguyen Minh Quang of Nam Ha; Do Quoc Hung of Ba Ria-Vung  Tau; Nguyen Don of Quang Nam- Danang; Vu Dinh Cu and Tran Thi  Tam Dan of Hanoi; Co Hoa Van of Lao Cai; Le Thi Thanh Liem and  Tran Van Ngau of Ben Tre; Tran Minh Xuan of Khanh Hoa; Nguyen  Ngoc Tran of An Giang; Le Khac Binh, Nguyen Tan Phat, Nguyen Van  Thanh, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Phuong, and Chu Pham Ngoc Son of Ho Chi  Minh City; Dang Huu of Binh Dinh; Pham Hung of Hai Hung; Tran  Chu Toan of Gia Lai; Nguyen Duc Hoan of Quang Tri; Bui Ngoc  Thanh of Lang Son; Nguyen Xuan Thiet and Dinh Xuan The of Vinh  Phu; Nguyen Khac Tao of Ha Tinh; Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu of Tien  Giang; Do Van An of Son La; Nguyen Quoc Thuc of Nghe An; Nguyen  Van Thanh of Dong Nai; and Hoang Dinh Cau of Ha Tay.    The National Assembly then decided on those issues where  there were still differences.    With a high identity of views, the National Assembly voted  to  pass the Law on Environmental Protection. This important law is  designed to keep the environment clean, healthy, and beautiful;  improve the environment; ensure ecological balance; prevent and  overcome the harmful impact on the environment caused by human  beings and the elements; and provide for the rational and  thrifty exploitation and use of natural resources.    The National Assembly will continue its session at the  conference hall on 28 December 1993.</p>

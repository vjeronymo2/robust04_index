			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- When meeting with Cyrus  Vance, former U.S. secretary of state, and his party at  Zhongnanhai this morning, State Council Premier Li Peng said:  Improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations is favorable to  economic cooperation between the two countries.    Li Peng said China attaches great importance to Sino-U.S.  relations and expressed the hope that relations between the two  countries will develop toward a good direction [hao de fang  xiang 1170 4104 2455 0686]. He said: As China and the United  States are two big and influential countries, statesmen of the  two countries should look toward the future and the 21st century  when handling bilateral relations.    Li Peng said: China and the United States are very strongly  complementary to each other economically [jing ji hu bu xing hen  qiang 4842 3444 0062 5943 1840 1771 1730]. The United States  has a very strong economic force and leads the world in the  fields of high technology and infrastructures, while China  enjoys sustained economic growth and has a vast market, rich  labor force resource, and fairly strong technical force. There  are bright prospects for Sino-U. S. multiform economic and  technological cooperation.    He said: "We are pleased to see that many large U.S.  corporations have recently submitted tenders in China. They are  very enthusiastic about participating in China's infrastructures  constructions."    Li Peng said: If Sino-U.S. relations were to continually  improve and develop, this would undoubtedly [wu yi 2477 3992] be  very favorable for U.S. enterprises to expand their business in  China.    At the guest's request, Li Peng gave a briefing on the  progress of reform of China's taxation system, policies for  attracting foreign funds, the role played by the People's Bank  of China as a central bank, and how interest rates are fixed.    Vance said he was very pleased to have the opportunity to  visit China again. He said he personally saw the tremendous  changes in Beijing on his arrival.    Vance will revisit Shanghai, where he visited in 1984. He  believed there would be even greater development and prosperity  over there.    Vance said that to his knowledge, President Clinton attaches  great importance to establishing a stable and healthy  relationship with China. He believed there would be further  development of the mutually beneficial Sino-U.S. cooperation in  various fields.    Li Peng said: The doors leading to China were opened when  the Republican Party was in power while diplomatic relations  were established under the rule of the Democratic Party. "We  have many friends in both parties."    Vance said: The United States will work to develop relations  with China no matter which party is in power. This is a  unanimous point.    The meeting was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere.  Premier Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin, Mrs Vance, and former U.S.  deputy secretary of state Whitehead and his wife were present at  the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) --  Japanese figures of different circles held a meeting for  thinking of Japan-Korea friendship in Kyoto on April 23.    Speeches were made at the meeting attended by Azuma Okuda,  chairman of the International Higher Institute; Hiroshi  Wakabayashi, secretary general of the Japan Committee for  Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea;  Hisateru Mitsuda, honorary professor at Kyoto University; and  other political, public and academic figures and men of the  press, 400 in all.    Liberal-democratic member of the House of Representatives  Hiromu Nonaka in his speech charged that the Japanese ruling  coalition was spreading anti-DPRK public opinion over the  "nuclear problem" of the DPRK.    "The Japanese people" he said "should strive to make the  relations with the DPRK very close ties and restore Japan- Korea  friendship and confidence."    Prof. Motofumi Asai at Meijigakuin University in his speech  pointed out that the United States is crying over the "nuclear  problem" of DPRK for the purpose of putting down public opinion  for disarmament at home.    Honorary Prof. Toshiyuki Toyota at Nagoya University in his  speech said the Japanese media were distorting facts by quoting  a part of Western reports and the International Atomic Energy  Agency was applying a double-standard policy regarding the  "nuclear problem" of the DPRK.    Lawyer Yoshihiro Sorano said that, in view of Japan-Korea  friendship, the issue of postwar settlement must be solved  properly and the conditions of the Koreans in Japan be improved.</p>

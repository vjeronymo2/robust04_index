			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON DESERVES PRAISE  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson should be praised for his efforts to reopen schools in  his district while building a school in Porter Ranch at no cost to us  taxpayers.  </P> <P> I agree that the school board is "totally out of control."  </P> <P> Where is Kornstein, our so-called representative? She is busy purchasing the  Ambassador Hotel and transporting our children on buses for year-round  education, and at the same time cutting our educators' salary.  </P> <P> I feel we should rally behind Bernson since he understands our district, which  has grown and prospered during his term in office.  </P> <P> RAE BERKOWITZ  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

So, the effects of  the additives m- ZrO[.sub]2[/] and t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] which  was partially stabilized by 2mol%Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  addition and stabilized by 12mol%CeO[.sub]2[/] addition on  mechanical properties of Ti(C,N)-  TiB[.sub]2[/]-ZrO[.sub]2[/] ceramics were made clear  firstly. As the result, it was found that 40% addition of  m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] to Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/] system could  increase a fracture toughness K[.sub]IC[/] from 3.2 to 7.5  MPam[.sup]1/2[/], also addition of t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] which  were stabilized by 2mol%Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  12mol%CeO[.sub]2[/] could increase the fracture toughness  K[.sub]IC[/] from 2.3 to 4.5 and to 4 MPa[.sup]1/2[/],  respectively. Next, it was investigated how the amount of  m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] affects the mechanical properties of  Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/]-m-ZrO ceramics. As the results,  Ti(C,N)- TiB[.sub]2[/]-m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] ceramics containing  over 30wt% m- ZrO[.sub]2[/] have higher fracture toughness  than 6 MPam[.sup]1/2[/]. It is thought that a high fracture  toughness K[.sub]IC[/] caused from t in phase  transformation and difference of thermal expansion between  ZrO[.sub]2[/] and the matrix of TiB[.sub]2[/] and Ti(C,N).

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Directorial Strongman: Arnold Schwarzenegger has the muscle, so to speak, to  direct one of his own movies, but he didn't want to make his debut on a major  project.  </P> <P> Instead, he directed a 30-minute episode of "Tales From the Crypt" for HBO,  which airs Saturday as part of the series taken from the 1950s comic book.  Schwarzenegger's episode, "The Switch," stars William Hickey as an old man who  swaps body parts with a younger man to attract a beautiful woman. "I didn't  want to start out with a big movie and fall on my face," Schwarzenegger said.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECT VISIONARIES  </P> <P> The front-page article (Aug. 6) about George Bush, the "environmental  president" who isn't really, made me angry at every wishy-washy popularity  seeker I have ever voted for. President Bush seems to be afraid to support or  oppose environmental issues because somebody, somewhere is likely to disagree  with him, and that might make him unpopular.  </P> <P> We need to find, and to elect, a few visionaries who are willing to make a  stand and stick to it. It would be nice if they were also articulate and made  occasional statements that weren't completely predictable.  </P> <P> SUSAN HOHENHAUSEN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

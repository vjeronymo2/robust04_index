			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. LOSES THE BEST FRIEND IT HAD IN KREMLIN;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> With the surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze, the U.S. government lost the best friend it ever had in the  Kremlin, a pivotal author of the post-Cold War Washington-Moscow partnership  that stretched from Eastern Europe to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III gamely predicted that Soviet foreign  policy will remain unchanged because President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wants it  that way. But Baker acknowledged that the U.S.-Soviet detente might not have  developed as it did if Shevardnadze had not been running Moscow's Foreign  Ministry.  </P> <P> "President Gorbachev has said there will be no change as a consequence of this  resignation in Soviet foreign policy," Baker told a press conference devoted  almost exclusively to Shevardnadze's departure.  </P> <P> Baker seemed to be trying to put the best face on what, from Washington's  standpoint, could become a disastrous development.  </P> <P> Even if the next foreign minister adopts Shevardnadze's policies wholesale, the  internal divisions in the Soviet Union highlighted by the foreign minister's  stunning resignation could mean real trouble for future U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> Baker put aside his generally optimistic assessment to suggest that the world  should take seriously Shevardnadze's warning that the Soviet Union may be  headed for dictatorship.  </P> <P> "We really are not in a position today . . . to absolutely guarantee that it  (dictatorship) won't be the case," Baker said.  </P> <P> George Carver, former deputy director of the CIA, said, "Shevardnadze seems to  be willing to put a warning shot across Gorbachev's bow.  </P> <P> "If there is a major cat fight brewing in the inner circle of the Politburo,  that will obviously affect U.S.-Soviet relations," Carver said. "The stresses  on the Soviet Union are such that the chances of major tears along major seams  are getting greater every day."  </P> <P> The sort of political instability highlighted by Shevardnadze's resignation is  a central concern of a new study of the Soviet economy due to be released today  by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The two institutions  advise against extensive Western financial aid to the Soviets "until we know  who's running the shop," as one official familiar with the report put it.  </P> <P> The report was requested by the leaders of the world's seven largest industrial  democracies at their July summit meeting in Houston. It will provide the first  detailed, internationally accepted set of statistics on the Soviet economy and,  overall, portrays the nation in "very gloomy" terms, the official said. World  Bank President Barber Conable and IMF Executive Director Michel Camdessus  delivered the report to President Bush in a White House meeting Thursday  morning. Until Shevardnadze's successor is selected, there will be no way to  assess the full impact of the change. But there seems to be no one on the scene  with Shevardnadze's prestige or forceful personality.  </P> <P> "Will Shevardnadze's successor have the same standing with Gorbachev to allow  him to overrule the military or to cooperate with the United States in the  Persian Gulf?" asked Dimitri Simes, a senior associate of the Carnegie  Endowment for International Peace. "If Shevardnadze's desperation is justified,  if indeed there is a profound crisis in the Soviet Union, then all relations  with the Soviet Union are in doubt."  </P> <P> Simes, a Soviet emigre, said that Gorbachev's government does not have the same  clear-cut division of responsibility that exists in the U.S. Cabinet.  Therefore, he said, it is not possible to be sure how much influence  Shevardnadze had over Kremlin policy. But from Moscow's reaction to the Persian  Gulf crisis, Shevardnadze's influence seems to have been profound.  </P> <P> Ever since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Baker and Shevardnadze have worked  together to orchestrate international solidarity against Saddam Hussein.  Throughout the crisis, Shevardnadze has offered staunch support for the U.S.  belief that military force may have to be used to end Iraq's occupation. At the  same time, Gorbachev has shown much more reluctance to condone military action.  </P> <P> Last October, Shevardnadze said in an American television interview that if the  U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force in the gulf, the Soviet Union  would send troops to participate. The comments produced a storm of criticism in  the newly democratic Soviet Parliament, and Shevardnadze immediately disowned  his own comments.  </P> <P> "Shevardnadze was on board with the idea that the United States might have to  use military force in the gulf," said Raymond L. Garthoff, a former State  Department expert on the Soviet Union who is now a senior fellow of the  Brookings Institution in Washington. "Gorbachev, while not ruling out force,  had been hoping to avoid that possibility."  </P> <P> It is probably unlikely that Gorbachev will reverse Soviet support for U.S.  policy in the gulf at this late date. But Moscow's backing may become somewhat  less outspoken.  </P> <P> In the 23-month tenure of the Bush Administration, Baker and Shevardnadze held  25 formal meetings, nine of them since Iraq invaded Kuwait less than five  months ago. In a very real sense, the U.S.-Soviet relationship has become the  Baker-Shevardnadze relationship.  </P> <P> "On a purely personal note, I am going to miss him," Baker said.  </P> <P> Asked if he had staked too much on his friendship with Shevardnadze, Baker  said: "We have not risked anything because we have developed a good personal  relationship with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union. . . . Our policy  toward the Soviet Union does not rest on personalities, never has, still  doesn't."  </P> <P> Maybe not. But even under the most favorable circumstances, it will take some  time for Baker and a new foreign minister to develop the same rapport that made  the Baker-Shevardnadze relationship so smooth.  </P> <P> And it was with obvious pride that Baker cited some of the results of his  partnership with Shevardnadze: peaceful democratization of the previously  Communist regimes of Eastern Europe; reunification of Germany and U.S.-Soviet  cooperation in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "Without trying in any way to suggest that there was any difference between  President Gorbachev and Minister Shevardnadze, because I don't think there was,  I'm not sure that (those results) would have happened had he not been foreign  minister of the Soviet Union," Baker said.  </P> <P> Under the supervision of Baker and Shevardnadze, U.S. and Soviet negotiators  have wrapped up 95% of a new treaty reducing by at least one-third the U.S. and  Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons. Bush and Gorbachev hope to sign  the pact at a summit meeting in Moscow in February.  </P> <P> Baker said he does not expect Shevardnadze's resignation to derail the arms  talks.  </P></p>

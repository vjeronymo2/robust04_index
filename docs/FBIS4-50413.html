			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Furui (6079 4395 3848)] </F>   [Text] Oslo, 11 May (XINHUA) -- At a meeting this afternoon  with Norwegian entrepreneurs from industrial and commercial  circles, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who is on an  official friendly visit to Norway, briefed Norwegian  entrepreneurs on China's achievements in reform and opening up  and expressed the hope of developing reciprocal and cooperative  relations between China and Norway.    He said: China is making efforts to establish a brand-new  socialist market economic structure. In the progress of reform  and opening up, China has significantly improved its investment  environment, gradually amplified its economic laws and  regulations, and expanded its investment scope. "From now on,  we must continue to deepen reform, open wider to the outside  world, and further improve the investment environment in order  to offer favorable conditions to foreign entrepreneurs who come  to China to promote economic cooperation."    Li Ruihuan said: In recent years, economic and trade  exchanges and cooperation in other fields between China and  Norway have developed rapidly. However, in light of the  supplementary nature and strength of both economies, the  potential for bilateral cooperation is still great. He added:  I welcome more Norwegian entrepreneurs to invest in China and  to establish more foreign- funded enterprises. I hope that  entrepreneurs from Norwegian economic circles will formulate  long-term strategies and foster an enterprising spirit to  explore more fields of cooperation with China.    Schel Kultin [name as received], secretary general of the  Norwegian Foreign Ministry, presided over the meeting. He said:  Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit has helped Norwegian enterprises  understand China's economic development, and his visit is  conducive to promoting the development of reciprocal and  cooperative relations between Norway and China. He expressed  his hope that Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit will further promote  the development of bilateral economic and trade relations based  on the existing foundation. Entrepreneurs from Norway's  industrial and commercial circles introduced the strong points  of their enterprises and the development of cooperation with  Chinese enterprises. They offered suggestions as well.</p>

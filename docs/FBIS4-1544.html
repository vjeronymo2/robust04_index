			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial </F> CPC Committee: "Attach a High Degree of Importance to the Issue  of the Party's Ruling Position Under the Conditions of a Market  Economy"]    [Text] Initially establishing a new economic system by the  end of the century is a great historical mission for the whole  party and people of all nationalities across the country. The  key to whether or not we can undertake this important historical  mission and successfully create a socialist market economic  system never before seen in the history of mankind lies in our  party and in upholding and improving its leadership. Historical  experiences have shown that upholding the party's leadership and  consolidating its position at the helm of the state are the most  important political guarantees for reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization. Meanwhile, historical experiences have  also shown that it is not very easy for us to unswervingly and  consistently uphold this political principle. Under the new  situation of establishing a socialist market economic system,  some comrades may have a confused idea about the party's ruling  position and their consciousness of being at the helm of the  state may be attenuated. As a result, a tendency to undermine  the party's leadership may appear. This warrants our attention.  As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in an important speech he  delivered at the beginning of 1992: "If we do not watch out for  signs when they begin to crop up, things will go wrong."  Especially during the crucial period when our reform, which  revolves around the establishment of a new system, enters a  phase of tackling major, difficult tasks, it is all the more  necessary for us to attach a high degree of importance to the  issue of the party's ruling position; successfully achieve  ideological and organizational improvement of the party;  successfully improve its work style; and strengthen and improve  leadership over reform, opening up, and economic work.  <H5>  In the process of Establishing and Improving a Socialist </H5> Market Economic System, We Must Always Prevent a Tendency To  Ignore the Party's Leadership    Our party proposed establishing a socialist market economic  system to enable the market to play a basic role in the  allocation of resources under macroeconomic regulation and  control by a socialist country. It is integrated with the basic  socialist system. Upholding the party's leadership is, of  course, one of the points that should be implied by the  proposal. The establishment and improvement of a socialist  market economic system will surely further liberate and develop  social productive forces, further consolidate our party's ruling  position, and further consolidate the material base for a  socialist system. Therefore, the kind of confused idea that the  party's leadership role under a market economy is unimportant  should not occur in the first place. However, a small number of  comrades do have a misunderstanding of the issue. Some people  say: "Since we are establishing a market economy, anyone can  become part of the leadership. Why do we still have to stress  leadership by the Communist Party?" Why does such an erroneous  concept appear? I think the reasons are found mainly in the  following two aspects:    The first is misconceptions. Because of their failure to  gain a genuine understanding of the essence and meaning of the  socialist market economy, as well as the role and significance  of the party's ruling status, some comrades cannot truly  understand the compatibility between the socialist market  economy and maintenance of the party's ruling status, and have  inevitably acquired some misconceptions.    1) The shift by the party and government from direct to  indirect economic management in a market economy could lead some  people to think the party's functions in leading the economy  will be weakened. An important feature of the market economy is  the independence of various economic entities. This has created  a wrong impression among some people, who are led to believe  that a market economy is equivalent to a decentralized and  laissez-faire economy not subject to leadership and  interference. Therefore, they deem it unnecessary to stress the  party's leadership over economic construction. Specifically, we  need to spend some time exploring the means by which the party  exercises correct and effective leadership over economic work at  a time when we have just taken a step forward toward building a  socialist market economy. We are not very experienced in this  respect, and this could generate a feeling among some comrades  that the party's functions in leading the economy will be  weakened.    (2) The pursuit of material benefits in a market economy  will  become the primary motive force driving various market  competitors to participate in economic activities. This could  generate a feeling among some people that the party's  ideological leadership will diminish. Some people are of the  opinion that the market economy encourages the practice of  making a profit in the market, the pursuit of maximum profits,  and the use of money to arouse people's initiative. Therefore,  they think the party's greatest asset -- ideological and  political work -- need not be put to use any more and that it  will no longer play much of a role. The party's previously  effective measures, such as those used to mobilize, guide,  educate, and restrain its members through ideological means,  will no longer be useful. The current tendency of some  localities toward neglecting ideological and political work, as  well as socialist spiritual civilization, has a great deal to do  with this misconception.    3) Various economic entities will become independent  corporate bodies in a market economy. This could lead people to  think that primary party organizations, especially party  organizations in enterprises, will weaken their functions as  political cores. Some comrades are of the opinion that the  pursuit of a market economy entitles various market competitors,  especially state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises,  and including state-owned large and medium enterprises, to make  decisions about their cadres, to hire professionals, and to  select the workers they need in the labor market. Under such  circumstances, party organizations will not be able to play  their role as leadership cores, and they will have to gradually  diminish or even abandon such a role. Some people have  proposed: "It is no longer appropriate to discuss the role of  party organizations in enterprises as political cores at a time  when a socialist market economy is being developed." These  misconceptions are precisely the major ideological causes  leading some comrades to neglect the party's leading role.    Next is international influence. Western politicians and  theorists repeatedly publicize the consistency of having a  market economy, private ownership, and multi-party system, and  the inconsistency of a market economy, socialist public  ownership, and communist party holding office. Some of our  comrades have been influenced by these erroneous media opinions  and by the fact the former Soviet Union and some East European  nations have been practicing the multi-party system during the  course of promoting the market economy since they disintegrated  and underwent evolution. In particular, bourgeois liberalists  and those deeply influenced by them, uphold even more Western  capitalist theories and the experience of "drastic changes" in  some former socialist countries. They absurdly believe the  market economy is inevitably linked to private ownership and the  capitalist system, and that a long coexistence between plural  economic sectors and the one-party-rule political system is  impossible. So, they hope the communist party's ruling status  will end someday. Some of our comrades have also been more or  less influenced by some hostile forces abroad and stubborn  bourgeois liberalists at home who distort China's socialist  market economic structure.    The above analysis shows us two things: First, fundamentally  speaking, in the new situation in which we are developing a  socialist market economy, our party has favorable conditions for  constantly consolidating and strengthening its ruling status;  however, its ruling status is also facing some new circumstances  and new challenges created by an existing erroneous tendency of  overlooking party leadership. If we fail to pay attention to  the tendency and adopt effective measures to deal with it, our  party's leadership over political, economic, ideological, and  organizational affairs will likely be weakened. Second, a great  deal of arduous and meticulous work indeed remains to be done to  truly prevent and overcome the erroneous tendency of overlooking  the party's leadership under market economy conditions. It  needs a theoretical explanation. We should clearly explain to  people the accurate definition of a socialist market economy,  eliminate their misunderstandings caused by the distortion of  the socialist market economy, and make them understand the  consistency between developing a market economy and upholding  party leadership. It needs practical deeds even more. We  should discover the best and most effective way for the party to  hold office and to exercise correct leadership over political,  economic, ideological, and organizational affairs. It is for  this reason that we should, during the entire course of  establishing and perfecting a socialist market economic  structure, always keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  words: "Without leadership by the party a big country like  China would be torn apart by strife, and incapable of  accomplishing anything. Whether inside or outside the party,  all tendencies towards weakening, breaking away from, opposing  or liquidating leadership by the party must be criticized. The  individuals involved should be educated or, if necessary,  struggles should be waged against them." (Volume 2 of  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 317) This is a  key to accelerating the establishment of the new structure.  <H5>  To Establish a Socialist Market Economic Structure Is To </H5> Enhance the Role of the Party Leadership, Not To Weaken It    Understanding the party's role of holding office under the  conditions of socialist market economy is in fact a question of  understanding the role of party leadership under the conditions  of a market economy. To develop a socialist market economic  structure is not to weaken party leadership. On the contrary,  it has set new tasks and new demands on party leadership, and it  requires us to take a further step to strengthen and improve it.    Then, what kinds of new tasks and demands does promotion of  the socialist market economy pose on the party's leadership? I  think there are at least the following tasks and demands:    First, developing the socialist market economy is a brand  new  subject; more than ever before, this work needs the party's  scientific guidance, theoretically and in principle and policy.  Experience shows the planned economy itself cannot effectively  advance the development of productive forces, and we must  develop a socialist market economy. But we really do not have a  solution ready as to how to develop a socialist market economy.  As Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we have never encountered most of  the problems cropping up in the process of developing a  socialist market economic system. Although we may make use of  some practices of the capitalist market economy outside the  country, what we are developing, after all, is a socialist  market economy. And, over the past decades, people have had  very little knowledge of the market economy. All this greatly  demands that we provide theoretical and scientific guidance --  that the party establish relevant principles and policy  conforming to market economic reality to guide people's  practice. History since the founding of the People's Republic  shows that only the CPC can provide theoretical and scientific  guidance concerning the line, principle, and policy for  developing a socialist market economy. This is because our  party is armed with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. Our party has adhered to the  ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from  facts, accumulated rich experience in economic construction over  the last few decades, and cultivated a large number of backbone  economic construction cadres. The most important thing is that  the market economy we want to develop is one that will be  integrated with the basic socialist system -- it follows the  general laws of a market economy and demonstrates the  characteristics of the essence of socialism. In this sense,  promotion of the development of a socialist market economy is  absolutely inseparable from the CPC's leadership. The facts  also prove this -- it is the CPC itself which has realized the  ills of the old economic system and established the basic theory  and policy of a socialist market economy. Since the party has  established the development of a socialist market economic  system as the objective of reform of the economic system, it is  completely able to establish a correct principle and policy to  guide the practice of this task.    Second, since the socialist market economy will pluralize  and decentralize interests, it has become increasingly necessary  for the party to coordinate the handling of all types of  contradictions so the overall interests of the state can be  safeguarded. One important feature of the socialist market  economy lies in the pluralization and decentralization of  interests, and this feature will inevitably give rise to more  contradictions, conflicts, and friction in all sorts of economic  contacts. This certainly will be the case, especially during  the initial period following the establishment of the socialist  market economic system when market-related laws and regulations  are inadequate. Not only will there be vertical contradictions  between the state, collectives, and individuals; there will also  be lateral contradictions between markets and between regions.  While certain contradictions can be settled through  administrative or economic laws, some cannot be resolved without  the party's intervention. In particular, major issues involving  the long-range and fundamental interests of people in the  country, and major projects which yield conspicuous social  results but inconspicuous economic results, they can hardly be  resolved by counting merely on administrative and economic  measures. The formulation and implementation of these measures  must be accomplished through those who will firmly enforce them.  Representing the fundamental interests of people of all  nationalities in the country, the party has a uniform program  and discipline, it can stay aloof of the economic interests of  various principal market components, and can coordinate and  settle various contradictions with the objective of safeguarding  the overall interests of the state as well as the fundamental  and long-range interests of the people. If the party's leading  role weakens, the situation will become one in which the main  market components will scramble for benefits and the state's  overall interests will suffer losses. This can very well be  explained by the heavy cost which the former Soviet Union paid  in pushing the so-called transition toward a market economy.  The transition not only gave rise to social unrests within its  republics, but it also gave rise to friction and conflict among  the republics, and eventually led to the disintegration of the  state. In China, local authorities and enterprises have had  fairly substantial autonomy since the adoption of the reform and  opening up policy, and in spite of the appearance of  interest-related differences and contradictions during the  course of economic development, on the whole these differences  and contradictions can be gradually dealt with, thanks to the  CPC's ideological, organizational, and political guarantee.  Besides, the existence of departmentalism, decentralism, and  small-group mentality in some places also dictates that the  party must have stronger leadership. We should say, therefore,  the party's leadership is essential for settling all kinds of  contradictions, friction, and conflicts emerging during the  course of economic development; and party leadership is an  important requirement for safeguarding national stability.    Third, the negative and corrupt phenomena generated from the  establishment of our socialist market economic system must be  effectively stopped and combated through exercising strong party  leadership. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: The  establishment of our socialist market economic system must go  through a difficult process of replacing the old system with a  new one. The loopholes and weak links caused by inadequate and  defective rules and mechanisms during this process also provides  opportunities for corrupt phenomena to generate. This is a very  practical observation. While we cannot assert the market  economy will certainly generate corruption, we dare say the  possibilities for corrupt phenomena to generate have noticeably  increased owing to the above-mentioned objective causes as well  as the limitations of the market economy itself. While these  negative and corrupt phenomena can be stopped and corrected  through administrative and legal measures, these measures also  have their limitations: They can crack down on misconduct, but  they cannot eliminate the thought which gives rise to the  misconduct; they can correct what has gone wrong, but they  cannot prevent what may go wrong; they can correct corruption  which violates discipline and the law, they cannot eliminate the  negative phenomenon characterized by "continuous minor mistakes  even if the commission of major mistakes has been avoided."  Ample facts show that even countries with the best and most  comprehensive legal systems have not yet been able to uproot  corruption. One important point is that the CPC considers it as  its objective to eliminate exploitation and corruption and  uproot bipolerization. This class attribute dictates the CPC  must commit itself to waging protracted, unremitting struggles  against all sorts of corruption. The party can effectively  educate and closely supervise its members and the entire society  through all kinds of disciplinary rules and regulations, and it  can also select the most outstanding elements to execute  discipline and law and wage organized struggles. These roles  that it plays cannot be substituted by any other organization.    Fourth, while the establishment of a socialist market  economic system needs all sorts of conditions, it needs the  party even more to create these conditions. Take mental  conditions, for instance. We need a powerful media to propagate  knowledge about the market economy, to change people's mind  sets, clear up people's misunderstandings about the market  economy, and sum up and propagate all experiences of success.  In terms of organizational conditions, we need the party to  train and select economic experts, managers, and specialists in  various fields; form united and pragmatic leading groups with  members who perform their duties honestly; and give full scope  to the roles played by democratic parties and mass organizations  so people in all quarters will actively throw themselves into  the great cause of building our market economy. In terms of  political conditions, we need the party to foster people's  democracy and exercise dictatorship over enemies, as well as to  ensure a peaceful international environment so the state can  enjoy political stability. We cannot possibly materialize these  "needs" through counting on economic organizations alone. Only  the organizationally strong CPC armed with the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics can rally the  forces in all social quarters at home to victoriously expedite  the process of building our socialist market economy.    We can see from what has been discussed above that the party  must strengthen its leadership as well as its status of being  the ruling party, instead of a weakening and wavering of its  ruling status during the course of building our socialist market  economic system.  <H5>  The Party Must Constantly Improve Its Leadership Style To </H5> Keep Pace With Requirements in the Development of the Socialist  Market Economy    The fact the party's ruling status remains unchanged after a  socialist market economic system has been established does not  mean it must not change its leadership style. After all, the  replacement of the traditional planned economy by a socialist  market economy is a change with far-reaching significance and  tremendous impact. This being the case, the party can no longer  apply the conventional methods it used to in leading planned  economic affairs, and it must seek new leadership styles and  methods compatible with the development of the socialist market  economy.    The key to improving party leadership and making it  compatible with the needs of our socialist market economy lies  in settling the issue about what the party ought and ought not  to take charge of so that it can do a good job in taking charge  of what it should and will certainly not involve itself in  things which are not its business. It must also make sure that  this principle will remain absolutely unchanged no matter what  new situations, new contradictions, or new problems may arise.  In accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines laid  down by the 14th National Party Congress, the party's basic  leading roles should be primarily political, ideological, and  organizational.    The party's political leadership rests with its leadership  over political principles, political orientation, and major  policy decisions. This is to say that, on the basis of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  objectives and missions set for building a socialist market  economic system, and China's actual situation, the party should  formulate practical lines and general and specific policies  which represent the interests of the overwhelming majority of  people; and, during different periods of development, come up  with correct policy decisions in connection with major domestic  and world issues to make sure the state will develop along a  socialist course with Chinese characteristics.    The party's ideological leadership means it will persist in  educating and arming the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong  Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics; and, through the party's  propaganda, mobilization, and ideological and political work,  help party members, cadres, and the people understand and grasp  the party's basic line and the theory of a socialist market  economy, and become familiar with the party's general and  specific policies so that the will of the party will become  their voluntary actions.    In exercising organizational leadership, the party's main  job  is to recommend economically proficient cadres, who can also  effectively uphold the party's basic theory and basic lines and  follow through with the party's intentions [yi tu 1942 0956], to  work at state organs, departments making overall economic  planning, departments in charge of economic affairs, and large  enterprise groups to take charge of major offices; and, through  the organization and mobilization launched by party  organizations, party cadres, and the broad masses of communist  party members at various levels, guide the people to materialize  all the party's propositions and accomplish all its missions.    Given the aforementioned basic functions of the party's  leadership, in perceiving and handling the relationship between  the party and government, we should change the party's past  leading style in which it directly managed specific economic  work matters. Instead, from the viewpoint of the overall  situation, we should focus on providing leadership in strategic  theory, lines, principles, and policies concerning economic  work. In addition, we should turn the party's ideas into the  state's will through a legal process, and, through party  organizations' activities and members' exemplary vanguard role,  motivate the broad masses to materialize this will. In  perceiving and handling the relationship between the party and  enterprises and institutions, we should change the past practice  in which party organizations did all administrative work and  commanded production operations. Instead, we should use our  energy primarily to ensure and supervise the implementation of  all party and state guidelines and policies on doing good  ideological and political work among cadres and workers; and on  strengthening leadership over trade unions, organizations of  Communist Youth League, and other mass organizations. Specific  matters concerning production work and business operations  should be independently and effectively carried out by factory  directors, managers, or production and administration organs.    Evidently, clearly defining the basic functions of the  party's leadership is the precondition for improving its leading  style. With this understanding, it will not be difficult to find  the principle and way that should be followed in improving the  party's leading style; we will be able to eliminate the  uncertainty and confusion in handling the relationship between  the party and government. Party organizations must truly have a  good grip of the three aforementioned basic functions and  endeavor to carry them out. They must not become tied up with  specific economic matters and must not weaken the three basic  functions; nor should they use reform as a pretext to  incorporate the three basic functions, which pertain to party  organizations, into administration departments. We should  prevent the two aforementioned situations from happening in  practical work. Currently, we should particularly guard against  the tendency of using the need to accommodate the new market  economic situation to make the party's leadership in enterprises  a part of enterprises' administrative work. If party  organizations of enterprises are incorporated into enterprises'  administration departments, how can they play their political,  ideological, and organizational leading role? I think internal  organs of party organizations of industrial and mining  enterprises may be set up according to the category an  enterprise is in. Some internal organs of medium and small  enterprises may be merged and their personnel reduced, but the  party's organization departments must not be incorporated into  administration and personnel departments. Organization  departments of party committees should not only be responsible  for supervising cadres, but, more importantly, they should  properly manage party organizations and party members.  Propaganda departments of party committees should publicize  Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, use Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to arm party members and workers, and conduct  ideological and political work. It will be difficult to  accomplish the party's tasks if organization and propaganda  departments of party committees are abrogated and only a party's  general office is in operation. It is even necessary to  establish a united front work department in some large  enterprises; of course the personnel should be kept to a minimum.    Currently, China is in the process of developing a socialist  market economic system; therefore, a leading style in line with  market economic development remains to be gradually developed  and summed up in practice. We believe that, with the common  efforts of comrades of the whole party, the party's new leading  style will be refined day by day.</p>

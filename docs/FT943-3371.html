			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CrestaCare healthy at Pounds 2.5m CrestaCare, the UK's third largest nursing home operator, turned round losses of Pounds 1.39m to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m for the six months to June 30. The group has been re-focused on the core healthcare business by a new management team over the past 18 months. It reported a modest rise in total turnover from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 15.7m; turnover from property and other activities fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 227,000. Turnover in the long term healthcare operations rose 50 per cent from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 15.5m and operating profits from these activities increased from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 3.43m. At the operating level a Pounds 157,000 loss was turned into a Pounds 3.43m profit in the latest period, partly reflecting the absence of property losses and exceptional costs. Finance costs fell to Pounds 961,000 from Pounds 1.23m. CrestaCare's Pounds 12.5m acquisition of the Scottish nursing home group ScotCare in July helped to increase the number of beds in operation by 32 per cent to more than 2,800. A further 90 bed facility is under development in Scotland, to be completed by the end of this year. Mr Andrew Taee, chief executive, said the Scottish acquisition was the beginning of a slow growth outside the company's traditional bases in the North of England, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. 'Our future growth will be focused upon strengthening our business within our existing regions, now including Scotland, and the gradual expansion into new geographic regions, particularly the South of England,' he said. He added that the company's future strategy would concentrate on specialist care, such as brain injury and stroke injury, which command higher weekly fees. Weekly fee rates rose to an average of Pounds 297, compared to Pounds 295 last year. Average bed occupancy for the first half of the year was 93.3 per cent. There were earnings per share of 1.1p, after losses of 2p last year. The interim dividend was lifted from 0.25p to 0.26p. Gearing stood at 22 per cent, including Pounds 21.2m of fixed rate debt paying 9.46 per cent.</p>

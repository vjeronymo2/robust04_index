			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Paints As-Supplied by the Manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Agency began its program to reduce emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of volatile organics in the late 1970's, the coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry has made significant progress in research of new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products with increased solids: organic solvent ratios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These liquid paints are of two primary types: waterborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and higher solids. Although many new waterborne products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been developed, manufacturers of marine coatings have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced solvent primarily by increasing the solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (nonvolatile) content of their products. Use of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrated or ``higher solids'' coatings reduce solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions per surface area painted (at same film thickness).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because most hazardous air pollutants are also volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organics, the VOC program has tended to also reduce HAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In addition, some coating manufacturers have reportedly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been able to reduce the HAP content of certain paints by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely substituting a solvent not on the HAP list yielding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints that contain little or no HAP solvents. A coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated in this manner may have the same or even higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC content than the one it replaces. In some cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP to VOC ratio may even increase when a company develops a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new reformulation with lower VOC. (Note, the absolute HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are likely to go down.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Paints As-Applied by the Shipyard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several alternatives a shipyard may follow to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize HAP emissions from as-applied paints. One is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid diluting the paint and apply it as-supplied. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to only use thinners that contain little or no HAP. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third is to reduce paint viscosity by heating the paint to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid or minimize the need for thinning. (Paint heaters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating elements placed in the paint delivery line upstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the spray gun. Depending on the length of the delivery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> line, the coating characteristics, and ambient temperature,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple paint heaters may be required at intervals along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the line. These decrease the ease of portability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility of the application system.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  ``Add-on'' pollution control systems are often used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control emissions from spray booths when coatings are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied in factory operations. Such systems are not now a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical alternative for many shipyard operations because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the size of ship components is too large to enable capturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the emissions with an enclosure. (There is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under development a mobile enclosure that, if successful,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will offer shipyards a method of capturing both particulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and volatile organics. Metro Machine shipyard in Norfolk,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia has developed a prototype portable enclosure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mounts adjacent to the ship and supports an omni-directional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elevator platform used by the operator to abrasive blast and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paint ship's hulls. The method shows promise of containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate and volatile organics of concentrations great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to make recovery available at reasonable cost. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also provides weather protection thereby allowing work to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued in inclement weather. Final evaluation will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely be completed in 1996.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

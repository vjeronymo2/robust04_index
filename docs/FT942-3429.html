			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / China harbours doubts on HK land measures China has expressed doubt over the measures announced last week to cool Hong Kong's overheated property market. Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, told a delegation of Hong Kong businessmen visiting Beijing that China is concerned that the greater effect of the measures will take place after 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to China, rather than before. Last week, the Hong Kong government announced measures, including a proposed increase in the supply of land and a reduction in the pre-sale of flats. Analysts and leading house-builders such as Mr Li Ka-shing said they thought the measures would help restrain the growth in house prices. The increase in land supply (70 hectares more than planned) was seen as having the biggest effect in the medium term, and analysts expect it to have a downwards effect on prices. It is, however, the one major measure which also needs China's assent as Beijing has a role in the allocation of land in Hong Kong. Mr Lu was quoted as saying Beijing did not want to see big fluctuations in land and property prices after 1997. 'We hope to see stability. The overheated property market definitely has to be cooled, but it has to be cooled gradually,' he said. His comments may reflect concern in Beijing about the possibility of presiding over a slump in house prices just as China resumes sovereignty. In voicing them, Mr Lu kept China's options open. He said the issue ought to be discussed in the Sino-British land commission, the body which will have to approve an increased allocation in land. House prices have fallen significantly since the government said in March it would intervene in the market. Investors believed last week's measures would depress prices further and accordingly marked down property shares.</p>

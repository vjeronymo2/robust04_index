			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO SEEKS RAIDER GUARANTEES  </P> <P> City officials said they don't want to pay the Los Angeles Raiders $50 million  to move to California's capital until a group of private investors provides $37  million in guarantees that the city won't lose money on the football deal.  </P> <P> Sacramento Mayor Anne Rudin said Thursday she wants the investors to advance  the first $30 million of the $50 million relocation fee offered to the Raiders.  The city would not repay the money until a football stadium is built and the  first game is played.  </P> <P> Rudin and other Sacramento officials also want the investment group to issue  the city a $7-million letter of credit that the city can tap if it fails to  earn enough money from the football deal to make debt payments on a proposed  bond issue to raise the $50-million fee.  </P> <P> "It would be a way to guarantee that unless the stadium is built and the first  game played, we are not out any money," Sacramento Treasurer Thomas Friery  said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, meanwhile, the president of the Coliseum Commission said today  that Raiders owner Al Davis is strongly interested in keeping the football team  where it is.  </P> <P> "We have had several indications recently that Davis wants to stay here," said  Richard Riordan, president of the commission that has been battling Davis on  several fronts over renovating the stadium.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagorno-Karabakh is prepared for a cease fire from  00:01 hours of April 29, 1994, says a letter sent on April 28 by  Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady Gukasyan and the commander of  the Karabakh Army, Samvel Babayan, to Russian Defense and  Foreign Ministers, Pavel Grachev and Andrey Kozyrev, as well as  to Russian presidential envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov.    Thus, Nagorno-Karabakh accepted the proposal put forward on  April 26 by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on the  cease-fire in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. The proposal  was backed by Azerbaijan on the same day. The Minister proposed  to declare a truce from 00:00 hours of April 28. However,  Stepanakert was unable to give an official answer before  Thursday.    The letter says that Nagorno Karabakh is prepared to observe  a cease fire based on the protocol signed following the results  of the meeting in Moscow on February 18 by defense ministers of  Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Pavel Grachev, Sarzh Sargsyan  and Mamadrafi Mammadov. The document provides for a cease-fire  in Nagorno-Karabakh, the withdrawal of the conflicting sides and  talks on the Karabakh status.    The letter by the Karabakh leaders says that because of the  absence of observers, the mutual distrust of the conflicting  sides, and in an attempt to exclude possible attempts to use a  temporary lull to prepare for another large-scale offensive, and  to help make the peace process irreversible, the leaders of  Nagorno-Karabakh believe it necessary to make use of the  mechanism of the above protocol.    The implementation of the entire complex of  military-technical measures, says the document, may guarantee a  lasting cease-fire and create favorable conditions for solving  political problems.    The letter says that leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh are  prepared  to order a cease-fire after the mediator (Russia) confirms the  reception of an identical document from the conflicting side.    Interfax was informed about the letter of the Karabakh  leadership by an aide to the Armenian president, Levon  Ter-Petrosyan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo 7 April, TASS-KAZTAG -- Japan and Kazakhstan  are ready to pool efforts to implement Alma-Ata's initiative and  convene a conference on interaction and confidence-building in  Asia similar to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Japan's  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said during their talks in  Tokyo on Thursday.    Their meeting was held in the official residence of the head  of the Japanese Government. It covered a wide array of  political and economic items. As concerns the situation in  Central Asia, Kazakhstan's president noted that Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have to pursue a tough domestic  policy in order to avert the spread of conflicts similar to that  in Tajikistan throughout the region. As regards the domestic  situation in Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev described it as politically  stable.    Nazarbayev called for expanding the scale of economic  integration in Asia as a whole and asked Tokyo to come forth  with an initiative for the organisation of a common continental  market. He stressed his country's readiness to serve as a base  for Tokyo's penetration to Central Asian markets.    The president said that he is ready to give Japan preference  in realizing major economic projects on the territory of his  republic. For this purpose he suggested that Morihiro Hosokawa  and himself set up a joint commission to prepare this important  move.    The Japanese prime minister assured Alma-Ata of his  invariable support for the transformations underway in  Kazakhstan and said the projects named by Kazakhstan in the  field of economic cooperation require a detailed study by  Japan's leadership.</p>

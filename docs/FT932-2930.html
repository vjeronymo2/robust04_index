			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (1): Opportunities galore - The UK telecoms sector, already Europe's most competitive, is about to engage in a further bout of price-cutting and aggressive marketing In assessing their telecoms needs and outgoings, never has it been harder for companies to keep track of costs, competition and the potentiality of new technology. UK companies have a tougher job than most. Britain's telecoms sector, already at the head of Europe's competition league, is about to engage in a further bout of price-cutting and aggressive marketing as new entrants establish themselves and established telecoms companies - not just the giant BT, but Mercury and the two mobile operators Cellnet and Vodafone - fight to keep their volumes and profits. In telecoms, sorting the wood from the trees is made extraordinarily difficult by the thick haze of acronyms and jargon obscuring the route at every turn. It is not just new technology: as competition intensifies, so does the complexity of tariff structures and the range of options and services on the market. For the finance director of a small or medium-sized company, who has to do the phones, the balance sheet and the contract cleaning, bewilderment is increasingly common. Fortunately, a few rules of thumb will go a long way. First, virtually all agree that prices have further to fall - in both the fixed-line and mobile markets. Because much of the pressure for price reductions in the US and UK is likely to come from new entrants, look carefully at anything they have to offer - once you have checked the respectability of their operating credentials. One simple test is: did their directors previously work for one of the big telecoms companies? Second rule of thumb: don't think you need to stick with just one or two suppliers. For most business users, least-cost routeing software or 'smart boxes' can take the pain out of call-by-call and day-to-day decisions on users. In the mobile market, very favourable deals on offer from new entrants with restricted networks - such as, in the London region, those of Hutchison Telecom and Mercury One-2-One - could make it worthwhile for companies to patronise more than one company, or even to give employees two portable handsets. The majority of PABX systems sold today either come with or are compatible with least-cost routeing software. For those without it, but with compatible systems, installation typically costs about Pounds 300. 'Smart' equipment is more expensive and less reliable, but reliability is improving and for most users the cost works out at about Pounds 100 a line. In the fixed-line business, the best prices are often those from new entrants re-selling leased lines and connecting them to private networks. A telling case study is the rise of Worldcom, a London-based company plying the international re-sale trade for the 18 past months. It now has more than 100 customers and expects to have 'a few thousand' by next year. Its rates are highly competitive with BT and Mercury, particularly for transatlantic traffic - and according to the Telecommunications Users' Association, there have been virtually no complaints about reliability. Worldcom is about to lease lines to Manchester, Birmingham, Heathrow and Glasgow, making it economic for non-City of London companies to link up with the operator. It also has a public network operators' licence pending; if it secures one, it will be able to route calls over BT's network, giving it a strong appeal even to smaller companies. At the other end of the fixed-line market, the cable TV companies - many of them with US parents anxious to learn the TV trade from which they are barred at home - are fast establishing local telephone networks which could soon challenge BT in conurbations. The cable TV franchise operators currently have only 160,000 telephone subscribers, and some made a shaky start. They also suffer from the absence of number portability - an issue before Oftel, the industry regulator - which makes it hazardous for companies to sever all connection with BT. But the cable companies are still in the early stages of construction: once they have reached the 15m in their franchise areas, BT's virtual monopoly of the local network will be under serious threat. In the US, MCI, the second-largest operator, now has about 18 per cent of long-distance traffic. In the UK, BT has ceded nearly 10 per cent of the market - and half or more of all outgoing traffic from the City of London - to Mercury. Another two UK national networks are under construction. Ionica, a private Cambridge-based company, is building a radio-based network for launch in early 1995. Energis, a subsidiary of National Grid, is wrapping fibre-optic around its pylons and is promising a price war with BT and Mercury as early as next spring, with a network connecting 17 of Britain's leading towns and cities. Energis will have to inter-connect with BT to convey its calls the 'last leg' but the cable companies offer the medium-term prospect of avoiding BT even in much of the local loop. It is the same story in the UK mobile market, where the huge margins of Vodafone and Cellnet are coming under sustained assault. Hutchison's Rabbit 'telepoint' service may lack the flexibility of Vodafone and Cellnet but at 20p a peak-rate minute inside the M25 its tariffs are less than two-thirds their standard rates. Mercury One-2-One is currently testing its PCN mobile service; it plans to launch it within the M25 this summer with a peak rate as low as 16p a minute and an access charge for high-volume users of about Pounds 20 - although One-2-One handsets will cost slightly more than the cheapest on offer from Cellnet and Vodafone. With One-2-One's PCN network due to cover 24 per cent of the population by April 1994, Vodafone and Cellnet can ill afford to sit by for long without cutting their tariffs. So the fire alarm mentality of existing mobile users ('break seal to use') could soon be a thing of the past. For most companies, getting the best price for existing services is a more pressing priority than high-flown debates about the virtues of national optical-fibre networks. Yet so rapid is the speed of change that to plan even for the next two or three years companies must be familiar with the main telecoms trends. Among those covered in the survey, two stand out: the development of 'outsourcing' and the growth in value-added services. At its most basic, outsourcing is the contracting out of part or all of a company's telecoms network-facilities management to a telecoms carrier. It is of particular appeal to companies anxious to modernise existing private networks, and to multinationals looking for 'one-stop-shop' arrangements to cater for their worldwide telecommunications needs. Learning from US experience, in the UK both BT and Mercury are bidding for domestic outsourcing contracts via facilities management units. BT is also seeking to carve out a role for itself in the global outsourcing market through a new Dollars 1bn joint venture with MCI launched earlier this month, which will eventually subsume its Atlanta-based Syncordia subsidiary. Mainland European operators have been slower off the mark. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have joined to establish an outsourcing company of their own, Eunetcom, while the Swiss, Dutch and Swedish state telecoms recently set up a joint venture, Unisource, to provide data transmission services to European-based multinational companies, signing up Sprint, the US carrier, to provide global links outside Europe. Meanwhile, American Telephone and Telegraph last month launched its Worldsource service aiming to provide a 'seamless' global telecoms service through partnerships with national telecoms carriers region by region. It has already signed up five Asia-Pacific carriers and is roaming Europe in search of partners for its launch in Europe next year. New services on offer range from plain paper fax machines able to send low-priority faxes overnight, to advanced electronic data exchange permitting users to exchange business documentation using standard electronic forms, broadband services such as video-conferencing, and virtual private networks which companies use to link switchboards on different sites, even in different countries, and far more besides. Remarkably, many of the once hidebound state telecoms utilities are leading the way in turning technology into new services. In the US and UK, their monopolies have been abolished; they are likely to be so soon in the rest of Europe. So they can no longer sit back, keep their networks ticking over and expect the profits to roll in regardless. For companies it offers opportunities galore.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 17 May (TANJUG) -- In his talks today with  David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the  conference on the former Yugoslavia, Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic said peace was in the interest of all people and all  nations in the Yugoslav area.    According to a statement issued by the Serbian president's  office, Milosevic stressed that Serbia wholeheartedly supports  the agreement on ending all hostilities in the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question of a political  solution and territorial demarcation should, according to  Milosevic, be discussed with representatives of the Serb people  from Bosnia, who are directly concerned, in exactly the same way  as are the Muslims and Croats in this former Yugoslav republic.    Since all elements of the agreement on an overall end to  hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed with  UN and UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] delegations in Belgrade  on 22 April, Milosevic believes that all obstacles and problems  in reaching [as received] an agreement on ending the hostilities  can only have been caused by the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army. He believes that the international community is again  facing a challenge -- either to behave in an impartial way or to  apply a policy of double standards to the parties in the  conflict.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic attended the  talks.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Howard accepts police proposals PROPOSALS to reduce police paperwork could release the equivalent of 2,300 officers for more active duties, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said yesterday. Mr Howard has accepted all 16 recommendations in a report on cutting police administrative burdens prepared for the Home Office by PA Consulting Group. Police service representatives welcomed Mr Howard's decision, but said substantial additional funds would be needed to implement the proposals. The report claims police paperwork after an arrest could be halved. It calls for action in three areas: better liaison between police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service; improved information technology; and better management of paperwork. Mr Howard said the recommendations were in keeping with the government's proposals in its recent police white paper to introduce a more management-based approach to policing. Nothing in them would detract from suspects' rights. Introducing the report's recommendations throughout England and Wales could cost about Pounds 40m. The consultants concluded that the most significant factor in reducing paperwork would be a rise in information technology support. Mr John Hoddinott, chief constable of Hampshire and chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers' crime committee, welcomed Mr Howard's endorsement of the report. But he said police information technology budgets were small and forces would be unable to finance the proposed changes from their resources alone. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, yesterday called for an urgent inquiry into a sharp fall in the number of criminal cases dealt with by crown courts in the past year. In the year to last August, 88,725 cases were dealt with by the crown court, a 15 per cent drop on the figure for the year to August 1992 of 103,702.</p>

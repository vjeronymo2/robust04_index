			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The reactions of South  Korea's ruling and opposition political parties to Jimmy  Carter's planned visit to North Korea are contrasting.    The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) and its former  chairman Kim Tae-chung welcomed the visit by the former U.S.  President, noting that it was first proposed by former party  leader Kim Tae- chung himself.    The DP said it hoped that Carter could help find a  breakthrough in the nuclear deadlock.    The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), however, sounded  a  note of caution, saying the visit could throw the issue into  confusion as the United States and its allies are working to  impose U.N. economic sanctions on North Korea.    When the news of Carter's planned trip reached Seoul, Kim  Tae- chung was said to have expressed "unreserved welcome."    "It really is good," Kim Tae-chung was quoted by his aides  as  having said. "Let's hope that the North Korean nuclear issue  could be resolved through this occasion."    The Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia and Pacific  Region said it hoped that Carter's trip would provide an  opportunity to resolve the mounting tension on the Korean  peninsula over the nuclear row.    The visit will help to maintain nuclear transparency and  normalize relations between the United States and North Korea in  a package deal, the foundation said.    Noting that U.N. inspection of a key radiochemical  laboratory at Yongbyon was realized following a visit to  Pyongyang by American evangelist Billy Graham, the foundation  said it hoped for progress in negotiations on settling the  nuclear issue.    The ruling party said Carter's visit in effect means a  reopening of negotiations and expressed concern that it could  muddy the current situation as the international community makes  a concerted effort to secure nuclear transparency in North Korea.    In particular, the Carter visit could work unexpectedly  against the move in the U.N. Security Council to slap Pyongyang  with economic sanctions.    Some DLP officials privately said "it is laughable" for  members of the opposition party "to rejoice unreservedly,"  claiming Carter's visit proves "the excellent and far-sighted  opinion of Chairman Kim Tae-chung."    Rep. No Chae-pong said, "We all know that the Kim Tae-chung  side had been in contact with Carter in the past.    "What I don't understand is that they (Democratic Party) are  trying to use the national security problem as a domestic  political issue."    Another DLP lawmaker pointed out that Carter had planned to  withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea and had been laughed at  for his naivete. "Unless he discarded his fixed ideas of the  past, he could only be an obstacle to South Korea's efforts to  resolve inter- Korean questions through dialogue," he said.</p>

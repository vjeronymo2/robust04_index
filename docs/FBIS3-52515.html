The amendments, consisting of eight articles, are seen as the  Palestinian new and final draft agreement. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  has obtained the full details of the eight Palestinian  proposals. They are:    1. The al-Nabi Musa area near Jericho should be under  Palestinian control.    2. Entry to the Gaza-Jericho region should come under the  jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority along with the  maintenance of security, with acceptance of electronic  inspection.    3. The al-Maghtis area should be annexed to Jericho in  the transitional period and the Palestinian flag should be  hoisted there.    4. The Musa al-'Alami project should have Palestinian  identity and should come under Palestinian sovereignty.    5. The Jericho area should be linked to al-Qurunful  mountain.    6. There should be agreement and coordination regarding  the King 'Abdallah bridge.    7. There are no problems regarding the crossing bridges  with Egypt and there is coordination on that, but where joint  projects in the Dead Sea area are concerned, the Palestinians  should have the right of approval, and the same thing would  later apply with Jordan.    8. The international crossings (borders) should come  under international supervision. [passage omitted]</p>

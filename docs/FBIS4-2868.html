			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The first  construction phase of Shenzhen Yantian port was completed today.    As the only deep-water port in south China, the planned  facilities will consist of 50 berths, each of which has a  capacity to accommodate ships exceeding 10,000 tons.    Sources said that when the berths go into operation, the  annual handling capacity will reach eight million standard  containers.    The first-phase construction of Yantian port consisted of 58  projects, including a 24-kilometer highway from the port to  Pinghu Railway Station, a 72-kilometer highway from the port to  Huizhou city, six berths with an annual handling capacity of 2.8  million tons and a container yard with an area of 240,000 square  meters, and a 6.29-square-kilometer infrastructural base for  water- and electricity-supply and telecommunications services.    The port is designed to be computer-controlled and it now  has  hundreds of up-to-date port machines.    The second phase of the construction of the port will start  later this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 18 (ITAR-TASS)--The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI  newspaper carries several articles on taxation in the Russian  Federation under the general headline "All Suffer From Taxation  Press, However Treasury is Empty".    Referring to the opinion of experts from the Russian  Economics Ministry, the newspaper writes: "The government now  collects only 60-65 per cent of all taxes due for payment, which  is clearly below the average of other countries. We have to  achieve the receipt of up to 80 per cent of taxes to the state  budget".    In the opinion of specialists from the American Heritage  fund, income taxes from working people should be cut. Russian  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin believes that "to introduce  new taxes now means to aggravate conditions for economic  activities and to increase mistrust of tax legislation".    The TRUD newspaper writes that the recent visits by Fuel and  Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik and Public Education Minister  Yevgeniy Tkachenko to the Kuznetsk coal basin in Siberia  somewhat defused the explosive situation there.    At the same time, the newspaper notes that the question on a  strike by coal miners and other workers remains open in that  area. For instance, 60 per cent of workers employed by light  industry enterprises have nothing to do: warehouses are packed  with ready-made goods, while trading firms prefer to buy imports.    Every third builder went on a forced leave: customers have  no  money to pay for the work done. "Some 20,000 projects stand  partially built," the newspaper notes.    Appraising the work done by the cabinet of former Prime  Minister Yegor Gaydar, prominent economist Nikolay Shmelev  writes in the newspaper that "the reformers went too far". To  change the situation in the country, it is necessary "to start,  at long last, to conduct a stiff industrial policy", he claims.    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper writes on the same topic,  noting that "the long-term programme for production of weaponry  and the government financial support for the conversion of the  munitions industry" remain a headache for the government.    According to the newspaper, it is unprofitable up to this  time to fill government military orders: they are paid at  ridiculously low prices.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper claims that the explosive  social and economic situation in Russia can be explained, among  other things, by the fact that the government has no action  programme.    The PRAVDA newspaper notes that the situation in the Russian  economy is very difficult after two years of "shock therapy".  "It would be an empty talk to speak about stabilisation in the  country," the newspaper adds. According to PRAVDA, the course  of Russian reforms "needs immediate adjustments".    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper features an exclusive  interview  with Bundeswehr General Inspector Klaus Naumann who claims that  the armed forces of Russia and Germany can cooperate in future.  In his opinion, the two countries "play an important, if not  decisive, role" in creating a system of European security.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes about a spectre of  a  new cold war in connection with NATO's decision to use force if  Bosnian Serbs do not withdraw heavy weaponry from the Sarajevo  area.    "Russia, put before another difficult choice, tries to  remain  its own self," the newspaper writes. "The NATO ultimatum is  declared 'illegitimate' and at variance with U.N. decisions.    The newspaper notes that the recent illness "has not  weakened  the political will of the Russian President who warned that  'some people try to resolve the Bosnian question without Russia.  We shall not permit this'".    PRAVDA front-pages a report on fanning up anti-Russian  sentiments in Estonia. It points to a recent "resolute protest"  by the Estonian parliament against allegedly "rising imperialist  trends in Russia's foreign policy".</p>

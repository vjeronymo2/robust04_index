			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Names optimistic over debt moratorium LEADING Names said yesterday they were optimistic that Lloyd's, the insurance market, will extend the terms of a recent six-month debt moratorium. Earlier this month Lloyd's said that more than 3,000 Names, facing heavy insurance losses, would be give an extra six months to cope with 'temporary insolvency' but 172 Names who have already received writs demanding they pay their debts did not benefit from the measure. Action groups of Names, the individuals whose assets back underwriting, have been pressing Lloyd's to extend the moratorium and Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group said after meeting Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, he was 'strongly optimistic' that that would happen.</p>

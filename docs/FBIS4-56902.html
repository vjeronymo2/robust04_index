			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A special session -- outside the National  Assembly -- was held at the Haitian parliament to conclude the  seventh period of meetings of the 45th Legislature. A number of  senators and deputies officially announced, on 9 May through  Senator Bernard Sansaricq, that a new president of Haiti will be  sworn in, in Haiti, within the next few hours: Judge Emile  Jonassaint, the current president of the Court of Cassation.  According to the announcement made by Sen. Sansaricq in the  presence of a group of parliamentarians, Jonassaint will be  sworn in on 11 May.    Here is a report by Edner Jean on 9 May, the day that was to  mark the conclusion of the National Assembly, [pauses] the  conclusion, in national assembly, of the current parliamentary  session. In the last analysis, the National Assembly was unable  to convene.    [Begin recording] [Jean] [passage omitted] For his part, the  president of the Chamber of Deputies said it is not up to him to  rule in favor of one or the other of the two Senate Offices,  adding immediately thereafter that his office is willing to work  with whichever Senate Office can gather 14 senators.    At that time, Sen. Sansaricq had still been unable to find a  14th member, something that was virtually impossible to do.  Exchanges between senators and deputies became very heated. At  1830, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde held a  meeting behind closed doors, but the socialists stuck firmly to  their position and finally left the room.    Sen. Sansaricq's reaction came almost immediately: At 1900,  he was back at the Senate, this time accompanied by about 15  deputies, all members of the Alliance for Parliamentary  Cohesion, and he solemnly announced that Judge Emile Jonassaint  will be sworn in as the new president of the Republic on 11 May.    [Sansaricq] I have already spoken to President Emile  Jonassaint. The president has completely agreed to be sworn in  at noon on 11 May, here, before the Senate of the Republic.  [applause] I also want to announce that the Haitian Army is  going to snap its fingers at the [word indistinct] of the Senate  of the Republic. [applause] [passage omitted]    [Jean] [passage omitted] There was a surprise. Attracted,  perhaps, by the atmosphere of this crowd -- to repeat the words  of Senator Dupiton -- Monde joined the historic meeting. He went  to the rostrum and took a stand in favor of the meeting and the  measures being taken. He added, however, that a clear  distinction should be made between the Monde who is president of  the Chamber of Deputies and the Monde who is a deputy. Monde was  warmly applauded by his peers.    At 2000, there was a power outage and this group of senators  and deputies went home, singing the national anthem. This is  Edner Jean for Radio Metropole. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Parambe hit by lower art income Parambe, which deals in securities and works of art, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 68,642 to Pounds 40,238 in the first half of 1993. The result reflected a sharp fall in income from works of art, where Ashlar, the art dealing offshoot, was unable to replace profits earned in 1991 from the sales of old master drawings to an American museum. Current sales were still 'disappointingly slow.' Net asset value per share rose by 18 per cent to 71.6p in the period, mainly due to a 33 per cent rise in the value of the investment portfolio. Security dealing income grew from Pounds 4,140 to Pounds 47,240, while the art contribution fell to Pounds 18,263 (Pounds 107,627). Investment income was little changed at Pounds 41,289 (Pounds 40,852). Earnings per share declined to 0.49p (0.83p), but the interim dividend is unchanged at 0.55p.</p>

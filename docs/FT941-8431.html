			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Pinault-Printemps Being a minority shareholder in a French company can be a perilous business, as investors in Canal Plus will readily testify. But those in La Redoute, which is being bought out by Pinault-Printemps at a sub-market price, would appear to have even greater cause for complaint. Given that Pinault-Printemps already owns 54 per cent of La Redoute's shares and has the support of other interested parties, the deal appears as good as done. But Pinault-Printemps' scrip issue before the one-for-one share swap inflicts a further humiliation. The net effect is that La Redoute's shareholders will have to accept low quality Pinault-Printemps paper worth about FFr900 in return for their shares in a promising retailer with a market value of FFr960. The mysterious 13 per cent fall in La Redoute's shares over the past month - at a time when there was speculation that it would be sold - is a another story in itself, which the French stock exchange should perhaps seek to unravel. This episode is hardly the best advertisement for the French equity market at a time when the government is trumpeting the virtues of Paris as a financial centre. Mr Francois Pinault's abrupt treatment of minority shareholders at the time of the Au Printemps acquisition prompted an official review of French takeover rules. One hopes his latest deal will provoke a similar response.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Casualty faces a sad reckoning: Contract hopes dashed A CASUALTY among Britain's remaining naval shipyards was inevitable and it always seemed most likely it would be Swan Hunter. Two prospects promised to stave off that fate. One was the Ministry of Defence's decision, after much hesitation, to go ahead with ordering a purpose-built helicopter carrier. Swan saw itself as the natural candidate for the job and staked its future on it. Last night Mr Robin Ashby, PR consultant to Swan until yesterday's receivership, said its final bid was increased to accommodate additional features requested by the MoD. Mr Ashby said both tenders last year were about Pounds 170m, but he believed that VSEL's final bid was about Pounds 160m, while Swan's was about Pounds 210m. The other prospect was a link-up under discussion with General Electric Company, which owns the rival Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde. Negotiations that could have led to a takeover of Swan were, however, contingent on its winning the order for the helicopter carrier. Without that Swan had no work on its books beyond the end of next year. Nobody in the industry believed UK naval work could continue to sustain four shipyards. An already inadequate workload has been drastically reduced since the launching of the government's Options for Change defence review in 1990  - an expected reduction of about 30 per cent in the fleet of frigates and destroyers and 50 per cent in submarines. The cuts affect both the shipyards and the naval refit dockyards of Devonport and Rosyth, under private management since 1987. The combined industry supported about 30,000 jobs in the mid-1980s. By the late 1990s this is expected to be no more than 11,000 or 12,000. The award of contracts has become an industrial policy by default, determining the future shape of competition in the industry. Swan suffered a heavy blow in January last year when Yarrow won a Pounds 400m order for the latest batch of three Type-23 frigates. Of 13 vessels built or on order, Yarrow has won nine to Swan's four. Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton, which made a niche for itself building glass-fibre mine warfare ships, has succeeded in compensating for a gap in this business with steel ships for export. VSEL, the former Vickers yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, is undergoing severe cuts, having failed until now in its bids for navy surface ship work. But, even if it faces daunting problems, VSEL has a guaranteed market as long as the navy wants submarines. Without firm assurances on future business from the MoD, receivership became the only option for Swan. Industry experts say the yard could continue in business with a much smaller workforce  - less than 1,000 of the present 2,200  - in the hope of securing export orders in the next 18 months. Arrangements have to be decided for completing work on the three frigates now at Swan. The last, HMS Richmond, has just been launched. Dr Malcolm McIntosh, the MoD's procurement chief, recently told the Commons defence committee that the Fort George contract had been awarded to Swan in 1987 on political grounds to safeguard jobs. But this week it was clear the government was not ready to do the same again.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Mexico rebels hold convention Some 6,000 delegates and observers from Mexico's main radical and leftist political groups set off for the Lacandon jungle in the southern state of Chiapas yesterday to participate in a self-styled convention of democracy convened by Zapatista insurgents. The convention was called by Sub-Comandante Marcos, the Zapatista spokesman, after the rebels rejected the government peace proposal for a resolution to the eight-month old Chiapas conflict. The Zapatistas launched their rebellion on New Year's Day. Mr Marcos has said the delegates will discuss the need for a transitional government, a new constitution, and a peaceful movement to democracy. A preliminary round of talks began on Saturday in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas. In highly disorganised sessions, delegates generally read out prepared speeches late into the night, mostly supporting Zapatista demands for an end to rule by Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary party and establishment of a transitional democratic government. The convention has been dismissed by many as an exercise in propaganda by Mr Marcos.</p>

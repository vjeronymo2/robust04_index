			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SILVER ENDING SURVIVES FOUL CLAIM, BEATS REAL CASH IN THE ARKANSAS DERBY  </P> <P> Southland-based Silver Ending, a bargain basement purchase, survived a foul  claim to win the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn and earn a trip to the Kentucky  Derby.  </P> <P> Silver Ending was eighth in the early going, but he made his move along the  rail and passed several horses in the far turn.  </P> <P> Jockey Gary Stevens then squeezed the colt inside of Southland-based Real Cash  and went on to win by 3 1/4 lengths.  </P> <P> Jose Santos, who rode runner-up Real Cash, filed a foul claim against Silver  Ending, saying the colt veered out in the turn. But the stewards upheld the  victory for Silver Ending.  </P> <P> Trainer Ron McAnally, who paid only $1,500 for Silver Ending at a yearling  sale, said he would take the colt to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby May 5.  </P> <P> Silver Ending covered the 1 1/8 miles on a good track in 1:48 and returned  $14.20, $7.60 and $5.80 as the third choice in the field of 13. The colt earned  $300,000, increasing his career total to $668,900.  </P> <P> Real Cash, part of a Wayne Lukas-trained entry, paid $9.20 and $11.40. Bright  Again, the favorite who was second to Summer Squall in the Jim Beam, was never  far off the lead but finished seventh.  </P> <P> At Keeneland: Go for Wand charged into the lead midway down the backstretch and  scored a five-length victory in the $224,000 Ashland Stakes.  </P> <P> The 1989 juvenile filly champion ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:43 3/5 in the mud.  </P> <P> At Garden State: Wind Splitter rallied from well off the pace to win the  $114,000 Trenton Handicap by 2 1/2 lengths over Loyal Pal.  </P></p>

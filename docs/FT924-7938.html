			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / BT falls 36% in wake of redundancies A BIG redundancy programme was behind a 36 per cent fall in British Telecommunications' pre-tax profits for the half year to the end of September. Profits fell from Pounds 1.61bn to Pounds 1.03bn and earnings per share were 42 per cent down from 17.4p to 10.1p. However, if redundancy charges of Pounds 442m and a Pounds 135m exceptional loss incurred on the disposal of its Canadian Mitel subsidiary are added back, earnings per share would have fallen only 2 per cent. BT has cut its workforce by 35,300 since the start of the financial year and expects to trim its 175,000 workforce by a further 15,000 a year over the next two years. The interim dividend will be 6.15p (5.7p), a 7.9 per cent increase. BT's shares closed up 15p at 388p. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said the recession, regulation and tougher competition led to a 1.5 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 6.53bn. But in the second quarter 'the first signs of a slight improvement may have been perceptible' and this had continued in October. On a 12-month moving average, inland call volumes fell 1 per cent, international volumes grew 5 per cent and exchange line connections increased 0.9 per cent. Mr Vallance said of the link this week between Mercury Communications, its main UK rival, and BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group: 'I am fairly relieved at the choice of partner.' He dismissed stockbroker suggestions that shareholder value could be enhanced by increasing dividends more sharply or buying back the company's shares. Mr Barry Romeril, finance director, said such suggestions were based on the hypothesis that the company would accumulate a cash mountain whereas its net debt was more than Pounds 2bn. Mr Vallance defended last week's sale of BT's stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the large US mobile communications company, as 'not a strategic blow'. He said that in the UK BT would like to provide entertainment services over its network and integrate its mobile communications operations with its mainstream network. Both are prevented by regulation. Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 1.17bn to Pounds 952m. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Ciller secures vote of confidence in Turkey Mrs Tansu Ciller, Turkey's first woman prime minister, yesterday secured a parliamentary vote of confidence, as deputies rallied to her support in the wake of the worst outbreak of Islamic violence in more than a decade, writes John Murray Brown. Despite earlier complaints about the composition of her cabinet, her radical economic plans and the potentially embarrassing revelation about her decision to seek US nationality, Mrs Ciller won the confidence vote backed by 247 deputies with 184 voting against in the 450-member assembly.</p>

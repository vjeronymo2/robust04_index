			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Monthly returns rule to be changed - Large Traders THE chancellor announced that large traders would not be required to submit monthly VAT returns from autumn 1992. Instead, they will be required to make monthly VAT payments on account from October 1992; they will continue to be required to render VAT returns quarterly. This decision follows consultation initiated by the chancellor in October 1991, when he announced the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT on most EC goods from January 1 1993 and proposals for large traders to submit monthly VAT returns from autumn 1992 to offset the consequential PSBR effects. Provision for monthly payments on account will be made in the Finance Bill and present legislation will not be used. From January 1 1993, for most Single Market goods, there will no longer be a requirement for businesses to submit official documents at the time of importation or to pay (or defer) the VAT due on goods before they are released from Customs' charge. VAT due on purchases from another member state will be accounted for under the Postponed Accounting System (PAS) on the businesses' usual VAT return. The PAS arrangement will mean that businesses no longer have to fund the tax payment for imports before they are able to reclaim the tax as an input tax deduction under the normal rules. This will give a significant cash flow advantage to businesses engaged in intra-Community trade. The postponed accounting arrangement means, however, that in the fiscal year 1992-93 there will be a considerable shortfall to the Exchequer. This is because businesses will not be paying import VAT at the time of importation (or up to six weeks later under the present system of deferring payment). To offset this cost, very large VAT payers will be required to make VAT payments on account for each of the first two months of every quarter. Very large traders are those who currently make quarterly VAT returns and payments and whose total VAT liability (including VAT due on imports and on goods from warehouse) exceeded Pounds 2m over the period covered by their last four quarterly returns up to and including March 31 1991. The chancellor previously announced his intention to consult on the original proposal that those large traders would change from quarterly returns and payment to monthly returns and payment. The chancellor has listened carefully to the responses arising from the consultation process, and has accepted the concerns expressed by businesses about the cost of changing internal accounting arrangements and the increased exposure to penalties and default surcharge. He has agreed that monthly VAT payments on account will be required, instead of monthly returns and payments, with the first payments on account due in the month of November, December or January depending on the timing of the VAT returns cycle for each trader. Full details of the proposed scheme are in a leaflet which will be sent to the business representatives previously consulted. Copies of the leaflet are available from the VAT Central Unit (tel: 0702 366585). Under the current system for imports, a business completes a Single Administrative Document and declares its duty and tax liability. VAT is paid at this time, or, subject to prior approval by Customs and Excise, any duty due and the VAT may be deferred for up to six weeks. Under the deferment arrangements the payments due are charged to a Duty Deferment Account on the 15th day of the month following the date of importation. A VAT Certificate is provided to importers as evidence of payment of the tax and this is used to support a claim for input tax deduction in the normal way. These arrangements will continue after 1993 for imports from outside the Single Market. Under the PAS system, using commercial documentation, the importer enters the 'import VAT' as tax due (output tax) in his business records and claims any tax due as a deductible expense for his business (input tax). These figures are declared on the business's normal VAT return. There will be no need to submit Customs documentation for goods supplied to a UK business by a business in another EC country nor will the importer need to pay VAT at the port or airport of entry. There are no changes for imports from outside the Single Market.</p>

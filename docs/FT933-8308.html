			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Nigerian papers proscribed NIGERIA'S military government yesterday proscribed newspapers shut last month, including one owned by Chief Moshood Abiola (above), victorious candidate in the June presidential poll subsequently annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. 'This is just the beginning of a new darkness of a type Nigerians never believed they deserved,' said Mr Abiola in London yesterday. 'Babangida has signalled to the world consent no longer forms any part of the code of government.' The decree outlaws newspapers of the Concord group, owned by Mr Abiola, and those of Punch, the Daily Sketch and Bendel Newspaper Corporation, which the government closed on July 22 in the biggest press clampdown since independence in 1960, accusing the papers of bias. General Babangida postponed a speech to the National Assembly yesterday, and is expected to give details of his proposed interim government today, his 52nd birthday. Yesterday's press clampdown reinforced doubts that he will hand effective power to the new administration. Lagos re-opened for business yesterday after a three-day mass stay-at-home protest, which left the city deserted from Thursday to Saturday. The Campaign for Democracy, which organised the protest, has promised more action. Thousands of people are fleeing the cities, particularly in the south-west, Mr Abiola's political strongold. 'As we get nearer the fateful August 27, the spate of flight has escalated,' the Lagos Guardian newspaper said in an editorial.</p>

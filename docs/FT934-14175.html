			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (17): Innovation on all fronts - Value-added network services / Telecom service providers across the world are scrambling to deliver more value-added network services (Vans) to their corporate customers in a bid to win new business and now Europe - has led to greater competition between established network operators, new entrants and specialised niche market players. At the same time, technological advances, particularly the shift to digital systems, have provided service operators with fresh opportunities. The result is a proliferation of value-added services aimed at corporate customers. For example, the digitalisation of BT's UK network has enabled the former PTT to offer a bundle of 'Star Services' - call-forwarding, call-waiting, caller identification and other special facilities which until recently have only been available of large companies' internal private branch exchanges (PBX). Similarly, the introduction of competing GSM (Groupe Systeme Mobile) digital cellular networks across Europe will give network operators an opportunity to exploit a whole new range of features like GSM's short message facility which allows handsets fitted with liquid crystal screens to receive 160-character messages, twice as long as the typical alphanumeric radio-pager. Mr Martin O'Byrne, managing director of Sema Group's telecom division which worked with Vodafone in the UK to develop the facility, believes that SMS and other features like it will provide network operators with an important way of differentiating their GSM networks. Value-added services are already an important and rapidly growing source of revenues for the telecommunications industry. The US Commerce Department estimated that providers of value-added services including electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, enhanced facsimile and managed network services in the US will earn around Dollars 8bn this year. Across the Atlantic, Ovum, the technology consultancy, produces a continuous information service called 'Vans Market Europe,' which forecasts that the European market will almost treble in value from Ecu 4.05bn in 1991 to Ecu 11.6bn in 1996, (see table). Ovum says France is the biggest Vans market in Europe although its share of the total is declining as other markets (such as Germany) expand. France Telcom ranks as Europe's Vans market leader with an estimated 20 per cent of the market followed by Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (13 per cent), Telephonica (10 per cent), Reuters (7.5 per cent), BT (4.1 per cent) and IBM (3.7 per cent). DATA NETWORK SERVICES Packet-switched and other data services were among the first true value-added services offered first in the US and subsequently in Europe. The three most common data network services are telecommunications companies' public X25 network, other vendors managed data network services and the big US and pan-European special purpose networks operated by companies like Reuters or consortia such as Swift. Traditional X25 packet-switched data networks provide a simple means for exchanging data between sites, but high prices and uncertainty about whether X25 can meet current and future requirements for high bandwidth services like video-conferencing have led to the development of alternatives known as fast-packet switching services. These include a fast packet technology called Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and frame relay, a slimmed-down version of X25 which is faster,simpler and cheaper than X25 and provides an ideal interconnection service for local area networks (Lans). In the United States, Frost and Sullivan, the market consultancy, has estimated that the market for fast packet switching services will rise from Dollars 74m in 1992 to Dollars 2bn by 1997. FRAME RELAY Ovum expects frame relay to account for eight per cent of the European Vans market by 1996 - astonishing growth given that two years ago it was little more than another high-tech concept which emerged out of ISDN standardisation work. Vendors in the US, where it is already well established, include the long distance carriers, local exchange carriers, local data specialists like Compuserve as well as internationally oriented managed network service providers like BT and Infonet. The market is now expanding quickly in Europe where most PTTs, together with AT&amp;T Istel and a handful of data specialists, have either launched, or have plans to launch, frame relay services. Ovum believes that in Europe 40 per cent of commercial sites with more than 100 employees will be using frame relay within five years of a national service being introduced. ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI) EDI enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange routine business documentation such as orders and invoices using standard electronic forms and their own computers linked through a service provider. It is often a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging information than the traditional paper-based business transaction and can play a crucial role in automating a transaction chain. These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated, and in the UK and the Netherlands which lead Europe in EDI usage. Ovum expects the EDI market in Europe, including customer software and support, to grow from about Ecu 196m in 1992 to about Ecu 590m in 1997, a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent. The market leaders in Europe are IBM and Geis which have pan-European networks and services and International Network Services (INS, jointly owned by Geis and ICL) which dominates the market in the UK with an estimated 55 per cent market share. ELECTRONIC MAIL Unlike EDI, electronic mail is a non-interactive service based on sending computer originated messages across a telecommunications network. In Europe, electronic mail is already a significant and fast-expanding Vans market. Ovum estimates that service providers earned Ecu 176m from electronic mail services last year and will earn almost ECu 1.5bn by 1997. The largest share of the market is held by BT GNS (formerly Tymnet) followed by IBM, Unisource and Geis. Ovum has identified seven other smaller market players including AT&amp;T, Easylink, Mercury and Sprint. The UK is the largest electronic mail market in Europe. ENHANCED FACSIMILE Value-added fax services are now widely available in the US and Europe and have proved highly popular on both sides of the Atlantic. Common features include broadcast fax to multiple destinations, automatic retry and deferred delivery. Ovum says the the European market is expanding 'spectacularly' and is set to become one of the larger Vans markets growing 12 fold to be worth Ecu 436m by 1997 compared to Ecu 36.3m last year. Part of the reason for this substantial increase is the popularity of basic fax services coupled with a desire by corporate customers in particular to control and cut fax costs. The PTT are among the most active suppliers of enhanced fax services however there are also a growing number of niche suppliers. In Europe, AT&amp;T Easylink led the way in 1990 with its Enhanced Fax (E-Fax) service and Italcable launched its Multifax service the following year. In the UK, which is the largest market in Europe, BT, Mercury and Sprint all offer enhanced fax services. Among the other Vans videotext during the 1980s all the European PTTs followed BT's example and launched videotext services but while these have proved very popular in some markets such as France, they have been much slower to develop in other markets including the UK and Germany. What is certain is that PTOs and others will continue to devise new value-added network services in an attempt to boost revenues, exploit the technology and retain their customers.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      EUROPEAN MARKET FORECASTS: VALUE-ADDED NETWORKS (ECU MILLIONS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       1991   1992    1993   1994    1995    1996  CAGR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Electronic data       135     200     258    330     402     490   29%   interchange Electronic mail       111     133     168    229     344     518   36% Enhanced fax            6      15      31     64      36     290  117% Frame relay             0      24     179    402     676     933  149% Data network        3,100   3,666   4,337  5,133   6,079   7,372   19%   services Card authorisation    176     218     278    365    491      671   31% Computerised          116     246     463    610    724      819   48%   reservations Videotex              409     470     547    631    719      811    15% TOTAL               4,053   4,972   6,261  7,764  9,571   11,902   24%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAGR indicates compound annual growth rate.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ovum, 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

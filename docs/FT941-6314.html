			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Underwriting gains push GA to record Pounds 295m General Accident, the composite insurer, yesterday provided further evidence of the recovery in the UK general insurance market by posting its highest ever profit figures. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 294.9m last year, compared with a Pounds 29.3m loss in 1992. The final dividend was increased by 4.4 per cent to 17.8p per share, making a total of 27.5p against 26.75p. As with Guardian Royal Exchange, Royal Insurance and Commercial Union, GA's turnround hinged on an improvement in the UK, where underwriting profits of Pounds 59.7m for the year - and Pounds 32m for the fourth quarter - were reported. 'Our early action on rates and operating costs has produced a very significant recovery,' said Mr Nelson Robertson, chief executive. 'Determination to underwrite for profit and not volume has had a very considerable impact.' In motor, underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 11.1m against a loss of Pounds 46.8m. Premium income increased by 4.8 per cent to Pounds 252.7m. However, the company reduced its exposure from 750,000 policies to 660,000, reflecting a planned reduction on the non-comprehensive side. Overall UK premium income increased from Pounds 1.25bn to Pounds 1.38bn. Results from the US - where GA obtains 32 per cent of its premium income - improved with underwriting losses falling from Pounds 210.5m to Pounds 140.4m. However, in Canada, where GA is the biggest player following an acquisition last year, underwriting losses more than doubled to Pounds 44.1m. Mr Robertson said GA had benefited from a reduced level of catastrophe losses in the US, but had been hit by storm losses and the need to strengthen reserves in Canada. The company is keen to expand in the Pacific region - it has market shares of 5-7 per cent in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr Robertson said the balance of the group's account could shift towards North America and the Pacific. 'There is nothing in our plan which says the UK has to provide us with a third of our total income.' The company has some capital which it could use for expansion, following a strengthening of its balance sheet. Its solvency margin - net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums - amounted to 57.4 per cent at the year-end, up from 41.5 per cent. Overall, general premium income rose to Pounds 4.18bn from Pounds 3.83bn. Life premiums amounted to Pounds 866.1m, against Pounds 790.4m and profits on the life side were Pounds 49.1m, compared with Pounds 34.8m. Investment income rose to Pounds 509.1m, from Pounds 504.9m. Losses from the estate agencies halved to Pounds 9.5m. Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 229m from Pounds 510.1m. Interest on loans fell to Pounds 15.9m, from Pounds 40.1m. Payments under the employee profit sharing scheme amounted to Pounds 8.9m. Lex, Page 24</p>

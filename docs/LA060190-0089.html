			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MEESE'S BROTHER FAILS TO WIN PANEL'S OK  </P> <P> George Meese, brother of former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese, failed to win  confirmation to another four-year term on the state Unemployment Insurance  Appeals Board, but the state Senate Rules Committee said it would again take up  his reappointment at an unspecified date. Meese's continued service in his  $86,000-a-year post was opposed by the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO,  which complained that the number of board decisions favoring unemployed  laborers has dropped dramatically since Gov. George Deukmejian appointed Meese  in 1985.  </P></p>

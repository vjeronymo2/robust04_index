			<p>BFN     [Text] Noumea, June 18 (AFP) -- Fijian President Ratu Sir  Kamisese Mara arrived Saturday in New Caledonia for a five-day  official visit at the invitation of the French Government.    The Fijian leader, who received military honors after  arriving from the French territory of Wallis and Futuna, called  for closer relations with New Caledonia.    He stressed that his country had no objections to French  policy in the South Pacific, particularly since the start of the  moratorium on nuclear testing in French Polynesia.    The president was to meet Saturday with members of the  Fijian  community in New Caledonia.    On Monday he will visit the headquarters of the Commission  of  the South Pacific and the Agency for the Development of Kanak  Culture, before meeting with representatives of New Caledonian  political parties and institutions.    He is scheduled to leave the territory on Wednesday.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MONORAIL DECISION COULD MOVE BAD AIR OUT OF ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> The Irvine City Council recently gave the green light to the initial half-mile  monorail link in a proposed five-mile loop through the Irvine Business Complex  adjacent to the John Wayne Airport. McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. was awarded  195,000 square feet of high-rise density in exchange for construction of this  $9-million monorail segment.  </P> <P> Can you envision walking outside in Orange County and taking a deep breath of  air without choking on the toxic fumes? This is what we are proposing to  eventually rid ourselves of: the pollution and congestion caused by hopelessly  snarled traffic. Imagine taking a short walk from your home to the monorail  station, quickly up the escalator and onto a sleek space-age vehicle that will  silently move you in air-conditioned comfort to your office, the airport,  shopping mall or other places.  </P> <P> Instead of gridlock and being in traffic, you can enjoy reading or contemplate  the reopened view of nature. We are literally talking about the real quality of  life here in Orange County.  </P> <P> Now, let's look at the pragmatic side. Will the proliferation of high-rise  buildings around John Wayne Airport continue? It certainly doesn't look likely  that there is any slowdown. I look out my office window and see high-rise  cranes all over the airport area.  </P> <P> What are they presently contributing to the community besides additional  smog-belching traffic? Nothing. So one way to view the density bonus that was  awarded to McDonnell Douglas Realty is to see that there was an equal bonus  received by the City of Irvine -- a monorail demonstration project that is  absolutely free to the taxpayers.  </P> <P> Was this a fair exchange, just looking at the economics of the deal? I think  so. The $9-million monorail equates to $46 per square foot of density -- a very  fair price by any national standard. But, in addition, the developer agrees to  operate and maintain the monorail until such time as it is donated to a transit  authority.  </P> <P> This joint effort by the City of Irvine and McDonnell Douglas Realty entails  some risk as well as vision. As Mayor Larry Agran said at the recent City  Council meeting, "When we have a proposal that combines the public's interest  with the private sector's needs and desires, then we have a real project." I  think he is right.  </P> <P> There is no free lunch or easy way out of our horrendous transportation  problems. It requires the dedication and the hard work of both the public and  private sectors to put something like this together, and despite all the  obstacles, we won. No -- on further reflection, the people won.  </P> <P> Perhaps it might have been a safer course to "study" the problem for years --  as they have in Los Angeles since 1936 -- always waiting for the perfect  solution. I think we are on the right course.  </P> <P> This train is moving. If we don't look out, it may move some of the present  lethargy and complacency right out of its path.  </P> <P> ROBERT R. YOUNG  </P> <P> President,  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas Realty Co.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nejla Sammakia] </F>   [Text] Jericho, West Bank, June 7 (AFP) -- Palestinian  television has gone on the air for the first time, broadcasting  a test card, although the transmission was hampered by the fact  that it came from one of the lowest spots on earth.    The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio and  television put out a trial television transmission late Monday  beamed from a converted hotel.    The corporation's circular logo, bearing the letters PBC in  English, followed by the name in Arabic and the Palestinian flag  on the side, was to appear on television screens for 24 hours.    The initial transmission covered Jericho only, and was  beamed  from a hotel which has been turned into a press center for the  visit of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, expected here later this month.    As technicians connected cables and put up giant aerials on  the roof, painters and carpenters were hurriedly renovating the  30-room building which has been closed to the public.    At a cost of around one million dollars, the television  center's main function will be to cover 'Arafat's visit.  Transmission to the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  will be ready within a week, technicians promised.    After 'Arafat's visit is over, the station will continue to  operate as a relay for the permanent broadcasting center, the  location of which is at the centre of a dispute between Israel  and the Palestine Liberation Organization.    The Palestinians want to set it up in the Israeli-occupied  town of Ramallah, also on the West Bank, where a pre-1967  Jordanian center stands. But Israel wants them to stay in  Jericho.    "We are happy to see the word 'Palestine' on the screen,"  said corporation head Radwan Abu-'Ayyash. "We've been watching  and listening to others, now it's time for others to listen to  us."    It is the first ever Palestinian television station. Until  recently, the PLO beamed radio programs from stations in Cairo,  Baghdad and Tunis.    However, not all residents were able to tune in their sets  to  the new station which used a higher frequency channel than  usual. Palestinian technicians said they may later adjust the  channel for wider reception.    Among the many problems facing the new station is the  location of Jericho. At more than 400 meters (1,300 feet) below  sea level, this valley oasis is one of the lowest spots in the  world and will make transmission difficult.    "Our plan was to have a main studio in Ramallah, connected  with one in Gaza and one in Jericho," Abu-'Ayyash said. "Because  we have no other choice, we will transmit from Jericho although  it is terrible from such a low area."    He said two French-made boosting towers were to be placed on  a surrounding mountain and on a nearby highway. Most of the  small equipment and transmitters was bought from Israel.    A French-donated vehicle for external transmission, and  other  equipment donated by Germany are on their way to Jericho, he  said.    The corporation's major headache however is a lack of funds.    Abu-'Ayyash said 55 million dollars were needed to establish  the permanent broadcasting center and its studios, most of which  have been promised by the European Union but not yet arrived.    "The money is locked up in Brussels," he said. "We have the  skills and the goodwill. But we have a political problem with  Israel, and without solving the political and money problems, we  can't do much."</p>

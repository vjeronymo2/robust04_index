			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 2d Corps Press center report </F> from Zivinice]    [Text] The heavy shelling, helicopter flights, and attacks  on the defense lines are the basic features of the [Serb]  aggressor's activities in the operational zone of the 6th  Operative Group Zivinice.    Dozens of shells were again fired at Zivinice today. The  prevailing view here is that the aggressor has decided to  intensify combat operations so as to endanger the safe use of  the nearby Dubrave Airport for humanitarian flights. It is well  known that the United Nations are determined to open this  airport soon, and it is also well known that the aggressor's  side is rejecting this.    The general alarm in Zivinice has already been sounded three  times today owing to the shelling.</p>

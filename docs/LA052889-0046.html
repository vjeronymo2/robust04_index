			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S INAPPROPRIATE ROLE AS AN EVENHANDED BROKER  </P> <P> Secretary of State Jim Baker's speech to the American Israel Political Action  Committee last week is being widely interpreted as the first comprehensive,  authoritative statement of the Bush Administration on the Arab-Israeli  conflict. It is generally believed that its style and substance reflect the  thoughts and feelings of the Bush-Baker team about problems of the region.  </P> <P> Examination of the speech establishes that it is less harshly critical of  Israel than was generally reported, especially on radio and television.  Nonetheless, the speech was not good news for Israel and its friends, and is  more likely to heighten tensions than lower them.  </P> <P> The substantive proposals made by Baker were rendered less attractive than they  might have been by some gratuitously negative language, which gave the speech  its negative tone.  </P> <P> "Stop the challenges to Israel's standing in international organizations," he  told the Arabs; "repudiate the odious line that Zionism is racism."  </P> <P> He told the Palestinians to renounce the policy of a phased takeover of Israel  and to give up the uprising for diplomacy.  </P> <P> To Israelis he said, "Forswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Allow  schools to reopen. Reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors who deserve  political rights."  </P> <P> There are important problems with Baker's speech. Most notable, perhaps, is the  curious tone of evenhandedness in Baker's approach, the kind of assumption that  fairness lies in a middle ground between Israeli and Palestinian goals, and his  request that all parties -- Israelis, Palestinians and other Arabs -- make  concessions.  </P> <P> Baker referred in the introductory portions of his speech to the fact that  Israel is a "vigorous democracy" with which the United States has a "strategic  partnership." But his discussion of the conflict communicated no sense of  greater concern for one side than for the other. It communicated no sense that  Israel is a beleaguered democracy confronting a violent adversary bent on its  destruction, no sense that Israel has fought three wars for survival.  </P> <P> In a phrase seized on by the media, Baker called on Israel to "lay aside, once  and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel." This is very strange  language; it suggests that the secretary thinks that Israel is driven by an  expansionist vision. But, of course, it was not expansionism that delivered the  West Bank and Gaza to Israeli occupation. It was the need to defend against  repeated attacks by neighbors.  </P> <P> Baker's curious language becomes curiouser when it is remembered that in the  since 1967, no Israeli government has acted to annex the territories, and that,  to the contrary, in the one available opportunity to negotiate peace with an  Arab neighbor, Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for a very formal  peace. In fact, no significant political party in Israel is driven by the  vision of a "greater Israel." And to suggest otherwise is unfair and  inaccurate.  </P> <P> However, there is a state in the region driven by dreams of expansion. It is  Assad's Syria, which occupies more than half of Lebanon. Jim Baker has yet to  discuss this most-important obstacle to peace in the region.  </P> <P> It is not clear why Baker should be more concerned with the peace and rights of  Palestinians than of Lebanese. It is not clear why a U.S. secretary of state  has a greater concern with peace on the West Bank than with peace in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Baker's goal for the West Bank and Gaza seems to me reasonable and compatible  with the security of Israel, Jordan and West Bank Palestinians. His support of  Israel's proposed plan for elections in the territories is consistent with our  values and Israel's. His recognition that it will take time and concession by  all is realistic. But his desire to be (or to seem to be) an evenhanded broker  in a life-and-death struggle involving a faithful ally seems to me  inappropriate.  </P> <P> Responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is not evenly distributed. This  conflict was born of Arab refusal to accept the existence of a Jewish state,  born of three Arab wars and of the refusal of Israel's neighbors even to  discuss peace. It is a conflict that has led to the murder of Jews and  Palestinians, and also of Anwar Sadat, Bashir Gemayel and other Arabs who have  dared to advocate peace. It is a conflict that successive Israeli governments  have sought to end -- even at great cost -- whenever a reasonable opportunity  appeared.  </P> <P> These are simple facts that need to be faced, even in this age when neutrality  is often confused with reason and justice.  </P></p>

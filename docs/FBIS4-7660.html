			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 2 (BTA) -- Mr. Friedrich Koenig,  rapporteur of the Political Committee of the Council of Europe's  [CE] Parliamentary Assembly, and Mr. Dominique Columberg,  rapporteur of the Legal Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly,  have established that state institutions in Bulgaria differ  considerably on many important home policy issues. Their  mission here was to draft a resolution on recommunization trends  in Bulgaria.    At a news conference today they summarized the results of  their meetings with MPs of the different parliamentary forces,  Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Justice Minister Petar  Kornazhev, Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev, Supreme Court  Chairman Ivan Grigorov and members of the Supreme Lawyers'  Council. Yesterday's schedule of the CE representatives proved  too tight to squeeze in a meeting with the members of the  Supreme Judicial Council.    We are not in a position to pass judgement, but the  differences between the executive and the judiciary will make it  very difficult for us to make our report quickly, Mr. Columberg  pointed out. He explained that several principled requirements  should be reflected in the report: whether the prerogatives of  the different state institutions are observed, whether they  enjoy an absolute autonomy, and whether they are not subject to  political influence. The reports should be presented to the  Parliamentary Assembly by July.    The CE representatives said that there are constitutional  grounds for the building of the judiciary in Bulgaria but a  series of important acts are yet to be passed.</p>

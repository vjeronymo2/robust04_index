			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Monarch sells stake in Ewart for loss MONARCH Properties, the private Dublin-based property developer, has sold its 29.2 per cent stake in Ewart, the publicly-quoted Northern Ireland property company, for a figure 'upwards of 80p per share' according to a spokesman for Monarch. The sale has resulted in a substantial loss to Monarch. Ewart is the lead developer for the Pounds 100m Laganside scheme in central Belfast, which involves construction of a concert hall, 200-bedroom hotel and 400,000 sq ft of offices, and has other property developments throughout the UK. Site work on the Laganside project is expected to start in March. Last September, Mr Philip Monahan, chairman of Monarch, called an extraordinary meeting in an attempt to oust four of Ewart's eight-man board, and replace them with two of his own nominees, 'with a view to radically redefining the strategic direction direction of Ewart'. His aim was to steer Ewart towards property development in the Republic, but there was suspicion on the board that he simply wanted to sell some of his own developments there into Ewart. At the time of the boardroom battle, Mr Monahan was not prepared to state that he was not planning such a move. His boardroom coup was narrowly defeated. Monarch's 5.5m shares in Ewart were bought at an average price of 125p, and the beneficial owner to whom they have been sold is Texas-based property developer Mr Claude Mayer. Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director of Ewart, said yesterday: 'I have been assured by Mr Monahan's legal representatives that Mr Mayer's intentions are friendly and that he will not be making a full bid. 'I can only hope our relationship with Mr Mayer will be better than it was with Mr Monahan.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hu Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang </F> (1660 2556 0342) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences National  Conditions Analysis Group: "Creating New Systems To Eradicate  Corruption Once and For All (Part Three of Three)"]    [Text] 4. Party and government organizations should be  strictly forbidden to engage in business activities. With "the  administration maintained by regular revenue," the high salary  system for bureaucrats should be introduced.    Whether or not officials should live on government pay or  should "do business" or be allowed to "earn extra income" is a  controversial issue.    We believe officials should only live on government pay.  They should never be allowed to "do business" or "earn extra  income" under any pretext. It is imperative to "maintain the  administration with regular revenue." "Maintaining the  administration with regular revenue" means the government  collecting compulsory taxes and then paying the salaries of  government officials and other personnel in the form of fiscal  outlay. In developed industrialized countries, this pay is  considered "bureaucratic pay" and a "high salary system" is in  operation. Normally, the average bureaucratic pay scale offered  by the public sector is higher than, or equivalent to, the  average pay scale offered by the private sector. The pay scale  for central government officials is even higher, because more  skills, higher educational qualifications, and richer experience  are required of these officials than employees in the private  sector. On the one hand, the high salary system conforms to the  theory of human capital investment returns and attracts a  constant flow of outstanding members of society into the  government bureaucracy to help improve the quality of that  bureaucracy. On the other hand, "high salaries foster honesty  in official conduct." When bureaucrats enjoy relatively  handsome and stable salary income and decent living standards,  the temporary gain obtained through corruption and embezzlement  will have to be greater in order to make it worthwhile because  of the risk of losing the income of "bureaucratic salaries" for  ever. This will check the impulse for corruption among  bureaucrats to a great extent but if the low salary system is  operating, it will cause many outstanding members of the  bureaucracy to leave and the quality of the bureaucracy to go  down. On the other hand, because the officials are paid less  than their human capital input and the worth of the work they  contribute, they will certainly seek illegal means of income to  obtain new self-compensation. All kinds of practices to "make  extra money by official means," with or without disguise, are a  form of legally acceptable compensation; while seeking personal  gain by abuse of power is another form of compensation, which is  illegal. There is no essential difference between the two and  both practices give officials a strong rent-seeking incentive  [xun zu ji li 1416 4436 3423 0536]. Some scholars believe that  being in a relative state of pauperism has left the social  status of party and government cadres in a polarized state and  the highest political status and lowest economic status  necessarily induce the impulse of party and government cadres to  compare their incomes with others and pursue high income for the  sake of a mental equilibrium. Therefore, one can say that low  salaries necessarily arouse party and government officials'  impulse for corruption. What needs elucidation here is that, at  the moment, officials are under the low salary system on the one  hand and, on the other, are enjoying "hidden incomes," such as  invisible housing subsidies and entitlement to transport in  exclusive cars and aircraft. With the ill-defined public and  private incomes and ambiguous rules and regulations, many  officials have learned to "hitchhike." The openness of the  administration [shi zheng 1395 2398], the clarity of the regime,  and the well-defined demarcation between the public and the  private will reduce the incidence of "hitchhikes" and to some  extent check corruption among officials. For this purpose, we  offer the following suggestions:    --We should introduce a high salary system for bureaucrats  and significantly raise the average pay scale for cadres in  government organs, so that it is higher than the average wage  level for workers in the whole country and reaches or exceeds  the middle income level. The average pay scale for cadres in the  central government organs should be even higher. The pay scale  for cadres at and above the level of ministers should be  equivalent to the high income scale and should be decided and  announced by the National People's Congress Standing Committee  on a yearly basis.    --All kinds of invisible subsidies granted to officials,  such  as housing subsidy, car subsidy, and medical and medicine  subsidy, should be scrapped and directly included in their  salaries. All the special supply avenues and special services  at preferential rates or free gratis should be removed.    The incomes and properties of officials should be made  transparent. They should collect all income by producing their  ID cards. The incomes collected should be transferred, paid,  recorded, and monitored by the bank, step by step. In the  meantime, they should deliver personal income tax and property  tax according to law. When necessary, the incomes, properties,  and tax payments of leaders can be publicized from time to time.  The judicial and tax authorities are entitled to verify and  examine them.    --It is necessary to reduce the number of levels of  government administration and the size of staff, which should be  cut by at least one-third. The administrative organs at the  prefectural level should be removed. All industrial ministries  and their subordinate regional industrial bureaus should be  replaced with trade societies. The trade societies, whose role  it is to strengthen the ties between enterprises in specific  trades and the government, constitute a third control mechanism  besides the market mechanism and state intervention. While they  represent the interests of their own trades and influence the  government policymaking and legislation, they also bear the  responsibility to support the government's formulation of  macropolicies.    Party and government organs should be strictly prohibited  from engaging in business and running any kind of company. All  existing companies should be disconnected from their parent  organs. Activities for "making extra money" organized by  government organs and various kinds of nonprofit institutions in  all sorts of names should not be encouraged.    --Cadres at and above the level of provincial or ministry  leaders cannot assume full- or part-time positions in any type  of companies after retiring from their official positions or  their work.    --The children of high-ranking cadres should be firmly  prohibited from engaging in business. The decision made by the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council on 28 July 1989  should be reiterated, that is: The spouses, children, and  children's spouses of the members of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and Secretariat and of the members of the State  Council standing conferences [chang wu hui yi 1603 0523 2585  6231] may not engage in business activities in the circulation  field and may not take up full- or part-time posts in companies  in the circulation field. This stipulation should apply to the  spouses, children, and children's spouses of retired CPC Central  Committee and State Council leaders.    What needs to be explained here is that, even with the  introduction of the high salary system for bureaucrats, a small  number of officials may still become corrupt and they will not  be satisfied with just 80,000 yuan or 100,000 yuan. They must  be punished and sternly handled according to law.    5. The Army should be strictly forbidden to engage in  business and it is necessary to "maintain the Army with regular  revenue."    Whether the Army should feed on the revenue or "engage in  business" is not a question for debate in a modern country. But  it has been a controversial point in China.    We believe the Army should only feed on the revenue and  should never "engage in business." It is necessary to "maintain  the Army with regular revenue." National defense belongs to  public goods that cannot be divided up or sold on the market.  It must be provided by the government (mainly the central  government). In a modern country, the government should provide  public goods, especially national defense expenditures, through  public spending with compulsory taxation. "Maintaining the Army  with regular revenue" is an international practice. The  international experience indicates that to allow the Army to  engage in business means giving the "green light" to corruption  in the Army.    Since the beginning of the 1980's, the Chinese Army has been  deeply involved in large-scale business activities. It has gone  so far that at present, all the three armed services, the  General Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department,  the General Logistics Department, all field armies, and all  provincial military districts are, without exception, involved  in running companies and making extra money to compensate for  the serious shortages in the military budget. As a result, the  commercialization, localization, and corruption of the armed  forces has accelerated. Cadres in the Army have been quite  critical of this but the central financial power is very low.  Though China's GNP has more than doubled since 1978, it is  still incapable of feeding an army of 3 million. The central  government, unable to do anything about it, keeps asking the  Army to hold out and allows it to engage in business and find  unofficial sources of income. This is a sign of serious neglect  of duty on the part of the central government and a very  shortsighted measure that could destroy the Great Wall and sow a  seed of turbulence and unrest for the future China. Some  leaders became aware of the severity of this problem a long time  ago and do not agree with these practices. In view of this, we  would like to offer the following suggestions:    --The army should be strictly forbidden to engage in  business. All kinds of companies owned or co-owned by the army,  including the army's own farms, should all be removed and their  assets transferred or auctioned off. The Army should not take  part in any kind of profitmaking economic activities of  localities and the troops stationed in a place may not accept  any kind of donations, contributions, or living subsidies from  local authorities.    --It is necessary to raise military expenditure by a big  margin and "maintain the Army with regular revenue." The  ability of the central treasury to absorb revenue must be  energetically improved to feed the Army, then the police, and  finally, officials and professors. All military expenditure  should come from allocations by the government treasury which  should cover the spending on routine army operations in  peacetime, i.e., ensuring that the growth rate of the actual  income of army personnel is slightly higher than that of the  average income of the residents in the whole country; ensuring  the maintenance of weaponry and equipment; accelerating  depreciation compensation; updating equipment; covering the  expenses of combat training; and making up for the shortages in  military funds by way of special withdrawals during wartime.    The measure of "maintaining the Army with regular revenue"  can be implemented in two stages. The first stage is  "maintaining the regular army with regular revenue," i.e.,  strictly banning business activities in field armies and navy  and air force combat units, which should be maintained with  central government funding. The second stage is a strict ban on  business activities in the whole army, which can be called  "maintaining the whole army with regular revenue." In our  opinion, even if it means having to invest in fewer big projects  and cut several hundred development zones, we should still  maintain the Army. In fact, the phenomenon of "relaxation" in  China's taxation system is serious and a large amount of tax is  uncollected. In 1992, the percentage of revenue in the GNP of  Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces was, shockingly, only 8.3 percent  and 9 percent respectively. Taxation is like squeezing a sponge  and the water (money) can be squeezed out by strict tax  collection to compensate the serious shortage of military  expenditure.    --Some of the national defense public goods can be produced  by the market. As one of the most important public goods,  national defense must be provided by the central government.  However, some of the national defense public goods, such as  army provisions and foodstuffs, medicines and medical apparatus,  military uniforms and military supplies, airports, roads, some  buildings, equipment and instruments can be produced by the  market and manufacturers. The military can place orders for  competitive bidding and the manufacturers produce the requested  products, so the Army does not have to be "self-sufficient" and  take care of everything it needs. The General Logistics  Department is just a big buyer and decides what to buy from the  market, rather than what to produce, except for facilities and  equipment which involve military secrets. It is most effective  to let the market produce some national defense goods and it  will also save a considerable amount of management spending and  national defense expenditure.    --Most of the ordnance industry enterprises should be  separated from the system of the regular armed forces to reduce  the size of the noncombatant elements of the army. Only an  extremely small number of core enterprises in the ordnance  industry having high security ratings can be kept. The  scientific research units in the ordnance industry should follow  suit. A ministry of ordnance industry should be formed on the  basis of the State Commission of Science, Technology, and  Industry for National Defense, reporting to the State Council.  It should specialize in the development and production of  weapons and equipment and enter into a buyer-seller relationship  with the military. The new mode in the context of the market  economy in future is that the central government provides money  to maintain the Army, the military places orders for goods, and  the ministry of ordnance industry produces the goods. As to  equipment other than weaponry, the military can invite bidding  from society at large and place orders with the winner.    --The tasks of the Army should be redefined and nonmilitary  expenditures which pose a burden on the Army should be cut down.  In the revolutionary period, the Army played multiple roles and  had to perform various functions. The army was not only a  combat force but also a production force. Under the objective  circumstances of that time, the Army would not have been able to  survive if they had not "used their own hands and supplied  themselves with ample food and clothing." But, in modern  society, it is inappropriate to give the Army too many  functions, too much responsibility, and too heavy a burden. Its  important function is protection of national defense. It is a  combat force but not a production force. An army is an army.  It is not an industrial army nor the main body of economic  operations. It should not take part in any market economic  activities, such as market-oriented productive activities and  operations, let alone activities that make staggering profits or  illegal activities, such as smuggling cars, reselling arms and  ammunitions at a profit, running deluxe hotels, and speculating  in real estate. It should not participate in local economic  construction as unpaid or cheap labor, which poses additional  financial burden on the Army and undermines the Army's spending  on military training. It should not undertake social service  functions, such as running nurseries, primary and middle schools  (except on islands and military bases), shops, post offices, and  community compounds. Naturally, however, helping with rescue  operations and relief provisions during natural calamities is  one of the functions of the Army and this is true with the armed  forces of all countries. This is one public service that the  Army renders to the society on behalf of the government. This  service does not cost the society anything but the government  must give the Army appropriate compensation out of disaster  relief expenditure.    Of the abovementioned five major reform measures, the last  two demand the consumption of large amounts of government  resources and the premise to them is to enhance the state's  ability to absorb revenue, i.e., raising the percentage of the  government revenue in the GNP and raising the percentage of the  central government's income in the total treasury revenue. The  second and third recommendations for the structural reforms do  not require the consumption of large amounts of government  resources and will only cause a certain reduction in the tariff  revenue. But, because they will stimulate technical importation  and promote the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, greater  benefits can be obtained. By breaking trade monopolies and  ensuring fair competition, the social transaction costs can be  greatly lowered. The first reform measure will bring  considerable returns. When the credit interest rate is closing  ranks with the market interest rate and bringing huge profits  for commercial banks, the government can obtain a rather large  amount of resources through such avenues as profit and tax  collection.    Whether or not we can put an end to corruption is a  yardstick  of whether or not a political system is institutionalized and  efficient. We believe that eradication of corruption by  creating new systems depends not only on the progress of the  economic structural reform but also on the progress of the  political structural reform and the development of socialist  democracy and politics. In view of the fact that China's  political development is lagging behind economic development and  the political structural reform is lagging behind the economic  structural reform, carrying out the political structural reform  in a vigorous and steady manner should be the key point in the  design of reform proposals for the next stage. This will  involve other major reform measures, such as the division and  balance of political power; the division and definition of  political functions (including those of the central government  and local governments); the streamlining and reorganization of  government organs; introduction of the civil service system and  improvement in the quality of officials; strengthening of the  supervision system and formulating "dogmas"; strengthening of  the judicial system and its independence; improvement of the  legal system and related rules and regulations; and  materialization of the role of media supervision.  <H5>  Postscript </H5>   What is most worrying is that corruption has become the  greatest social pollutant in today's China. It is the most  likely element which can ruin all the achievements made so far  in China's reform and opening up, terminate China's economic  takeoff, and delay China's modernization process. This is the  ultimate reason why we wrote this report. This report is not  commissioned or sponsored by any organization and is purely a  product of the conscience of Chinese intellectuals and their  concern for the long-term interests of the Chinese nation.    Obviously, the legitimacy of the third-generation leadership  lies in whether or not they have the courage to combat  corruption, whether or not they show efficiency in combating  corruption, and whether or not they will truly honor their  promise to a population of over 1 billion. The people are  watching! The people are waiting! The people are making a  choice!    This report sets forth an important approach to the  eradication of corruption by way of creating new systems and a  tentative package of five major measures for making innovations  in the systems. We are fully aware that each of these major  measures directly touches some special interest groups and will  bring adjustments to the existing interest pattern. Regarding  special interest groups, we should recognize them, restrict  them, and standardize them. Naturally, however, the  anticorruption operation, be it an institutional one or an  ethical one, is bound to encounter opposition and obstruction  from various quarters. Nevertheless, the anticorruption  operation is now like a "boat sailing against the current which  must forge ahead or it will be driven back."    To think about what others are unwilling to think about and  to say what others dare not say is one of the signs of maturity  of the new generation of Chinese intellectuals. In this report  on the national conditions, we look at the worst possibility and  sound a warning about the worst possible result: If we fail to  check the ever-deteriorating corruption tendencies, the  Communist Party may break down, not because of external factors,  but because of an internal factor, namely, institutional  corruption, thus once again terminating China's modernization  process. As China's scientists, we do not wish to become  successful prophets and are willing to make unremitting and  painstaking efforts to stop this worst possibility from coming  true.    We wrote this report with heavy hearts. Being concerned  about the country and the people is the nature of Chinese  intellectuals. As early as over 2,000 years ago, Confucius said:  "Scholars are bent on the Great Way." His disciple Zeng Can  developed and enhanced this idea of his, saying: "A scholar  cannot be without breadth of vision and vigorous endurance. His  burden is heavy and his course long. Perfect virtue is the  burden which he considers it is his to sustain -- is it not  heavy?! Only with death does his course stop -- is it not  long?!" We are fully aware of the arduousness of our mission  and the length of our course but, we have no choice! The  challenge facing the Chinese nation is extremely grim and the  development opportunity we have is almost the last one and there  is only one way out left for us. Seeking development through  reforms and ensuring the success of reforms by combating  corruption is the road that China must take in its effort to  become a strong nation in the world.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DARKNESS OF THE DAMNED;  </P> <P> THE DEMON BY HUBERT SELBY JR. (MARION BOYARS: $19.95; 312 PP.);  </P> <P> THE ROOM BY HUBERT SELBY JR. (MARION BOYARS: $19.95; 288 PP.)  </P> <P> Hung up in echoing patterns of obsession, novelist Hubert Selby's heroes are  forever trying to beat the system but find themselves doomed to a loser's  world. Driven to escape a fatal confinement in material hells of New York City  and in complex hells of Being, they mount violent, dark revolts, but are  continually pulled back into the damned condition from which they started --  discovering, like Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, that "where we are is hell, / And  where hell is we must ever be."  </P> <P> In Selby's world of urban lost souls, individual identity is as much beside the  point as it is for John Bunyan's "Everyman" or Samuel Beckett's "Unnameable."  Suffering through endless "routines" of abjection as ultimate proof of the  humility of a dehumanized humanity's humility before a nonexistent God, his  protagonists drift in a fluid, hallucinatory haze of drive and phobia, lust and  revulsion, sin and retribution, necessary crime and inevitable punishment.  </P> <P> Headlong, stark and arresting, Selby's books have the energy, intensity and  pain of alienated singular vision and an inexorable momentum of horror that is  at once hypnotic and almost too much to bear.  </P> <P> Selby is a self-taught writer who went from P.S. 102 in Brooklyn to the  Merchant Marine to a long literary apprenticeship, working at odd jobs while  moonlighting as a storyteller. His first book, "Last Exit to Brooklyn," won  some fame -- and, due to its raw content, more notoriety -- in the mid-1960s.  </P> <P> His three novels of the following decade -- "The Room" and "The Demon" (first  published in 1971 and 1976, respectively) as well as "Requiem for a Dream" --  undeservedly received far less notice. Since then, he has published only one  book, "The Song of the Silent Snow," a collection of short stories to which  readers may wish to turn to find early rehearsals of the two novels here under  review.  </P> <P> In a significant sense, Selby's entire work comprises one overlapping tale,  with interchangeable settings and a single central figure who, when given a  name at all, always is called Harry. In "Last Exit," he is Harry Black, a union  shop steward. In "The Demon," an almost perfect novel that may well be the  writer's finest achievement, he is Harry White.  </P> <P> White is an ambitious, upwardly mobile young corporate executive with the sex  drive of a satyr, the inner tension of a tightly coiled spring and a  sleepwalker's lack of self-knowledge. The latter deficiency, a tragic constant  in Selby's scheme of the doomed, triggers a geometric progression toward  despair whose finely calibrated gradations the novelist charts with terrifying,  Dantesque precision. Harry may not know it, but each step in his climb up the  success ladder, and each mechanical surrender to "the demon that was welling up  inside him," adds to the burden of inarticulate grief, guilt and shame that  will become his downfall. And the higher he climbs, the steeper will be his  vertiginous tumble into the inferno.  </P> <P> For Harry White, an automaton-like pursuit of sexual release with woman after  woman is the only way of appeasing the inner demon. Sex for Harry is not  passion but a convulsive compulsion, a wallowing in defilement that defers but  does not remove a crushing weight of meaninglessness in his life. Each new  conquest brings temporary relief that soon yields in turn to new cycles of  tension, self-conflict and pain. An "ideal" marriage to a beautiful, loving  wife, an executive vice presidency of his firm, a luxurious home in the  suburbs, all the trappings of fortune are but fuel to Harry's insatiable demon.  </P> <P> When the fall comes, Harry at first does a good job of concealment. A crack-up  episode over lunch at the Banker's Club leads to a hospital visit, where, to  his secret dismay, the doctors are able to find no physical explanation of his  erratic behavior -- "no tumor. . . . Nothing. Just him." But soon his "night  visits to hell" are becoming more and more desperate, his battles with the  demon less and less successful. He turns from casual sex to petty theft to  gratuitous murder, eventually finding himself immersed beyond all extrication  in "the huge cesspool that he felt he was, and could not get away from."  </P> <P> With Selby's careful prose taking on the accelerating force of catastrophe,  Harry meets his fate in scenes of orgiastic violence and sacrificial  self-immolation, an Easter Sunday murder of the Cardinal of New York on the  altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral followed by a final suicidal plunge into the  vortex of oblivion.  </P> <P> Harry White's spasmodic attempt to penetrate the void of being, to force  meaning out of the pointlessness of his life, brings him to self-revelation at  last. As he dies, all the evasion and avoidance and "games" now swept away, he  finds "the truth of his life suddenly thrust in front of him," his timetables  of success obliterated in a timelessness of vision.  </P> <P> It is out of a like timelessness that Selby's companion novel, "The Room,"  begins. A nameless prisoner, charged with a crime he may or may not have  committed, speaks to us from his confinement in the remand cell where he is  being held pending trial. His telling-over of the repetitive minutiae of  abjection, his reveries exposing the repressed traumas of his childhood, the  sexual warpings and stuntings of his adolescence, and his violent, imaginary  revenges against his captors, make up a canticle of pain that reiterates the  central truth of Selby's dark vision: The interior hell and its torments are at  once the supreme proof of cosmic justice and of the absence of mercy from the  world.  </P> <P> In Dante's medieval conception, hell was located at the Earth's core, and thus  farthest from the sun, stars and planets by which human time is told. For  Selby's incarcerated hero, similarly, there is no time, only the unendurable  weight of being -- "it just seems to drag and drag and weigh a ton. And hang on  you like a monkey. Like it's going to suck the blood out of you. Or suck your  guts out. . . ."  </P> <P> Selby is a seeker after the quality of mercy in an age ruled by the indifferent  mechanics of quantity, a writer whose books defiantly refuse any such easy  accommodation with the social order as is implied in the work of, say, John  Updike; as Amiri Baraka once suggested, Selby's pages are populated by  "Americans no character in a John Updike novel would be happy to meet."  </P> <P> At a time when the most successful fiction is that which provides reassuring  distraction from the difficult truths of existence, it is easy to see how the  acute and agonized moral vision of a writer like Selby may go ignored by -- as  culture critic Theodor Adorno once put it -- "those who would like to sleep  through the deluge that threatens them." Selby's works unleash the darkness of  the deluge.  </P></p>

It circulated a statement which said that the Ukrainian  Defence Ministry and the Ukrainian Navy had been put before the  accomplished fact. No one had informed them in advance about  the planned exercise.    The statement pointed out as well that prior to the official  announcement of the beginning of the exercise coastal guard  units of the Black Sea Fleet had been put on a high combat alert  and an exercise had been held on loading the hardware on landing  boats.    Such actions on the eve of presidential elections in the  Crimea may heighten tension in the region and create conditions  for all kinds of provocations which, of course, is  impermissible. Since during the transitional period the Black  Sea Fleet belongs simultaneously to the two countries, Ukraine  and Russia, the mutual informing of the Black Sea Fleet and the  Ukrainian Navy of the exercises, training, as well as the  movement of personnel and armaments connected with them, is in  line with the fraternal atmosphere, good neighbourly relations  and the consolidation of trust and mutual understanding, the  statement said.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Reassurance on video games Video games carry only a small chance of triggering epileptic fits, a study ordered by the Department of Trade and Industry's Consumer Safety Unit said yesterday. People who suffer a first fit while playing games usually have an unrecognised sensitivity to flashing light, said the report. Watching games would 'very rarely' spark an epileptic seizure in people without a history of the condition.</p>

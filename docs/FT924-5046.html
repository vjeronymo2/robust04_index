			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Swiss equities uneasily calm before EEA vote - Ian Rodger assesses the possible impact of a 'yes' or 'no' to closer ties with the European Community The Swiss stock market has entered a period of uneasy calm ahead of the national referendum next month on the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty. The campaign in the run-up to this vote has been the most passionate seen in Switzerland since a plebiscite on foreign residents in the early 1970s. Opinion polls show an extraordinarily large proportion of Swiss - 20 per cent - still undecided about whether to make this large leap towards closer economic integration with the European Community (EC). The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) oscillated from a low for the year of 1,053 at the end of August to more than 1,150 in early November before contracting the EEA blues which brought it lower, and kept it down last week before it recovered 12.9 yesterday to close at 1,138.7. This leaves it still 8.2 per cent up on the year. As might be expected, the SMI index of leading shares has diverged from the overall market plan as investors have taken refuge in the blue-chip issues. At its closing level yesterday of 1,914.6, it is up about about 12 per cent since late August. Analysts agree that, barring further large external shocks, the EEA issue will dominate the market until the December 6 vote. The outcome is of critical importance to many quoted Swiss companies. If the treaty is accepted, export-oriented machinery makers such as the machine tool maker, George Fischer, and the lifts producer, Schindler, will benefit, while hitherto protected domestic retailers and breweries will suffer from increased competition. If the treaty is rejected, the patterns will reverse. For the big banks and multinational industrial companies, such as Nestle, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Ciba Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, the consensus view - encouraged by these organisations themselves - is that the impact of the vote will be negligible. This is because they are already well-established in the EC through subsidiaries and factories and depend to a very small or, in the case of the banks, a diminishing extent on the Swiss market for their earnings. The market would prefer a 'yes' vote, because it is felt that a rejection would further dampen an already weak economy. Many economists believe that a 'yes' vote would add about 4 to 6 per cent to Swiss GDP over the next two years. Thus, when opinion polls last week indicated that the anti-EEA view was gaining ground, the market fell. Mr Mirko Sangiorgio of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich believes that the market has still not entirely discounted the likelihood (in his view) of a negative outcome. 'Not all participants have discounted a 'no', especially those from abroad, so I believe that the market could be surprised if there is a rejection, and could decline by about 4 per cent,' he says. Mr Stephan Meier, head of Swiss equity investment research at Swiss Bank Corporation, agrees. 'If 20 per cent of the people have not decided on the outcome, how can the market be expected to decide?' he asks. The anticipation of a negative result can already be seen in the recent performance of some key shares. Ascom, the telecommunications group which is pushing aggressively into EC markets, has plunged from SFr1,260 at the beginning of November to SFr1,090. Schindler bearers have fallen from SFr3,020 to SFr2,870 over the same period. SBC has analysed 60 companies which make up 90 per cent of the Swiss market's capitalisation and has concluded that earnings of 40 of them would decline in the event of a negative vote. Put another way, their average profit growth next year would drop from 20 per cent to 16 per cent. Still, the main negative effects would be in the longer term, Mr Meier argues, as many Swiss companies would lose their competitiveness in Europe. As for the stock market, he fears that there would be a loss of confidence by foreign investors in all but the top Swiss stocks, and he recommends that investors use derivatives, such as puts on the SMI, to safeguard their positions during this uncertain period. Once the EEA vote is out of the way, analysts believe that investors' attention will once again focus on fundamentals, and there is not much optimism on that front either. Earnings reports this week from Nestle and ABB have indicated that times are getting tougher. 'They were not bad, but they were worse than expected,' says Mr Wolfgang Strub, an analyst at Swiss Volksbank. Mr Sangiorgio agrees. 'Our adjustments to earnings estimates are all on the downside these days, and that process is not finished,' he predicts. Baer has just revised down its forecast for Swiss GDP for next year, now anticipating a decline of 0.4 per cent instead of a flat result. The only support for the market will come from declining interest rates and inflation, Mr Sangiorgio says.</p>

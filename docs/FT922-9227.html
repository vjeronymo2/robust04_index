			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Exxon executive 'held by ecological militants' A MILITANT environmental group, the Rainbow Warriors, has claimed it is holding Mr Sidney Reso, head of Exxon's international division, according to a New York press report yesterday. There was no official confirmation of the report but US law enforcement officers are investigating claims that a series of ransom messages has been received about Mr Reso, who disappeared on the morning of April 29 while going to work in New Jersey. His car was found at the end of his driveway, with the engine running and the door ajar. Mr Michael Murphy, the New Jersey prosecutor working with the FBI on the case, last night said it would be 'inappropriate' to discuss the report of an unverified communication from alleged kidnappers. He said that, without a photograph or voice recording, he could not conclude that Mr Reso was held by any group. A spokesman for Exxon, said it had 'no new information.' The company is seen as a prime enemy of militant environmentalists, who accuse the company of arrogance over the oil spill disaster caused by the Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska in 1989. Rainbow Warrior was a protest ship owned by the Greenpeace environmental group. It was sunk by French secret service saboteurs in 1985.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "New Law Against Unfair Trade Is Being </F> Weighed"]    [Text] China is considering drafting a new law against  trade monopolies.    Such a law could help the government in shifting the country  away from a centrally planned economy, said an official with the  State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce.    China already has a law against unfair competition, which  took effect in December, but the government acknowledges that it  is not strong enough to suppress monopolistic practices, said Ma  Yanling, an official of the administration's Economic Checking  Department.    China's drive to build a market oriented economic system  requires a legal structure to plug loopholes that allow fake  products, false advertising, giveaway sales and contract  kickbacks, she added.    The expected law against monopolistic practices is also in  step with the country's efforts to restructure its business  system to conform with fair-trade rules set down by the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which it hopes to rejoin.    The government intends the new law to ban regional  restrictive business practices and unfair restraint of trade by  public utilities such as cooking gas and electrical supply  companies.    But, Ma noted, it will be at least another year before such  a  law gets final approval from the National People's Congress  (NPC).    To prepare for drafting the legislation, legal officials are  busily consulting foreign experts, especially those in developed  countries.    Chinese efforts to draw on foreign experience and insight  regarding laws against unfair competition were spotlighted by  two major international seminars last month in Shanghai and  Shenzhen.    The United Nations' Conference on Trade and Development  (UNCTD) and the State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce  jointly sponsored the seminars with more than 150 participants  from Chinese and foreign agencies.    They were intended to provide an opportunity for Chinese  legal officials to exchange their experiences on the  implementation of the anti-unfair competition law.    They also were expected to help Chinese officials learn from  foreign experiences in preparation for drafting the law against  monopolies, said Wang Zhifang, another official with the State  Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce.    Besides the United Nations officials, German and British  officials also participated in the seminars, which were the  first international meetings of their kind jointly sponsored by  the UN and the administration.    Gan Guoping, Vice-Minister of the State Administration for  Industry and Commerce, told the meetings that the government was  keen to strengthen co-operation with the UN and foreign legal  officials to tighten restrictions against unfair competitive and  restrictive business practices.    China will carry on the campaign against unfair competition  and will work out new laws banning trade monopolies in its bids  to bring about an orderly transition from central planning to a  socialist market-oriented economy, he added.    Realization of this ambition requires closer co-operation  and  a frequent exchanges with foreign legal institutions, Gan noted.    According to official sources, illegal lotteries to promote  sales, kickbacks in awarding contracts and regional restrictions  on businesses designed to protect local industries are still  widespread in China.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Jordan finds incentive in Middle East peace talks - James Whittington tracks Amman stock market Some of the richest traders on Jordan's stock exchange see themselves as political analysts rather than market specialists. Which perhaps explains why the Amman Financial Market - with 110 listed companies and a capitalisation of JD3.5bn (Dollars 5bn) - often reacts so vigorously to each small step in the Middle East peace process. An economic pact signed between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation earlier this month boosted shares by 3.17 per cent in one day. The general price index, which had been languishing at around 158 throughout December, shot up to 170.67 on the day after the agreement was signed, while the value of trade was up to JD10.7m from a JD2m average a month earlier. Admittedly, the market dropped by around 8 points when the local press pointed out the agreement meant very little in real terms. Within a few days, the self-appointed analysts cashed in their winnings and the price index jolted down to 164, where it has remained. Yesterday the index closed at 164.46. Such knee-jerk trading gives a taste of the year ahead. The bourse will have plenty of politics to chew over as the Middle East peace process creeps slowly forward. And it will continue to attract foreign interest as one of the most profitable and well-developed open markets in the region. Buoyed by two successive years of strong real economic growth, sustained government commitment to International Monetary Fund reforms, and high liquidity, the market's index rose by 30 per cent in 1992 and was a further 23 per cent up by the end of last year. Market turnover in 1993 was JD968m, and on the basis of earnings, the overall price/earnings ratio was 21.7. While the government and its agencies hold substantial stakes in many Jordanian companies, notably in tourism and minerals companies, it is nevertheless among the most highly traded markets in the region. Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Consultants in London, a specialist on Middle East markets, reckons that at least half of total issued stock is tradeable, which is far higher than the regional average. As important, in Mr Morland's view, is the degree of local participation: he estimates there are around 100,000 players. 'It has a broad domestic investor base and is thought of as a natural home for savings,' he says. Such buoyancy is attracting considerable outside interest. Official figures show at least 15 per cent of the market is non-Jordanian, mostly in the hands of Gulf Arabs. Only 2 to 3 per cent is judged to be held by non-Arabs. But this should change as more western investors turn their attention to the Middle East in light of last year's success on other regional emerging markets. Ten leading institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Baring Securities and Citicorp, recently won approval to trade on the Amman Financial Market and, according to Mr Dan Smaller of Lehman Brothers, the market can expect 'substantial' inward investment during 1994. 'The peace process has taken away a big risk. Even if the details of peace take time to negotiate, the breakthrough has removed a big obstacle,' he says, adding that he expects Lehman to commit up to Dollars 25m to the market during the first quarter of this year. Non-Arab foreign investors must obtain approval from the prime minister's office in Amman before trading. Local brokers say this takes a matter of weeks, although it has been known to take months because of the kingdom's vague investment law and objections from the previous parliament over foreign ownership of local companies. But this should change in 1994. Mr Umayya Toukan, the director general of Jordan's bourse, says amendments to the law will explicitly encourage foreign investment in the market and the new parliament will be more favourable to this than its predecessor. The standard restriction for non-Jordanians is that foreigners are not allowed to own more than 49 per cent of most businesses. But capital and dividends can be easily repatriated as long as foreign currency brought in was declared for original investment. While relatively high gains can be made on Jordan's desert bourse, it is not for the faint-hearted. Not only is there a dearth of information on listed companies, but trading arrangements badly need updating: a new and computerised building is planned to replace the present souk-like trading floor.</p>

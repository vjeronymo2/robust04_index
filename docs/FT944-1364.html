			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Berlusconi hit by ministers' threat to resign The Italian government was further undermined yesterday by the prospect of ministers from the populist Northern League resigning in advance of tomorrow's no-confidence vote in parliament. At least three of the five League ministers said they preferred to resign their portfolios before voting against the right-wing coalition of which they formed part. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the finance minister, went further and became the first minister to criticise openly Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, by claiming 'he lacked the ability to run the government'. But Mr Berlusconi still received support yesterday - albeit lukewarm - from Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and the most influential League figure in the cabinet. Within the movement, backers of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, were gathering signatures from deputies to check those willing to vote against the government. Another group was collecting the names of those among the 105 deputies who would either abstain or vote for Mr Berlusconi. Mr Bossi has tested the loyalty of a sizeable number of deputies by turning towards the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) as a potential ally. Others are concerned that since their election was due to strong backing from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, they cannot easily break this link without betraying the electorate. However, the League is aware that the government has little chance of survival and that all options should be held open. Apart from Mr Pagliarini, the two other ministers willing to resign are Mr Francesco Speroni, in charge of institutional reform, and Mr Vito Gnutti, industry minister. Mr Pagliarini justified his support for Mr Bossi by saying the government had failed to fulfil its objectives and that he had been left to operate in a vacuum. The stance of the League will be crucial for the eight-month-old government in the three no-confidence motions due to be debated on consecutive days from tomorrow. Mr Bossi needs about 50 deputies to remain loyal to ensure the downfall of the government. He has sponsored one no-confidence motion in tandem with the Popular party (PPI) of Mr Rocco Buttiglione as part of what he says is a new Liberal Democrat axis. Tension will heighten as the government and opposition seek to drum up support and organise street demonstrations. The financial markets registered their concern over the increasing instability by forcing the lira to fall close to yet another psychological barrier - L1,050 to the D-Mark.</p>

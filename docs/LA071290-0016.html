Alan Goddu, 39, told police that two men had threatened him with the gun, then  driven away. While he tried to get the license number, the men fired four shots  at him, said Detective Carlos Garcia of the Metro Arson Strike Team, which was  brought in because of the explosives found.  </P> <P> No one was hurt, and police are not sure of the motive for the shooting.  </P> <P> About two hours later, San Diego Police Officers Bob Lopez and Paul Peregud saw  the car on Moraga Drive in Clairemont and pulled it over at Idlewild Way,  Garcia said.  </P> <P> A search of the car turned up a .45-caliber handgun, a .25-caliber handgun, a  small homemade bomb, a homemade pipe bomb, an AK-47 rifle, a hand-held  spotlight and a small quantity of a substance believed to be methamphetamine,  Garcia said. All the firearms were loaded.  </P> <P> Garcia said he doesn't know why the pair were carrying so many weapons.  </P> <P> According to a spokeswoman at the jail, Latil and Blake are both being held on  suspicion of assault with a gun, possession of a destructive device and  transportation of a destructive device.  </P> <P> They are also being held on suspicion of selling a destructive device, carrying  a loaded gun, carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle without a license,  possessing a controlled substance, being under the influence of a controlled  substance and threatening a person with a firearm.  </P> <P> Latil is also being held on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs.  </P></p>

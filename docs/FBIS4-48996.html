			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "BOC to Help Stabilize HK Market"] </F>   [Text] When the Bank of China issues HK dollars next  month, it will be looking more toward the region's stability  than economic gain, according to a senior bank official.    The bank's power to stabilize the local financial market  will  be enhanced with the note-issuance, Wang Qiren, Chairman of BOC,  said on Thursday [28 April].    He said it will also increase Hong Kong's status as an  international financial centre and ensure the region's smooth  transition back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.    Note-issuing banks will not bring any economic benefits to  BOC under the current system, he said.    BOC will issue HK dollars on Monday after 20 months of  preparation.    For every HK$7.80 [Hong Kong dollars] issued, BOC must match  that by depositing $1 into the Hong Kong government's exchange  fund.    A total of HK$3 billion ($384.6 million) will be issued this  year, representing about 4 percent of the total HK notes  currently in circulation.    BOC will have to bear the cost of issuing notes and the risk  in the fluctuation of foreign exchange.    Wang said his bank has played an active role in ensuring the  smooth operation of Hong Kong's financial system in the past few  years by cooperating with the region's government.    "Participation in the notes issuance means our social  responsibility has been enhanced," Wang said.    He said his bank will continue to conduct its business  strictly in accordance with Hong Kong's financial laws He said  that the Bank of China's relationship with local counterparts  will not be changed by the note issue.    Wang said his bank will continue to support Hong Kong and  Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank as the  main note issuers.    BOC is willing to cooperate with the other two banks and all  other associates to contribute to the financial stability and  development of Hong Kong, he said.    It has gained a firm foothold in the region and the BOC  Group  in Hong Kong is its largest overseas operation, as well as the  second- largest banking group in Hong Kong.    Wang said the group has been supplying high quality service  for local residents and firms with an objective of "taking root  in Hong Kong, rendering services in Hong Kong.'    By the end of last year, the group assets value mounted to  HK$700 billion with a network of more than 350 subsidiaries  throughout the island, Kowloon and the New Territories.    The group's savings and credits have risen by 30 and 46  times  respectively since 1978.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Final part of interview" with Lieutenant Colonel (Octavio </F> Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of Interior Office by  police reporter Alemany; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Alemany] The controls established to prevent the  theft of agricultural products during the first months of 1994  will be maintained until the end of the 1994 harvest and even  after that in order to eradicate all possible channels for  illegally supplying the underground market with agricultural  products and allowing the so-called profiteers [macetas] to get  rich.    [(Geronez)] We plan to keep an ensemble of measures after  the  conclusion of this campaign. The first thing we are going to do  is work at the current level of intensity throughout the time  the harvest is taking place. The harvest is to last until the  end of April, more or less, possibly through the first days of  May. After that, we plan to keep up a certain level of  harassment, with checkpoints on the main roads linking our  province with the City of Havana and also at certain points  linking Pinar del Rio Province -- necessarily passing through  our province -- with the City of Havana. A large quantity of  products comes from Pinar del Rio and these products need to be  protected until they reach the product-concentrating market  [mercado concentrador] and, finally, the local produce market  [placita].    [Alemany] According to Lt. Col. (Geronez) of the Havana  Province Ministry of Interior [Minint] Office, all the forces  responsible for agricultural products' reaching the cold-storage  facilities and the wholesale and retail produce markets for  equitable distribution among the population will thoroughly  carry out their mission to guarantee that the population is  supplied with foodstuffs.    [(Geronez)] We comrades absorbed in this task, in this  harvest, are working meticulously and arduously so that our  population can feel secure, can trust that the products  earmarked for cold-storage facilities will go there; and that  those earmarked for the product-concentrating markets for direct  consumption by the population will arrive and reach the people.    It is important for all the products earmarked for  cold-storage facilities to arrive and be stored because that is  what is going to permit the systematic provisioning of the  population with an entire series of products throughout the  year, products that are going to be in short supply because they  will be out of season, in short supply from the point of view of  agricultural production, I mean. Because we think that the  quantities being put into cold storage can guarantee a certain  level of supply.    [Alemany] Lastly, Lt. Col. (Geronez) said Havana Province's  Minint forces will always fulfill their duty of preventing  unscrupulous or criminal individuals from continuing to affect  the security and tranquility of the citizenry.    [(Geronez)] It is truly a commitment of ours, all us Minint  comrades, all our institution's officers corps, troops, and  auxiliaries, to have those products reach the population, have  those products contribute to alleviating our country's food  situation. And we are going to work, struggle, make the greatest  effort so that our people will feel satisfaction with all the  work we are doing.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among other issues, OPIC's annual public hearing has, in previous years, provided a forum for testimony concerning section 231A(a) of the Act. This section provides that OPIC may operate its programs only in those countries that are determined to be ``taking steps to adopt and implement laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights to workers in that country (including any designated zone in that country).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on consultations with Congress, OPIC complies with annual determinations made by the Executive Branch with respect to worker rights for countries that are eligible for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Any country for which GSP eligibility is revoked on account of its failure to take steps to adopt and implement internationally recognized worker rights is subject concurrently to the suspension of OPIC programs until such time as a favorable worker rights determination can be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For non-GSP countries in which OPIC operates its programs, OPIC has agreed to provide a worker rights report to the Congress for any country which is the subject of a formal challenge at its annual public hearing. To qualify as a formal challenge, testimony must pertain directly to the worker rights requirements of the law as defined in OPIC's 1985 reauthorizing legislation (Pub. L. 99&hyph;204) with reference to the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and be supported by factual information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEARING CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Harvey A.

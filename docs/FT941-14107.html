			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Time Warner in anti-takeover move Time Warner, the US media group in which Canada's Seagram drinks company has built up an 11 per cent stake, announced yesterday it was introducing a poison pill anti-takeover device which will prevent any investor buying more than 15 per cent of its stock. Seagram, which is controlled by the Bronfman family and began buying Time Warner stock last summer, has announced plans to buy up to 15 per cent of the company's shares for investment purposes. Time Warner is apparently concerned that Seagram's stake could turn out to be unfriendly, though the company yesterday sought to portray the poison pill as a general response to the takeover wave sweeping the US media industry. Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, said yesterday's action 'in no way interferes with Seagram's stated objective to acquire up to 15 per cent of Time Warner's stock as a friendly and supportive investor'. Seagram said the move did not appear to interfere with its objectives but added it did not believe poison pills were in the best interests of shareholders, since they could interfere with choice and adversely affect values. The drinks company has no large interests in the entertainment business but Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, its young president, has dabbled in film production and has expressed enthusiasm for the media industry. Time Warner said it had developed the pill following concern from several institutional investors and the group's strategic partners. Its partners include US West, the Baby Bell regional telephone company, and Japanese companies Toshiba and Itochu, each of which owns a stake in the group's cable and entertainment operations. Time Warner said the pill, known formally as a shareholder rights plan, would not preclude a bona-fide all-cash offer for the company which treated all shareholders equally. It was designed to protect against 'abusive takeover tactics, including acquisition of control without paying all shareholders a fair premium'. The scheme is triggered if an investor buys more than 15 per cent of the company's stock. That gives all shareholders - apart from the 15 per cent investor - the right to buy stock at a large discount.</p>

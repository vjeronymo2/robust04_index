			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Charged with a gentle closing of the door: The minister who has to reverse Italy's open immigration policy MARGHERITA Boniver, Italy's new immigration minister, knows she has a tough job ahead. In the past two years, immigration has become one of the country's most sensitive political issues. Moreover, her ministry, which is one of the few innovations to come out of the government crisis last month, has no independent budget and has yet to move into new premises. Even when it is functioning, it will have only 35-40 staff. Yet Mrs Boniver, a Socialist well known for her role in Amnesty International and other human rights causes, seems confident about the unenviable, and seemingly impossible, task of co-ordinating and enforcing the country's landmark immigration law passed in 1990. That followed years of lax supervision and a tradition of tolerance, which made Italy a haven for untold thousands of illegal immigrants, many of them from poor black African states. More recently, Albanians and Yugoslavs have swelled their ranks. However, sentiment towards immigrants has soured sharply as their numbers have increased and the economy has slowed. The upshot has been a tenser atmosphere, in which violent racist incidents have become more commonplace. 'Italy considered itself a non-racist country,' says Mrs Boniver, one of two women ministers in the new government. 'But the Italians woke up startled one day to realise we too have a strain of racism. There is a strain of racism in all societies. The job is to keep that under control'. The trigger in Italy has been the apparently sudden, though unquantified, leap in untrained black immigrants in particular. Few find jobs and most end up on the street or the beach, pedalling trinkets, cigarettes or fake designer goods. Italy having been traditionally a country of emigration, 'the phenomenon of seeing hundreds of thousands of Africans has become very evident for the Italians all of a sudden', she explains. Moreover, the numbers appeared out of control in a country which almost anybody could enter without a permit. Although some control was theoretically exercised by the ministry of the interior, there was 'nothing planned at all', she says. 'And, you know, Italians are not particularly talented in organisation.' How will she cope with the new immigration law steered through parliament by her Socialist colleague Mr Claudio Martelli? 'My first priority is to make the Martelli law work. That is an immense job in itself, as it means co-ordinating about 12 other ministries, including local government, the police, education and social services.' They must join forces to establish the framework for dealing with the 250,000 immigrants who took advantage of the amnesty last year to legalise their status. Next comes the problem of longer-term resettlement, she says. Italian communes have been no more willing to accept Africans and Albanians than the small west German towns were willing to absorb thousands of east Europeans as the Communist system collapsed. Some 800 Albanians have been sent to Mrs Boniver's north Italian constituency of Asti alone, causing immediate problems there, she says. 'You can't expect local elected politicians to take on what is an extremely unpopular task. They keep saying no.' But while shifting responsibility for resettlement to regional, or even national, level may take the heat off local politicians, it will not tackle the root problem. That involves setting further immigration quotas after the freeze during the law's first year of operation, when immigrants taking advantage of the amnesty were legalised and a further 50,000 expelled. Setting next year's quota is 'one of my first priorities', she says. She would like preference to be given to Italy's ex-colonies in Africa and to neighbouring countries such as Albania which have Italian-speaking communities. But she admits that enforcing the country-by-country quotas will be all but impossible given Italy's long coastline, relative proximity to Africa 'and the fact that we are not a police state'. As a result, the number of illegal immigrants, estimated at 300,000 even after the amnesty, is set to grow. The Italians also face the additional threat posed by political instability in neighbouring countries such as Yugoslavia and Albania. Even under the new law, there is no visa requirement with Yugoslavia, which means the door is open to huge inflows in the event of a crisis there. According to Mrs Boniver, setting up the new ministry has already taken part of the sting out of the immigration issue. Giving her responsibility for looking after the interests of Italians abroad will further calm popular sentiment, she thinks. 'If the new ministry had been just for immigration, it would have created a lot of resentment' from people claiming that immigrants were getting some sort of special treatment, she says. So establishing a joint function was 'very astute from a political point of view'. Moreover, the big Italian communities in countries such as Brazil and Argentina, which have traditionally come under the foreign ministry's wing, have not always received enough attention in the past. It will be her job to co-ordinate policies towards them and to improve the flow of information to prevent them feeling 'abandoned'. While she stresses she will give equal weight to both her new responsibilities, it is her domestic task which is likely to be by far the more pressing.</p>

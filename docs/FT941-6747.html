			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Strong growth in exports helps Daewoo lift profits Correction (published 4th March 1994) appeneded to this article. Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, has reported a 56 per cent increase in net profits to Won298bn (Dollars 368m) in 1993 on sales up by 35 per cent to Won27,027bn. The jump in earnings reflected strong exports of cars and electronics as the Korean won fell against the Japanese yen. The group's securities business also had sharply rising profits due to the recovery of the Seoul bourse last year. Daewoo Corporation, the group's trading and construction unit, had a 20 per cent rise in profits to Won48.6bn because of increased shipments of exports. Sales grew by 17 per cent to Won9,534bn. Daewoo Electronics' profits increased by 19 per cent to Won19bn as sales rose by 16 per cent to Won2,000bn, while Daewoo Motors cut its losses to Won60bn from Won90bn in 1992 as exports grew by 80 per cent to 100,000 vehicles. Sales increased by 29 per cent to Won2,200bn. The group's most profitable subsidiary is still Daewoo Shipbuilding, although earnings declined slightly to Won200bn from Won211bn in 1992. Last year's flat profit growth reflected sluggish orders received in 1992. However, it recorded the largest number of orders among the world's shipbuilders last year, indicating that earnings will increase in 1994. Sales were unchanged at Won1,554bn. Daewoo Heavy Industries, a machinery producer, reported a 59 per cent increase in profits to Won16.7bn, although sales declined by 2 per cent to Won882bn. Daewoo Shipbuilding and Daewoo Heavy Industries are scheduled to merge this year. Daewoo Telecom had a profit rise of 11 per cent to Won7.3bn on 24 per cent higher sales of Won473bn. Orion Electric reported earnings down by 38 per cent to Won8.2bn as sales rose by 18 per cent to Won477bn. Daewoo Securities had the biggest profit rise among the group's main businesses, with earnings growing by 64 per cent to Won80bn. Sales increased by 16 per cent to Won440bn. CORRECTION Daewoo's group profits for 1993 were Won464bn and not Won298bn as stated in Tuesday's edition.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Sport: Adding some polish to Woosnam's game - Golf AS initiation ceremonies go, it didn't match the Freemasons'. There was no rolled-up trouser leg or bared chest and blood was not drawn. The passing of this flame took place when Ian Woosnam slowly pulled the gold watch from his left wrist and handed it over in complete silence. Woosnam's watch was received with all the reverence due to an object that might have cost its owner several thousand pounds had he bought it. The recipient slipped the chunk of gold on his right wrist. This man, who now wore a watch on each wrist, had been a writer a moment earlier. Now, for better or worse, and certainly for nothing, I was a caddie. This had not been anticipated but you do not ignore the opportunity to caddie for the 1991 US Masters' champion, and a leading contender in this week's Open. To be allowed to carry Woosnam's bag around Valderrama during last Sunday's skins' game, and thus run an eye over his game at close quarters was a bit like being given the chance to ride a favourite in the Grand National four days before the off. 'Keep up, shut up and clean up,' was one piece of advice that was passed on to this would-be caddie. Others included: 'stay sober,' and 'speak only when you're spoken to.' The most ominous, however, was 'watch out for the bricks'. It was a reference to a practical joke Nick Faldo played on a hapless writer fulfilling the same role for Faldo as I was for Woosnam. The journalist took 12 holes before he discovered the extra items in the bag. Woosnam's bag contained no such hazards. If not quite as spare as a butcher's pencil, it was lightly laden. It was 80 in the shade there was no need for an umbrella or rain clothes. Water was provided on each tee so there was no need for us to carry our own. He had ten new gloves still crinkling in their Cellophane, dozens of green pencils with rubbers on the one end and 15 balls some of which I marked with a pencil dot scored into the balata covering directly above and beneath the number. And a nearly empty packet of cigarettes, two lighters and some mild pain killers. The first crisis came early. Our opening drive finished a few inches ahead of Fred Couples's. Woosnam stared at the green. 'What've we got, John?'. I reached in to my pocket and pulled out the yardage chart we had been given on the first tee. It consisted of a drawing of the hole, on which were arrows. Some pointed to the green, others to the tee. There were numbers alongside each arrow, 145 and 159. Working that out was straightforward even for someone who did not trouble the examiners at maths O level. One was the distance in yards, the other in metres. 'Is that to the flag or the front?' Woosnam asked. At this moment a TV camera homed in on us, beaming our image to hundreds of thousands of viewers in South Africa. A microphone was poised to record our conversation. Suddenly, a sense of panic descended and the life of a journalist seemed to have regained much of its appeal. 'And where's it from?' continued Woosnam. I did what any self respecting journalist would have done in the circumstances. I hummed and hawed. I dithered. Relief was at hand. 'I don't get this,' said Couples, a frown on his face. He turned to the master of ceremonies, a quintessential Englishman dressed in shorts, who replied: 'It's in metres to the front of the green.' Woosnam heard this. The pressure was off. Thereafter, Woosnam had the measure of his caddie. On each green he would pick up his ball and toss it to me and I would rub it fiercely in the wet towel I carried until the ball gleamed brighter than a town hall door knob. I gave him a new ball every three holes. We tried to co-ordinate our views about the line of a putt but when I said left lip and he said it was an inch to the right then it became clear that we were as far apart on the same issue as John Major and Neil Kinnock. My main worry was not to get in his way - or anybody else's. I had to clean Woosnam's ball, place his bag so that it didn't impede the cameras, make sure I did not walk on any other player's line, keep his clubs in the right section of his voluminous bag. It was a job to keep up, what with 40 lbs slung across my shoulder. As I trudged to the fourth tee, I felt a club being replaced firmly in my bag. 'Better not lose a club, mate' said Greg Norman cheerfully. In first round of the Open on Thursday, Woosnam scored an excellent 65. I knew he was running in to form last Sunday when he accepted my daft advice to take a driver on the eighth at Valderrama, a hole much more suited to a one iron. So if success comes his way at Muirfield tomorrow it can be said we began it last Sunday. If it doesn't, he will have thrown it all away.</p>

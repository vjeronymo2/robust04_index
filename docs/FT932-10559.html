			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: UN declares 'safe areas' THE United Nations Security Council took steps last night to give UN protection to Sarajevo and several other Moslem towns under siege in Bosnia. It decided unanimously to declare the Bosnian capital, together with Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac and Tuzla, 'safe areas' which would be patrolled by UN troops. Srebrenica already has similar protection from Canadian UN forces. The UN resolution called for encircling Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw to a point where they no longer threaten the Moslem enclaves. The vote came after the UN met for urgent consultations in an atmosphere of deepening crisis, following the Bosnian Serb assembly's refusal to endorse the international peace plan for the war-torn republic. Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate, called the resolution a palliative and warned the Bosnian Serbs of 'new stronger and tougher measures' if they continued their intransigence. The coming days would determine whether the US and the rest of the international community decided that the use of force became inevitable, she said. Third world countries which sponsored the resolution made it clear the measure would be inadequate in itself. There were again calls for what one delegate termed 'surgical military intervention' by an international force. Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, who led a Security Council mission to Bosnia last month, speaking in his role as the non-aligned members' spokesman, called the safe areas proposal symbolic and a minimal response to developments. 'These new elements should force the international community to act in a much more affirmative way,' he said. The use of force was 'looming' because the inadequacy of past UN measures had only encouraged Serbian intransigence. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, and the US were in sharp disagreement last night over who should control an expanded UN military operation that might eventually be authorised by the Council. In a working paper for members, he insisted that political and strategic direction must come from the UN through himself. Washington is demanding that Nato be in command. Russia is willing to provide troops but supports Mr Boutros Ghali on the issue of UN control. France also wants a UN-directed force, not simply one with UN blessing. The working paper calls for up to 70,000 troops, at least 20,000 of whom would be Americans, for the largest ever UN military operation.</p>

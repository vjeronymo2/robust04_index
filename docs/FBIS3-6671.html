Today our People's Army has grown up strong to be the  party's  ever-victorious, invincible Army, which firmly guarantees the  chuche revolutionary cause, the socialist cause, with force of  arms under the excellent and tested leadership of the supreme  commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA] Comrade Kim  Chong-il, a great commander.    With his deep insight into the significance and importance  of  the work of firmly preparing soldiers politically,  ideologically, militarily, and technologically, our supreme  commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has thoroughly mastered the  great leader's [suryong] ideology and theory on army building  and is constantly developing and enriching them, has extensively  elucidated the theoretical and practical problems arising in  fostering them into the party's fighters and wisely led them.    On 25 August, 1960 -- which is still fresh in our memory --  our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il visited a tank unit.  That day, discovering the slogan "Let us defend with our lives  the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-song"  placed on the top of the gate of the soldiers' hall in the unit,  Comrade Kim Chong-il said with emotion that this slogan is a  good slogan reflecting the firm and invariable faith of our  people and soldiers of the People's Army and that we should  expedite the final victory of the Korean revolution by upholding  this slogan in the future, too.    Two years later, one day in August 1962, our supreme  commander Comrade Kim Chong-il visited a military camp. There,  he made the significant remarks that the first, the second, and  the third mission and duty of our fighters are to defend the  leader [suryong] with our lives and stressed that the People's  Army is the great leader's [suryong] Army and the Workers  Party's Army. After that, he constantly made a tour of  on-the-spot guidance to various units of different services and  branches of the KPA and brilliantly elucidated and wisely led  the direction and method that the People's Army should advance  at every phase of the developing revolution.    In late April 1981, our supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il personally called responsible functionaries of the  People's Army. That day our supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il scientifically analyzed the deviation as found in the  international communist movement, and taught that we should  inherit and consummate to the end the chuche revolutionary cause  generation after generation under any difficult circumstances.  He then said that to brilliantly inherit and consummate this  cause, it is imperative to firmly guarantee the party's  leadership.    At that moment, the functionaries were wrapped up in solemn  emotion. The party's leadership--this is a fundamental source  and lifeline of the might of our People's Army. Therefore,  apart from the party's leadership, we cannot think about the  existence of the People's Army itself and hope for victories in  all activities.    What suddenly crossed the minds of the officials who are  engraving his words was the days of the wise leadership of our  supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who exerted unremitting  efforts to foster the People's Army into an invincible powerful  Army as today that is endlessly loyal to the party.    It was a New Year's eve of a certain year when the whole  country was stirring with the atmosphere of a holiday. Our  supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il did not even rest on this  New Year's day but called a functionary to give a teaching on  the problems in the work of the People's Army.    On this day, as an Army of the great leader [suryong] and an  Army of the party, the supreme comrade commander made a  programmatic teaching, which will be a guideline in thoroughly  being prepared with its party-type trait and in brilliantly  realizing the cause of modeling the whole Army after the chuche  idea.    Our supreme comrade commander said that the policy on  further  strengthening the People's Army politically and militarily is  the leader's [suryong] program to strengthen the People's Army  as a revolutionary force of the party and his determination, and  also said that in the People's Army, it must be fully filled  with the firm faith of entrusting everything to only the party  and that it knows of no one else but the party. He said that  this is the party-type trait which the People's Army must be  prepared with.    He then warmly emphasized that this can be achieved only  when the party's leadership system is thoroughly established  within the People's Army.    It became late into the night in silence. Our Supreme  Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il is embracing the programmatic  guideline to further strengthen and develop the People's Army  into the party's army. His efforts overflowing with enthusiasm  continued endlessly.    The functionary who deeply bore in his heart the supreme  comrade commander's teaching and who looked up to him, was  infinitely pulsating with the pride and satisfaction of living  and struggling by upholding the leader [yongdoja] of the  revolutionary force who is such a brilliant and great person.    Truly, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il elucidated  the party's great military building program of the working  class, and created a brilliant example in the party military  building through outstanding military ideology, theory, and  unremitting energetic activities. He is a military commander of  the times.    It is not only this. To foster the People's Army into a  party's army, which is possessed with a party-type trait, our  Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il not only provided a  programmatic guideline and fundamental principle in military  building, but he also took an epoch-making measure to thoroughly  implement it. He is also a refined leader [yongdoja] of the  revolutionary force who led the People's Army step by step and  hand in hand.    It was mid-March 1985. On this day, our Supreme Commander  Comrade Kim Chong-il talked with a responsible functionary of  the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces through the telephone  and made an epoch-making measure to further strengthen and  develop the People's Army into a party's Army and embraced him  with great faith. That functionary tried hard to repress his  heart which was burning with passion, and stood for a long time  with the receiver in his hand as if he was stuck.    The historical days when the supreme comrade commander  endlessly exerted all his energy to thoroughly establish the  party's leadership system within the People's Army was once  again warmly rekindled in the mind of the functionary.    One day in late August 1977 our Supreme Commander Comrade  Kim  Chong-il called the functionary and gave a valuable teaching to  him for a long time. Comrade supreme commander told him that the  basic mission of the party organizations and political organs in  the People's Army is to build our People's Army into a powerful  party's Army by firmly establishing the party's unitary  ideological system, that is, the party's leadership system,  within the entire Army. He then stressed that soldiers should  not forget historic lessons and should advance upholding the  banner of modeling the entire Army after the chuche idea in the  People's Army in order to be infinitely loyal to the party's  leadership.    Looking at comrade supreme commander who was continuing the  talk with strong passion the functionary seethed with burning  emotion. The great commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who [word  indistinct] the political [word indistinct] of the People's Army  and who is setting the Army on a firm, immortal track today by  personally leading the party's work in the Army! With what words  can we explain the efforts he has devoted in fostering the  People's Army into the party's army? When the functionary's  heart was seething with such thought the Supreme Commander  Comrade Kim Chong-il told him that it is important to correctly  grasp the principal line in the party's political work in the  People's Army and that the principal line in the party's  political work in the People's Army is to firmly establish the  party's leadership system.    Indeed, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il's  teaching  on that day was precious words which make it possible for  functionaries to clearly know the principal line and core  element in the party's political work in the Army and to  outstandingly perform their mission. The physical and mental  efforts our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has devoted  to strengthen and develop the KPA into an ever-victorious,  invincible party's Army are indeed boundless.    Comrade Kim Kyong-hwan, a KPA officer, says: "The Supreme  Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who earlier elucidated the  mission and duty of the revolutionary armed forces as a profound  principle has thoroughly established the leadership system of  the entire Army in conformity with the inherent nature and  mission of the People's Army and is energetically leading the  struggle to strengthen the People's Army politically and  ideologically. Thanks to the wise leadership of the comrade  supreme commander who set forth the slogan of loyalty, `Let us  fight with life for the great leader [suryong]' and who has led  soldiers not only to strengthen the education in loyalty to the  party and the leader [suryong], but also to accelerate the  revolution our People's Army has been able to firmly adhere to  the revolutionary character as the leader's Army and as the  party's Army and to constantly consummate the party's features  in conformity with the demands of the developing revolution."    Yes, it is indeed so. Our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il's wise leadership was the great (?bloodshot) and the  boundless nourishment which has fostered the People's Army into  an ever-victorious and invincible army which is infinitely loyal  to the party. Thanks to these great (?bloodshot) and infinite  nourishment today our People's Army has been able to grow up to  be a genuine party's Army which is demonstrating its  ever-victorious might.    These ranks of loyalty and ranks of singlehearted unity will  trust and follow forever only our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the great commander, as the party's army and will more  vigorously fight under his leadership for the consummation and  victory of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style  and for the country's reunification.</p>

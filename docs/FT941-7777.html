			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: GKN and Westland strategy talks The chairmen of GKN and Westland met yesterday for the first time since GKN launched its hostile Pounds 497m bid for the helicopter maker a fortnight ago. Sir David Lees asked to meet Mr Alan Jones, his Westland counterpart, to reiterate GKN's strategic reasons for making the bid. Although Mr Jones has urged Westland shareholders to reject GKN's offer, Sir David said they had an amicable discussion during which he reiterated his determination to preserve the Yeovil-based company's management structure and continue with its existing defence projects. 'I told Alan that I was concerned that the process might appear to be hostile. We have no wish for it to be interpreted that way,' he said. There were no signs last night, however, that Mr Jones had altered his opposition to GKN, which announced its bid earlier this month after acquiring an 18.7 per cent stake in Westland from United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters. The acquisition took GKN's holding to 45 per cent and forced it to mount a full bid. Sir David also met a number of MPs whose constituencies border the Westland plant to give reassurances on job cuts and the affects of a takeover.</p>

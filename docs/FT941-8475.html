			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bullers to raise Pounds 2.6m for purchase Bullers, the giftware, fine art and decorative products group, is raising Pounds 2.56m net through a placing and open offer to fund an acquisition. At the same time it is undergoing a capital reorganisation and debt conversion. It is buying Clashfleet, a media services company, for a maximum Pounds 2.8m, to be satisfied in cash and shares. The purchase will form the core of a new media division. Most of Clashfleet is made up of a company operating as Wiseman, which in the year to May 31 1993 incurred losses of Pounds 690,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.3m. It then had negative net worth of Pounds 500,000. Under the capital reorganisation the 1p shares are being split into 0.01p ordinary and 0.99p deferred. The ordinary shares are to be consolidated into 10p shares. The 4.2 per cent cumulative preference shares of Pounds 1 are being consolidated into Pounds 6 shares and split into 13 new ordinary and 470 deferred of 1p. It is the company's intention to cancel the deferred shares and the share premium account leaving the deficit on the profit and loss account at Pounds 1.4m. Under the placing and open offer 26m new shares are being issued at 11p, of which 6.51m will be available to shareholders at a rate of 32 new ordinary for one new ordinary. Part of the cash raised will be used to buy out the leases on equipment operated by Wiseman. The rest of the purchase, involving an initial payment of Pounds 900,000 and a profit related payment to a maximum of Pounds 1.1m, will be satisfied by new ordinary shares. As part of the acquisition Clashfleet is paying Bullers Pounds 703,000 in preference shares for equipment. Marmara Bank, which has advanced Pounds 1.75m, is converting Pounds 398,000 into preference shares and Pounds 989,000 into new ordinary shares. Marmara and Auric, an associate, will have a holding of 20.5 per cent. The companies are appointing three directors to Bullers. Barclays, which is owed Pounds 1.1m, is converting Pounds 600,000 into a medium term loan. Bullers has recently been experiencing considerable difficulty. In the year to June 30 it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds 2.4m with a deficit on net assets of Pounds 1.28m. It is monitoring existing businesses with the intention of disposing of those which cannot be returned to profit. Caverswall, which has incurred significant losses, is being sold for a nominal sum and Michael Sutty, which is not operating satisfactorily, is being considered for disposal or closure.</p>

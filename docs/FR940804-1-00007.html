			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board believes that the proposed exception is consistent with the terms and purposes of section 106, is justified by the competitive environment in which nonbanking subsidiaries generally operate, and is potentially beneficial both to banking organizations and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Consistency With Section 106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By its terms, section 106 applies only when a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bank <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  offers the tying product_that is, when a bank is varying the consideration or conditioning the availability of a product in order to create an incentive for the customer to purchase another product from the bank or an affiliate. This coverage was consistent with the stated purpose of section 106: To prevent banks from using their market power over certain products to gain an unfair competitive advantage in other products. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 16 (1970) (section 106 was ``intended to provide specific statutory assurance that the use of the economic power of a bank will not lead to a lessening of competition or unfair competitive practices''). The proposed exception would apply only when nonbanks are offering the packaged products. Such arrangements are not covered by the terms of section 106; nor do they raise the specific concerns that section 106 was intended to address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Consistency With Regulation Y  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The tying restrictions of section 106 were imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 in conjunction with an extension of new nonbanking powers to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The potential for anticompetitive behavior by such subsidiaries_which were then uncommon_was uncertain pending implementation of the Act, and the Board therefore adopted a prophylactic rule in applying the restrictions of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much has changed, however, since adoption of that rule. Competition in most financial markets has increased substantially since 1971, and through its experience in the supervision of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, the Board has been able to assess the role of nonbanking subsidiaries in those markets. The Board believes that neither bank holding companies nor their nonbanking subsidiaries generally appear to possess sufficient market power in the products that they offer to impair competition. For example, the ``laundry list'' activities in which bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries are permitted to engage are generally conducted in competitive national or regional markets that are characterized by large numbers of actual or potential competitors and low barriers to entry. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In such markets, the potential for a market participant to gain a competitive advantage through tying is substantially reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The ``laundry list'' activities are specified by regulation. See 12 CFR 225.25.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, if the Board's proposal were adopted, ties involving bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries would, as noted, continue to be restricted by the federal antitrust laws (primarily the Clayton and Sherman Acts)_the same restrictions that bind their competitors. In addition, section 106 would continue to restrict tying by banks, and the Board would continue to apply special restrictions to tying by a nonbank when the tied product is offered by an affiliated bank. As a final protection, the Board would retain the authority to terminate or modify any exception that resulted in anticompetitive practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Board is proposing to rescind its special restrictions on tying between nonbanks only where the products are separately available and a discount is being offered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These conditions prevent the conditioning of the availability of one product on the purchase of another and allow consumers to compare prices. The Board recognizes that to the extent that the market for products offered by bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries is competitive, these conditions should not be strictly necessary. The Board seeks comment on whether these conditions should be retained as a precaution against any anti-competitive practices. The Board also seeks comment on a clarification to the requirement of separate availability, applicable to all the regulatory exceptions, that would provide that products must be separately available ``at competitive prices.'' This amendment would clarify that if a product is available outside a package arrangement only at a non-competitive price, it is not truly separately available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Under antitrust law, concerns over tying arrangements are substantially reduced where the buyer is free to take either product by itself, even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Northern Pacific R. Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Unites States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 356 U.S. 1, 6 n.4 (1958).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs of Tying Restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The special tying restrictions imposed on nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies not only appear to be unnecessary to prevent those companies from gaining an unfair competitive advantage, but also place those companies at a competitive disadvantage with other providers of the same products and services. As a result of Regulation Y's current prohibition, a nonbanking company is generally prohibited from offering discounted packages of its own products or discounted packages that include its own products and those of other affiliated nonbanking companies. Their competitors who are not affiliated with banks are not similarly constrained. Several commenters in the Board's recent rulemaking noted that brokerage firms and other nonbank competitors are offering the types of discounts currently prohibited by Regulation Y, which are not generally illegal for purposes of the federal antitrust laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inability of nonbanks in a holding company structure to offer discounts not only diminishes their competitiveness but also deprives their customers of an opportunity to receive discounts. The Board believes that under the proposed rule, customers would be presented with more choices and potentially lower costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Congressional Intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board notes that this proposed treatment of tying by nonbanking subsidiaries is consistent with recent Congressional action in the tying area. In applying anti-tying restrictions to savings associations in the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act, Public Law No. 97&hyph;320, section 331, 96 Stat. 1496, Congress closely paralleled section 106 in applying the restriction only when the tying product was offered by the savings association. An extension of the restrictions to non-savings association affiliates of the type adopted by the Board was neither included by Congress nor subsequently adopted by the Office of Thrift Supervision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

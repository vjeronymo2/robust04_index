			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 17 February carries  within its regular 45-minute newscast several reports on the  combat situation in the republic and in Sarajevo.    According to a correspondent in the operational zone of the  7th South Operational Group, "the chetniks have started fierce  tank and infantry attacks in the Filipovici region. These  attacks have been going on for four days." He also says that in  a "powerful counterattack, the fighters from this region  destroyed yet another tank. Several dozens of chetniks have  been put out of action. A number of infantry and antitank  weapons were captured. This was the 77th enemy tank to have  been destroyed in this region."    Brcko correspondents Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salikovic  report that "continuous shelling of our positions has been going  since this morning. The fiercest attacks are being launched by  the enemy on the area between Omerbegovaca and Vranovaca. The  chetniks are using mortars, of 155-mm and 122-mm howitzers,  tanks, hill guns, portable mortars, and [word indistinct].  Double charge shells are being used increasingly frequently.  The Brcko defense positions have been attacked for the first  time with shells that explode about 10 meters above the ground.  There are indications that this kind of shell was used by the  aggressor for the massacre of civilians at the Sarajevo market  [on 5 February]."    According to a reporter from the Information Service of the  First Army Corps in Sarajevo, the "chetniks are continuing to  violate the cease-fire in some parts of Sarajevo today. This  started early this morning when they targeted NATO aircraft with  illuminating [svetleci] bullets from Nedzarici. Then they fired  mortar shells from Decija Glava and also used portable mortars  to attack Hladivode from Gradina. Chetnik snipers have again  been active, especially from Vraca, and they are using silencers  so citizens are warned to exercise the maximum caution."</p>

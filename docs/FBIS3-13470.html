This morning the Israeli delegation met with 'Arafat and  held  intensive talks with him. Yuri Savir, director general of the  Israeli Foreign Ministry, and General 'Uzi Dayan, head of  planning in the Defense Ministry, took part in the talks as well  as PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh; Abu-Ala'  [Ahmad Quray'], head of the PLO's Economic Department; and Akram  Haniyah, 'Arafat's adviser on the occupied territories affairs.    Following this meeting, the Israeli delegation telephoned  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and briefed him on the  results of the talks with 'Arafat.    The Israeli delegation arrived in Tunisia last night aboard  a  private Israeli plane but the Tunisian authorities refused to  let it land. The delegation then returned to Rome where it  boarded the plane that carried Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator on  the Middle East peace process, from Rome to Tunis.</p>

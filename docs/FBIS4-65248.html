			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] London, May 12 (A.A.) -- A Turkish delegation  headed by Bilgin Unan, Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary,  is holding contacts in London in an effort to find a solution to  the corrosion problem facing the Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline.    Unan said during his meetings with officials from the  British  Foreign Ministry that he was told the British Government would  help Turkey in its economic problems.    "Britain has realized the importance of the issue for  Turkey,  specially economically. British officials have told us `we  shall help the Turkish economy as much as we can,'" he said.    Inan stressed that Turkey is looking for a solution to the  problem that would not violate the UN embargo on Iraq.    "We are asking our allies who are in the UN Security Council  to help us in solving this issue and understanding our problem.  Our trade relations with Iraq have ceased because of the  embargo and our losses following the closure of the pipeline  have already reached 5 billion dollars," he said.    He said his contacts face-to-face with officials of the  British Foreign Ministry were very useful, adding the flushing  operation of the pipeline will allow for 12 million barrels of  oil and the sale of this will bring a modest contribution to  Turkey's economy while it will bring some humanitarian help  products to Iraq.

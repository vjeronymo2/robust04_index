			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Appointments: Brannen to head ILO in London The International Labour Organisation has appointed as director of its London offices Peter Brannen, previously head of international relations at the Department of Employment and a former member of ILO's governing body. Described by colleagues as an unconventional civil servant with 'more time for vision than systems', he is known for his energy and his tendency to end up in the chair of any committee of which he is a member. His main achievement at the employment department was co-ordinating technical assistance to the new governments in central and eastern Europe. Born in County Durham 50 years ago, Brannen tends to become a professional Geordie when abroad, and indeed, at home - staff at the ILO can look forward to his whisky-inspired, 3 am renditions of Keep Your Feet Still Geordie Hinny, a local hymn to drinking. All that remains of his early training as a priest is the joy he gets from repentance - which is matched only by the joy of sinning in the first place. He describes himself as 'in principle a saint but in practice a sinner' - which explains why his vegetarianism is punctuated by the occasional large steak. The ILO, a UN agency which includes employers, unions and governments, has criticised the UK government's industrial relations legislation. Brannen is unlikely to be fazed by this aspect of his new role; he spent much of his time at the employment department trying to reconcile UK policy with ILO aims.</p>

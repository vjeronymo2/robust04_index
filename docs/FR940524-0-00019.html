			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 41. To prevent unjust enrichment by women and minorities trafficking in licenses acquired through the use of bidding credits, we will impose a forfeiture requirement on transfers of such licenses to entities that are not owned by women or minorities. The penalty required will be reimbursement to the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest, before transfer will be permitted. The amount of the penalty will be reduced over time. To ensure that only legitimate minority and women-owned firms are able to take advantage of bidding credits, strict eligibility criteria have been adopted (in the Second Report and Order). Also, to ensure that our rules are narrowly tailored while meeting the statutory goal of providing opportunities for women and minorities to participate in the telecommunications industry, publicly-traded companies are prohibited from taking advantage of bidding credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tax certificates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Tax certificates will be issued to initial investors in minority and female-owned enterprises upon divestiture of their interests, and to licensees who transfer their authorizations to minority and female-owned businesses. In implementing this program, we will borrow from our existing tax certificate program and grant tax certificates, upon request, that will enable the licensees and investors to defer the gain realized upon a sale either by: (1) Treating it as an involuntary conversion under 26 U.S.C. 1033, with the recognition of gain avoided by the acquisition of qualified replacement property; or (2) electing to reduce the basis of certain depreciable property, or both. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 43. Tax certificates will be available to initial investors who provide ``start-up'' financing and investors who purchase shares within the first year after license issuance. To be eligible for a tax certificate, such investor transactions must not reduce minority or female ownership or control in the entity below 50.1 percent. To prevent unjust enrichment, we will impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer or assignment of narrowband PCS licenses obtained thorough the benefit of tax certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 44.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Installment payments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We adopt installment payments for small businesses_including small businesses owned by women and minorities and rural telephone companies that meet the small business definition_bidding for any of the BTA, MTA or regional narrowband PCS licenses. These licenses are appropriately sized for development by bona fide small businesses. We estimate that the cost to build-out these licenses will be between $50,000 and $1.25 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45. The installment payment option will enable all small businesses to pay the full amount of their winning bid in installments (less the upfront payment, which must be paid in full, and the down payment, half of which is due five days after the auction closes and the other half five days after the application is granted). Generally, interest charges will be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for 10 year U.S. Treasury obligations. Payments of interest only will be due for the first two years. Principal and interest will be amortized over the remaining years of the license. Timely payment of all installments will be a condition of the license grant. If a small business making installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a non-small business entity during the term of the license, we will require payment of the remaining principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Need for and Purpose of the Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 46. This rulemaking proceeding was initiated to implement section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended. The rules adopted herein will carry out Congress' intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for narrowband PCS licenses. The rules adopted herein also will carry out Congress' intent to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issues Raised in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47. The IRFA noted that the proposals under consideration in the NPRM included the possibility of new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for a number of small business entities. No commenters responded specifically to the issues raised in the IRFA. We have made some modifications to the proposed requirements as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Significant Alternatives Considered and Rejected <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All significant alternatives have been addressed in the Second Report and Order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Communications Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William F.

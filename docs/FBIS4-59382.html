			<p>BFN     [Text] Assessing the results of the Gaza-Jericho agreement,  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation in the  talks with Israel, has said that, in view of the Declaration of  Principles signed in Oslo, we have obtained the best possible  results. The worst of the Oslo agreement was the issues we  decided to postpone -- for example, the settlements, the issue  of the 1948 refugees, external security, and Jerusalem.    He added: In my opinion, we have obtained the best  conditions even on the postponed issues, particularly the  settlements. The whole conflict in this agreement was on how to  reduce the area of the settlements and Israel's control over  them during the transitional period.    Dr. Sha'th added that the agreement does not limit the  demand  for legitimate rights in the forthcoming period. We have added  a clause to the effect that, whatever happens during the  transitional period, our rights in the final phase will not be  affected. The land in the West Bank and Gaza will also remain a  single regional unit. There was also another clause which  stipulated that whatever we signed in the Gaza-Jericho agreement  did not constitute a renunciation of any of our rights. Sha'th  also said that Israel has no right to reoccupy Gaza if  settlements and settlers are exposed to danger.    Concerning foreign relations, Dr. Sha'th pointed out that  Israel advocated that the Palestinian authority should not be  allowed to exercise foreign relations. More than this, the PLO  would not be allowed to exercise these relations on behalf of  this authority, something which we rejected, he said. According  to the agreement, countries and international organizations have  the right to establish representation bureaus in the self-rule  area, but the Palestinian authority cannot have embassies other  than embassies of Palestine.    On the outstanding points of difference after the signing of  the agreement, and the talks to be held about it, Dr. Sha'th  said that all these issues are remnants of the Cairo security  agreement: these are the Mawasi beach in Gaza, the Jericho  crossing point, the Rafah crossing point, the area of Jericho,  and the presence of Palestinian soldiers on the Allenby bridge.  The talks will continue around four main axes, among which are  the gaining of early authority in the West Bank, to include  education, culture, tourism, taxes, social affairs, police, and  so on. We will also start negotiating over the withdrawal of  the Israeli forces from the West Bank and the holding of  legislative elections in it. The four-man committee would start  negotiating on the return of the refugees after a month.    Dr. Sha'th pointed out in a press statement that the talks  on  the refugees will revolve around two issues only. These are  return measures and measures for maintaining security and order;  there will not merely be discussions of the same principle.</p>

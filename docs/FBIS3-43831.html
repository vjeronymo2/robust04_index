IFP  spokesman Ed Tillett said in a statement the party had distanced  itself last week from the call to Zulus to stay away from work  on Monday and dissociated itself from all acts of intimidation.    "The IFP has always campaigned against coercion to enforce  stayaways and is not about to bow to political expedience on  this principle," Mr Tillett said.    The call for a national Zulu stayaway had been made by the  United Independent Trade Unions ad hoc committee of South Africa  -- an umbrella grouping representing 10 independent trade unions  -- after they had "canvassed the feelings of their members".    "Insofar as township residents on the reef linking alleged  intimidators to the IFP, it must be remembered that all 'zulus'  on the reef are arbitrarily labelled 'Inkathas' by non-Zulus,  irrespective of whether they are card-carrying members or  supporters of the IFP or not," Mr Tillett said.</p>

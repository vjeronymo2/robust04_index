			<p>BFN     [Text] Military leaders yesterday warned that a proposed  drop in the Defense Ministry's budget growth would seriously  affect arms acquisition programs and compromise the country's  self-defense capability.    They were speaking after the Cabinet approved a balanced  budget of Baht [Thai currency] 715 billion for fiscal 1995, with  strong emphasis on accelerating rural development, improving  education and increasing the standard of living of lower  socioeconomic groups.    The Defense Ministry saw its proposed budget growing by 7.5  percent, a drop of 0.5 percent compared with the current fiscal  year. Some military leaders complained that the new budget  would adversely affect self-defense capability.    Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak said after the Cabinet  meeting  that the slower growth in the proposed defense budget would  definitely affect the Armed Forces arms acquisition programs.    "The Defense Ministry will discuss it with the Budget  Bureau," Gen Wichit said.    ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Prachet Siridet, the Navy  Commander-in-Chief, said the defense budget could not be cut  without the national security being compromised. "However, it  depends how much of a cut there will be."    The Navy chief insisted that the Armed Forces had drawn up  their budget proposals they deserved.    Cabinet sources said the Defense Ministry had indicated it  would register reservations about the 1995 budget, reasoning  that the bulk would be spent on arms purchases and a shortfall  in funds would affect its program of modernization.    Baht 256 billion, a 22.4 percent increase over the current  fiscal year, would be pumped into these projects which are  considered by the government to be top priority.    The Cabinet appointed Deputy Prime Ministers Banyat  Banthatthan, Amnuai Wirawan, Bunchu Rotchanasathian, and  Supachai Phanitchaphak to scrutinize and adjust the allocations  earmarked for government agencies under their control, Budget  Bureau Director Bodi Chunnanon said. The four would discuss  proposed adjustments on May 17.    The proposed budget for secret operations would be given to  the Customs Department, the Office of the Counter Corruption  Commission and the National Intelligence Agency, Bodi said. The  total secret fund would represent only 0.1 percent of the total  budget, he added.    Bodi said adjustments could be made but total public sector  expenditure would remain fixed at Baht 715 billion.    The national budget for fiscal 1995 will be finalized by the  Cabinet on May 31, he said.    Bodi said that in fiscal 1995 each of the 360 members of the  House of Representatives would be allocated about Baht 1O  million to finance community development projects in their  respective constituencies.    Of the Baht 1O million, Baht 5 million would be funnelled  through the Prime Minister's Office of the Secretary General.  The other half would be made available through various  government agencies involved in development work.    MPs had been allocated Baht 20 million each for community  development in the current financial year which ends September  30.    Bodi said the figures would probably be adjusted upwards  when  the House of Representatives debates the Budget Bill.    The Budget Bureau chief said the reason the defense budget  was not being increased at the same percentage rate as in fiscal  1995 was because the Defense Ministry had been given more than  enough in the current financial year and still had funds left to  spend.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / RTZ makes Dollars 470m move into US coal RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, is moving into US coal with a Dollars 470m (Pounds 331m) agreed offer for Nerco, the floundering natural resources group 82 per cent owned by PacifiCorp. Nerco's profitable coal units will be merged with RTZ's US Kennecott copper and gold mining subsidiary but the Morgan Stanley investment bank will sell the oil and gas operations. Nerco's gold and silver mining interests have been up for sale for some time. RTZ will look closely before deciding whether to go ahead with the disposal process already in place. Nerco's net debt at the end of 1992 was Dollars 692m and after the deal RTZ's gearing will rise to about 60 per cent from 35 per cent. Mr Robert Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said: 'We shall move promptly to achieve the planned asset disposals. Meanwhile, we expect this transaction to enhance earnings even in 1993.' PacifiCorp has agreed to fund Dollars 225m of the consideration and will be repaid from certain contract revenues of Nerco. Through its 49 per cent-owned associate, CRA, RTZ already has coal interests in Australia and Indonesia. Nerco owns two low-sulphur, open pit, steam coal mines in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming and has a 50 per cent stake in a third. It produced 16.6m tonnes in 1992 and has reserves totalling 580m tonnes, and more than 60 per cent of production is secured by long-term contracts. Mr Wilson said demand for low-sulphur coal in the US was expected to grow by 2 per cent annually and material from Powder River was probably the lowest-cost in the world: about Dollars 4 a tonne to mine. RTZ's share price closed 6p down after the news at 646p, possibly because of market fears of a rights issue. RTZ is offering Dollars 12 for each Nerco share. At the close in New York Nerco's shares were up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 11 1/2 . The US company also announced a net loss of Dollars 551m on revenues of Dollars 578m after write-downs totalling Dollars 714m. This left its net assets worth Dollars 247m. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at S G Warburg, said: 'It looks like a very good deal - if you want that sort of deal. But should anyone be buying coal anywhere in the world, even reasonably high-quality coal?' Lex, Page 16</p>

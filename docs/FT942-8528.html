			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Mexican opposition advances Mexico's centre-right opposition has been lifted greatly by the television debate last week between the country's main presidential candidates and is now leading the governing party in some opinion polls. The leftist opposition has been relegated to third. Mori of Mexico gives Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party (PAN) 25 per cent support, against 20 per cent for Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), with 41 per cent undecided. An internal poll for the PRI gives Mr Fernandez de Cevallos 40 per cent and Mr Zedillo 39 per cent. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) trailed with 12-13 per cent. PRI officials expect the popularity of Mr Fernandez de Cevallos to decline as the impact of the debate fades. They argue that the polls are biased in his favour because they do not include the rural areas where his party has little support. Even so, the PAN surge is causing anxiety in the governing party and contributing to deep divisions in the PRD. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is less known than Mr Cardenas but the former's party offers social conservatism and pro-business policies which may be more palatable to many voters than the left-of-centre platform of Mr Cardenas, and may make the PAN candidate a more credible alternative to the PRI. One PRI official said: 'We now have to concentrate on winning the election, not just on obtaining legitimacy for the result.' Government officials say they much prefer to have Mr Fernandez de Cevallos, rather than Mr Cardenas, as the principal opposition in the August presidential election, in the belief this could make the post-electoral situation more stable. If Mr Cardenas does come third, officials reckon his capacity to organise allegations of electoral fraud will be much reduced. The PAN has generally co-operated with the PRI. The PRI's aura of invincibility has been damaged by the televised debate, in which Mr Fernandez de Cevallos was judged the clear winner. Mr Zedillo has been criticised for failing to defend the policies of President Carlos Salinas, for not mentioning his own party, and for mean-spiritedness during much of his time on air. Members of the PRD are increasingly frustrated at Mr Cardenas's lacklustre campaign, encapsulated by his poor performance in the television debate. Yesterday, the party leaders held an emergency meeting to resolve differences between factions and refocus the campaign, according to press reports. Many of Mr Cardenas's problems seem of his own making. Last weekend he met Sub-comandante Marcos, the rebel leader in the southern state of Chiapas, and seemed to play into the hands of those who attack him for extremism. The meeting turned into a fiasco as Marcos, rather than offer his support for Mr Cardenas, criticised him for his failings. The meeting conflicted with Mr Cardenas's recent move to the political centre. Some government officials are worried that he may move back to the left, in an effort to shore up support from the party faithful, if his popularity ebbs away. A newly radicalised Mr Cardenas, even in third place, could make the electoral process more tense.</p>

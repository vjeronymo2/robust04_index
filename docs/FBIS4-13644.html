			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Research Council, headed by his eminence  the grand imam of al-Azhar, has issued the following statement  in response to remarks on al-Azhar by some writers:    Praise be to God and prayers and salutations be on God's  messenger Muhammad and all prophets and messengers. "Our Lord!  Decide thou between us and our people in truth, for thou art the  best to decide." [Koranic verse] The Islamic Research Council  of al-Azhar has examined remarks by some writers about al-Azhar,  particularly about al-Azhar's examination of [literary and  artistic] material. The council issues this statement to the  Egyptian people as a reminder and in eagerness to explain and  stress the task it is entrusted with. The essence of this task  is to promote God's religion through wisdom and good advice; as  Almighty God said, "Let there arise out of you a band of people  inviting to all that is good, enjoying what is right, and  forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain  felicity." [Koranic verse]    What is to the credit of our glorious nation is that  religiousness has been instilled in the Egyptian people's souls  since history began. The Egyptian people, including all their  trends and inclinations, are clearly religious and adhere to  God's teachings.    Al-Azhar has always been the place sought by students of  Islamic knowledge from all parts of the world and from the  Islamic world east and west in realization of God's command in  his holy book "If a contingent from every expedition remain  behind, admonish the people when they return to them that thus  they may learn to guard themselves against evil." [Koranic  verses]    Al-Azhar's task also is to study Islamic sciences, explain  the facts of religion to people at home and abroad, and present  them to the people pure, sound, and void of odious bigotry and  extremism. This is so because al-Azhar seeks a middle course and  moderation--a characteristic by which al-Azhar and its  institutions have been known throughout history--out of the  conviction that this religion is easy and one should not go to  extremes. This lays on al-Azhar the duty to convey the message  of Islam to all nations, defend it, and explain its effect on  the progress of mankind and civilization.    It is the destiny of al-Azhar to be the trusted guardian of  Islamic values and the cultural heritage of this nation. This  has become deeply entrenched in the minds of the Egyptian  people, who flock in alarm to the al-Azhar mosque for advice on  every issue that concerns their Islamic creed, shari'ah, and  ethics. These are precisely the Islamic principles legislated  by the Egyptian Constitutions, laws, and by-laws in Egypt,  culminating in the declaration that Islam is the state's  religion, Arabic its official language, and the principles of  the Islamic shari'ah the main source of legislation.    If this were the established rule, and indeed it is, then  there should not be room for any discordant voices or writers  with twisted ideology to question al-Azhar's right to caution  against whatever may contradict the teachings of Islam or exceed  the limits set by God Almighty in His Koran or in the teachings  of His prophet, peace be upon him, or that it is the ultimate  authority in this regard. These voices and writers are not new  to the scene. For decades they have tried to advocate alien and  imported ideologies and materialistic philosophies, to  antagonize the heavenly revelation, and to conspire against  Islam, only to be defeated and fail on every occasion, thank  God. Today, once again they have come out into the open, taking  advantage of the extremists' plots, to undermine Islam in its  entirety, or rather to strike at religion in general.    The noble al-Azhar has always been and continues to be  against any form of extremism and eager to show the bright image  of Islam, in a bid to uphold what is right, refute and uproot  what is wrong, and to promote virtue and prohibit vice, as God  has ordered, with wisdom and good advice. If some are riding  the wave of extremism and excess, it is the duty of those who  are well versed to straighten out their deviation and restore  them to reason. As for those who cannot tolerate Islam and who  declare themselves and their writings to be at war against its  rules and rites, there is no place for them in this arena, for  they are the ones who make things worse by combating extremism  with an even more misleading and harmful extremism.    Judging by their conduct, it is clear that they hold no  reverence for Allah. Their boldness against Islam's heritage  and its sources in the Koran and the prophet's tradition is  evident to all, beyond any doubt. They fail to realize that in  drifting away from God's religion there is no distinction  between deviation to the right or to the left, between adding  and omitting, and between those who question God's religion and  those who are ungrateful to it.    Being the higher body involved in Islamic research, it is  the  Islamic Research Council's duty "to give its views on any  sectarian, social, or economic problem that comes up," and "to  follow up on all the studies and researches published on Islam  and the Islamic heritage inside the country and abroad to  benefit from whatever authentic views they contain, or to  counter, correct, or react to them." To attain its goals under  the powers invested in it, the Council may issue recommendations  to individuals and groups involved in the field of Islamic  culture in public and private organizations.    It would have been better for the voices and pens that  contest the Honorable al-Azhar's missions to have followed the  call to pursue an orthodox line of conduct, in word and deed as  well as in performance, and avoided sparking off disagreements  on religious issues. They are well aware that those who follow  the call are careful to obey God's word and cherish Islam, their  creed and canon.    Accordingly, and since the al-Azhar shaykh is by law "the  grand imam and the highest opinion on all religion-related  matters," the Council--supported by its chairman, the grand imam  of al-Azhar--will continue, along with him, to protect the Koran  and its tradition, guard the bounds established by Allah, and  necessarily draw attention to the need to rectify deviations or  twisted conduct regardless of its kind or source.    "For the scum disappears like froth cast out, while that  which is for the good of mankind remains on Earth." [Koranic  verse]    May Allah guide our steps. God as our witness, we have  conveyed the message.    [Signed] Honorable al-Azhar Shaykh and Chairman of the  Islamic Research Center Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq</p>

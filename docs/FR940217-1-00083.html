			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to fine proceedings against third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers, the Secretary proposes to amend &sect;668.84 to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the procedures for fine proceedings that a designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> department official notifies each institution that is affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alleged violations identified as the basis for the fine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding. To the extent possible, the official also notifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each institution that contracts with the servicer for the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service affected by the alleged violation. This change would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parallel the notification requirements that the Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed under &sect;668.24(b). As explained in the prior discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding notification requirements under &sect;668.24(b), there was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no consensus during negotiated rulemaking on this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision. Some negotiators opposed this requirement on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounds previously noted. In addition, &sect;&sect;668.85 and 668.86 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the official to notify each institution that contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a third-party servicer under a suspension, limitation, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fine, limitation, suspension, and termination proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would all require the official to include in the notice to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer the consequences of the action to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, including that the Secretary may fine, limit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspend, or terminate the institution, as applicable. Given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential consequences to an institution, the Secretary deems it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper to provide notice to each institution that could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected of the Secretary's intent to seek a sanction against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, whether the Secretary also intends to seek a sanction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the institution or not. Even if the Secretary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin a fine, limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against an institution, the Secretary believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution should be kept informed of the status of any proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanction against the institution's servicer. Imposition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanction could have an effect on the institution's participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a Title IV, HEA program. Further, the Secretary believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution should be informed if its servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of a Title IV, HEA program is called into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question. That information would permit the institution to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed judgments about the institution's continued use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, and take corrective action prior to the outcome of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 668.87&blank;Prehearing Conference and 668.88 Hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add references to third-party servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conform to the proposed changes in the scope of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.89&blank;Authority and responsibilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing official. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary proposes to amend this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make clear that a hearing official is bound by all applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutes and regulations. This change would codify in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations the existing responsibility of the hearing official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.90&blank;Initial and final decisions_Appeals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section would be amended to add references to third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers to conform to the proposed changes in the scope of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart. In addition, paragraph (a)(3) of this section would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to reflect changes proposed under &sect;&sect;668.12 and 668.82  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealing with the past performance of individuals, agencies, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations that are affiliated with an institution, including,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as applicable, third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add a new restriction on a hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official's authority to modify a proposed sanction against an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or third-party servicer. If a designated department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official brings a termination action against an institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer for engaging in fraud, and a hearing official finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution or servicer has engaged in fraud, the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official must uphold the termination. The examples of fraud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in this section are the same as those proposed for &sect;668.83  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning emergency action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that if an institution or third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer engages in fraud involving a Title IV, HEA program, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the program should be terminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer any aspect of that institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs, as applicable, should be terminated. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not believe that a lesser sanction that permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution or servicer to continue to participate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program or in the case of a third-party servicer to be eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to contract, is a sufficient safeguard against the likely abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (c)(1) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section so that in a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hearing official's initial decision automatically becomes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's final decision in 30 days (20 days is mandated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current regulations) after the initial decision is issued and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by both parties unless that initial decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned before the Secretary. The Secretary is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these new timeframes to make them consistent with other reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in this part. The Secretary does not believe that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten-day difference in an institution's or servicer's right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal an initial decision would unduly affect the integrity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to make technical changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section to correct typographical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> errors that inadvertently appeared in final regulations published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 31, 1991 (56 FR 36698).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.91&blank;Filing of requests for hearings and appeals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmation of mailing and receipt dates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to add references to third-party servicers to conform to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed changes in the scope of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

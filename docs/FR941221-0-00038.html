			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In order to implement the amendment, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking on May 31, 1994. We received nine comments from two commenters on the proposed rule. Our response to these comments is set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we have revised the final rule to make it consistent with the amendment to IRCA in the Labor/Health and Human Services FY 1995 Appropriations Act, Public Law 103&hyph;333. The amendment provides that States use reallocated funds to reimburse accepted SLIAG-related costs within 90 days of the award of the funds but no later than July 31, 1995. This change to the final rule is also discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Section 402.2, Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The amendment to IRCA requires that unexpended funds from SLIAG grants be reallocated to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. In the final rule, ``unexpended funds'' is defined as the amount by which a State's allotments through FY 1994 exceed the State's SLIAG-related costs as of December 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Comment (Definition of ``Unexpended Funds'') <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> One commenter suggested that the definition of unexpended funds should be revised to mean the amount by which a State's allotments exceed the amount of the State's drawdowns from its allotments as of December 30, 1994. The commenter suggested that States' drawdowns may be higher than their accepted SLIAG-related costs and that the definition of unexpended funds in the proposed rule would be unworkable unless the rule were further amended to require States to repay amounts by which drawdowns exceed accepted costs. The commenter also noted that States can appeal any order for repayment of funds and that an appeal can be time-consuming. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We have chosen to use SLIAG-related costs rather than drawdowns in calculating unexpended funds for the following reasons. First, the current SLIAG regulation at &sect;402.20 provides that Department rules at 45 CFR part 92 apply to grants awarded under the SLIAG program. Part 92 requires that grantees refund to the Department any unobligated grant funds after the end of the funding period (45 CFR 92.50(d)(2)). Grantees are further required to liquidate obligations of grant funds no later than 90 days following the end of the funding period of a grant (45 CFR 92.23(b)). We believe that the regulation does therefore already meet one concern of the commenter, since it requires that States refund the amounts by which their drawdowns from their allotments exceed their SLIAG-related costs. In the case of SLIAG grants, refund of unobligated amounts is required after the due date of the final cost reports on December 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

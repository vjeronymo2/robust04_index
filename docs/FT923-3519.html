			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Coats Viyella ahead to Pounds 53m TRADING CONDITIONS in the textiles and clothing industry remained 'harsh', Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, Europe's biggest textiles manufacturer, said yesterday. He warned he could not see a recovery in the UK until the summer of 1993 and that trading would be difficult in the rest of the world outside the US and Far East. The shares fell 10p to 155p. The statement accompanied Coats' results for the six months to June 30 which showed higher operating and pre-tax profits following last year's acquisition of Tootal, the thread maker. The acquisition helped push turnover from Pounds 877m to Pounds 1.02bn, while operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 69.2m (Pounds 50.6m). However, rising debt and interest charges held profits at the pre-tax level to Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 48.1m). The increased number of shares in issue as a result of the deal meant that earnings per share were unchanged at 4.3p. The interim dividend is held at 3p. The Brazilian activities fell into the red, accounting for an overall loss of Pounds 700,000 for South America, compared with a profit of Pounds 6m. The company blamed high interest rates and inflation. It has spent about Pounds 3m in exceptional reorganisation costs in Brazil. The benefits of the merger with Tootal came through strongly in North America, which showed a 65 per cent improvement in operating profits, from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 20.4m. The company merged its industrial and consumer thread interests and has gained in market share and margin. North America was also helped by improvements at Dynacast, the precision engineering business. Operating profits rose from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 10.7m. The UK also saw a sharp gain, from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 19.1m, thanks to cost cutting, including the closure in April of a shirt factory in Northern Ireland. COMMENT There are an awful lot of losses in Brazil for Coats Viyella. More restructuring costs are to come as the company switches production to Asia; Coats' sourcing of clothes from outside western Europe has risen from zero to more than 20 per cent in two years. Gearing is going in the wrong direction, the company is caught in an ACT trap, the UK economy is dreadful and cash flow is slow. Fortunately for Coats, the Tootal merger benefits are arriving and the US is producing cash. Next year, perhaps, a stronger dollar will make the US yet more valuable, help out over ACT and protect domestic markets a little. The company will be lucky to make Pounds 120m pre-tax for the full year, compared with Pounds 111m last year, and earn 11p a share for an above sector average p/e of 14.</p>

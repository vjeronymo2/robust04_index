			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Travellers warned to avoid Algeria BRITAIN and other EC countries yesterday warned their nationals to avoid Algeria unless absolutely necessary because of the recent wave of killings and kidnappings. The warning coincided with a report from Amnesty International which told the Algerian authorities that 'no level of opposition violence, no matter how horrifying, can be used to justify torture, summary executions and unfair trials'. The EC countries are seeking Algerian help in providing additional security for their nationals, following the kidnapping on Sunday of three employees of the French consulate in Algiers. No news of the three, all French nationals, has been received since they were seized. 'Visitors are advised to postpone all but essential visits to Algeria, where there have recently been a number of terrorist attacks on foreign residents,' the Foreign Office in London said yesterday. France has urged families of its expatriates in Algeria to take advantage of school holidays to return home. Algeria has blamed Moslem extremists for the murders of two French surveyors, two Russian army officers and three oil workers employed by an Italian company. In its report Amnesty International said hundreds of people had been sentenced to death this year in Algeria by courts which violated requirements of international law.</p>

The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as  saying:    "The principles and line adhered to by our party and the  government of our Republic for national reunification remain  unchanged. We will continue to make every effort to reunify the  country in the form of a confederation based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments, and on the three  principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great  national unity."    The article goes on:    As the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said, the principles  of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity  are the three principles consistently maintained by the Workers'  Party of Korea in the struggle for national reunification.  Because these principles clearly show the way of solving the  national reunification question in conformity with the will and  interests of the entire Korean people.    The reunification of the country is a cause of putting an  end  to the domination and interference of outside forces and  realizing national independence on a nationwide scale.    The reunification of the country, the cause of independence  of the nation, can successfuly be solved only by the efforts of  the Korean nation itself. The driving force of the  reunification of the country is the Korean nation.    Korea must be reunified by peaceful means. The Korean nation  must be reunified into one. But a war must not be chosen for  this purpose. It is the biggest tragedy and shame for fellow  countrymen to live in antagonism or to fight each other with  arms.    The whole nation must share the same will and firmly unite  as  one in the struggle for national reunification. A bright  prospect of national reunification can be opened when the entire  people in the North and the South achieve great national unity  on the principle of giving priority to the common interests of  the nation, transcending the differences in idea, system and  religious belief, and of subordinating everything to the cause  of national reunification.    Great national unity is the fundamental prerequisite to  independent and peaceful reunification and its essential  content. Independent and peaceful reunification is unthinkable  apart from great national unity.    The harmony and unity of the entire nation is the very  reunification of the country that we desire.    The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification  and great national unity are a common action program which the  North and the South agreed upon and proclaimed to the world  jointly, the article stresses.</p>

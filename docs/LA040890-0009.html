			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 ROBERT PLANT "MANIC NIRVANA" ES PARANZA/ATLANTIC. ALBUMS  ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Nope, this isn't it.  </P> <P> Former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant still hasn't come up with that macho,  hard-rock album Zep fans have been waiting for since the band called it quits a  decade ago.  </P> <P> His solo albums -- this is his fifth since 1982 -- are like public dress  rehearsals for the real thing. His last one, 1988's "Now and Zen," was a  disjointed, dissonant mess, wandering all over the place. The new one is more  focused -- with guitars a stronger force than usual -- but some of the pieces  still seem cluttered and aimless, tottering on quirky rhythmic structures.  </P> <P> Plant is apparently still experimenting, seeking a new niche. Meanwhile, he  keeps Zep fans salivating with numbers, like "Nirvana," that have tantalizing  echoes of good old Zep. The album's best song is a remake of Kenny Dino's 1961  hit, "Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night," mainly because it's  fairly close in spirit and feel to old Zep tunes.  </P> <P> It's time for Plant to stop pussyfooting around, come to terms with whatever he  has to come to terms with and make that good, hard-rocking, Zep-style album  that's obviously lurking inside, clamoring to get out.  </P> <P> C'mon Robert, we're getting tired of waiting.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Asian Development  Bank (ADB) has approved a 140-million-dollar loan to help two  Chinese cities fight environmental pollution.    According to an official of the International Department of  the People's Bank of China, ADB loans to China this year are  expected to top 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, about the same as last  year.    The 140-million-dollar loan will have a maturity term of 25  years and carry an interest rate of 6.7 percent.    It will mainly be used to build gas facilities in Chengde  and  Tangshan, two cities in north China's Hubei Province which have  long been plagued by air pollution caused by burning coal  instead of gas.    Since China obtained ADB membership in 1986, it has received  a total of 3 billion U.S. dollars' worth of loans from the  organization, most of which have gone to projects in  infrastructure construction, environmental protection and  programs to relieve dire poverty.</p>

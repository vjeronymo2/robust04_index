			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities rally as Treasury prices rebound Wall Street A big rally in the Treasury market helped US share prices rebound from Monday's losses yesterday, but investors remained concerned about rising interest rates and the possibility of another monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.37 at 3,656.41. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 regained 3.69 at 446.01, while the Nasdaq composite rose 2.04 to 725.00. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 295.6m shares, while advances outpaced declines by 1,316 to 881. A semblance of calm was restored to the equity markets yesterday after the previous day's gyrations and heavy losses. Shares were aided by a sharp snap-back in Treasury prices, which were boosted by strong demand for US government securities from overseas buyers - particularly Japanese and Middle Eastern - a stronger dollar, and by a successful afternoon auction of three-year Treasury notes. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up by more than 1 1/2 points, and the yield had dropped to just under 7.5 per cent. Analysts said that another factor boosting stocks was the feeling among some institutional investors that the market had become slightly 'oversold' in recent days, a feeling which prompted some bargain hunting yesterday. In spite of the gains, the mood was not particularly upbeat, said traders. Investors' main concern - that interest rates will continue to rise as the Fed acts to slow the rapidly expanding economy and bond investors continue to express their doubts about the central bank's ability to control inflation - continued to undermine sentiment. Among individual stocks, AT&amp;T advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 in heavy trading of 6.06m shares after the company announced that it had won a Dollars 4bn contract from Saudi Arabia to rewire the country for advanced telecommunications services. In a similar move, shares in IDB Communications, which are quoted on the Nasdaq market, forged ahead Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 in volume of 2.7m shares after the company signed an agreement to provide direct long-distance telephone services between the US and Saudi Arabia. Computer stocks were in demand. Hewlett-Packard climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 78 1/2 , Compaq added Dollars 2 at Dollars 109, IBM firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 58 and Digital Equipment rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/4 . Auto stocks were also higher as a group, with Ford up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4 , General Motors Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 55 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars 1 3/8 better at Dollars 46 1/8 . PDA Engineering jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 5 5/8 after MacNeal-Schwendler (up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 12 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange) agreed to buy the company for Dollars 6.85 a share. Canada Toronto stocks ended on a mixed note, with traders saying the market will remain edgy until the US Federal Reserve unveils its rate plans. The TSE 300 composite index gained 10.8 at 4,189.9 but declines outpaced advances by 381 to 348, with 326 issues holding their ground. There was a moderate trade of 48.7m shares valued at CDollars 506m. Of the TSE's 14 sub-sectors, 11 ended higher. But the gains were muted by a tumble in precious metals shares. The gold and silver index fell 203.6, or 2.10 per cent, to 9,511.6 as gold prices were whacked by strong gains in the US dollar. A trader said the low volume could be an indication that the market has bottomed. But others said it is chiefly a sign of burgeoning investor fears. Active issues were topped by PWA Corp, the airline holding company still in the throes of a painful restructuring. PWA was steady at CDollars 0.55. South Africa's financial markets were closed yesterday for the inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president.</p>

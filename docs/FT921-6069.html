			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Buoyant UBS unveils capital restructuring UNION Bank of Switzerland (UBS) has reported consolidated net income of SFr1.2bn (Dollars 857.1m) for 1991, a 35.6 per cent gain on the depressed result of the previous year. The bank, Switzerland's largest and strongest, also unveiled a capital restructuring, consisting of splits of its registered and bearer shares and a forced conversion of its participation certificates into bearer shares. Shareholders are being offered unchanged dividends plus bonus warrants on terms to be set later. Mr Robert Studer, president of the executive board, said the 'very satisfactory' results were attributable mainly to the improvement in UBS operations outside Switzerland. These contribute about a quarter of the group's profits. Net interest income jumped 23.3 per cent to SFr3.3bn, thanks largely to the sharp decline in dollar interest rates, while profit from trading in securities and foreign exchange markets soared 44.3 per cent to SFr1.3bn. Net income from fund management and other services rose 19.6 per cent to SFr2.7bn. Cash flow reached SFr3.4bn compared with SFr2.5bn. Depreciation and provisions were up 29.6 per cent to SFr1.7bn. Consolidated total assets stood at SFr249.3bn at the end of 1991, only 6.5 per cent higher than a year earlier, and 2 per cent came from the appreciation of most currencies against the Swiss franc. Capital and reserves, including the 1991 net profit, rose 3.8 per cent to SFr18.4bn at the year end. Mr Studer emphasised the strength of UBS's balance sheet, perhaps seeking to ease fears it too might face scrutiny from a credit rating agency. Last month, Moody's removed its triple A rating from long term bonds of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank, and put those of Swiss Bank Corporation, the second largest, on its watch list. Mr Studer listed the group's SFr30.5bn in capital, reserves, margin for subordinated bond issues and accumulated provisions, and concluded: 'Even if we take into account that a part of the provisions will have to be utilised in the future for writing off loan losses and for latent taxes, we may with good conscience consider our capital and reserves as being very strong.' UBS is the first of many Swiss companies expected to changes in the Swiss companies law which comes into effect July 1. Mr Ulrich Grete, executive vice-president, said the main purpose of this was to bring the price of the shares down to levels that made it easier for individuals to buy and sell them. UBS will split both the SFr100 par value registered shares and the SFr500 bearer shares five for one. Holders of UBS participation certificates (PCs) have been entitled to exchange them into bearer shares at the rate of one share for every 25 PCs since 1990. Mr Grete said the remaining 462,000 PCs would be invalidated as of yesterday and trading in them would halt on March 27. However, UBS would continue to buy any offered after that date and exchange them in packets of 25 for bearer shares.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Technology: Putting videos in the picture - Worth Watching For those would-be cinematographers with 8mm camcorders, the Korean electronics company Goldstar has introduced a simpler way of transferring recordings from 8mm to VHS format so that the film can be viewed like an ordinary video. The RDD10i machine is a traditional VHS remote control VCR but with an extra slot for 8mm tapes. By inserting the recorded 8mm tape and a blank VHS tape the reording can be simply transferred. The system also includes basic film editing capabilities to help produce a more professional film. The RDD10i costs Pounds 629.99. Goldstar: South Korea, 2 787 1114; UK, 0753 691888.</p>

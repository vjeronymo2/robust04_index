			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (30): Pits face difficult challenge - Coal Three hundred metres below the surface of the Silesian hills, and four kilometres along dark, dripping tunnels from the main shaft of the Janina mine near Katowice, Mr Jerzy Poniewski, senior engineer, is adamant that his son will not be following him into a career down the pit. 'He speaks German and English and is going to medical school. He doesn't want to be a miner - there are no prospects'. Nevertheless, if Polish coal mining has a profitable future, the face of it is probably the Janina mine. Mr Poniewski and his colleagues have hauled Janina back from the brink of bankruptcy in June 1990, by a programme of modernisation and job cuts yet to be undertaken by most of the industry. 'It was a question of life and death,' says Mr Tadeusz Gruber, the mine's deputy-director. Restructuring the coal industry is one of the most difficult challenges facing the Polish economy. Poland remains highly dependent on hard coal, which supplies two thirds of electricity generation and more than three quarters of industrial and household heating. Lignite provides another 14 per cent of primary energy consumption. With an estimated 65bn tonnes of reserves, a third of which are being actively mined, Poland also has some of the richest deposits in Europe. There are geological handicaps - methane gas in some, underground water in many, as in the Janina mine - but much of the coal has low sulphur content and is close to the surface compared to that in the UK. In theory, it is an industry which should have little problem attracting outside investment. The World Bank, in a survey of the industry, has recommended a continuing central role for coal production in the economy - provided that restructuring takes place. However, the present financial position of the 70 mines in Upper and Lower Silesia and Lublin is precarious. Of the pits, which were reorganised last spring into seven corporations, seven have been listed for closure. Production has slumped from a peak of just under 200m tonnes in 1979 to about 130m tonnes last year, largely because of the collapse in industrial demand for electricity and heating. In December 1993, the mines' liabilities exceeded their receivables - money owing to them - by 32,000bn zlotys, according to Mr Eugeniusz Pawetczyk, vice-president of the State Coal Agency, which was responsible for the mines until last year. The government and industry analysts are clear that jobs need to be shed to bring the industry firmly into profit. According to the State Coal Agency, the 305,000 employees in the hard coal mines in December 1993 (excluding those working in lignite mining) represented a fall of 25,000 in the year. 'We need more cuts - half of the current total is our aim,' says Mr Pawetczyk. He expects that the reduction this year will be some 32,000, although 25,000 of that will be achieved by natural wastage and separation of service and engineering companies. Ministers are concerned, however, that cuts on that scale could be politically explosive. The Janina mine is still the largest employer in its district, and is directly responsible for the housing of 1,300 families. The miners earn an average of 4m zlotys to 5m zlotys a month, well above the industrial average of 3m zlotys to 4m zlotys, and reluctance about accepting the offered six months' redundancy pay in return for leaving would be understandable. However, Mr Gruber says that the mine has managed to cut its workforce from 6,000 people four years ago to 4,000 mainly by separating service, maintenance and engineering activities into separate companies, and by hiring no new people. 'We used to have 50 people washing the miners' clothes, but now they are in a separate company and we don't pay for their social services,' he says. But industry analysts are concerned that some mines will simply try to raise coal prices instead of cutting costs, because of the difficulty of making redundancies. Last year, the financial plight of the mines was partly alleviated by a deal with the generating industry allowing the average domestic price of coal to rise by nearly a third. That is a picture acknowledged by the directors of Weglokoks, the state-owned company which handles 90 per cent of exports: 'The coal mines were in a weak position last year before they grouped into seven companies. There was too much competition to sell coal - now they have started acting together, they have brought coal prices up to the level of costs.' According to Mr Henryk Pyszny, Weglokoks' president, exports are currently less profitable than domestic coal sales because of low world coal prices. However if cheaper imports begin to challenge domestic production, the mines could be plunged back further into deficit, the mines argue. The recent changes made by a few mines point the way to solution of these problems. But measured against the goals of internationally competitive production and coal prices set by the market, coal mining is still near the beginning of a long road.</p>

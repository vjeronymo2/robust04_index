			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, head of the </F> Political and Foreign Relations Department of the Yemeni  Socialist Party, by unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] You were with us when we heard our  colleague Mamduh Sa'd's interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Iryani. What is your response and how can the ongoing  conflict in Yemen be contained?    [Al-Dali] Actually I believe that the starting point in  resolving the worsening crisis represented by this ferocious war  should be an immediate halt to the war. Afterward, we could  disengage the forces and then sit and talk about anything or any  issue.    [Correspondent] How can the fighting be stopped amid these  reports and statements by the two sides?    [Al-Dali] The aggressor should order a halt to his  aggressions against the southern and eastern governorates. The  aggressor must stop his aggressions against the eastern and  southern governorates. We have agreed on more than one occasion  to halt the fighting and to accept mediation efforts, and to sit  down for talks with our brothers, but the other side has refused  and rejected more than one initiative to halt the fighting. He,  the aggressor, has to stop the fighting.    [Correspondent] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is very  strongly opposed to your declaration of secession from unity.    [Al-Dali] We did not choose to proclaim a new state in the  southern and eastern governorates at our own choosing; there  were reasons and motives that prompted us to do so.    [Correspondent] In a few words, what would you say about the  YSP's initiative?    [Al-Dali] An immediate cease-fire, withdrawing and  disengaging the forces, and sitting down for talks without  preconditions.</p>

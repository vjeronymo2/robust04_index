			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Mobile phone network planned HUTCHISON Microtel, the cellular mobile phone operator, yesterday claimed that the network it plans to launch next spring will cover 70 per cent of the UK's population by the end of 1994. Mr Malcolm Way, Microtel's managing director, said that by the time of the launch the company would have spent Pounds 350m on its network, more than twice the current investment in Mercury's One-2-One. It plans to have invested more than Pounds 700m by the end of the decade. One-2-One's network covers only the London region, although it will extend further into the south-east next year. Hutchison Microtel's network uses the same Personal Communications Network technology as One-2-One. Mr Way warned that, in spite of Mercury's strong pitch for the consumer market, a mass market for mobile phones would not be achieved easily. 'There is still a long way to go before consumers are made aware of, and comfortable with, the concept of a convenient and affordable mobile telephone,' he said. Microtel's parent company, the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, emphasised earlier this summer its determination to concentrate on its core businesses of Far East property. However, no buyer has yet emerged for Microtel and the company said that a change of ownership would be unlikely to affect its building and launch plans. The government has awarded three new licences to provide telecommunications services. The companies gaining the licences are ScottishPower Telecommunications, a subsidiary of Scottish Power, Torch Communications, a joint venture between Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston Communications, which operates a network in Hull, and MFS, a subsidiary of a US business telecommunications company. The companies plan to provide services in limited areas.</p>

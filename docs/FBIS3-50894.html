			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Velasquez] </F>   [Text] Larrainzar, 7 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- People woke up  warmer this Friday, and the huge mess that appears to be a  quarrel, armed conflict, or war is beginning to clear up to the  disbelief of some and the astonishment of others.    In San Andres -- according to Mayor Diego Perez Hernandez --  between 15 and 20 percent of the population left with the  rebels. Here we live in 43 communities, he said. "We know they  left."    San Juan Chamula Mayor Domingo Lopez Ruiz said 60 families  left to join the rebels and that "they will not be allowed to  return to their community as they have caused disorder."    Lopez Ruiz told a group of reporters that there were two  training camps in Larrainzar, which is near San Juan Chamula.  One camp is called Vayalemo and Suytic, and the other in a site  called "La Casa de las Hormigas." He said the people left the  villages Bautista El Chico, Tres Cruces, Setelton, and Tzotic.  He added that 15 days before 1 January, a woman by the name of  Willis Blanca took weapons, people, and food to those training  camps.    Those villages are located some 50 km northwest of San  Cristobal de las Casas, one of the towns occupied by an armed  group on 1 January, which prompted the Army's intervention and  resulted in 100 people being killed in seven days of violence.    In Larrainzar the situation is different, however. The mayor  said that starting tomorrow, Saturday, he will meet with all the  residents "to decide what will be done because their priority is  to save lives."    The mayor said he was forced to turn over some vehicles and  some municipal drivers were taken away. He added that "30 or 40  guerrillas have returned, but no one knows where they are."  The mayor, a young rural professor, said that the "trucks  loaded with people" left for San Cristobal de las Casas on the  night of 31 December.    "Some 30 or 40 of them came here, seemingly unarmed. I spoke  with them for two hours, but when I refused to turn over the  vehicles they lifted their shirts and showed me their weapons,"  he said. "They told me to give them the vehicles or they would  kill me. I didn't want to die, so I gave them the vehicles. I  was told that many of them boarded the vehicles a little farther  down the road."    In San Juan Chamula, just south of Larrainzar, Mayor Lopez  Ruiz pointed out that even though local residents are unarmed,  they are so well organized that on 4 January they caught "a spy."    "The man seemed suspicious. He was not looking at the road.  He came here to find out about us. A judge and town councilman  left in a patrol car to question him," Lopez said. "The man  said he had no name and that he was from Larrainzar. He later  said he was coming here to visit a friend but gave no name. He  then tried to draw a weapon but was arrested," Lopez explained.  "He was driving a green three-ton truck with a sign on the  front that read `El Chapulin.' We confiscated his truck, his .22  caliber Star pistol, two magazines, a license, and a voting  card," Domingo said.    "The man was carrying another card that read: Soviet Union,  you know where I am. A list of six weapons followed. I only  remember one of them: rifle .22-16 with the price of 1,700 new  pesos ($548).    "I asked the Army to take him away and General Oton Saldivar  Carrillo sent me a vehicle. The man's name is Andres Hernandez  Nunez. We later learned that two houses full of weapons were  found in Larrainzar.    "They are ambitious people. They want the land without  working for it, through violence. We all know that to have  something we have to work" We do not believe in violence.  That is why God gave us the power to speak so we can express  our needs. Even though I am an authority, I cannot give all the  orders by myself, I am not a dictator," Lopez added.    "Those who left are not going to be forgiven. They caused  disorder and that is why we could not drive to the city to buy  fuel, medicine, or anything. The people will not forgive them  because the people of Chamula can think and can get things done  through discussion," the San Juan Chamula mayor said.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Kohl pins hope on man from east GERMANY'S Christian Democratic Union yesterday closed ranks behind its virtually unknown candidate for the presidency, angrily rejecting criticism that he is a non-entity whose only qualification is that he is east German. Mr Steffen Heitmann, the 49-year-old justice minister from the eastern state of Saxony, was given a rousing ovation at the end of the CDU party conference in Berlin, as delegates sought to counter the impression that they are only half-hearted about his candidacy for the highest office in the federal republic. It was a demonstration of party solidarity in the face of opposition attacks, and of the obvious need to forge a stronger union between east and west, urged on by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, his heir apparent and party leader in the German parliament. The unresolved strains of unification, and the need to forge a greater sense of national identity and patriotism to overcome them, were the underlying themes of the conference, as the CDU struggles to counter political apathy - above all in east Germany - before an election marathon next year. Membership of all the main political parties is languishing in the eastern states, and both the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) have problems in providing a full slate of candidates in some areas. According to the latest opinion poll, CDU support is only 28 per cent in the five states which constituted the former German Democratic Republic, all with elections in 1994. Mr Heitmann's candidacy for the presidency is seen as part of Mr Kohl's attempt to win back some eastern support, although he is barely known in the east, let alone in the west of the country. He was a Lutheran lay preacher before unification, and his greatest asset, in the eyes of CDU party leaders, is that he had a blameless reputation during the communist years - unlike many other eastern politicians. Yesterday he was persuaded to speak fleetingly to the conference - not enough to demonstrate his political inexperience, but long enough to win sympathy and support from the floor. He spoke emotionally about the 'wonderful experience' of German unification, and said: 'The walls in our heads and in our hearts will not grow higher, if we simply want it.' His nomination by the CDU and its sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, is not yet assured. Mr Theo Waigel, leader of the CSU, showed his sympathy, but insisted that he still wanted to get to know him better. The SPD on Monday formally nominated Mr Johannes Rau, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, as its presidential candidate, which means the election will almost certainly split on party lines. The new president must be chosen next May by an electoral college, to succeed Mr Richard von Weizsacker, who has completed the maximum two terms in office. Deutsche Telekom and Siemens have signed a contract with the Moscow Telephone Company (MGTS) to operate a digital network for mobile phones in the Russian capital, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. DT mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, will participate in a joint venture with MGTS, the public phone operator, InterEWM, a technical institute, and Siemens.

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa on course to resume paying dividend Lufthansa, the German flag-carrying airline, said it expected to make an operating profit this year and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would resume dividend payments. The company, which last paid a dividend on ordinary shares in 1989, updated earlier estimates and reported pre-tax earnings for the first six months of DM105m (Dollars 68.2m) compared with a DM221m deficit last time. Higher sales had been reflected in increased earnings for the first time in years, it said. The same applied to average yields in passenger traffic. Lufthansa, which is preparing for the first tranche of a two-stage rights issue in the next few weeks, is still majority-owned by the German government. However, Bonn has said it will dilute its holding by not taking up its rights, in accordance with its privatisation plans. The airline has been a strong favourite in the German stock market lately, as news of its progress has dribbled out. After crashing to losses of DM426m in 1991, and deficits of DM390m in 1992 and DM92m last year, analysts expect it to earn between DM100m and DM200m net this year. According to the company, a 7.8 per cent cut in the workforce, coupled with increased sales had lifted productivity per employee by 18 per cent over the same part of 1993. Labour costs fell 4 per cent and, although the number of flights rose 7.5 per cent, fuel costs fell. The group, which includes the Condor charter fleet, carried 17.6m passengers in the review period, a rise of 3 per cent. Freight tonnage, a particularly strong performer at its home base in Frankfurt airport, rose 18 per cent. In a separate development, local politicians said the Frankfurt city authorities might be prepared to sell part of their 28.9 per cent stake in Frankfurt airport. Although the Social Democrat administration remains sceptical about privatisation, budget constraints and falling tax revenues have forced it to seek other sources of income. Other main stakeholders in the airport are the government of the state of Hesse, with 45.2 per cent, and the federal government with 25.9 per cent.</p>

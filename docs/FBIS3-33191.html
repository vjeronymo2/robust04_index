Casas  Regueiro heads a ministerial commission which includes the heads  of the Construction and Water Resources Ministries, the Cuban  Institute of Radio and Television, and the construction  materials industry. Their visit, which concluded at noon today,  included socioeconomic projects in Guantanamo and Caimaneras  Municipalities and farming areas of San Antonio del Sur  Municipality.    Div. Gen. Senen Casas told reporters that the two months  since the commission's last visit show significant progress in  recovery efforts and demonstrate the extraordinary efforts of  Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba construction workers despite  supply shortages.    Senen Casas, who is also the transportation minister,  relayed  kudos to the people of Guantanamo on behalf of Commander in  Chief Fidel Castro; Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary  Armed Forces; and the government for the progress they have  achieved in such a short time; however, there is still much to  be done. The ministerial commission oversaw the level of  fulfillment of the recovery effort and the prioritized  socioeconomic program undertaken following the Politburo  committee's visit of April 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the latest  information provided by the State Statistical Bureau, the shift  of surplus farm labor to nonfarm jobs has accelerated noticeably  in China. In 1993, farm workers engaged in secondary and  tertiary industries accounted for 29.8 percent of the total  rural work force, an increase of 9.6 percentage points from  1992. This demonstrates China's new achievements in rural  industrialization.    Since the introduction of reform and opening up, large  numbers of rural workers have abandoned crop planting to work in  village and town enterprises or to engage in industrial,  commercial, and service businesses in other regions. This shift  of labor to other sectors has improved peasants' quality and  incomes, helping to bring capital, technology, and information  to the countryside. Last year was an important year in which  rural China, or even the entire socioeconomic structure, turned  in the direction of the market. It also saw the quickest  transfer of surplus farm labor to nonfarm jobs. The number of  workers thus transferred represented 8.6 percent of the total  rural work force, an increase of 4.3 percentage points from 1992.    Sectorally, industry, construction, commerce, and catering  are the main industries where farm labor is headed. Among farm  workers who shifted to nonfarm jobs in 1993, 31.1 percent went  to the industrial sector, 25.1 percent to the construction  industry, and 17 percent to commercial and catering businesses.  Some also joined the communications and transportation sector,  postal and telecommunications services, and sports, cultural,  and art establishments as job opportunities for these workers  multiplied.    Although men account for most of the workers who transfer to  nonfarm jobs, the number of women involved in such transfers is  increasing. In 1993, women accounted for 33.2 percent of  surplus farm workers who transferred to nonfarm jobs, an  increase of 4.8 percentage points from 1992.    Geographically, the shift within a province decreased in  1993  but that across provincial lines increased. Statistics show  that nationwide, workers who switched to nonfarm jobs within  provinces last year accounted for 80.6 percent of the total work  force thus transferred, while those who shifted to nonfarm jobs  outside their provinces represented 19.4 percent. Judging by  the distribution of such labor in east, central, and west China,  74.1 percent of farm workers went to the east in ever-increasing  numbers, while the percentage of workers moving to central and  west China declined.    In 1993, more farm labor transferred to nonfarm jobs in west  China at a markedly accelerated pace; however, the number of  such workers was still below the national average. Rural  workers engaged in secondary and tertiary industries in all of  west China accounted for 18 percent of the total rural work  force, an increase of 6.7 percentage points from 1992. In 1993,  the number of workers which transferred to nonfarm jobs in west  China represented 7.8 percent of the total work force.    Village and town enterprises continued to expand rapidly,  becoming the main reason for last year's accelerated shift of  surplus farm labor to nonfarm jobs. Nationwide, village and  town enterprises numbered 24 million in 1993, an 18-percent  increase from 1992, and employed 120 million workers.</p>

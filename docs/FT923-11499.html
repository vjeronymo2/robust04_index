			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: 3M breaks run of five declines MINNESOTA Mining and Manufacturing, the diversified US manufacturer known as 3M, broke a string of five quarterly declines in the three months ended June 30. The company reported net income of Dollars 322m, or Dollars 1.47 per share, up 7.6 per cent from Dollars 299m, or Dollars 1.36 per share, a year ago. With nearly half its sales overseas, 3M has been suffering from negative currency effects. But these were offset during the second quarter by a 6 per cent gain in unit volume, improved productivity, lower raw materials costs and a decline in its tax rate. Mr LD DeSimone, chairman, said US unit sales registered their best gain in six quarters with a rise of about 3 per cent. Outside the US, sales increased about 8 per cent. During the first half, net income rose 1.9 per cent to Dollars 610m, or Dollars 2.79 per share, compared with Dollars 599m, or Dollars 2.73 per share, a year ago. Sales were up 2.5 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn from Dollars 6.7bn last year.</p>

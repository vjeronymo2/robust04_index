			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 SPRINTERS NAMED FOR ANCIENT TITLE  </P> <P> With Housebuster injured, the Breeders' Cup Sprint has gone from a race with an  odds-on favorite to a scramble, and a contender might emerge today from the  $100,000 Ancient Title Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The Ancient Title, which is at six furlongs, drew 10 starters.  </P> <P> The favorites are Prospectors Gamble and Sensational Star.  </P> <P> Prospectors Gamble, who won two of three stakes earlier this year at Hollywood  Park, has returned to California from Saratoga, where the 5-year-old roan had a  victory and a fourth-place finish in two tries.  </P> <P> Sensational Star, a former claimer, has increased his earnings to $365,355 with  three consecutive victories, the last two in sprints at Del Mar. He barely  missed the track record for three-quarters of a mile with a time of 1:08 in the  Bing Crosby Handicap.  </P> <P> On Saturday at Santa Anita, Ruhlmann and Lively One will try to earn their way  to the Breeders' Cup for trainer Charlie Whittingham when they run in the  $200,000 Goodwood Handicap, and on Sunday, older fillies and mares will compete  on the grass in the $150,000 Las Palmas Handicap.  </P> <P> Starting today, after approval by the California Horse Racing Board, Santa  Anita will offer its races for betting to Canterbury Downs in Minnesota and  Birmingham Race Course in Alabama. Nevada's race books hope to be plugged into  the same interstate network before the Oak Tree season ends, and all of the  out-of-state bets will be included in the parimutuel pools at Santa Anita.  </P></p>

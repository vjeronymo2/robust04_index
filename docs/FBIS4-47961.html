			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] first vice  chairman, Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka, in a press conference in  Kibungo explains the nature of the Rwandan conflict. [passage  omitted]    The journalists wanted to know what would happen if foreign  military forces came anyway. Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka said that  this would be violation of people in Rwanda and it would be  called an invasion.    Asked as to why the RPF had rejected the UN special envoy in  Rwanda, Mr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh, the RPF vice chairman  replied that the RPF had written to UN secretary general  requesting for a replacement of Booh-Booh for he was found  incapable of handling his present responsibilities. Mr.  Mazimpaka gave examples of how Jacques Roger Booh-Booh had taken  sides in the conflict. [passage omitted] Therefore, Mr.  Mazimpaka said the RPF will have no dealings with the UN while  Jacques Roger Booh-Booh is still in Rwanda.</p>

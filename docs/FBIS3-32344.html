At the same time, the Pemex spokesman denied that the  explosion had resulted in several casualties.    Martinez denied reports disclosed on Saturday by Radio Red,  a  Mexico City radio station, on at least 10 persons having died  and 20 others having been wounded as result of the explosion and  fire at a pipeline located in the municipality of Cunduacan,  near Villahermosa, 600 km southeast of Mexico City. "There were  no fatalities," the Pemex spokesman emphasized, and indicated  that only nine persons were injured as a result of burns,  including Pemex workers and residents of the communities of  Gregorio Mendez and Ranch Nuevo, both which are near the area.    Martinez pointed out that the explosion took place at a gas  pipeline connected to the petroleum installation known as Iride.  He added that the cause of the explosion is "still being  investigated," starting first by cleaning up the area and then  examining materials through laboratory analysis. Pemex  technicians and specialists from the Attorney General's Office  [PGR] are investigating the explosion and fire which resulted in  damages to an area measuring approximately 300 meters, mainly to  trees and pastures, he specified.    A Red Cross spokesperson told AFP on Saturday that the  disaster prompted the evacuation of at least 800 persons living  in the nearby communities whom, according to Mario Martinez,  "have already returned to their homes." He stipulated that  Pemex is also investigating damages to nearby properties. Pemex  will compensate the owners for any damaged property.    The Pemex spokesman acknowledged that the Iride installation  lacked "adequate attention to normal maintenance procedures,"  but attributed this to the fact that peasants in the area "have  blocked entry" to the site by staging constant "protests for  alleged damages" caused by the petroleum plant. "These  installations have been blocked from the first months of 1993 to  date by persons unjustly demanding compensation for alleged  damages," Pemex indicated.    Residents of the region of Cunduacan where Pemex  concentrates  a vast petroleum drilling and production infrastructure have  complained about damage caused by the state-owned company which  they accuse of polluting the area in which they live.</p>

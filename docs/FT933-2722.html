			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / BBC white paper due next year THE GOVERNMENT plans to publish early next year a white paper on the future of the BBC, Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, said last night at a meeting of the Royal Television Society in Cambridge. However, parliamentary approval of legislation might not be completed until 1996. The BBC is to amalgamate its engineering research and development departments from April 1994. The move will result in a net loss of 131 jobs.</p>

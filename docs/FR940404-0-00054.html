			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension rule, 49 CFR part 29, ``Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Governmentwide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants),'' implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' This rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;19.14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special award conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, if an applicant or recipient:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Has a history of poor performance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is not financially stable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Is not otherwise responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Additional requirements may only be imposed provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The nature of the additional requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The nature of the corrective action needed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A copy of such notices shall be sent to the Assistant Secretary for Administration. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;19.15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Metric system of measurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205), declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;19.16  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act, any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;19.17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certifications and representations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

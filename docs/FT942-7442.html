			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Low demand pushes Seiko into the red Seiko, the Japanese watch and clock maker, plunged further into the red during the year to March 31, reporting a 12-month consolidated pre-tax loss of Y6.5bn (Dollars 62m) against a deficit of Y3.4bn a year earlier. The company, which is a world-renowned brand, blamed weak demand for its core products and the costs of restructuring its overseas operations for the gloomy financial report. Revenues of Y334.7bn were down on last year's Y378bn, and earnings per share slipped to a loss of Y59.61 against a loss of Y49.45 last time. The final dividend is unchanged at Y5. Seiko had warned during the year that the recession was having an adverse affect on sales in the domestic market, in the shape of consumer reluctance to buy new watches and lower levels of gift purchases by companies. For the current financial year, Seiko is forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y5bn on sales of Y360bn.</p>

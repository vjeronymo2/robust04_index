			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINIMALISM DEBATE  </P> <P> Concerning Donna Perlmutter's "The Growing Debate Over Minimalism," June 18:  </P> <P> The eminent British composer Benjamin Britten, who was not an academician and  certainly not a minimalist, was asked during an interview about the various  compositional styles of the 20th Century. He replied that "the important thing  is not what style a person composes in but whether the chap has anything to  say."  </P> <P> It seems that about all the academicians and minimalists have to say are  commentaries they give about their music.  </P> <P> KENNETH LEAVENS  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

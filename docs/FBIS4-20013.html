			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 25 KYODO -- North Korea has conveyed  its desire to have International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspectors monitor the refueling of its main nuclear reactor at  the end of this month, an IAEA source said Monday [25 April].    The source said the IAEA has accepted Pyongyang's proposal  and plans to send an advance party to North Korea as early as  Thursday to check and remove security seals on the experimental  reactor. He said their visas have already been prepared.    But the IAEA needs to further sound out North Korea on the  mission, the source said, noting Pyongyang has yet to reply to  the Agency's inquiries.    He said that before sending a full team, the U.N. nuclear  watchdog wants to know whether the offer to allow observation of  the unloading of spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear  facility is merely that, or whether North Korea will also allow  collection of fuel samples to take place.    IAEA spokesman David Kyd told reporters Sunday the Agency is  "not sending a team until we have clarification."    The Agency wants to inspect the spent fuel core of the  Yongbyon reactor to see if any nuclear material has been  diverted for possible use in a covert nuclear weapons  development program.    Sampling can determine if the spent fuel had been in the  Yongbyon reactor since it went on line in 1986, or if the fuel  had been secretly changed.    The reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, three years  before the IAEA made its first nuclear inspection in North Korea.    The IAEA source said North Korea has not responded to a  separate agency request that it also be allowed to inspect a  radiochemical laboratory placed off limits to inspectors in a  visit last month.</p>

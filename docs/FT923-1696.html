			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Arts: Rigoletto and Faust - Opera Northern Ireland Amid a riot of noise and colour the auditorium was filled with a throng of masked revellers. They were the guests at the masquerade, one with horns, several top-hatted, a bare-chested cardinal and a few in drag among them, all heading for what was evidently promising to be a night of uninhibited orgiastic excess. This was the opening of Opera Northern Ireland's new production of Rigoletto. In the last few years the company has been winning a reputation for capturing some of the younger operatic talent. The risk has paid off with a run of shows which have been innovative and eye-catching, successes that have increasingly gone towards a strong company profile. That sense of excitement is in the air again this season. The new Rigoletto has been targetted with a keen eye for the company's adventurous style. Sometimes there were fears that the producer, Tim Coleman, would go too far, but in general he knows when to pull back from the brink and the theatrical expertise on display was considerable: he created real people; the series of duets which is at the heart of this opera put before us a succession of moving encounters. The relationship between Rigoletto and Gilda could hardly have been more tender, the pain they shared after her abduction as clear to see as an open wound. Kimm Julian is arguably too tall and commanding a figure to make an ideal Rigoletto, but the inexperienced Gilda was nicely caught by Susannah Waters. In this production Peter Riberi had no trouble putting across the arrogance of the Duke, although his tenor is on the tense side for Verdi. After the seduction of Gilda he emerged from the shower, the apogee of the narcissistic man in the all-male club of the officers' changing room  - one scene where the producer had overdone it. Rachel Hallawell's notably well-Sung Maddalena and Alan Ewing's Sparafucile were more restrained. With Kenneth Montgomery giving the orchestra a decisive lead, the opera built to a powerful conclusion. The scene of Gilda's midnight murder, strikingly designed by Lez Brotherston and lit by Paul Pyant, was theatre at its most compelling: the thunderstorm roared from the pit, while Sparafucile stood in the moonlight, refreshing himself in the rain and washing the blood from his body. Chilling stuff. The other opera was a revival of Faust. This amounts to a less daring vision of Gounod's opera, but the production never muffs any of the difficult moments and has its own touches of originality. The steeples of a medieval German town loom over a market-place and the drama is enacted there, watched by the townsfolk. Using the spoken dialogue was also a bold step. The outstanding feature here was the singing of Maureen O'Flynn as Marguerite, whose beautiful soprano with its effortless top was a constant pleasure. Claude Corbeil was the sensitive tenor, who has the makings of a fine Faust if only he can master his nerves. Guy Belanger made a stylish Mephistopheles, for whom Enid Hartle's devilishly naughty Marthe looked more than a match. Karl Morgan Daymond played a nicely insolent Valentin, with a good top to the voice. The high standard of the Ulster Orchestra's playing, this time under Stephen Barlow, was again an asset; the chorus is a weaker feature. On this year's showing Opera Northern Ireland is on the right track and its aspirations deserve wholehearted encouragement.</p>

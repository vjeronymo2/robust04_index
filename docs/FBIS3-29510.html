			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Japan's beef imports in the  first nine months of fiscal 1993 already exceeded the record  amount imported in the whole of fiscal 1992, the Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said in a preliminary report  Friday [18 February].    The ministry said imports in the April-December period  totaled 437,000 tons, rising 25.7 percent from a year earlier  and topping the annual record of 423,000 tons set in fiscal 1992.    Imports in fiscal 1993, ending March 31, are expected to  total 550,000 tons, the ministry forecast.    Japan liberalized beef imports in 1991 and reduced tariffs  in  1992 and 1993. Imported beef is used mostly by restaurant  chains.    The ministry said beef imports are expected to continue  increasing in the coming years, since Japan agreed in December  at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to further reduce the  tariffs to 38.5 percent from the present 50 percent in the six  years beginning 1995.</p>

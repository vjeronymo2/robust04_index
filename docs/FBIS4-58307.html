			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait, 1 May -- Two political advisers at the  National Assembly have agreed that the visit currently being  paid to Arab Maghreb countries by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir  al-Sabah, the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  was a new and serious turning-point in Kuwait's foreign policy  toward anti-coalition countries. [passage omitted]    Deputy 'Abdallah al-Shayiji said that the visit had the  support of the National Assembly, which was consulted on the  contents and aims of the visit -- this would increase the  chances of its success. He said that al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah,  the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister would brief  the Foreign Affairs Committee at the National Assembly at the  end of his tour on the outcome of his talks with officials in  the countries he had visited.    He added that the anti-coalition countries should not be  dealt with in one way due to the variation in their stances from  the early days of the Iraqi aggression until the subsequent  liberation. These countries should be divided into categories  and dealt with separately in a way that suited the amount of  damage they have caused to the State of Kuwait.    Al-Shayiji said that those countries could be categorized as  follows: A category that includes Arab Maghreb countries, a  second category that includes Sudan, a third that includes  Yemen, and a fourth category that includes the PLO and Jordan.  He clarified that the first category was prepared at this stage  for an intensive Kuwaiti move at all official, popular,  academic, and media levels through delegations that would  exchange visits between the two sides.    Deputy Dr. 'Abd al-Ridha al-'Asiri said that it was high  time  Kuwait reformulated the national target of its foreign policy  and to look to the future from the nation's interest rather than  emotions. He added that the foreign minister's visit was a  change in tactics and not in strategy.    Dr. al-'Asiri called for a united stance by legislative and  executive powers regarding Kuwait's foreign policy through  dialogue and consultation between the government and the  National Assembly before any step is taken in this regard.    Al-'Asir said that the success of the foreign minister's  visit would depend on the Arab Maghreb countries support for all  UN resolutions against Iraq, including the recognition of the  new border demarcation between Iraq and Kuwait, and the return  of POWs and detainees held in Iraqi prisons, and the recognition  of international legitimacy.    Al-Shayiji said that the Foreign Affairs Committee at the  Kuwaiti National Assembly was in the process of preparing a  working paper on Kuwait's foreign policy for the next period, to  be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Rudolf Serkin - Obituary Rudolf Serkin died in Vermont on May 8, aged 88, and with his death the 20th century has lost one of its greatest pianists. He was born in Bohemia in 1903 of Russian parents, studied in Vienna (where one of his composition teachers was Schoenberg) and made his debut with the Vienna Symphony at the age of 12. It was a concert with the Busch Chamber Orchestra in Berlin in 1920, though, that led to his enduring association with the Busch family. He became Adolf Busch's recital partner in duos and trios, appeared regularly with the Busch Quartet and married Adolf's daughter Irene in 1935; their son Peter, has become a challenging pianist in his own right. In 1939 the Serkins emigrated to the United States, where he was to become head of piano at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and in 1950 to start the Marlboro Music Festival and School with Adolf and Hermann Busch. While Serkin established his reputation as one of the most authoritative and musically disciplined interpreters of the Viennese tradition, he was also from his earliest days a superlative chamber musician, first within the Busch dynasty but later with other distinguished groups such as the Budapest Quartet. He was never a flamboyant technician; his piano tone was always eloquent rather than seductive. But he was a profound thinking musician who placed his considerable powers strictly at the service of the music he respected so deeply. Though his programmes ranged into the dustier corners of the repertory, including the piano works of Mendelssohn, Reger and Strauss, Serkin's art was always centred upon the Viennese classics; his Mozart piano concertos (he returned to them in his 80s for a last series of recordings with Abbado) had limpid grace and lyrical strength, his Beethoven was searching, never pedantic, his Schubert often starkly dramatic. Perhaps his accounts of the Brahms concertos demonstrated his intellectual grasp most magnificently, with their ability to encompass rhetorical grandeur and the most careful introspection in a single dramatic sweep. In his last years his performances were sometimes erratic, pared down to the point of gruffness, but the dedication and self-effacing demeanour of his playing remained. And at its best it could still sustain a tradition that appears to us now as descended from a golden age, which had fashioned Serkin into one of its peerless interpreters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 17 Jun (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) is expected to hold eight ministerial portfolios in  the new government, with the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ)  heading the remaining 4 ministries, according to the latest news  of coalition talks. The MSZP won 209 of the total 386 seats in  the recent elections, while the SZDSZ took 69.    It is almost certain that in the coalition, or as the  parties  themselves define it, "common government," MSZP President Gyula  Horn will be appointed prime minister. Gabor Kuncze, SZDSZ  parliamentary party leader and prime ministerial candidate, will  fill the newly created post of "coalition deputy prime  minister." However, according to the Constitution law, it is  not the coalition deputy prime minister who will replace the  prime minister in the case of his absence, but the minister of  finance and economy, Laszlo Bekesi. The new, re-structured  Ministry of Finance and Economy will have increased  responsibilities compared to the present Ministry of Finance.    The privatisation process may also be managed by Bekesi,  dubbed the MSZP's "economics guru." Bekesi was responsible for  the party's economic manifesto and was finance minister in the  Nemeth government of 1988-89.    Of the ministries, Gabor Kuncze is likely to head the  Ministry of Interior, and another SZDSZ member, Gabor Fodor, the  Ministry of Culture and Education.    A Socialist politician is expected to head the Ministry of  Labour. The Ministry of International Economic Relations will  be integrated with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, where the  minister is expected to be Socialist politician Laszlo Pal. His  name has also been mentioned as the possible head of a unified  State Property Agency (SPA)-State Holding Company (AV Rt).    An SZDSZ politician is expected to head the Ministry of  Infrastructure, which will be formed from the Ministry of  Transport, Telecommunications and Water Management. The  minister of justice is also expected to be appointed from the  SZDSZ, although according to some sources the SZDSZ is seeking  to exchange this portfolio for the Speaker of Parliament. The  Socialists' candidate for speaker is Zoltan Gal. If he is  appointed, then the deputy speaker(s) may be Alajos Dornbach  from the SZDSZ, and/or Peter Boross, the outgoing prime  minister. Since the SZDSZ has refused the defence portfolio  offered by the Socialists, this position is also expected to be  filled by the MSZP.    Pal Kovacs and Laszlo Kovacs, both MSZP, are expected to  head  the Ministry of Welfare and the Foreign Ministry repectively.  The minister of agriculture is also expected to be an MSZP  politician, Laszlo Lakos.    Two candidates, Gyorgy Keleti (MSZP) and Imre Mecs (SZDSZ)  are running for the post of the minister of defence. The head  of the environmental protection portfolio is expected to be  former Expo commissioner Etele Barath.    The number of ministers without portfolio is expected to be  reduced to 1 or 2, and the present internal structure of the  ministries maintained. The arrangement of public administration  state secretaries, who organise political and professional  activities of the ministries, will also remain. However, the  state secretary positions remain an area of dispute, the  question being whether or not the secretary should be from the  same party as the minister.</p>

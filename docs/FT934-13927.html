			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (6): A focus for liberalisation - Offshore trusts OFFSHORE trusts play an important role in the Bermudian economy, as a long-standing and significant part of the international business attracted to the country, and most recently as a focal point for the gradual liberalisation of its protectionist policies. While this year's telephone directory has no entry for Coutts &amp; Co, the banking group, in the centre of Hamilton, the company's building is prominent. John Ritchie, its managing director, began work in early January, days after changes in the law became effective and Coutts was granted permission to establish a presence on the island. Figures compiled by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the country's financial regulator, show that last year there were 24 applications for trust company licences. By the end of 1992, 22 companies had been licensed, including 15 existing local companies, six newly-incorporated local companies and one newly incorporated exempted company. The intense secrecy of trusts - with no public disclosure of any meaningful value - means no reliable figures are available on the number administered from Bermuda. But it runs into several thousand, with most held by the banks. The recent expansion in trust administrations would not have been possible until very recently. Following an announcement by the finance minister that liberalisation was to permit the entry into the market of new trust companies, and about two years of discussions, a new trust law was passed in 1991. Until that time, the market was controlled by a few entities - most notably the three local banks, the Bank of Bermuda, the Bank of Butterfield and the Bermuda Commercial Bank. During the previous two decades, the authorities have all but frozen new applications from trust companies. The government decided to pass the law in spite of some resistance, while granting the banks the concession that their new rivals would not gain deposit-taking powers. In some quarters, the concerns linger on. Cumming Zuill of the Bank of Bermuda, says: 'I think it will affect us. The sector will be harder to control, leave more room for error, pressure on infrastructure, and we will lose staff.' But Coutts' Mr Ritchie denies that the entry of new trust companies will squeeze existing business. 'We're going to be out there promoting Bermuda. With that marketing, the cake will get larger,' he says. Aside from the new entrants, competition is growing between the existing entities involved in administration. All the different service providers argue for the strengths of their own type of expertise in trust work. Richard Pearman of Conyers, Dill and Pearman, one of the biggest law firms on the island, says: 'We are individuals, not monolithic corporate trustees. We emphasise a continuing personal relationship.' Diana Kempe of Appleby, Spurling and Kempe, the other large Bermudian law firm, says: 'Our services are cheaper. We have no acceptance and termination fees, and less sophisticated structures.' Mr Zuill says: 'We have more formality and structure. The larger banks are too big, and not responsive because it is not their principal business. This is a very personal business. You have to be sensitive to the needs of the client.' The nature of the products is also changing. Traditionally, most trust business has been personal, involving either the passive holding of individuals' assets - such as race horses, oil paintings and property - or active management of their money. Malcolm Williams, general manager-secretary of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, says interest has been growing recently in offshore trusts throughout the world, driven by concerns such as an increasingly 'fortress' Europe, the changes in the former eastern bloc countries, and the Gulf War. uncertainty over the future of Hong Kong in the hands of China after 1997 has persuaded many residents to place their personal assets offshore in jurisdictions such as Bermuda, and many are redomiciling their companies on the island. 'Business tends to reflect international misfortunes,' says Mr Williams. 'When there are changes in government or turmoil, it makes people think about protecting their assets.' But Bermuda benefits from other unusual types of trusts. The special purpose trust allows for a beneficiary beyond those conventionally allowed - namely person or a charity. Purpose trusts can make a company the beneficiary, creating what Donald Malcolm of Conyers calls 'a true orphan'. These entities classify for relief as foreign sales corporations under US tax rules. One of the more common uses is for aircraft leasing. By placing the aircraft into such a trust, it can escape the clutches of a liquidator if the leasee collapses, providing reassurance to bankers. This was used recently by GPA, the Irish leasing company which narrowly escaped formal insolvency proceedings. Mr Zuill says pension trusts are also being established in Bermuda, designed by companies for international executives moving between countries, each with different pension requirements. Meanwhile, there is pressure for the development of asset protection trusts, by which individuals - often professionals likely to face negligence lawsuits - place their assets outside the control of creditors, sometimes in the knowledge that they have been or are about to be sued. 'I'm not entirely happy with those,' says Mr Ritchie. 'They rely on knowing a great deal. We as a group are very careful. They are not a vehicle we are encouraging.'</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Telecoms newcomer wins full licence THE first direct competitor to British Telecommunications and Mercury under government plans to open up the telecoms market was given the go-ahead yesterday, Tony Jackson writes. Ionica, a privately-owned company, has been granted a licence to run a radio-based system across the country. It aims to take 5 per cent of the household and small-business market within 10 years. Mr Nigel Playford, managing director, said: 'We aim to undercut BT across the board.' Ionica was one of four companies awarded a provisional licence in August. The others - Millicom, Worldcom and National Network - are still in discussion with the government. Draft licences were announced yesterday for a further six companies: Vodafone, Millicom, ScottishPower, Scottish Hydro, Telecom Electric and City of London Telecommunications. Ionica's shareholders are Yorkshire Electricity, Northern Electric, Ivory &amp; Sime, 3i, Robert Fleming, Kingston Communications and Symbionics.</p>

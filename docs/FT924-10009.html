			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey warns on funds for training MANAGERS in a survey published by the Industrial Society have warned the government strongly not to cut publicly funded training programmes and initiatives. Most managers, according to the survey, believed that possible cuts in funding for Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which administer publicly funded training, would damage training. Nearly a quarter said such a move would be 'very damaging'. Tecs, with growing numbers of unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, have asked that no cuts be made to their budget of Pounds 2.4bn a year. According to the survey of 528 companies, there has been a dip over the past six months in training spending by companies. Many trade unions would like to negotiate on training, but the survey said that only 6 per cent of managers in the survey treated training as a matter for negotiation with unions and only a further 2 per cent were considering it. Nearly two thirds of the companies surveyed described their companies as largely 'traditional' at present in terms of industrial relations, but 52 per cent expected their companies to cut management layers and move towards 'empowering' individuals.

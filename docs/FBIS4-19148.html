			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A number of issues dealing with the  military have surfaced in the Portuguese press.  <H5>  Offsets for F-16's </H5>   Writing in the 19 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, military  affairs specialist Jose Vegar contends that the Ministry of  Defense "inexplicably" gave up its right to more offsets in the  negotiations for the purchase of 20 U.S.-made F-16 Lockheed  fighter aircraft. While at the outset Portugal expected some  $100 million, Vegar cites a "high U.S. official" as saying that  the company will only pay $42 million. He also cites Ministry of  Defense sources as stating that negotiations are ongoing and  that Portugal expects offsets of about $90 million. The issue  surfaced at the end of 1992, when the United States announced  that Portugal would have to pay $173 million for the F-16  aircraft Washington refused to consider part of the payment for  the use of the Azores' Lajes air base. Lisbon agreed, expecting  that offsets would be offered by the manufacturer, "as is the  practice," Vegar continues. However, Lockheed was "evasive"  throughout 1993, prompting the Portuguese minister of defense to  notify the company that unless offsets were not negotiated until  1 December 1993, the deal was off. Following a recent visit to  Lisbon by a Lockheed team, which initially offered $18 million,  the Ministry of Defense agreed to accept $42 million. Vegar  cites an unidentified Portuguese high official involved in the  negotiations as explaining the changes that took place in the  ministry--notably the departure of State Secretary of Defense  Eugenio Ramos--influenced the "final outcome," given that the  Portuguese negotiators were "less familiar" with the issue,  whose real importance they were not aware of. Vegar regrets that  Portugal concluded the agreement, for the threat to cancel it  was Lisbon's only trump card.  <H5>  Lajes Issue Revisited </H5>   According to an article in the 22 March Lisbon daily  PUBLICO,  the Lajes cooperation agreement between the United States and  Portugal will be signed at the end of July. The only issue  pending at this time is the labor agreement, despite the fact  that the United States has finally agreed that labor relations  will be regulated on the basis of Portuguese legislation.  Notably absent from the agreement is the issue of "financial  offsets" for the Lajes base use, which will be the subject of  two distinct formulations: the first will be in the context of  NATO, while the second will relate to specific U.S. interests,  with the use of the base reviewed case by case.  <H5>  Missiles, Machine Guns Acquisition </H5>   Jose Vegar notes in the 12 March SEMANARIO that following  the  refusal by the United States to furnish Stinger missiles to  Portugal as compensation for the Lajes base, the government will  soon open the acquisition of ground-to-air missiles and  target-detecting equipment to international bidding. According  to Vegar, who contends that the Stinger missiles were already  "antiquated," competition will be harsh, with the Short Missile  System (SMS) British-French company formed by the Short and  Thomson firms and the French Matra company already squaring off  for the fight ahead.    Meanwhile, bidding for the new 5.56 machine gun to replace  the old G-3's is progressing, Vegar continues. The defense firm  INDEP has already submitted its report to Minister of Defense  Fernando Nogueira, who has decided that the issue should be  classified "top secret." The companies vying for the contract  will be invited to detail the offsets they are willing to offer.  According to Vegar, INDEP has evaluated the various types of  weapons in the competition and is now awaiting Nogueira's  "political" decision, which reportedly involves the U.S. Colt,  the Israeli Galil, and the Austrian Steyr companies.  <H5>  Scarcity of Volunteers </H5>   According to the 1 April Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, Fernando  Nogueira's plan to limit compulsory military service to four  months for all branches of the armed forces has run into  difficulties because of the lack of volunteers. In addition,  according to a military source cited by EXPRESSO, volunteers are  refusing to serve in areas other than those where they reside.  As a result, the government has decided to increase military  service to seven months for recruits who will serve in the  medical services. It should be noted that in general, military  officials have disagreed with the reduction of military service  on grounds that it is "technically impracticable."</p>

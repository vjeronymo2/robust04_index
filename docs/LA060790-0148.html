			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GIANTS REGAIN THEIR WINNING WAYS AND COMPLETE SWEEP OF REDS  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants appear to be swinging back into the form that made  them National League champions last season.  </P> <P> The Giants became the first team to win a series against the Cincinnati Reds  when Kevin Mitchell hit a home run off Rob Dibble with two out in the 11th  inning Wednesday at San Francisco to give the Giants a 3-2 victory.  </P> <P> The Giants extended their winning streak to six games by sweeping the Reds,  whose 33-15 record is the best in the majors.  </P> <P> "I thought I'd see a fastball and I hit it pretty good," said Mitchell, who has  15 homers. "I was lucky to get a hold of it."  </P> <P> Will Clark's 10th homer, a solo shot in the ninth off Randy Myers, tied the  score, 2-2. Mitchell's homer off Dibble (3-1) marked the first time in 29 games  that the Reds lost when leading after eight innings.  </P> <P> Paul O'Neill hit his seventh homer for the Reds, who have an 11-game lead over  the fourth-place Giants in the West.  </P> <P> Reliever Jeff Brantley (2-1) earned the victory, retiring Ron Oester on a  grounder with runners on first and second to end the Reds' 11th.  </P> <P> San Diego 3, Houston 2 -- Garry Templeton capped a three-run ninth inning with  a two-out single at San Diego as the Padres handed the Astros' their sixth  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Joe Carter hit his ninth homer, a two-run shot off Mark Portugal (1-6). Glenn  Davis supplied all of the Astros' runs with his 17th homer, his seventh in six  games.  </P> <P> New York 4, Montreal 3 -- Frank Viola yielded seven hits in seven innings at  New York to become the first National League pitcher to win nine games.  </P> <P> Viola (9-2) struck out six and walked two. John Franco pitched the ninth for  his ninth save.  </P> <P> Howard Johnson hit his ninth homer for the Mets.  </P> <P> St. Louis 12, Philadelphia 11 -- Willie McGee's two-run double capped a  three-run rally in the 10th inning at St. Louis as reliever Frank DiPino (3-0)  earned his 14th consecutive victory since June 9, 1988.  </P> <P> The Phillies' Len Dykstra had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 19 games  and finished the night at a major league-leading .415.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 1 -- Andy Van Slyke's three-run homer keyed a five-run  first inning for the Pirates, who completed a three-game sweep at Pittsburgh in  a game called in the middle of the seventh after a rain delay.  </P> <P> Doug Drabek (8-2) pitched a five-hitter as the Pirates beat the Cubs for the  seventh consecutive time.  </P> <P> Greg Maddux (4-6) suffered his fifth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson hit his 14th homer for the Cubs.  </P></p>

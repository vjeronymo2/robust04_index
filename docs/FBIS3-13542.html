			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij has stated that  there can be no going back on the security measures, because in  addition to expressing the will of the Lebanese people, these  measures were the result of a decision by the government and the  state institutions, primarily the Army. In an interview with  AL-NAHAR, Mirhij said the security operation targets no  individual. It covers all parts of the country.    Referring to the so-called siege on Samir Ja'ja', he said  there is no siege on Ja'ja'; the proof lies in his receiving  people and making statements. He added that the barriers laid  around Ghidras could be for the purpose of preventing suspects  or wanted people from going to or leaving Ghidras.    Responding to remarks by Ja'ja' that he has no wanted  persons, the interior minister said that in this case there is  no problem, because the barriers are not against Ja'ja'  personally. Why then is every security incident being utilized  for political purposes that are contrary to the country's  interests? There is an attempt to make the people feel that  they are a target of attack. This is wrong. The security  operation aims to maintain the security of the citizen, not to  harm him.    Mirhij said that reports about legal violations during the  detention operations are unfounded speculation, because the  security authorities operate under the law.    Asked how long the security measures in Ghidras will  continue  and whether they are concrete, Mirhij said: When the Army wants  to enter, it will enter Ghidras and the home of Ja'ja'. Every  Lebanese house is a house for the Army. We will bring out the  criminals and security violators from any figure or official's  house. He added that talk of making Ja'ja' a hero is  supposition. If people go to him, it means he is not under  siege. There is no one we would want to cancel out politically  unless he cancels himself out. Let everyone abide by the laws  and national accord and no one will cancel him out.    Answering a question, Mirhij denied that the authorities  overlooked events in Ba'labakk. He said: We are pursuing the  perpetrators. What happened there has been exaggerated to make  the state appear biased.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Kravchuk turns to old guard in election race President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine yesterday won parliamentary approval for a stalwart of the former communist elite to become prime minister, in what appeared to be an effort to draw support from leftist and eastern voters for his re-election bid later this month. The appointment of Mr Vitaly Masol, who advocates a state-controlled economy and closer ties with Russia, was backed by 199 of the 335 deputies, with 24 opposing him. Many market reformers and nationalists abstained from participating in 'the lurch back to the communist system', as one put it. Mr Masol served as prime minister of Soviet Ukraine from 1987 to 1990. He was forced out of office in protests that delivered the first blow to the Communist party's absolute rule in Ukraine. It is unclear what Mr Masol, as a powerful prime minister, would bring Ukraine. In his bid for parliamentary approval he astonished delegates by saying Ukraine 'is a state with market reforms' and that 'we cannot act by traditional methods'. Last month he urged the restoration of strict state controls and condemned Ukraine's leadership for 'liberalising prices . . . exiting the rouble zone . . . (and) cutting credits to industry'. Mr Masol's return to the premiership reflects Mr Kravchuk's vulnerability in the presidential vote on June 26, where he is trailing Mr Leonid Kuchma, an industrialist who is popular in the Russian-oriented eastern Ukraine. Mr Kravchuk can bank on votes from western Ukraine, where a strong body of nationalists back him. Ukrainian nationalists fought against Mr Kravchuk in the 1991 election but now see Mr Kuchma's pro-Russian position as a threat to independence. The president's position in the west was also helped by the signing of an accord with the European Union on Tuesday. However, Mr Kravchuk is desperately seeking support in the more densely populated east, where the mood is increasingly pro-Russian and pro-communist. On Monday he adopted the eastern call to make Russian an official language along with Ukrainian.</p>

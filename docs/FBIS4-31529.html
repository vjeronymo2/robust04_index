			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A.K.: "Economists on `Strategy for Poland'; </F> Neither a Plan nor a Declaration"]    [Text] "It is not my ambition to go down in history. I do,  however, want to resolve a few problems that are a burden on the  economy. I will not allow a few dozen other issues to be  included in this program. I have selected 10," said Deputy  Prime Minister Kolodko after hearing economists' questions and  remarks concerning the "Strategy for Poland." The deputy prime  minister took part in a meeting at the Polish Economic Society,  which was held on 8 June in Warsaw.    Many controversies were aroused by the unemployment  counteracting program. A decrease in the unemployment rate,  which was envisioned in the program, to a level of 14 percent  was said to be too low. It was also stressed that it is not  possible to lower the inflation rate and the unemployment rate  at the same time. The goal to work toward should be to lower  unemployment, whereas combating inflation is merely a means  leading to the achievement of this goal. Therefore, a "monetary  expansion" should not be feared.    Many statements suggested that the "Strategy for Poland" is  too optimistic. Participants of the meeting listed the  conditions that should be met so that implementation of the  programs is possible--"to mobilize savings"; "to extend the  investment blockade"; "to increase the inflow of foreign capital  and to create conditions for investors"; "to improve the  competitiveness of the economy and, following the Japanese  model, to set up a foreign trade council"; "to immediately  embark on a program of investing in human capital"; "to extend  the guarantees for deposits in all banks"; "to prepare  substitute policies, when it turns out that, for instance, there  are new possibilities."    As Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko said, the "Strategy for  Poland" is supposed to inform both households and all companies,  as well as foreign investors, about the intentions of the Polish  Government. They should know what they can count on. This is  exemplified by the tax on immovable property, which has been  blown up into sensational news, despite the fact that work on it  was started by previous governments. The ministry is conducting  such work; however, it will be the Sejm that decides what taxes  and when they will be introduced. We want to develop housing,  said the deputy prime minister, and we will not tamper with the  fiscal system in such a way as to impede this sector.    There exist very acute conflicts between employment and  inflation or between unemployment and inflation. These are more  political than economic decisions. The "Strategy for Poland"  proposes lowering these two rates, both the inflation rate and  the unemployment rate, which is possible. Right now, however,  it seems that of greater importance is the quicker lowering of  the inflation rate--to less than 10 percent by 1997. This is  more real than lowering the unemployment rate to this level.    The government is not going to grant a state loan, as was  done, for example, before World War II for implementation of the  program. The country's debts are too great debt to afford such  measures. Therefore, I do not want to accept credits without any  consideration, the deputy prime minister said.    The announced consolidation of banks, which also causes  concern, is indispensable because of competition. Even the  largest Polish companies are simply small compared to Western  firms. It is not true that there are surpluses in this year's  budget. The revenues are indeed greater. However, for example,  the valorization of retirement and disability pensions costs 2.5  trillion zlotys [Z] a month, which totals approximately Z30  trillion per year. The budget participates in this. Now, if it  turned out that there are really some surpluses, I would prefer  to spend them primarily in such a way as to partially lessen the  debt burden of the education or health sector, said Deputy Prime  Minister Kolodko.    Grzegorz Kolodko said that, for the time being, there is no  need to amend the budget, which does not mean, however, that  there cannot be any changes in the future. "I will certainly  not propose it this month," he said.</p>

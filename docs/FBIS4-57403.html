			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marieta Cabrera] </F>   [Text] At 0900 on 18 May, the ARC [expansion unknown]  Gloria, flagship of the Colombian Navy, which is visiting Cuba  for a second time, put in at the port of the Cuban Revolutionary  Navy's [MGR] General Staff. The crew, headed by Captain (Eduardo  Otero Erazo), was greeted by Colombian Ambassador Ricardo  Santamaria and Captain (Martin Jodar), chief of the MGR General  Staff, who welcomed the ship to Cuban territory. Over the past  25 years, this Colombian Navy ship has visited 48 countries on  five continents. Cuba is the second stop in this year's  eight-nation tour which began with Kingston, Jamaica.    As regards the ship's goals, the ship's captain said the  following:    [Begin recording] [(Otero)] I believe it is going to be a  very interesting visit, which will serve to further reaffirm the  ties of friendship and fraternity that exist between the peoples  of Colombia and Cuba.    [Cabrera] Why was Cuba selected?    [(Otero)] I believe Cuba was selected because it is one of  the most important cultures in Latin America, and also to  reaffirm the ties of friendship between the two countries. [end  recording]    The flagship's crew met with Rear Admiral Pedro Perez  Betancourt, chief of the MGR, who expressed to the Colombian  crew the interest the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] minister  and the chief of the General Staff have in this visit. He also  discussed the naval history of the two nations and weather  conditions en route to Cuba.    During their stay, the visitors will have a busy agenda  which  includes meeting members of the FAR and the population in  general while the ship is open to visitors.</p>

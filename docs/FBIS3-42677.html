			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with E.A. Pamfilova, former minister of social </F> protection of the population of Russia, by Galina Valyuzhenich,  under the rubric "Moment for a Moral Choice"; place and date not  given: "Why Ella Pamfilova Left"]    [Text] We can hardly name a statesman whose resignation was  received by the common people as painfully as the departure of  Ella Pamfilova from her position. Her name is associated with  the notions of kindness and justice which the people now lack so  badly. This is why people are calling, writing, and coming to  us. Some ask with hope: "Is it really true? Could this be yet  another rumor?" Others, aware of a good relationship between  herself and our editorial office, plead: "Could you influence  her?" A group of retirees visiting the editorial office was more  categorically minded: "We will not let this happen: We are  collecting signatures, we will go to Yeltsin himself. See what  she has thought up--to abandon us!"    Hope, regret, pain, and disappointment ("she betrayed  us")--everything has become intertwined.    Even when I was in the lobby awaiting her return from the  president they approached me with just one request: Persuade  her, talk her into staying on.    To tell you the truth, I was certain that the president  would  not accept her resignation. However, he did.    [Valyuzhenich] Ella Aleksandrovna, did you not decide to  resign the ministerial post on an impulse?    [Pamfilova] No. It was neither on an impulse nor "to keep  others company." I thought about this step for a long time, and  it was not simple for me to take. My departure is a protest  against disgracing the idea of the current reforms, which are  becoming increasingly criminally-distributive,  officialdom-oriented in nature. In essence, dealing with the  consequences of an inconsistently implemented policy, I spent  two years putting out fires. I consider it dishonest to  participate in the implementation of a policy which I do not  subscribe to and for which I cannot be held responsible, and my  responsibilities are too great. It is impossible to protect the  people without an opportunity to influence the elimination of  the main causes engendering their defenselessness.    Destructive processes are mounting in the social sphere. The  system of compensation for labor in sectors financed from the  budget does not make it possible even for healthy young men with  high levels of qualification to support their families. The  phenomenon of a suicide epidemic has appeared, mainly among the  men of the household.    Stressful situations--fear of losing a job, lack of funds  for  the most basic existence--anger people. As they get embittered,  parents frequently take out their anger on their children. Do  you know how many children now run away from home to escape the  wrath of their parents? I know. What is happening to the  technical professionals, who were initially democratic and  progressively minded, those who are not adept at stealing and  engaging in speculation?... People are sinking to the bottom,  becoming alcoholics, and growing brutal. Work-related injuries  are increasing; more and more disabled children are being born.  Therefore, the ranks of my wards--those who are morally and  physically crippled, orphans, invalids, and beggars--are being  replenished every day, if not every hour. Rather than a  nondescript mass, I see specific people with shattered lives  behind the passionless numbers of statistical reports which few  are concerned about. Perhaps this is the reason why it is so  painful for me to witness how our unsinkable bureaucracy is  getting fat against the background of the growing impoverishment  of the people.    A situation is possible whereby retirees will be unable to  receive even the retirement benefits guaranteed to them in the  environment of a slump in production and nonpayments by  enterprises, when less and less money is being taken in by the  Retirement Fund and the number of retirees is increasing. How  will I look people in the eye? I do not want to be responsible  for the mistakes and miscalculations of others.    My departure is not a betrayal of the people who expect help  from me. It is a fight for them. As I see it, it would be a  betrayal to fail to live up to their expectations, to give  hope--and as a result fail to provide the barest necessities. My  departure is a form of protest by which I would like to attract  attention to the fact that social policy cannot be reduced  solely to emergency measures aimed at eliminating particular  social evils, and that the measures currently proposed by the  government will only worsen the situation.    [Valyuzhenich] History is aware of various forms of protest  all the way to self-immolation; however, hardly anyone will be  able to reliably determine how effective they are. Would you  perhaps have a greater opportunity to influence the coordination  of the policy pursued if you remained a minister?    [Pamfilova] The whole point is that I would not. I have  already said repeatedly that the functions of sectoral  ministries have been reduced to the level of dispatchers. All  major policy decisions are made behind closed doors, by a narrow  circle of advisers close to the prime minister. We have been  assigned the roles of extras. Verbal populism in the government  milieu is growing, but when it comes to making specific  decisions everything that does not reflect the interests of  certain corporate groups is torpedoed.    The last election made us understand that many mistakes were  made in the policy pursued. It would appear that we should have  sat down and analyzed them. Alas, nobody did this.... The  meetings of the government still consider small, narrow issues.    At times, the situation borders on the absurd. For example,  I  cannot get an appointment with Chernomyrdin. Indeed, do not look  surprised. I do not remember how many times I have signed up....  On one occasion I could not stand it and came to see him on  Saturday without an appointment. So, what do you think? I waited  by the door for a whole day....    It even became hard to write in the press. Recently I called  a press conference at the government press center, at which I  was sharply critical. After I left, the journalists were  instructed to provide no information in the press. My outrage  with all of this has reached the limit. Under such  circumstances, how can I influence policy coordination and the  making of vital decisions? Even while holding the position of  minister I was bound hand and foot.    What could I actually do if I retained my position? Open  free  canteens for the increasing number of beggars, shelters for the  homeless, and orphanages for stray children? "Hack out" bonuses  on top of retirement benefits and allowances which depreciate  instantly, before they get to their recipients? For example, we  had a great fight to increase the bonus for retirees effective  in February, and we ensured this. I am ashamed to mention the  amount--8,000. And this is happening in the environment of our  inflation! How would you like me to look old people in the eye?  What am I to tell them? This is just one example of the  implementation of a strict financial policy. However, should it  be tightened at the expense of minimum social guarantees? Is it  really hard to understand that a social explosion is just one  step away from this policy? I am pained and annoyed by my  failure to convince the government that social policy is not an  inflationary factor, not an impediment to reforms but rather the  heart, the engine of them.    Recently I was called from a boarding school for crippled  children and told that there was nothing to feed the children.  They were down to one barrel of pickles. Can you believe  this?--I did not even have an opportunity to help them because,  you see, I am "not supposed" to dispose of funds allocated from  the budget at my own discretion. For a whole year I hacked out  $2 million for an orthopedic prosthesis factory in order to  manufacture hands, feet, and footwear for the handicapped.... A  whole year! Meanwhile, they are blowing hundreds of millions of  dollars on repairing the White House and purchasing imported  furniture. What is this? Is this not a feast in a time of famine?    No sooner had I left than they took away from the Social  Support Fund, which reports to the ministry, the former party  dachas in Uspenskoye which had been transferred to it at one  point. We had leased out the dachas and organized recreation for  crippled children with the proceeds. The money will now be  pumped out of the dachas by those who deposit it in personal  accounts at foreign banks.    Under the pretext of the election results, powerful  "advocates of the state," for whom the main point is to preserve  the system of allocation by officials as the principal source of  gain, are now getting a grip on power. They are concerned about  the redistribution of large properties, privatization,  laundering of petrodollars generated through illegal  transactions.... Do they have time for the suffering of the  common man?    At present, the grabbing instinct is as developed as ever  because there are things to grab. Compared to current abuses,  those of the past appear to be child's play. Meanwhile, there is  much talk about fighting corruption in the upper echelons of  power, but all of this is verbiage, verbiage, verbiage.... The  same corrupt bureaucracy bound by mutual guarantees holds sway.    I believe that those in power should set their moral,  ethical  standards very high, and should share with the people many of  our objective differences. The authorities should be pure and  honest. Only in this case will people respect and support them.    [Valyuzhenich] Your civic position is understandable.  However, as they say, one always chooses the lesser of two evils.    [Pamfilova] I do not want to choose an evil, do you  understand? I want to reverse the situation.    [Valyuzhenich] Do you believe that in the Duma you will have  a greater opportunity to influence social policy?    [Pamfilova] I have no great delusions as to this. At any  rate, I will not be responsible or pay for the mistakes of  others. However, I do not intend to give up and acknowledge my  powerlessness. I have the energy for a fight.    As you will understand, I did not seek personal gain when I  resigned from my position. I think that they will now throw  stones at my back; I have spited too many people: I interfered  with someone "privatizing" a state dacha, with someone else  pocketing a handsome sum, and dared to "criticize" someone....  Of course, it would have been more advantageous to continue in  the position of minister. Some people even warned me that I was  supposedly bringing my personal career to an end.... However,  everyone has a moment when he makes a moral choice, and I have  made mine.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / German privatisation: Eye-catching but little for sale - Constitutional and other hurdles suggest progress will be slow THE window-dressing put up for the recent re-opening of Germany's privatisation programme was certainly eye-catching. But for all the promotional build-up, the government had precious little to offer for immediate sale. Finance minister Mr Theo Waigel unveiled plans to press on with the sale of 'a good two dozen' state concerns against a backdrop that plugged Deutsche Telekom, the country's telecommunications network, as 'the people's share of the 90s'. Mr Waigel warned, however, that privatising Telekom would require a change in the constitution. That could take years. The government also promised to sell off its remaining 51 per cent stake in Lufthansa, the state airline, 'as soon as possible'. But, as the Finance Ministry pointed out, stock markets are not in the best of condition at the moment. Nor is the airline: it lost DM600m (Pounds 213m) in the first five months of this year. In fact, Mr Waigel's slender inventory, approved by the cabinet last week, included only odds and ends: the Mon Repos convalescent home in Davos, Switzerland; Bonn's holdings in the federal network of motorway filling stations and cafes; and an array of consultancies, house-building concerns and canals. The latest initiative, which follows the finance minister's declaration earlier this year that privatisation must proceed 'without taboos', suggests that the final stage of federal withdrawal from commerce is approaching. His initial task is to convince the opposition Social Democrats, especially those representatives of the independently-minded Lander sitting in the Bundesrat, or upper house, that privatisation is both politically and economically necessary. The Bundesrat holds the power to block constitutional changes necessary before Telekom and the railway network can be freed from state control. Encouragingly, the opposition minority in the Bundestag is already tilting in favour of change. Mr Arne Bornsen, the SPD's postal services spokesman, admits that the SPD's 'ideological barriers to privatisation' are coming down. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the opposition leader, has gone so far as to write to Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, urging rapid reform of the railways and offering unspecified support for constitutional amendments. However, SPD opposition outside the Bundestag remains deep-seated. A recent suggestion from the monopolies commission (an independent group of parliamentary advisers separate from the cartel office), that banks owned by the Lander should be privatised, was promptly rejected by most of the 16 state prime ministers. The mostly SPD-controlled Lander governments also hold substantial stakes in assets such as airports, insurance companies and utility groups, which have considerable importance as symbols of the federal states' independence. Before Mr Engholm can fully endorse Mr Waigel's plans, the SPD must also find ways of damping resistance among its traditional supporters in the trade unions. They fear job cuts and the loss to many members of their treasured civil service status - and their effective right to jobs for life. Mr Waigel's response to opponents is that business is not a job for politicians. But there are other, more powerful, forces behind his renewed campaign. The government has long been convinced that telecommunications, in particular, needs to be privatised to become a more effective international competitor. However, the crucial factor behind the renewed drive is the financial strain of unification. This threatens to push up total state debt from its current level of DM1,300bn to DM1,900bn (Pounds 674bn) by 1995. With some 20 per cent of annual west German output now being transferred to the east, the Finance Ministry wants to place as many of the country's productive resources as possible into efficient, tax-paying private hands. The loss-making railways alone expect debts and accumulated losses of almost DM420bn by the end of the decade. According to Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, merging the eastern and western networks into a public limited company - to be called Deutsche Eisenbahn - freeing it from direct government control, and allowing at least partial privatisation, will almost halve the expected burden on the state. Profitable Telekom - which at present has to contribute the equivalent of 10 per cent of its annual revenues to finance deficits elsewhere in the Bundespost system - is expected to borrow DM17bn this year alone to fund the installation of new connections in the east. The estimated total cost of upgrading the former GDR is DM60bn. As budgetary pressures continue to build, it seems likely that the Lander may undergo a change of heart. Under the treaty of unification, they are committed to take over a substantial proportion of the costs of unification from Bonn, starting in 1995. The already heavily-indebted state governments have also been told by Bonn to freeze public spending for the next four years. Experience and the remaining constitutional hurdles suggest progress will not be quick. Germany began its phased exit from a handful of industrial enterprises in 1959, and managed to finish it just 30 years later. Even so, that experience has given Mr Waigel some fine examples to demonstrate the benefits of state withdrawal from commerce - the former state-controlled conglomerates, Veba and Viag, engineering group Preussag, and Volkswagen, the vehicle maker, today rank among the 20 biggest and most successful companies in Germany.</p>

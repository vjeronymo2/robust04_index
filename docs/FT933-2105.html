			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Blow to DTI hopes of attracting Mercedes DEPARTMENT OF Trade and Industry hopes of finding a site in the UK for Mercedes-Benz to build small cars, and prepare a deal for the German vehicle manufacturer, may have been frustrated by public exposure. The UK, France, the Czech Republic and Germany are on the shortlist. The disclosure by Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' chief executive, that the company wants to make 200,000 small cars a year in one of four countries has triggered rival approaches to its UK headquarters. To the chagrin of the Invest in Britain Bureau, the DTI agency most closely involved in seeking to attract the project, even individual chartered surveyors are understood to have approached Mercedes with proposals for the 250 - 300 acre site sought by the carmaker. While the bureau last night refused to discuss its role on grounds of 'commercial confidentiality', it is understood that it had been hoping to maximise the UK's chances of attracting the project by compiling data on all potential sites in the country, and preparing its own proposal. So far, only the Northern Development Corporation and Midlands development authorities have acknowledged that they want the project. Industry analysts say Mercedes has to decide by the end of this year if production is to start, as planned, by 1997. Mercedes has been stepping up its motor component purchases in the UK, which now supplies Pounds 72m-worth annually. The parent group, Daimler-Benz, spends Pounds 350m annually with UK suppliers. The group recently warned component makers not to interpret increased orders as being linked with the small-car site.</p>

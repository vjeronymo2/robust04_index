			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Abu Yamin Salam, Zubaidah Abu Bakar, and Noor </F> Adzman Baharuddin]    [Text] Melaka, Wed. -- The Immigration Department has been  instructed not to renew Al-Arqam leader Asaari Muhammad's  passport unless he personally applies for renewal.    Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said  Asaari  should not be allowed to use a proxy to renew his passport.    "We want him to come personally to the department," he told  reporters after addressing a seminar on the role of Penawar, a  bureau in Pemadam [antidrug association] which helps families of  dadah [drug] addicts cope with related problems.    Although Megat Junid declined to elaborate, he indicated  that  there were a few things that the Government needed to know from  Asaari, who is believed to be in Thailand.    Megat Junid also instructed the Immigration Department to  ensure that Al-Arqam sympathisers within the department do not  renew Asaari's passport without the latter coming to the office.    He added that the Government was getting information on  Al-Arqam's activities in Thailand.    Megat Junid said he had spoken to Thai Deputy Foreign  Minister Dr Abdul Halim Surin [name as published] on the matter  and the latter had given an assurance to co-operate fully with  Malaysian officials.    Although many negative things have been said about the  Al-Arqam movement, Megat Junid said appropriate action could  only be taken with proof of wrongdoing.    He also believed that many people joined the movement for  its  religious activities and it would not be appropriate to assume  that they were engaged in activities that threatened national  unity.    "The movement has about 10,000 hardcore members but it has  about 100,000 sympathisers. We cannot assume that these people  are involved in the formation of its alleged Badar [Warrior]  Army" he said.    Asked why Al-Arqam conducts many of its activities in  southern Thailand, Megat Junid said: "Only Asaari can answer  that. The movement should continue to carry out its activities  here if they do not breach the rules."    In Alor Star, the Kedah Government has directed the State  Islamic Religious Department to identify Al-Arqam members among  civil servants.    State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Sheikh  Alias Mustaffa said the department had also been asked to  compile a list of activities conducted by Al-Arqam members here.    "We are aware that the movement is quite active in the  State.  We need to know the extent of the members' activities and  influence on the people," he said after closing a day-long  seminar for 600 imams [clergymen] and religious teachers here  yesterday.    Sheikh Alias said the directive was in line with the  department's move to check Al-Arqam activities.    In Kangar, Kedah Menteri Besar [Chief Minister] Tan Sri Dr  Abdul Hamid Pawanteh said the State Government was monitoring  the activities of the Al-Arqam movement and several other  missionary groups to check deviant activities.    "The State Islamic Affairs Council is aware of the existence  of religious cults in Perlis.    "We do not want to have any group using religion for  self-gain or for the benefit of a certain group of people to  exist in the State," he added.    Dr Hamid said the State Government needed evidence that the  Al-Arqam had deviated from Islamic teachings before it could  decide on what action to take.    Al-Arqam has a base at Titi Tinggi along the Kangar-Padang  Besar trunk road and its followers are involved in a wide range  of economic activities in Perlis.    The Islamic Centre recently alleged the Al-Arqam has 313  armed units called the Tentera Badar [Warrior Army].</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Telebras head to testify in US broker row THE president of Telebras, Brazil's state telecommunications company, has been called to testify before the country's Congress, to explain allegations that his former finance director attempted to extort Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.1m) from Merrill Lynch, the US securities house. The allegations began circulating in the Brazilian financial markets in July, when Merrill Lynch was not appointed lead manager for the company's forthcoming Dollars 500m launch of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in New York. Merrill Lynch had handled the company's Eurobond offerings and was expected to manage the ADR issue. The charges become public after the resignation of Mr Mauro Brito as finance director of Telebras last week. Press reports in Brazil alleged that he was forced to quit because he had demanded money from Merrill Lynch for the firm to keep its position managing the issue. Mr Brito denies the allegations. Telebras has made countercharges, claiming irregularities in the launch of Eurobonds carried out by Merrill Lynch in 1991 and 1992, and claiming that the brokerage had received commission four times higher than market rates. According to the newspaper O Globo, Mr Iram Siqueira Lima, former finance director of Telebras, has written to Mr Adyr da Silva, its current president, admitting that Merrill Lynch had received a commission above market rates for the Eurobonds issue. However, he pointed out that, at the time, Telebras did not have a good image in the market and that Merrill Lynch had guaranteed to place all the bonds. Merrill Lynch issued an official statement on Wednesday night denying the allegations: '(The company) strongly rejects any suggestion of irregularity in its dealings with Telebras,' it said. Traders are watching events carefully, as Telebras shares represent 60 per cent of the Sao Paulo stock market index and are a favourite of foreigner buyers, often accounting for more than half of daily trading. Congressman Paulo Heslander, who demanded that Congress investigate, said: 'These charges are damaging the image of Brazil overseas.' This is expected to delay the launch of the ADRs, which was expected before the end of this year. Another US securities house, Smith Barney Shearson, has warned clients that the launch might now take place in the middle of next year.</p>

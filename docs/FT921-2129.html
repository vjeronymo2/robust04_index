			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Honduras legislates for farm recovery - A wide-ranging reform of agricultural laws THE HONDURAS government is boasting that it has 'the most comprehensive agricultural policy law in Latin America' after the passing earlier this month of an important measure streamlining farming legislation. And it now expects the disbursement during April of a Dollars 70m agricultural sector structural adjustment loan from the World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank, which was conditional on the reform package. The measure, which amends 20 previous laws and decrees, clarifies land tenure rules and pricing and credit policies, and aims to reinforce the boost to agriculture from 1990's lempira devaluation, which triggered price rises. The legislation follows tortuous negotiations between the government, ranchers and peasant organisations. A mid-1991 draft drew heavy criticism from peasants but the final version is supported by the leaders of about 80 per cent of organised peasants. Left wing protestors blocked roads in some parts of the country, reviving the tactics successful earlier in forcing the reversal of a forestry concession to Stone Container Corporation, the US paper group. But they failed to make much impact on the National Congress. On land tenure, the law simplifies the 1975 Land Reform, leaving just two grounds for compulsory redistribution: abandonment for 18 months (or two years in exceptional cases), and individual holdings above the (generally high) ceilings established in the 1975 law. Joint ownership, renting and technically inefficient exploitation all disappear as grounds for redistribution. Mr Roger Norton, an American economist - the major intellectual influence behind the law - hopes that market incentives will succeed where bureaucratic rules failed. 'The single greatest lesson of eastern Europe is that you can't mandate efficiency from the state,' he says. The law also scraps the five-hectare minimum area for land titles, and requires the National Agrarian Institute to speed the land titling process. These measures aim to boost investment, by giving farmers an incentive to make improvements and by establishing loan collateral to increase their access to credit. Members of Honduras' 2,800 land reform co-operatives will receive individual, negotiable shareholdings and will be allowed to break their farms up into personal units. Future land reform beneficiaries - which for the first time will include women in their own right - will decide the form of their tenure for themselves. Under the 1975 law, the institute promoted large scale co-operative enterprises, which generally proved unsuccessful. During 1991 there was a controversial wave of sales of north coast co-operatives' land to banana companies. In future, such sales will carry a 20 per cent tax to reflect the value of public investments in the reform sector. Joint investments by reform enterprises and private corporations are also legalised. The law's critics argue that it rings the death knell of land redistribution, casting in stone the existing, highly polarised tenure structure. But its advocates stress that compulsory redistribution has been a failure. They argue that simplified rules will revive the land reform, while liberalisation will foster redistribution to small farmers through non-confiscatory mechanisms such as renting. Coupled with improved grain prices, according to Mr Norton, this should mean that 'one of the main effects of this law will be to reduce rural poverty'. However the government vetoed his proposal for a progressive land tax, designed to stimulate a break-up of large estates. Grain prices should be reinforced by the institutionalisation of changes in the agricultural trade regime, implemented over the last year, including the abolition of the state monopoly of foreign trade in grains, and 15 per cent import tariffs for grains (20 per cent for processed products), which should keep the sector profitable. Previously, grain imports were tariff-free. Along with other Central American republics, Honduras has established a price band system to insulate domestic grain prices from sharp fluctuation in world prices. Linked to this is the opening of free trade in grains within Central America, and Honduras hopes to be a net exporter to the region, as it was in the 1960s. The government hopes these changes will stabilise grain prices at profitable levels. At the end of 1991, prices collapsed when private traders linked to the armed forces imported large volumes of rice and maize just before the national harvest. They were encouraged by a temporary reduction in import tariffs to 5 per cent, leading to allegations of corruption from opposition politicians. As a result of the imports, producer prices for maize fell below Dollars 6 a quintal (100 kg), discrediting the agricultural liberalisation strategy in the eyes of many producers. The 15 per cent tariff levels should keep prices above Dollars 8 a quintal during 1992. Other important changes in the modernisation law include the rationalisation of the state agricultural development bank, Banadesa. The bank's trust fund activities are to be transferred to a new network of rural credit houses managed by peasant organisations and in future, Banadesa lending will concentrate on small grain producers, with loans to state bodies banned and big farmers also excluded. A state land bank is to be established to reinforce the land reform process and reform beneficiaries are to receive grants of seed capital.</p>

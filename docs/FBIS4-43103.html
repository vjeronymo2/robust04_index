			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Necat Sunar] </F>   [Text] Istanbul -- Professor Mahir Kaynak, a former  National Intelligence Organization (MIT) official and a faculty  member at Gazi University, said that the murders of Kurdish  businessmen and intellectuals may be the work of those who  provided the names of these persons to Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller and her circle.    Kaynak said: "The fact that the style of the murders is the  same is an indication that they are being committed by the same  cadres."    We sought the views of the former MIT official Mahir Kaynak  after the murders of the Kurdish businessmen by the  counter-guerrillas following Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  statement that "we know the names of the businessmen and artists  from whom PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] derives money; we  will call them to account." Kaynak asserted that these murders  were committed by those who submitted the names to Tansu Ciller.  Kaynak, who replied to our questions before the murder of Savas  Buldan, a Kurdish businessmen from Yuksekova, said that the  murders might continue.    Stressing that in the aftermath of the latest economic and  political developments the state has fallen into disintegration,  Kaynak noted that this disarray further deepened with the crisis  surrounding Gures [chief of General Staff], and asserted that  there is a two-headed administration in Turkey.    Kaynak said: "At present the state has disintegrated  considerably. Because of the economic and political  disintegration, the current government cadres have lost their  power. The incident surrounding Gures shows that there are two  powers. That is, it is becoming clear that not a single power  controls the developments in Turkey. As is evident from the  Dogan Gures crisis, one power is supporting Dogan Gures. There  is also another power which wants to push him out of the way.  Therefore, political power in Turkey is not concentrated in one  hand."    Arguing that the murder of Kurdish businessmen,  intellectuals, and bureaucrats results from this two-headed  administration within the state, Kaynak said: "The cadre that  does not favor a political solution to the Kurdish problem is  planning to commit such murders."    Indicating that the identical style of the murders is proof  enough of their being committed by the same cadres, Kaynak said:  "And, the purpose in murdering the businessmen with some  intervals is not to create excessive uneasiness in the public.  Once a murder is committed there is a waiting period to let it  be forgotten. Then a second murder is committed. In this way  the public does not pay much attention."</p>

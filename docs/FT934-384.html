			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Belgium bows out to applause: Widespread praise for six-month spell presiding over EU As Belgium prepares to hand over the rotating presidency of the European Union to Greece on January 1, the coalition government in Brussels is basking in praise for its six-month stewardship of the EU. The European Commission said this week that the Belgian presidency had been active and productive, a view generally shared among the permanent delegations in Brussels. Achievements include a delicate brokering role which helped to conclude the world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; a deal on the location of almost a dozen European institutions, including the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt; a share-out of development funds; and much unglamorous but necessary work implementing the Maastricht treaty. Belgium's performance defied predictions that its presidency would prove ineffective because of a weak coalition government, linguistic divisions and labour unrest. Despite the regular presence of dozens of anti-riot trucks in Brussels in the past half year, fears that the government might fall in the face of opposition to its 'social pact' - the most ambitious austerity programme since the second world war - proved unfounded. As a founder member of the European Community in 1958 and one of the smaller EU states, Belgium has become used to subordinating its own national interests to achieve compromise. In this respect, says Mr Peter Ludlow, head of the Brussels-based Centre for European Studies, Belgium's has been 'a model presidency'. Personalities count, too. Though occasionally irascible, Mr Willy Claes proved an effective chairman of the general affairs council comprising EU foreign ministers; and Mr Philippe Maystadt showed why he is one of the more respected finance ministers in Europe. Both benefited from the advice of Ambassador Philippe de Schoutheete de Tervarent, Belgium's long-serving permanent representative to the EU. It was Mr Claes and Mr de Schoutheete who helped to keep France within the European fold during the Gatt trade talks, taking the sting out of relations between Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, the chief trade negotiator. Similarly, both men calmed down European parliamentarians and persuaded them to compromise on a new accord governing the roles of EU institutions post-Maastricht. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister, and Mr Claes are also credited with buoying up a moody Mr Jacques Delors before he delivered his white paper on growth and competitiveness to acclaim at the Brussels summit this month. Criticism of the Belgian presidency focuses on the less-than-smooth running of second-tier EU councils such as environment, agriculture and research. The 'green-leaning' Danes, Dutch and Germans were also unhappy about the compromise on waste packaging which they argue will damage the environment. Like its predecessors, the Belgian presidency proved unable to make real progress in the Bosnian conflict. Talks this week in Brussels identified some points of agreement; but Mr Claes was reduced to describing as 'pathetic' Bosnian Serb excuses for not reopening Tuzla airport to allow resumption of humanitarian aid to starving refugees.</p>

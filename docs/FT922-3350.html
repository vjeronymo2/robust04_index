			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Wang files further patent suits WANG Laboratories, the US office computer company, has filed suit against the US subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Electric and NMB Semiconductor, both of Japan, charging that the companies are selling products that infringe Wang patents. Wang claims Mitsubishi and NMB used its patented single in-line memory module (SIMM) technology without license. A SIMM is a holder for multiple memory chips that plugs into a computer circuit board to add memory capacity. The devices are widely used in personal computers. The suits are the latest move in an aggressive patent enforcement effort by Wang. Last August, Wang won a similar case against NEC and Toshiba. The US court awarded Wang damages of Dollars 3.3m and ordered the two companies to halt manufacturing and sale of SIMMs in the US. Since then, Wang has reached licensing agreements with over 30 US and foreign companies. These include several companies named in a trade complaint alleging unfair trade based upon patent infringement. Yesterday, Wang said it had withdrawn the trade complaint because all the companies named have since licensed the technology, with the exception of NMB and and Mitsubishi.</p>

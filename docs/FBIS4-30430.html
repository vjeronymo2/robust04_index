			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that since the nuclear fuel  that North Korea recently removed from its five-megawatt  experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon is coated with the  alloyed magnesium (Magnox), it may leak radiation within two  years if North Korea uses its present method of preservation.    In a closed seminar marking the inauguration of the Atomic  Energy Control Center held at the Plaza Hotel in Seoul on 24  June, Professor Kim Pyong-ku, chief of the reactor development  team of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, noted that  because the coating material Magnox is apt to erode in water,  long-term preservation of Magnox-coated nuclear fuel in water --  North Korea uses this method -- may result in a leakage of  radiation. He expressed his concerns about the problem as North  Korea cannot but help reprocess the nuclear fuel rods within two  years, and insisted that those nuclear fuel rods must be  resealed and kept dry permanently or must be disposed of for  good all under the supervision of the International Atomic  Energy Agency.</p>

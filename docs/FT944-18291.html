			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Revival of activity in Latin American eurobond issuance The Latin American eurobond market saw a revival of activity in the third quarter of this year, following two successive quarters of decline. It was lifted by greater political and economic stability in the region and a better tone in the US Treasury market. According to a report by West Merchant Bank, the London subsidiary of Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, Dollars 3.4bn worth of new offerings were launched during the third quarter of 1994, compared with Dollars 2.0bn in the second quarter. This is still less than the Dollars 6.4bn worth of bonds offered in the first three months of the year and the Dollars 9.2bn launched in the final three months of 1993. Nevertheless, it is a significant improvement on the second quarter of the year, which saw many borrowers withdraw from the market. Mr Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank, said in the report: 'The third-quarter upturn suggests that the market is slowly recovering from the negative shock caused earlier in the year by higher US interest rates, the collapse in the secondary debt market, and adverse political and financial developments in countries like Mexico and Venezuela.' However, further progress will depend to a great extent on the state of the US government bond market. The recovery in the third quarter takes total Latin American offerings for the year to Dollars 11.9bn, down 31 per cent on the same period in 1993 but greater than the Dollars 10.2bn raised during the whole of 1992. Brazil and Mexico accounted for a large part of the resurgence in activity. The success of the Real Plan in controlling inflation and the prospect of victory in today's presidential elections for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister and the plan's architect, has boosted investor confidence in Brazil. Sentiment in Mexico, which has been battered by political unrest, found support in the recent election victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo. The signing last month of the 'pacto', the agreement between business, labour and the government under which prices, wages and exchange rate policies are set, will provide further support. However, the assassination last week of an important figure in the ruling PRI party is likely to be a significant blow to confidence. Brazil launched eight offerings in the third quarter with a total value of Dollars 537m, compared with only two offerings in the second quarter worth Dollars 81m. 'Brazilian issuers have to some extent improved their ability to access international capital markets,' said Ms Rebecca Clarke, research manager at West Merchant Bank. 'Now the elections are over, we are likely to see more new issuance from Brazil.' Activity was greatest in September, when issuance reached its highest level since February. There was a rush of large offerings from Mexico and Argentina, including two deals from Cemex, Mexico's largest cement producer. The quarter was also notable for a rise in the number of countries tapping the market. Colombia, Chile and Trinidad and Tobago, all absent in the second quarter, returned to the market, to join Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Mexico.</p>

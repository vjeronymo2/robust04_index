			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Yugrina: "Give...Stop...We Demand..."] </F>   [Text] Yesterday morning at 0815 representatives of  industrial enterprises of Novosibirsk organized a picket line at  the entrance to the oblast administration building. The  participants carried placards: "Halting production to curb  inflation is insanity!" "Taxes are an octopus on the body of  production." "The country was proud of the working class and now  they are firing them." "We demand work!" "Without wages how will  we feed our children?" "Stop the decline of production!" Judging  from their content it is possible to determine the demands of  the forthcoming protest rally, which will take place on 9 July.  So far they are economic ones. That is what trade union leaders  of the defense industry have decided. A natural question: "On  the eve of a large action why was it necessary to 'besiege' the  front entrance to the oblast administration?"    "It is a warning action. We want not only to draw attention  to the needs of the working class but also to awaken the  awareness of those who are still in an inert condition," says V.  Tyulenkov, chairman of the trade union committee of the Kometa  production association.    Unfortunately, for certain people the 50 percent decline of  the production volume in "defense" and the radioelectronics  industry is no cause for alarm. It is not without reason that  they say that some people will not do anything until disaster is  at their door. And perhaps the working man did not notice the  first signs of it. Hidden unemployment has created the illusion  of temporary difficulties with entering the market economy, and  the pacifying speeches of government bureaucrats about the grace  period for privatization hypnotized the people for a certain  amount of time. But now the voice of the workers is beginning to  cut through, and they are saying: "It is silent in the shop--it  is an ominous silence!"    "Why did you decide to join the picket line today," I asked  Olga Grigoryevna Baturina, an engineer of the scientific  research institute of automatic instruments.    "I last received my wages in February. For six months now I  have not received a stipend for my child," the young woman said  almost in a whisper. I could see that she was very agitated  because this was the first time she had participated in such a  measure. Friends and acquaintances usually say of such people:  "Quiet, modest, retiring, cannot stand up for herself." But Olga  Grigoryevna's last hope lies with the local authorities. And  today she has come out to defend herself and her child.    "They will definitely help us. After all, I have an  eight-year-old child. What am I supposed to feed him?"--the  woman asks.    "There is no money, but they order us to survive!"--this was  the theme of the reproachful placards of the engineers of  another scientific research institute. A group of women here are  in the mood for a more purposeful discussion.    "Our Zoya Nikolayevna Sadkova died recently. She had a month  to go before she received her pension. The diagnosis on the  death certificate was exhaustion from hunger"--this is what the  person carrying the placard told me. These women no longer  believe in either the local or the higher authorities.    I met the chief of the oblast administration, I.I. Indinok,  with the picketers.    "Ivan Ivanovich, how do you intend to solve the social  problems in the oblast?" a television correspondent asked the  governor.    "Perhaps we can solve this problem together?" I. Indinok  answered a question with another question and pointed to a  placard--"Oblast administration! Protect the children from the  decadence of TV and radio!"    The questions, demands, and requests were left for the  rally.  What will it do? Will the circle of mutual nonpayments be  broken, will the tax rates change, will the jobs be returned,  will earned money be paid?...</p>

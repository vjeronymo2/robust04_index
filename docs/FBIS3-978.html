Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Alhaji Babagana  Kingibe, stated this in Accra after delivering a message from  Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, to Ghana's  President Jerry Rawlings. He said the OAU conflict prevention  mechanism, under the chairmanship of President Husni Mubarak,  has invited Nigeria to a meeting today to discuss the conflict.    Alhaji Babagana reaffirmed that Nigeria stood for a peaceful  resolution of the conflict but was disgusted when France sent  troops and armament to support Cameroon. The minister said the  OAU had already held several meetings in Addis Ababa and the  organization's ability to resolve the conflict peacefully will  be a test for President Mubarak's committee.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / US offer on Georgian peace President Bill Clinton yesterday offered to help pay for United Nations peacekeeping in the Georgian region of Abkhazia if peace can be agreed between Abkhaz separatists and the Georgian government, but ruled out sending any US troops. Speaking after talks at the White House with Mr Edward Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who now leads Georgia, Mr Clinton backed a final effort by the UN to broker a deal in Abkhazia. Mr Shevardnadze is due to discuss the conflict tomorrow with the UN Security Council.</p>

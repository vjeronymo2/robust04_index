			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: AMR to cut spending as shortfall reaches Dollars 935m AMR, parent company of American Airlines, yesterday opened the US airlines' reporting season with news of a Dollars 145m operating loss in the final quarter of 1992, and an after-tax deficit of Dollars 200m for the three-month period. Revenues rose by 5.1 per cent, to Dollars 3.58bn. The fourth-quarter results bring AMR's net loss for the year to Dollars 935m. However, this partially reflects non-cash charges related to a change in US accounting methods for post-retirement health benefits. The net loss in 1992 before the accounting-related charges stood at Dollars 475m. Revenues were Dollars 14.4bn, up from Dollars 12.9bn in the previous year. Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, said the figures reflected 'one of the most difficult and challenging years in the history of commercial aviation'. He also cautioned against expecting a rapid turnround: 'Although the economy has recently shown some signs of strength, we think much of the recent optimism is unwarranted', he commented. 'As a result of our concern about the outlook for profitability, we have cut more than Dollars 300m from anticipated 1993 spending and continue to look for other solutions to our earnings dilemma.' AMR is generally seen as a bellwether for the US airline sector, and its large fourth-quarter and 12-month losses are likely to be mirrored at other carriers. However, in AMR's case, some one-off charges compounded the difficulties. The Dollars 145m fourth-quarter operating loss included a Dollars 22m charge related to severance payments, while the Dollars 200m net deficit included Dollars 145m-worth of provisions for aircraft lease terminations and losses on a computer reservation project, partly offset by a Dollars 103m tax benefit. These one-off items, plus some special charges earlier in the year, also impacted the full-year figures. The airline, one of the 'Big Three' US carriers which opposed British Airways' planned Dollars 750m investment in USAir, also indicated yesterday that it would fight any scaled-down investment proposal by the UK carrier. There has been speculation that BA would announce plans to take a voting stake of around 20 per cent in USAir, for around Dollars 340m. American echoed calls made by other opponents of the deal for a review of US policy towards foreign ownership of US airlines. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which holds a minority equity interest in and Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, yesterday released more details of the proposed integration of the ir two airlines' services - their 454 aircraft and all ticketing and promotional material.</p>

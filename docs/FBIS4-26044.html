			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Yu-sha (7627 6276 2619) from Beijing: </F> "Tension in Spring--Utmost `Solicitude' Is Shown for National  Churches"]    [Text] April, May, and June every year are the spring  season for blossoms in Beijing. However, Beijing's political  atmosphere seems like winter during this period. This is  particularly true now as this year marks the fifth anniversary  of the 4 June incident. While being highhanded with the  democratic, worker, and student movements as these days  approach, the authorities are also showing their special  "solicitude" toward "some other people."    For example, the authorities recently issued a circular,  calling for precautions against national level churches formed  by all kinds of religious organizations. The circular also  prohibited ties between these churches and their counterparts  abroad.  <H5>  Churches Must Not Develop Ties With Foreigners </H5>   The State Council's Religion Bureau recently held a national  conference in Beijing for chiefs of bureaus in charge of  religion work. In light of the spirit of the speech made by  Jiang Zemin at the National United Front Work Meeting, the  conference initially laid down the principle of offering  "classified guidance" to different religious groups. The  principle for different religious sects is to prevent the  establishment of a national religious organization and its ties  with foreign organizations.  <H5>  Buddhist and Taoist Organizations May Not Indiscriminately </H5> Receive New Members    Regarding Buddhism and Taoism, the present task is to  support  and help Buddhist and Taoist organizations at all levels to  strengthen their building, improve the quality of the monks, and  exercise proper management over existing monasteries. The  circular says: "Measures must be adopted to resolutely check  practices of indiscriminate preaching of monastic disciplines  and recruiting new members." Statutory procedures should be  undergone to build monasteries and no monastery may be built  without approval. In places which hold regular religious  activities in small rural temples, it is necessary to strengthen  management and let them open the temples to disciples after  undergoing registration procedures.  <H5>  Guard Against Islamic Interference in State Policies </H5>   Regarding Islam, it is necessary to guard against its  interference in the state's policies. The circular reiterated  that they cannot meddle in the state's administrative, judicial,  education, and marriage systems and may not restore the  abolished feudal privileges and the exploitation system. The  "Haiji Monastery," "imam [a hong 7093 6059]," and "jaiz [re yi  si 3583 0181 2448]" must not be allowed to resume. Moreover, it  is necessary to step up management of the Islamic monasteries,  rectify and improve the "ahung [7093 6059]" and "imam day [yi ma  ri 0122 3854 2480]" management system. Furthermore, it is  necessary to positively and steadily resolve the contradictions  and disputes between and within the sects and adopt forceful  measures to stop the violent conflicts.  <H5>  Step Up the Handling of Underground Catholic Forces </H5>   Regarding Catholic work, the stress should be put on  reforming the rites and gradually introducing mass in Chinese.  It is necessary to further implement the policies on churches  and premises and create conditions for normal religious  activities. Shortages of bishops and clergymen is an  outstanding question. Training should be given to those who are  politically competent. If the question cannot be resolved  temporarily, the responsible bishop can concurrently take up the  job. Efforts should be stepped up in comprehensively handling  the underground Catholic forces. Measures should be adopted to  promptly dissolve the already established organizations. As  regards the organizations which have not yet taken shape, it is  necessary to take precautions and not allow them to develop.  Moreover, the establishment of a national center for  Catholicism will not be allowed.    Regarding Christianity, the religious departments should  tackle the "thorny issues" together with the Christian  organizations at all levels, namely, individuals proclaiming  themselves missionaries, the establishment of private meeting  places, and the question of minority religious sects.  <H5>  Family Gatherings Not To Be Seen as Private Gatherings </H5>   He who proclaims himself a missionary, who openly opposes  the  socialist system and government leadership, who publicize  extremism, and who disseminates heretical beliefs shall be  punished according to law. Measures should be adopted to check  missionary work done by those unqualified to preach or who are  not even disciples.    As regards the private meeting places set up directly by  those who proclaim themselves missionaries or under their  influence, and the gathering of some disciples who have  separated themselves from the open religious establishments for  various reasons and formed their own organizations, they shall  be banned if involved in illegal activities. If their  activities are normal, they can undergo registration. Some  should be guided to participate in religious activities at the  registered establishments. The traditional Christian family  gathering should not be regarded as a private gathering.  Nevertheless, the family gatherings should be replaced by  churches and these people should be associated through the  registered churches.  <H5>  No National Level Organizations Should Be Established </H5>   On the question of Christian sects, it is necessary to  uphold  association, seek common ground while reserving differences, and  strengthen unity. Some localities with a large number of sects  and disciples may be allowed to set up churches in places where  conditions permit. However, no sect will be allowed to resume  or establish national or regional organizations; nor will it be  allowed to resume or establish ties with the religious  organizations abroad. The organizations of the new sects  introduced from abroad or established domestically of their own  accord will be regarded as illegal organizations in light of  relevant Chinese regulations.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: Chartered surveyors body not averse to change Sir, Vanessa Houlder is wrong to assume (Property Market, February 7) that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will back away from a radical approach to future market needs. The profession has an excellent record of change. Without the protection of statute or registration systems, it has prospered by serving clients' needs. In the last 30 years, the profession has expanded by merger, by entering overseas markets, and by extending the applications of its skills. RICS rules have changed to permit practice with limited liability, to permit qualification overseas based on property law and practice in other jurisdictions, and to delegate academic examinations to higher education institutions. In a body of 67,000 qualified professionals - and 22,000 working for qualification - each set of changes needs analysis and explanation. A recession which has hit property and construction heavily may make members more cautious. But the profession's leaders will press for constructive changes now as in the past and will put the needs of the profession's clients and members first, and the institution's structure second. Ted Watts, president, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, 12 Great George Street, Parliament Square, London SW1P 3AD</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul at record high as Hong Kong weakens Arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking ahead of the three-day weekend depressed prices, and the Nikkei erased the gains of the past two days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index lost 51.71 to 19,833.67 after a high of 19,907.58 and a low of 19,760.05. Volume was 355m shares against Wednesday's 394m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.74 to 1,584.22 while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.01 to 289.85. Losers led gainers by 575 to 425, with 189 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.93 to 1,297.61. Analysts said brokers, looking to boost profits ahead of the September book closing, were unwinding their positions. On Thursday, the country's leading securities companies announced downward revisions for interim and annual earnings projections due to the lower-than-expected trading volumes during the first half. Daiwa Securities fell Y20 to Y1,430 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y1,090. Sanyo Securities, which announced on Wednesday that its capital ratio had dropped below the 200 per cent 'safety' line, lost Y4 to Y556. Profit-taking depressed high-technology stocks. Oki Electric, which had gained on Wednesday on expectations of higher earnings because of firm semiconductor demand, lost Y8 to Y780 while Toshiba declined Y4 to Y751. Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y10 to Y955 on rising gold prices. Meanwhile, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily which publishes the Nikkei 300, yesterday said that four component stocks are to be replaced. Japan Airlines, Maruha, Daito Trust Construction, and Sumitomo Warehouse will replace Mitsubishi Petrochemical, Hanwa, Nagasakiya, and Fujita Kanko. Mitsubishi Petrochemical will be delisted next month due to its merger with Mitsubishi Kasei, while the other three stocks are to be replaced due to lower trading volumes and market capitalisation. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 16.23 to 22,073.35 in volume of 268.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y90 to Y5,880 on profit-taking. Roundup The region was mixed yesterday. SEOUL finished at an all time higher after a third straight trading day of advances as investors sought large-capitalised blue chips and bank stocks. The composite index closed 10.40 or 1.0 per cent higher at 1,034.01, taking the cumulative three day rise to 4.6 per cent. Brokers said the strong advance prompted steady selling in anticipation of a consolidation, although it was more than offset by strong demand, especially of medium-priced blue chips like Goldstar and Daewoo Heavy Industries. Both went daily limit-up to record closes of Won31,800 and Won17,100 respectively. HONG KONG tumbled 1.6 per cent on worries about the outlook for US interest rates as investors returned after Wednesday's holiday, but prices closed off lows on light bargain hunting by retail investors. The Hang Seng index lost 156.61 to 9,668.14, having been down 240 points at one stage. Turnover improved to HKDollars 4.64bn from HKDollars 3.22bn. HSBC Holdings eased HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 88.25. Hongkong Land recovered from a low of HKDollars 18.65, finishing at HKDollars 19, down 50 cents. Shipping companies' shares continued to advance as funds bought in anticipation of a recovery in the global shipping industry. Wah Kwong Shipping Holdings rose HKDollars 2.10 or 14.8 per cent to HKDollars 16.30, after a 10.8 per cent advance on Tuesday, and IMC Holdings rose 42.5 cents or 9.2 per cent at HKDollars 5.025. The H share index lost 43.16 or 3.0 per cent to 1,399.14 in a delayed reaction to China's higher inflation rate. TAIPEI saw late selling send prices lower and the weighted index closed down 1.6 per cent amid profit-taking on financials. The index fell 109.56 to 6,889.88 in turnover of TDollars 54.2bn. Among financials Cathay Life fell TDollars 7 to TDollars 215 and Chang Hwa Bank TDollars 6 to TDollars 199. Elite Group rose by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 54.50 for the second consecutive session since its debut on Wednesday. SYDNEY rose modestly boosted in light turnover by a stronger gold price. The All Ordinaries index rose 1.6 to 2,028.2. Turnover was ADollars 586.9m. Gold shares were actively bought on the firmer gold price, with Newcrest rising 13 cents to ADollars 6.68. SINGAPORE edged lower as attention focused on Malaysian OTC stocks. The Straits Times Industrials index lost 3.60 to 2,286.09, while the UOB-OTC index, which tracks mainly Malaysian stocks, dropped 15.01 to 1,281.57 on heavy profit-taking in the afternoon. KUALA LUMPUR gave way to heavy afternoon profit-taking by retail and institutional investors and the composite index lost 11.26 to 1,179.88. Some Singapore and Japanese funds were said to be booking profits after the recent run-up while investors were also unnerved by rumours, subsequently denied, that Bank Negara had issued tighter guidelines on financing of share purchases. BOMBAY fell sharply on the last day of the account. The BSE 30 share index lost 55.33 to 4,451.78, although the broader 100-share national index gained 14.08 to 2,116.49 reflecting some scattered buying.</p>

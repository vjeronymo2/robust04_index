			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In an effort to develop standards that did not require measuring the volume of solids, the Measurement Work Group decided to explore a format based on the weight of solids used, rather than the volume of finishing material or volume of solids. In evaluating a format of lb HAP emitted per lb solids used, the Measurement Work Group first concluded that this format predicted actual emission reductions better than any other format when extremes in finishing materials were tested. For example, if a source were to increase the solids content of its finishing material and decrease its usage of finishing materials, the format of lb HAP/lb solids properly credited the source's emission reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three potential drawbacks to the format of lb HAP/lb solids were identified by the Measurement Work Group. The first drawback concerned higher solids stains. Unlike the film building finishing materials, stain usage is not directly related to the solids content. A source could use a higher solids stain to reduce its lb HAP/lb solids level without decreasing stain usage or HAP emissions. The second drawback was that a source could double its film thickness to reduce the lb HAP/lb solids value while increasing emissions. The third drawback with using a lb HAP/lb solids format is related to pigmented finishing materials such as basecoats and enamels. Some of the pigments used in these finishing materials have a higher density than the solids used in conventional finishing materials. While these finishing materials typically have a lower HAP content than the conventional finishing materials used by the industry, the lb HAP/lb solids format for these finishing materials will overestimate the actual decrease in emissions because of the higher density of the solids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Work Group presented its findings to the Committee along with a recommendation that, despite the drawbacks, the lb HAP/lb solids format was the most reasonable. Regarding the first drawback (the problem with higher solids stains), the Work Group agreed that this issue did not pose a significant problem with the lb HAP/lb solids format. An analysis of an extreme case, that is, a stain with a solids content at the upper end of the normal range, indicated that the error would be less than 5 percent, which the Committee agreed was an acceptable margin of error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, another issue associated with the relationship between a lb HAP/lb solids format and stains was raised by industry when the Committee was developing the compliant coatings approach for meeting the emission limitation. As discussed, stains are low-solids finishing materials so formulating a stain to meet a limitation based on solids is difficult. The industry indicated that a compliant stain could be formulated, but only if the emission limitation applied only to the volatile HAP in the coating. Stains may contain small amounts of nonvolatile HAP such as chromium and manganese compounds for which there are no readily acceptable non-HAP substitutions. The industry pointed out that a significant percentage of these nonvolatile HAP are captured and controlled by filters in the spray booths. A small percentage may be emitted from overspray that is not captured by the filters, but industry indicated that these emissions will be reduced by the equipment requirements of the proposed standards, which will reduce finishing material usage and overspray (see discussion of work practices in section VI.E.). The Committee agreed that these nonvolatile HAP will be reduced both by filters and by the application equipment requirements so that the emission limitation for the finishing materials would apply only to the volatile HAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the second drawback (the coating thickness issue), industry pointed out that economics would preclude a source from meeting standards expressed as a lb HAP/lb solids by doubling the coating thickness. According to industry representatives, finishing lines are designed to run at a certain speed. To increase coating thickness, the line would have to be slowed down to apply more finishing material. This practice would lower the overall production rate. The cost of the additional finishing material and the lost production would deter a source from this approach. Industry representatives also pointed out that, in most situations, the product quality would suffer if the coating thickness were doubled. Given the unlikely situation of a source doubling its coating thickness, the Committee agreed that this was not a significant drawback to the lb HAP/lb solids format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

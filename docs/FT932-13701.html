			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Letter (2): Why British industry fails to attract talent Sir, Mr Crispin Hill's letter calling for academics to extol the virtues of a career in manufacturing suffers the same credibility problem that all such calls do from people who want others to do it but who are not prepared to do it themselves. If all the academics, journalists and other pundits who have suddenly realised that Britain's manufacturing base is seriously ill actually tried it, they would find out why many of the most able avoid or leave manufacturing. They would see that in manufacturing, incomes (below PLC board level) are significantly lower than in the professions, job security is less, and to get the job done you have to make the sort of decisions and take risks those in 'the professions' avoid like the plague. I agree that we need to raise the status of working in manufacturing, but the place to start is to raise the relative pay levels sharply. The rest will follow. While City slickers can charge Pounds 300 an hour to sell off the assets of bust businesses or to pontificate about manufacturing from the outside, can you blame anyone choosing to do that in preference to working harder for a fraction of the money, albeit that they have the 'satisfaction' of doing something of use to the world.

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Suharto to be challenged in court on decree Indonesia's political and economic stability belie the status and authority of the judiciary. It is a generally held view that President Suharto and senior cabinet ministers stand above the law and challenging authority at this level is largely taboo. The next few weeks, however, will see two cases which challenge the government's authority at its highest level. Hearings on the first case start today and involve Indonesian environmentalists suing President Suharto for issuing a decree which allegedly allowed state money from a reforestation project fund to be diverted to non-environmental causes. While the president has said he will face the challenge, officials have also made clear that he will not testify. In the second case, a prominent journalist, Mr Gunawan Mohamad, and former employees of the banned weekly magazine Tempo have filed a suit against Mr Harmoko, minister of information, challenging him for banning the magazine in June this year. Court hearings are expected to start within the next two weeks. Environmentalists and journalists admit their chances of winning are slim but they remain undeterred. 'Winning or losing is not the target here,' said Ms Emmy Hafild, project co-ordinator at Walhi, the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, which is among the seven pressure groups bringing the case against President Suharto. 'This suit is just a gesture.' Earlier this month, a Jakarta court established at preliminary hearings that the pressure groups and journalists have valid cases. Among other things, environmentalists are accusing President Suharto of 'violating the principles of good governance'. They have criticised him for not seeking parliamentary approval before allegedly diverting the money from the reforestation fund. No fewer than seven environmental and legal pressure groups have joined forces to file the suit against the 73-year-old president. They are contesting a presidential decree, issued on June 2, which, they say, allowed about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) from a reforestation fund to be used for developing a national aircraft industry.</p>

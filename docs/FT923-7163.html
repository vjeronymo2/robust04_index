			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Live from Houston with the Democrats THE Democrats are present at their rivals' convention in Houston, both in body and spirit. Democratic national chairman Ron Brown and Betsey Wright, a leading aide to Bill Clinton, are here, providing a running commentary and instant reaction to events on the floor for television. In addition the party plans to counter Republican attacks on Mr Clinton with two television ads. 'And now a short break for the facts,' the announcer says in one. 'On November 5 1990, George Bush signed the second-biggest tax increase in American history. Under Bill Clinton, Arkansas has the second-lowest tax burden per person in the country. Those are the facts. Back to the show.' Republicans were fuming that TV the night before had not broken into its regular coverage  - one network was into an update of the Woody Allen/Mia Farrow drama  - to broadcast live Mr Bush's punchy arrival in Houston. But the party had only itself to blame for running a loose schedule on Monday night. That meant Ronald Reagan only got to his feet well after prime time in the eastern half of the country. Some wags even said he appeared after his bedtime in California. Larry Bird, the Boston Celtics basketball star, yesterday announced that back injuries had forced his retirement, an important enough piece of news for CNN to interrupt its convention coverage and get an instant reaction from Vice-President Dan Quayle, whom it was interviewing at the time. The convention features a programme for foreign visitors, largely comprising conservative politicians. Not all, it seems, have taken a vow of diplomatic silence. One British politician was positively unrestrained at a lunch addressed by Jack Kemp, housing secretary. He kept shouting out 'Kemp in '96'. Sadly for those wanting to know his identity, British backbenchers are not exactly familiar faces for foreign correspondents.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of overall loss for first half MANNESMANN, the diversified German engineering group, lost money in every operating division in the first four months of 1993, and warned of an overall operating loss for the first half of the year. Hardest hit were the industrial giant's steel tubes division, and its manufacture of vehicle components, with sharp falls in both orders and turnover. Mr Werner Dieter, group chairman, said that at least 7,700 jobs would have to be cut from the 135,000-strong workforce, and possibly many more in the course of the year. However, the one area of the company's operations where it is expressing greater optimism is its D2 mobile telephone system, the first private network in Germany, which already has 220,000 customers. Mannesmann, which last year boosted its turnover to DM28bn (Dollars 17.1bn) from DM24.3bn in 1991, reflects the plight of the entire German engineering industry. Net profits dropped by almost half to DM339m from DM625m the previous year. Sales in the first four months were DM7.9bn, down 4 per cent from the comparable period of 1992, while orders stood at DM9.4bn, down 14 per cent. Mr Dieter blamed the losses on world-wide price pressures, currency fluctuations in Europe and one-off charges for the redundancy programme. The pipes and tubes division, Mannesmann's traditional core unit, saw the biggest squeeze, with a 23 per cent drop in turnover to DM928m, and a 21 per cent drop in orders to DM1.3bn. Two joint-venture plants owned by the Europipe grouping in Germany and France are to be closed this year, with a loss of some 600 jobs. Mr Dieter blamed cheap steel imports from central and eastern Europe for the plight of that division, as well as the collapse of the former Soviet market. He insisted, however, that the company would remain in all forms of tube manufacturing, although it might have to consider co-operation agreements and mergers with competitors. The vehicle components division was hit by the downturn in the German car industry, with orders in the first four months down 14 per cent to DM9.4bn.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. Nateq-Nuri,  and the deputies from the cities of Tehran, Torbat-e Jam,  Shahr-e Kord, and Damavand and Firuzkuh gave speeches. Then the  Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our  esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  'Abbas'ali 'Amid-Zanjani, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   Eighty percent of the nation's problems have to do with the  weak and naive performance of duties.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was 'Amid-Zanjani, deputy from Tehran. During his speech  he discussed the martyrdom anniversary of Master Motahari, and  he discussed a statement from His Holiness the Imam (peace be  upon him) concerning the mission of making the universities  Islamic. He said: We hope that in this opportunity for the  nation's higher education, all those working in science,  research, and education will seek to achieve this sacred goal  more quickly.    He then said: Those who are desperately working behind the  scenes of these activities to create fear and ultimately to  revive harshness in the country must realize that harshness in  this Islamic nation, in these circumstances with the  establishment of the government and the deepening of the  revolution, benefits no one, and the ones most subject to it  will be those who have started it.    The deputy from Tehran discussed the Voice and Vision of the  Islamic Republic of Iran Supervision Council. He said: The  Majles selected deputies for membership in this council, and Mr.  Hoseyni and I were appointed to serve in this capacity. We know  that the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran  Supervision Council replaced the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran Supervisory Council in the revision of the  Constitution, and that this council's responsibilities have been  precisely specified in the law approved by the Interests  Discernment Council. After a short delay, the Constitutional  Revision Council was formed for various reasons, and has so far  taken great strides to organize itself to perform the council's  lawful duties.    He added: These include compiling the relevant guidelines  and  creating appropriate organizations for carrying out the  responsibilities of constitutional revision and supervising the  Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    In this regard, programs have been selected as models and  have been evaluated by expert and experienced people. These  programs include programs for the New Year's celebration and for  children. In this regard I must say that the previous management  took steps to achieve the goals set by the organization. There  were malfunctions, and the new management appointed by order of  the exalted leader took very great and constructive steps.    Continuing his remarks, 'Amid-Zanjani discussed the arrival  of the time for the Mecca pilgrimage rites. He said: We hope  this year the obligations and rites of the pilgrimage will be  performed to achieve the goals of Abraham's pilgrimage, that the  Government of Saudi Arabia, which claims to be guarding the  shrines and to be serving the pilgrims, will act on this claim  sincerely, that it will not obstruct the performance of rites,  which are a part of the essence of Abraham's pilgrimage (purging  polytheists), and that this year's pilgrims, like those in  previous years, will be able to perform their pilgrimage  obligations as commanded by Koran and Islamic law.    He discussed the issue of the work ethic. He said: The  revival of this great Islamic tradition, the call for which we  are hearing from society's leader, is really a call that was  issued with deep forcefulness in the first days by the Prophet  of Islam.    In any case, this is a cultural slogan which, if  implemented,  can solve many of our problems, even the economic and social  ones. Perhaps 80 percent of the nation's problems have to do  with this very problem of weak and naive performance of duties.    The speaker then addressed the deputies. He said: In Article  72 of the Constitution we see that the Majles and the deputies  are prohibited from enacting bills and motions that are in  conflict with the criteria of the pure religious laws of Islam.  The meaning of the above article is that the Majles cannot enact  anything it sees as being in conflict with religious law. Some  people think this is the duty of the Guardian Council and that  it is only the Guardian Council that must concern itself with  whether something is contrary to religious law or not. This is a  great mistake. The Constitution has prohibited the Majles and  the deputies from approving any laws or bills that are in any  way in conflict with the criteria of Islam. Therefore, each  deputy must take the steps necessary to determine which motion  or bill is in violation of Islamic criteria and which is not.    It is no excuse for any deputy not to know what is in  violation of the criteria of Islam.  <H5>  Mohammad Hoseyni, Deputy From Torbat-e Jam </H5>   Through obedience to the commands from the exalted leader  concerning the work ethic and social order, a civilization  worthy of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be established.    The next speaker was Mohammad Hoseyni, deputy from Torbat-e  Jam. During his speech he said: One of the problems and  afflictions besetting many developing nations is the lack of  suitable and enduring economic policies to put economic issues  in order. These nations use short-term and unstable policies to  deal with their economic problems.    In the same regard he said: Improved economic polices could  increase the average return on economic projects by 50 to 100  percent. Therefore, putting the economic issues in order needs  stabilization of government policies, and it is hoped that this  will be achieved in the Second Five-Year Plan. The speaker then  discussed the fact that exports are one of the most vital  economic sectors in any nation. He said: To stabilize their  economies, governments try to increase their national exports  and to free themselves from having a single product. It is clear  that the respected government is trying to liberate the economy  from single-product exports.    He added: It is hoped that the government will give special  attention to this important sector, that it will create  industrial planning centers for exports, activate the export  guarantee fund, activate the Nonoil Export Development  Committee, create an exports information bank, create a  permanent exhibition of export goods, establish regulations and  criteria for the marketing of goods at export exhibitions,  establish an export development institute, strengthen private  export companies, establish a market development fund, and  finally that it will revise the export organizations, in order  to be able to achieve greater growth in the Second Five-Year  Plan, meaning more than $23 billion.    Continuing, he said: The Third World nations, especially the  Islamic nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran, must give  special attention to the production, conversion, preservation,  and sound distribution of foodstuffs. In this regard, in  studying the Second Five-Year Plan the Majles must give the  necessary attention to the production of food and to the related  food industries.    The deputy from Torbat-e Jam discussed the efforts of the  enemies of Islam to exaggerate problems and weakness by  depicting public lack of confidence in the government. He said:  This matter magnifies the duty of the officials and especially  the deputies to explain the issues to the people.    He noted: Although failed efforts in the last few months by  those who have submitted to imperialism, such as the dastardly  attacks against the president of the republic and the temporary  Friday imam of Mashhad, are proof that the enemy has been  unsuccessful in this effort and has turned again to physical  assassination. It is necessary, however, by explaining the  government's luminous achievements in the First Five-Year Plan,  to disappoint the enemy more than ever.    Hoseyni then discussed World Worker Day and offered  congratulations to workers on this day. He expressed the hope  that through obedience to the commands of the exalted leader,  who has emphasized the two basic elements of the work ethic and  social order, it will be possible to establish a civilization  worthy of Islam and the Government of the Islamic Republic of  Iran in the current century.    Continuing, the speaker said: Information from the Iran  Statistics Center shows that the national literacy rate in the  country for those six years of age and older in the year 1365  [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] was 61.8 percent, and in the year  1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this figure reached 74.1  percent. At the same time, the result of a research project  shows that 95 percent of the population in the compulsory  education ages between six and 10 years were studying in the  schools in the year 1370. It is necessary to offer  congratulations on Teacher Week and Teacher Day to all those  working in education and training, especially the esteemed  teachers, for the unstinting efforts of teachers, managers, the  administrative-educational cadre and others, and foremost among  them it is necessary to praise and thank the committed and  learned minister, the resourceful manager of the nation's  education and training.    The deputy from Torbat-e Jam offered condolences on the  martyrdom anniversary of Martyr Motahari and he issued memos to  officials on the problems in his electoral district, as follows:  to the minister of commerce on expediting the wheat storage and  silo project, to the minister of roads and transportation to  expedite widening the road from Fariman to Torbat-e Jam and  Taybad, to the minister of the interior to expedite appointment  of the governor of Taybad.    At the end of his speech the speaker also praised and  thanked  the minister of culture and higher education for ordering the  creation of the government university, the minister of petroleum  for expediting the gas delivery project, and the Khorasan  general manager of industry and agriculture for giving special  attention to Torbat-e Jam.  <H5>  'Ali Mobini Dehkerdi, Deputy From Shahr-e Kord </H5>   The Islamic government has presented a new way to manage a  society and it has rejected and rejects imperialism and  domination.    The next speaker was Mobini Dehkadeh'i [as published],  deputy  from Shahr-e Kord. During his speech he offered congratulations  on Labor and Worker Week and Teacher Week. He added: In these  sensitive times we commemorate the greatness of the position,  rank and status of the martyr of the pen and Islamic thought,  the great thinker and trainer of youth in the seminary and the  university, Martyr Motahari, because this theologian and Islamic  philosopher is the best model for officials, teachers,  educators, ministry of education employees and professors.    He asked insiders to encourage society to study the works of  Martyr Motahari. He said: The generosity of a human being and  his wisdom, greatness and pride is found in the light of the  life-giving orthodoxy of Islam. The Islamic government has  presented a new road and path for the management of society and  it rejects any kind of imperialism, exploitation, expansionism,  domination or acceptance of domination. The martyr-nurturing,  loyal, and sacrificing nation of Iran is proud to be the leading  government of the world's oppressed, believers, pious, free,  free-thinking and God-seeking people.    The speaker also said: Iran has begun an extensive and aware  effort to cut its economic, cultural, social, and scientific  dependence on oppressive nations, and to teach the world's  thinkers and intellectuals that it is effective to live  independently with self-reliance, belief in self and rejecting  the selling of self through careful implementation of the  commands of the Koran and the traditions of the esteemed Prophet  of Islam. He then added: The world devourers, with the support  of world imperialism, have trampled the primary human rights of  societies and nations. With arrogance, vanity, hate, genocide,  shamelessness, and heedlessness in the heart of Europe, they are  secretly and openly trying to deprive the rich civilization of  Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the support of Islamic  government. The Serbian genocide against Muslims, burning, and  the aggression in Gorazde must be analyzed in this same  connection.    The speaker discussed the defeat of imperialist policymakers  in their efforts to resist and control Islam. He discussed the  enactment of the Second Five-Year Plan in the year 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] and then evaluated the First Five-Year  Plan. He said: One of the important ways to anchor inflation and  high prices and to support the oppressed classes in society is  serious struggle against economic, government, and private  monopolies, preventing collusion in the marketing of the goods  needed by society, supervising the domestic market and setting  prices justly. It is clear that the people must not pay the  price of the inability of managers and their waste and  extravagance in the form of existing monopolies.    He also added: The importance of transferring economic and  executive activities to loans and privatization is possible  through the creation of an organization independent of  government organizations under the supervision of the Policy  Council with representatives from the nation's three government  powers, the judicial, the executive and the legislative.  [sentence as published] Preventing social polarization,  providing for public participation in production matters,  aligning economic adjustment with the banking facilities given,  transferring government resources and equipment to the people,  and increasing the utilization coefficient requires more  activity than has so far been carried out, so that the  government can carry out its basic responsibilities with more  peace of mind.    Continuing, the speaker said: Having administration that is  strong and not subject to doubt in the reform of the nation's  administrative and executive structure is one of the country's  clear requirements today. Serious struggle against giant  government, meeting the minimum needs of government employees,  reducing the volume of the government and organizing the  nation's revenues and expenditures are possible through serious  and sincere cooperation between the government and the Majles.    The deputy from Shahr-e Kord then discussed the important  role of the Voice and Vision organization and the media in  promoting the culture of working, trying, and economizing. He  said: A great religious and national duty is to establish  Islamic values in society and to eliminate Western values  expressed through the use of clothing, garments, industrial  products and consumer goods.    Mobini Dehkerdi then cited strengthening and promoting the  spirit of lawfulness among the nation's officials and the people  and focusing on the Five-Year Plan instead of individual,  organizational, and sector concerns in society as areas worthy  of consideration in the nation's situation today. He said: An  undeniable principle for achieving a nonoil economy is the  adoption of clear and firm polices to reduce dependence in the  government's annual budget on oil revenues during the Second  Five-Year Plan, in such a way that it will be achieved by the  end of the plan, with the development of nonoil exports and  improved tax revenues based on the criterion of the incomes of  society's classes.  <H5>  Seyyed Ahmad Rasuli-Nezhad, Deputy From Damavand and Firuzkuh </H5>   The Ministry of Roads and Transportation has raised the  rates  for train, aircraft, minibus and urban bus fares on its own  initiative.    The final preagenda speaker was Rasuli-Nezhad, deputy from  Firuzkuh. In his speech he severely condemned the killing and  slaughter of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said: The  Security Council's lackeys react to everything that is against  the interest of its permanent members. How do you justify the  way it has dealt with the killing of Muslims at al-Khalil by the  Zionists and the slaughter in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the  hands of the bloodthirsty Serbs?    He said: It seems that this council issues a resolution  every  time the interests and security of the bullies, superpowers,  world imperialists and their agents are threatened, and issues  an order to put down the threat. What answer is the unworthy UN  secretary-general giving to nations for all these crimes and and  oppression?    He then discussed the problems in his electoral district. He  said: Since the time the current minister took over, not only  has the Ministry of Roads and Transportation failed to act on  the decisions that have been made and to remove the burden from  the shoulders of the people, it has created many problems and  severe dissatisfaction for the people. This includes raising the  tolls on freeways and highways without providing additional  services and acceptable quality.    Heavy vehicles, which cause much loss of life and property,  are allowed to use the freeways solely to obtain more revenue.    He added: Other examples are the heavy and sudden price  increases for tickets for passenger trains, aircraft, and  recently for minibuses and urban buses. In the last example, how  is it that the respected minister of roads and transportation  and its general managers throughout the country undertook on  their own initiative to increase fares, without the slightest  consultation with province executive officials, especially the  governors-general, the governors, and the district governors?    This was done on the pretext that the gentlemen doing the  driving wanted this fare increase for the New Year's holidays so  they could provide appropriate and worthy service to the  respected travelers. To prevent protests from officials and the  people, they announced a specific date for implementing this  program in a set of guidelines, so that this aspect of the  situation might be tolerable. It was completely surprising and  regrettable, however, that after the end of the announced period  they issued another guidelines statement saying that the rates  announced in the previous guidelines will remain in force,  setting off a wave of public unhappiness. They themselves are  sitting in warm and comfortable seats, coming and going in the  latest fancy vehicles, their women and children at ease. It  appears that they have not thought for an instant about the  women and children of the people, the passengers and these  toiling, low-income, oppressed people.    Mr. Torkan, we in the Damavand and Firuzkuh area did not  have  any problem transporting passengers during the New Year's  holidays for you to come and raise prices. Is it fair for  travelers from Damavand taking this short trip to Tehran and  back to pay such a fare? Is it fair for an oppressed person from  Firuzkuh, a city in the province of Tehran, to pay the heavy  1,600-rial official fare you announced just to take the short  trip to Tehran and back? Perhaps it is not your concern whether  the people have the money or not, people who must stand for  hours lined up without shelter in the burning summer sun and in  the unbearable winter cold to obtain transportation at this  heavy fare.    In this same regard the speaker added: Mr. minister, do you  feel the pain of these people? I sharply protest this willful  initiative by the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, which  has severely disturbed the people in my electoral district. I  ask that the previous rates be announced and implemented. If  this is not done, in accordance with my lawful duty, I will  present a question to the minister in charge at an open Majles  session, or I will take any other legal step within the realm of  my responsibilities in order to pursue the matter to its  conclusion.    Continuing, Rasuli-Nezhad said: It is surprising, in view of  the fact that we are in the planting season and in the second  month of the current year, that it is still not known on what  date the budget for the current year will be sent to the offices  of the governors-general and the executive organizations. This  is especially surprising in my electoral district, where the  planting season is limited and the cold season is long.    The deputy from Damavand and Firuzkuh added: The sudden  increase in the rate for consumer electrical power has made the  people anxious and unhappy and has caused a substantial shutdown  at workshops and small factories.    He discussed manpower adjustment. He said: We must first  think about creating employment and work, and then think about  adjustment.    The speaker then discussed the numerous and repeated press  conferences by the members of the Council of Ministers and he  asked the president of the republic to remind them that not only  do these appearances not solve any problems, they create  problems and headaches for the nation and the government.    At the end of his speech Rasuli-Nezhad said: In view of the  fact that a number of people live on the poverty line and are in  need of their evening bread, the preparation of an album on the  first round of women's games in the Islamic nations at 25 tumans  was a completely improper thing to do, and should be pursued and  dealt with.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Amendment to the Airline Organization Law </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was continued consideration of the report from the  second consultation of the Roads and Transportation Commission  concerning the Motion To Amend Articles From the Law  Establishing the Airline Organization of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, which was approved by the deputies.    Article 1: Article 5, Note 2 of the law is amended as  follows:    Article 5: The National Aircraft Organization is the only  authority authorized to sign agreements and authorizations  between the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other  nations. The right to make flights to transport persons and  things to make use of the rights given in contracts, agreements  and authorizations for the operation of air services between the  government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other nations is  assigned to the Aircraft Company of the Islamic Republic of  Iran. If the Aircraft Company of the Islamic Republic of Iran  fails to announce that is ready to provide airline services  within a maximum of six months, the National Aircraft  Organization is authorized to give authorization to operate the  flights to other government airline companies.    Note 2: Iranian airline institutions, with the exception of  the National Airline Organization of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, which operate under the relevant regulations and conduct  flight operations, as well as other Iranian airline  institutions, which may be established in the future adhering to  the Flight Law with the necessary letter of authorization, may  engage in passenger and freight transportation or any other type  of commercial flight without weight restrictions with passenger  or freight aircraft (as determined by the Supreme National  Airline Council). The executive director of the Airline Company  of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be appointed as a voting  member of the Supreme National Airline Council mentioned in  Article 6 of the Amendment to the National Airline Law.    Article 2: Note 2, Article 11 is amended as follows:    Note 2: The National Airline Organization and the government  airline companies are included in all the activities given in  Article 11 of the aforementioned law.    Article 3: Article 7 is amended as follows:    Article 7: As of the date of this law's enactment, the  general representative (agence general) for the  foreign airline institutions in Iran and likewise for aircraft  technical services (repairs) will be the National Aircraft  Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Passenger land  support services, the deplaning of passengers, and the unloading  and loading of aircraft at the nation's airports for domestic  flights, with the exception of the aforementioned company and  the companies affiliated with the National Aircraft  Organization, are assigned to the National Aircraft  Organization, and the Airline Company of the Islamic Republic of  Iran will perform these tasks in the case of foreign aircraft.  If shortcomings and malfunctions are felt in the performance of  these duties, the National Aircraft Organization can assign the  tasks by prior announcement to real and legal persons and  entities, whether government or nongovernment. With the approval  of this law, all other conflicting laws are null and void.  <H5>  Amendment to the International Railway Transportation and </H5> Shipping Convention    Another item on the agenda was the report from the Housing  and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill Amending  Articles From the International Railway Transportation and  Shipping Convention, of which Article 1 was approved by the  deputies.    Article 1: The amended protocol dated 30 December 1990 (29  Azar 1369) to the International Railway Transportation and  Shipping Convention dated 9 May 1980 (19 Ordibehesht 1359)  enacted by the Second General Assembly of the United Nations for  international rail transportation and shipping, is approved.  <H5>  Amendment to the Iran Communications Company Law </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report from the  Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the  Bill Amending Article 7 of the Law Establishing the Iran  Communications Company (returned from the Guardian Council), for  which the amendment to Article 7 was deleted in order to secure  the approval of the Guardian Council.    It is worth mentioning that this amendment states that the  Iran Communications Company may issue agreements in principle  for the creations of specialist communications companies.    Rashidi, expert for the Administrative and Employment  Affairs  Commission, said concerning this: The Guardian Council issued  the opinion that the creation of such organizations in the  Communications Company entails a financial burden and that this  violates the Constitution. After receiving this opinion, the  commission invited the minister of post and telegraph, and he  dispensed in some way with this proposal from the Communications  Company. Therefore the commission voted for the deletion of this  amendment.  <H5>  Bill Giving Minister of Roads and Transportation Membership </H5> on the Iran Supreme Architecture Council    The fifth item on the agenda was the report from the  Administrative Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Giving the  Minister of Roads and Transportation Membership on the Iran  Supreme Urban Construction and Architecture Council (returned  from the Guardian Council), and the aforementioned minister's  membership was deleted and rejected in order to secure the  approval of the Guardian Council.  <H5>  Bill Forming Rural Development Homes </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the Bill Forming Rural  Development Homes. Mr. Rashidi, expert for the Administrative  and Employment Affairs Commission, said concerning this: This  bill, intended to improve the economic, social, and development  situation in rural areas, seeks to maintain, preserve, and  develop investment, which is made for rural people.    After speeches by two people opposing and supporting the  bill, continued consideration was postponed to the next session.  <H5>  Selection of Majles Deputies To Supervise Implementation of </H5> the 1373 Budget Notes    Another item on the agenda was the selection of Majles  deputies to supervise implementation of the notes of the 1373  National Budget Law, as follows:    1 - Mr. Jalali, with 149 votes, and Mobini Dehkerdi, with  148  votes, will supervise distribution of credits and the procedure  for implementing Paragraph B, Note 2 of the 1373 budget. This  note pertains to economizing on 1373 current and development  expenses for government companies and banks, which are spent on  projects in rural and deprived areas.    2 - Bahonar, with 139 votes, and Mohammad Hashem Rahbari,  with 148 votes, will represent the Majles as supervisors at the  meetings of the Economic Council.    3 - Rashidi, with 139 votes and Mr. Nosrati, with 114 votes,  will supervise the purchase of basic goods.    4 - Mr. Ja'fari, with 131 votes and Mr. Kuhkan, with 116  votes from the commission, and Mr. Moqteda'i, with 99 votes from  the commission, will supervise proper implementation of Note 13.  This note pertains to the performance of missions outside the  country by government agents, workers, and companies.    The selection of the rest of the deputies to supervise  implementation of the 1373 notes was postponed to the next  session.  <H5>  Condemnation of the Attempted Assassination of the Mashhad </H5> Temporary Friday Imam by 167 Deputies    In a a letter read at yesterday's open Majles session, 167  deputies condemned the attempted assassination of the Mashhad  Temporary Friday Imam. The text of the letter is as follows:    To His Holiness Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mr. 'Aba'i,  Mashhad temporary Friday Imam    The report of the attempted assassination of that great man  severly affected all the forces of the Islamic revolution. You  are one of the true children of the Islam of Mohammad (peace be  upon him), one of the students from the school of Imam Sadeq  (peace be upon him), a prominent figure at the seminary, and one  of the true and long-time companions of His Holiness the Imam  (peace be upon him) and the exalted leader. We thank God that  through the grace of His Holiness Baqiyatollah al-A'zam (may God  hasten his joyful advent) and special grace from His Holiness  'Ali ibn Musa al-Reza (peace be upon him), you were spared this  danger to continue service to Islam and the Muslims.</p>

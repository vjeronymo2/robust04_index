			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in  Spanish at 0100 GMT on 12 April broadcast a live debate by four  Panamanian presidential candidates: Ernesto Perez Balladares of  the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD), Ruben Dario Carles of  the Change '94 coalition, Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian  Democratic Party (PDC), and Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro  Movement. The debate, which is being held at the Atlapa  Convention Center in Panama City, is sponsored by the Latin  American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media  Presidential Debate Committee, and is moderated by Ricardo  Alberto Arias.    Arias begins by saying the debate will focus on four topics:  the national economy, the Panama Canal and reverted areas,  social and political problems, and the country's present and  future. Three television journalists will pose questions to the  candidates: Luz Maria Noli of Televisora Nacional, Dora de  Reyna of Telemetro Television, and Julio Miller of RPC  Television.    The debate gets under way with Noli asking Blades what he  plans to do regarding the $3.4 billion in overdue payments the  Panamanian Government owes international banks. Blades replies:  "One possible answer is this: Nothing, which is exactly what  those individuals in charge of negotiations on the foreign debt  have been doing. We have a huge problem with the international  banks. Under the current circumstances, we have no resources to  amortize this debt." Blades continues by saying that, from 1982  to 1992, Latin America disbursed more than $110 billion for a  debt that originally amounted to $330 billion and now amounts to  $420 billion. He says the nation must concentrate on  development when dealing with this "immoral and unpayable debt."    Asked by Noli about Panama's commitment to repaying its  foreign debt, Blades replies: "While the Papa Egoro Movement  recognizes the debts contracted by the Panamanian state, it also  takes into account the need to repay domestic debts, as well as  the need to create conditions that will make economic  development possible."    Commenting on this same topic, Carles says: "These debts  have  been incurred by the state and must be repaid, but the various  options available must be negotiated with dignity and firmness.  I have already said that the current government should stop all  negotiations with commercial banks and let the next government  resolve this problem."    Vallarino also comments on this issue: "Blades is right to a  certain extent, but we cannot ignore the fact that Panama, for  its entire commercial life, has been bounded to the  international community. Although it was not the Panamanian  people who incurred this debt, it was illegally agreed upon, the  money has been spent, and we really have to repay it. We should  seek rapprochement with the banks and try to utilize the Brady  Plan or other options, such as exchanging our debts for  environmental guarantees."    When the discussion turns to how the Panamanian Government  can meet its social goals in light of the burden of the foreign  debt, Perez Balladares says: "Governments can implement their  social programs in three ways. One is to levy taxes; another,  to secure financing through public debt; the third, by way of  savings." He fails to say which of these means he favors.    According to Blades, a government with clearly outlined  goals  can successfully handle negotiations on the foreign debt. He  says, "The problem we have had so far is that we have not been  taken seriously."    Next, Dora de Reina asks Carles how he plans to restructure  public finances to encourage greater investment. Carles  answers: "We must continue to stick to the methods we have been  applying for four years, and we must apply them with discipline,  seriousness, and honesty."    When asked by Reina which government agencies he would  concentrate on to attain his goals, Carles replies people should  be required to act in a trustworthy manner. The problem in  Panama, he says, is not money, but the way in which money is  used. "We must ensure that those funds allocated to public  services are returned to the public." Efficiency and  willingness to work is the key, he says.    Vallarino says he views investment differently. "The problem  of investment in Panama is that investors must be able to trust  in the government, and the government must be honest." He adds:  "More investments are necessary, particularly from the private  sector. This can be engendered by a country that inspires  confidence."    When discussing how to operate the government in tight  financial times, Perez Balladares says he will encourage reduced  public spending, although he admits this is not enough. He  adds: "We are inviting the private sector to participate in  financing and developing infrastructure works projects. The  private and public sectors must work together to achieve  national goals."    Blades comments that the country's economic difficulties  are artificial because the country possesses natural and human  resources. "Panama's economic difficulties are the result of  official corruption and the lack of willingness by authorities  to develop the country. If we eliminate official corruption and  the lack of imagination and willingness, the economic problems  will disappear."    Carles says he has been arguing for four years that the  problem is not the lack of money but the use of available  resources. "We depend very heavily on the private sector."    Miller next asks candidate Vallarino if he thinks the next  government should privatize some state enterprises. Vallarino  replies: "The next government should privatize everything it  can, but we must be careful not to harm workers with large-scale  dismissals. Workers should also be allowed to share in the  enterprises' ownership." Asked by Miller if obligations with  the international financial institutions should be honored in  relationship to this privatization, Vallarino replies that he  never agreed with the obligations with international banks but  that they exist so they must be honored. "Public interest comes  first, then the state's interest. Public interest includes the  people, families, and the unemployed."    Perez Balladares comments: "The criterion for privatization  should be greater social efficiency. I do not believe in  privatization for the sake of privatization. I disagree with  Mr. Vallarino."    Blades adds that it is risky to privatize strategic national  assets such as electric services and telecommunications. "I do  not think any enterprise in Panama should be privatized if it  would result in large-scale dismissals. If it must be done, we  should first try to relocate the workers who would be fired."    Carles argues that international banks should not be cause  for too much concern about privatization matters. "We have to  privatize services, not institutions. Certain activities of all  existing institutions can be privatized to prevent loss, waste,  corruption, and inefficiency."    Vallarino concludes: "Privatization must benefit the  workers.  When I spoke about privatization, I meant all those services  that are not monopolies. I disagree with Perez Balladares.  Ventures in the 1970's and 1980's impoverished the Panamanian  people and have cost many millions that could have been well  invested in hospitals, schools, and roads."    Noli then asks candidate Perez Balladares the last question  on the national economy. Asked for his position on the money  laundering charges made by the United States against Panama,  Perez Balladares says: "Aside from cosmetic actions, this  government has not taken the steps that should have been taken."  He says corporations are chiefly to blame for this illegal  activity. "The existing instruments in the banking system are  good enough if they are used. All reports on deposits exceeding  $10,000 should be fed into a central computer. That would make  it possible to see at a glance if companies are making cash  deposits that exceed the sales figures reported to the Finance  Ministry. Someone should make sure that goods sold in the Colon  Free Zone actually leave the area to prevent false sales, which  can be used as a method of money laundering."    Blades comments that money laundering is a very particular  activity that will be very difficult to eradicate, but certain  measures could be taken. He states: "Control over amounts up  to $10,000 should be extended to pawn shops and loan companies.  I am amused when I hear about smuggling, considering that we  have 1,500 miles of coastline and only a few boats. I wonder why  the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet ratified  the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty."    Carles says: "I cannot accept the North Americans' drug  trafficking accusations against Panama after they issued good  conduct certificates to Noriega."    Thus ends the national economy segment.    Regarding the topic of the Canal and the reverted areas,  Reyna mentions that some analysts have suggested that the  Neutrality Treaty curtails Panama's capability to generate  revenues. She asks candidates if they have studied the subject  and their opinion on the analysts' statement.    Ruben Blades replies that ``although the Treaty does strain  our capability to generate revenues, we should not emphasize the  aspect of tolls.'' Blades emphasizes: "The Canal must have a  broader function in addition to the simple aspect of toll rates.  The Canal must be incorporated into a process of economic  development and the creation of an array of services that do not  now exist." Asked about an increase in toll rates, Blades  argued that Panama cannot implement an increase out of the blue.  He added: "I would call for a direct meeting with the United  States and the countries that use the Canal most and tell them  that we must do something because otherwise the operation,  maintenance, and efficient management of the Canal will be at  stake. I strongly believe they will be willing to accede to  changes in the toll policy."    On the same subject, Carles argues: "From any angle, the  Canal is ours and we are the ones who, with good judgment and  solid criteria, must decide on changes regarding the toll policy  and services." Considering that Panama does not have a monopoly  on interoceanic transportation, Panama must examine the effects  an increase might have on Panama's competitive capability, he  adds.    Vallarino notes that although Article 3 of the Neutrality  Treaty poses difficulties to Panama regarding tolls, they are  negotiable. Vallarino stresses: "Article 4 sells our  sovereignty, and that is why I do not agree with the argument  that we should not look back." He says running for president is  like applying for the most important and delicate job in the  country and says presidential candidates must present their  references just like any other job seeker.    Perez Balladares agrees that users must have some input  regarding the toll policy. He emphasizes: "What is important  is not the revenues generated by tolls but the considerable  wealth that the future utilization of areas bordering the Canal  could generate."    Blades concludes that increases should be considered only if  they are necessary and that all the benefits resulting from the  Canal's return to Panama must be invested nationwide.    Miller next asks Carles if he agrees with the structure and  functions of the ARI, the Interoceanic Region Authority.    Carles replies that the ARI must be given an opportunity and  be pressured to work efficiently and rapidly, because gaining  control of the Canal is a blessed opportunity to profit from a  geographic situation that is key to the country's development.    Questioned by Miller on how to prevent the ARI and the Canal  from becoming a political pinata, Carles says that it happened  before during the military period. He adds: "I am optimistic  that the ARI will be able to make significant contributions to  the country's progress."    Along this line, Vallarino asserts that the ARI is good and  that it should draft all its regulations and send them to the  National Assembly for approval. Vallarino believes that "to a  great extent, the success of ARI depends on who is managing it,  and that is the bottom line."    Perez Balladares comments: "First, I believe that ARI  decisions must be approved by the president before they are  implemented. Second, the ARI board of directors must be  broadened to include more sectors of Panamanian society."    Blades states that there are a number of opinions regarding  the use of the reverted areas. He claims: "I do have problems  with the way the ARI has been drafted because I can see a future  conflict between the path the ARI assumes and the path that I,  as president, would assume regarding the tapping of the reverted  areas."    Noli then asks Vallarino for his opinion on recent polls  showing that Panamanians want U.S. bases to stay in Panama. He  replies that the Panamanian people are very much afraid of what  the government will do with the reverted areas and bases because  of the many failures. "Panamanians can put all the reverted  areas to good use and create jobs. A project I studied a few  days ago would provide between 25 and 50 percent of the jobs  presently provided by the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in the  Canal Zone." Asked by Noli if he would favor changes regarding  the bases, Vallarino replies: "I would show the Panamanian  people all the things that can be done with the reverted areas."    Perez Balladares comments: "I think attention has been  focused on the wrong issue. The military bases are a military  problem, not an economic one. Wherever there are military  bases, the two countries involved agree that the presence of  those bases benefits them both militarily. In Panama's case,  the North Americans have said clearly that they do not want to  stay. If they have changed their mind, they should say so."    Blades says the discussion seems like rhetoric. "Panama is  better off without foreign military bases. We can reap high  profits from the reverted areas and protect our national  identity at the same time. An honest government can dispel  fears of instability and economic depression." Carles counters  by saying: "The national identity was destroyed by Omar Torrijos  when he placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella." Vallarino  comments that Panama should not offer the national territory for  the bases to stay if the U.S. Government itself has said it is  not interested. "I am sure that we can turn those bases into an  emporium of wealth through honest work for the people's good.  The return of the bases can mark the beginning of our great  economic growth."    Reyna asks Perez Balladares the last question on the  constitutional amendment proposal on the canal, and he says it  is not bad. "I would support constitutional reforms regarding  the canal administration." As for the possibility of keeping  party politics separate from canal affairs, he replies: "The  country must make progress between elections and strive for  national goals regardless of who governs the country during the  five-year term. This is what we intend to do."    Blades says that regardless of what the Constitution says,  an  honest government is required. Carles adds that the canal is a  delicate matter. "The norms introduced in the proposal to amend  the Constitution by the commission headed by Vallarino considers  the most important subjects in the canal administration. We  cannot wait until the year 2000." Vallarino says it is not  normal to handle these things through the Constitution, "but  considering the corruption we have seen, it is a good idea to  include these things in the document to remove them from the  influence of politics and nepotism and other forms of corruption  in the government." This marks the end of the discussion on the  canal and reverted areas and the topic turns to social and  political problems.    Miller asks Blades what he will do to solve the Social  Security Fund members' complaints about the shortage of  medicines and hospital beds. He replies that the Social  Security Fund problem is a complex one. "The government owes the  fund $828 million in bonds and notes payable. The state has  been used to divert funds from certain institutions. In  addition, the state has not developed national economic  projects. Funds should be redirected to the health sector."  Asked by Miller about the current retirement age, Blades  replies that it is risky to speak of bigger pensions and  retirement unless we can be sure of where the necessary funds  will come from. "What we need is an honest government that  manages health resources properly."    Carles says the dictatorship and the PRD did away with the  fund. "We should first consider the technical studies that have  been done and proceed from there." Vallarino says the health  problem is serious because many people cannot afford to pay for  private services. Perez Balladares and Blades agree on the need  to improve the services offered by the Social Security Fund.  Carles adds that water service can be improved in a number of  ways. Vallarino, Perez Balladares, and Blades agree.    Reyna then says Panama lags behind the rest of the world in  terms of education and asks Vallarino what he proposes to  correct the situation. He replies that "teachers must be  trained and reassured of their benefits and salaries. We must  also build schools." Asked about the establishment of private  universities, Vallarino says they will help raise Panama's  cultural level. Perez Balladares says: "Our government will  make education a priority." Blades says education is closely  associated with health. "We have to make breakfast and lunch  available to children while they are at school, but we must  first make sure of our goals." Carles and Vallarino agree that  education is fundamental.    Miller next asks Perez Balladares about the crime rate  linked  to the lack of security. The candidate replies: "The police  have to be given back their self-esteem." "Drug trafficking must  be fought at its various stages. We must keep young people from  being lured into it by strengthening the family. Schools must  be protected, and traffickers must be punished. The police must  be professionalized." Perez Balladares clarifies that by  professionalization he does not mean militarization of the  police, which should be professional nevertheless. Blades  advocates attacking the causes of corruption. "Officials in  positions of authority need to set good examples." Carles adds:  "We need a civilian police force without traces of militarism.  We should start by creating a real police academy."    Vallarino says: "I think it is essential, as several have  already said, that we must avoid impunity, we need to punish the  guilty, especially those higher up and the white collar  criminals, especially when they are public officials. We need  to punish and act tough with those who are the true source of  the drug problem."    Perez Balladares agrees that the punitive part of drug  control has to be beefed up but adds: "To truly face up to this  problem we need to strengthen the structure of the Panamanian  family."    Arias announces that during this last stage of the debate  with the four presidential candidates, "the topic will continue  to be social and political problems. Due to time constraints,  no follow-up questions will be allowed in this stage."    Noli asks Blades, if he were president would he back a duty  free port law for Bocas del Toro Province similar to the law  already approved for Colon Province, since both places have  similar unemployment problems. Blades replies that Papa Egoro  is proposing something even better -- provincial inventories:  "Each province is being examined to determine its human and  natural resources and what are its infrastructure and public  service needs. Once we can determine exactly what are the  strong points of each province, we will then have the  opportunity to truly define what the best path is, in economic  terms, for each province. Nevertheless, as I know the people of  Bocas del Toro are watching, they should know right now that  similar to what has been done for Colon, they can rest assured  that we are not going to forget them, as has been the case up to  now."    Carles then replies to the same question, stressing that  Panama is a country and we cannot have the country sprinkled  with duty free stores all over. Instead, Panama needs a  national economic policy. "We must first test the Colon free  port system and see how this concept works and then see what can  be done in the future."    Vallarino says that he welcomes the question because it  gives  him the opportunity to explain something: "You may not believe  what I am about to say, but Colon is probably the richest city  in the world on an average per capita income basis.  Nevertheless, there are a number of people in Colon who live  very, very, very badly. The problem is not Colon; the problem  is helping the people of Colon take advantage of the  opportunities they have around them."    Perez Balladares replies: "To my way of thinking the Colon  free port proposal is very appropriate for the area of Colon and  its idiosyncrasy because Colon is located at one of the Canal's  terminal ports. I sincerely do not believe this is applicable  to other provinces of the Republic, which have a vocation for  agriculture, self-production."    Arias says that Reyna will ask Carles a question. Reyna says  that in general, the government in Panama has kept women out of  posts requiring responsibility. She asks whether Carles can  make a formal promise for women's participation in his  government. Carles replies that in the Comptroller General's  Office nearly half the heads of department were women and that  they were excellent workers. "In my administration women will  have the same opportunities as men because experience tells of  their capacity, dedication, and efficiency."    Vallarino again refers to his party's pact and says: "In my  government, if elected, all land deeds that are distributed will  be in the name of the couple, in a family.    Perez Balladares says: "I want to say that the idea is not  to passively create equal conditions. I think that we must  actively and positively establish equal conditions; and under  equal conditions, we should favor women. Why do I say this?  Because the contrary has been true historically."    Blades points out that his Papa Egoro Movement is "the first  party in Panama's history to offer, by statute, 50 percent of  its positions to women." The candidate says he is pleased by  his colleagues' opinion regarding women. Blades adds that  "women must be considered not only simply for humanitarian  reasons, but because they are simply better educated, in primary  and secondary school and the university, and it would be absurd  to not use their intellect in a national development project."    Carles says that "people are treated equally if they have  opportunities and are capable. In Panama, education has been  offered to men and women and this is why both sexes are able to  compete in the private and public sectors. I think that  Panamanian women will have great opportunities in the future.  We have respected their status and will continue to give them  opportunities and responsibilities."    Journalist Miller points out that the citizens are  constantly complaining about the high rates of utilities, such  as electricity. He asks Vallarino whether he will promote a  decrease in rates.    Vallarino answers: "Definitely yes. Public utility  companies are monopolies, and as with all monopolies, they abuse  people. They abuse with poor services and high rates." He  calls for the regulation of public utilities as should be done  with any monopoly.    Perez Balladares says that "we must find ways to ensure  efficiency in the granting of public services." He calls for  the privatization of certain services.    Blades points out that this situation is "a product of  corruption and administrative inefficiency." He calls for a law  to force, for example, the telephone company, to invest a  certain amount of money to improve its services. Blades  proposes a law to allow public utility companies to be run with  the same flexibility that private companies are run.    Carles recalls that he has faced this problem for years. He  adds that public enterprises "must be supervised and controlled;  we must strive to prevent the continued growth of such  institutions when many of their activities can be privatized."  As examples, Carles lists cellular telephones, electricity, and  water processing plants.    Journalist Noli poses the last question of this debate to  Perez Balladares. She notes that the state payroll was reduced  by nearly 5,000 persons but salaries increased by $5.39 million  in 1993. Noli asks the candidate how he will effectively reduce  state bureaucracy without further worsening the unemployment  situation.    Perez Balladares points out that "we must clearly say that  the private sector is the one that can create jobs in the  future, not the state." He adds that public servants earning  low salaries were fired and new servants with higher salaries  were hired. This is, he says, not only unjust but absurd.  Perez Balladares points out that the public sector is generally  efficient. He notes that "I think that all candidates have been  excessively harsh in criticizing the public sector. I am very  proud of our public sector." Perez Balladares says public  employees could be better paid to ensure they do a better job.  He promises to promote approval of the civil service law  because public servants deserve respect.</p>

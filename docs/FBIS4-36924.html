			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani received Kenyan  Attorney General Amos Wako this morning. After giving Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani a written message from the Kenyan president,  the Kenyan attorney general described the outcome of his  meetings with our country's judicial officials as very fruitful.    Thanking Iran for its efforts in the fight against narcotics  and for observing human rights standards, he called for more  cooperation and consultation regarding the sharing of Iran's  invaluable experience with his country.    Thanking Iran for its foreign policy on establishing and  expanding ties with the Third World, especially African  countries, he described as very important and effective the role  of our country's officials in global developments. He said:  Since the victory of the Islamic revolution, as a big regional  and Islamic power, Iran has played an active role in defending  the rights of the innocent and the deprived throughout the  world. He called for the expansion of mutual ties in all fields.    According to a Central News Unit report, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed regret that monopolistic countries  pursue their hegemonistic policy in the world by resorting to  holy concepts. He said: The cruelty and harshness of those  powers are known throughout history, and there is strong  evidence of their disregard for human rights. They try to  accuse developing countries and countries seeking independence  of human rights violations.    He said: Using their capabilities, since they possess rich  natural and human resources, Third World countries could,  through cooperation--directly and without middlemen--help each  other in solving their problems.    Expressing concern about the bitter events in Africa,  particularly the events in Somalia, Rwanda, Angola, and  Mozambique, the president called for more effort by the  Organization of African Unity to end the crisis in that region.    He expressed the hope that relations between Iran and Kenya  would be expanded in all fields.</p>

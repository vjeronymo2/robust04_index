			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] San Salvador de Jujuy, 20 Apr (NA) -- Some 2,000  state workers participated today in a peaceful demonstration in  front of the provincial Government House demanding better  salaries.    The protest, the first one in the tenure of new Governor  Oscar Perassi, was organized by the State Unions Front, whose  main leader is Carlos "Perro" Santillan, the municipal workers'  leader.    The workers, who are demanding that the 80-peso increase  granted by the government be incorporated into their fringe  benefits package and not be considered just a pay increase, were  policed by a Border Guard unit because no policeman put in an  appearance.    The labor leaders who put themselves at the head of the  protesters indicated today that on 27 April they will carry out  a general strike in the province if the government does not give  a concrete answer to their demands.    Despite the fact that there were no incidents, the  demonstration was held in an atmosphere of tension because the  recent serious incidents in the beginning of the month still are  on people's minds.

Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee,  presided  over the conference and gave a speech. Wu Liji, deputy  secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the  region, made a speech on doing a good job in the region's  judicial and state security work in line with the region's  realities. Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the regional party  committee, relayed the guidelines of the national conference on  judicial and public security work.    Qian Fenyong, Geriletu, and Wuyunqimuge attended the  conference.    In his speech, Wang Qun pointed out: Development is our  purpose, reform is the motivation for development, and unity and  stability are the essential prerequisites for reform and  development. Regarding stability as an overriding task is  precisely to ensure development. Reform, development, and  stability are mutually conditional. The region's political,  cadre, and work foundations are good and are based on the good  tradition of national unity. The current overall situation is  also very good and are favorable to reform and development.  However, leaders at all levels should remain sober-minded and  should understand that some factors affecting social stability  also exist. Therefore, we should strengthen party leadership  and strengthen ideological education for cadres and the masses.  Leaders of party committees and governments at all levels  should all persist in the fundamental principle of taking a  two-handed approach and being tough with both hands," that is,  they should not only pay attention to economic construction, but  also to building spiritual civilization. We should unite the  ideas of the whole party and the whole society with the  guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should strengthen  unity in all fields and mobilize the initiative of all fields to  positively greet the critical year of 1994 and to create a new  situation in the socialist market economic system.    In his speech, Wu Liji pointed out: Persisting in the  fundamental principle of grasping both economic construction and  spiritual civilization to create long-term and stable social and  political environment for reform, opening up, and modernization  drive constitutes an important content of the theory of building  the socialism with Chinese characteristics. Next year is  critical to deepening reform. All localities should  conscientiously implement the "decision" of the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of  the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional  party committee. All localities should not only persist in  development without the slightest degree of deviation, increase  the dynamics of reform, and accelerate the pace of building the  socialist market economic system, but also steadfastly put  stability in an important position, implement the principle of  "regarding stability as an overriding task," truly regard  economic construction as the central task, and make reform,  opening up, economic development, and social stability promote  one another. Party and government leaders at all levels should  actually shoulder the duty of safeguarding political stability,  should conscientiously persist in the principle of taking a  two-handed approach and being tough with both hands" not only in  holding meetings and issuing documents but also in actions, and  should pay attention to the work of safeguarding social and  political stability in the course of paying attention to reform  and development.    He said: In our Inner Mongolia, national unity constitutes  the foundation of social stability. The unity of the party, the  unity among all levels of leading bodies in particular,  constitutes the guarantee for maintaining unity among all  nationalities. We should firmly and unremittingly educate the  cadres and the masses of all nationalities with the Marxist  viewpoint on nationalities and with the party's policies towards  nationalities. We should always hold high the banner of  developing the economy and promoting national unity. In  promoting the cause of national unity and progress, we should  correctly approach and handle the issue of nationalities in line  with state laws and pertinent policies.    He stressed: Under the new situation, the most fundamental  and effective way to make judicial, procuratorial, and state  security organs persist in the party's basic line and facilitate  economic construction, is to fully exploit the function of the  people's democratic dictatorship entrusted on these organs by  the state in order to create a good and stable social  environment for accelerating economic development and  establishing new systems. We should effectively exploit the  functions of state security organs, actually strengthen the  struggle against covered fronts, and frustrate subversion,  infiltration, and sabotage of the hostile forces outside the  territory. We should further organize cadres and the masses in  the region to study and propagate the "state security law" to  enhance their patriotic spirit and their sense of state  security. At the same time, we should continue to deal severe  blows to criminal cases, concentrate on investigating and  handling major and appalling economic cases, such as corruption  and embezzlement cases, punish serious criminal cases as  severely and promptly as possible, and actually overcome and  correct the phenomena of failing to enforce laws strictly and  failing to deal severe blows to crimes. We should strengthen  supervision over law enforcement of judicial, procuratorial, and  state security organs in order to successful build these organs  and successfully build the ranks of judicial, procuratorial, and  security workers.    He also set forth specific demands on further strengthening  leadership over judicial and state security work, on trying the  best to solve conspicuous problems and difficulties, and in  strengthening state security work.    A responsible person of the regional security department  relayed the guidelines of the national security work conference.  Attending the conference were the comrades who were attending  the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional  party committee, responsible persons of the regional judicial  and state security departments, and responsible comrades of  judicial and procuratorial, public security, and security  departments of various leagues and cities.</p>

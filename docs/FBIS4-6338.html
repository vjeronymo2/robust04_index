			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, April 19 (AFP) -- The Singapore  Government Tuesday denied US media reports that an American  teenager was tortured and forced to confess to acts of vandalism  for which he has been ordered caned by a Singapore court.    The Ministry of Home Affairs said that a probe by a special  police unit carried out in October last year found no evidence  to substantiate the claim that 18-year-old Michael Fay from  Dayton, Ohio, was abused during interrogation.    "The IIS [Internal Investigation Section] investigation  revealed no evidence of police abuse," a ministry spokesman  said, responding to queries from AFP. The IIS, or Internal  Investigation unit, is charged with probing public complaints  against the police.    The Home Ministry's denial came in the face of escalating  media attention on a US demand that Singapore cancel the court  order that Fay be given six strokes of a rattan cane, which  could leave him permanently scarred.    "Michael Fay was examined in hospital and also by doctors  who  had been examining him daily during his remand. No injury was  detected," the spokesman said.    The spokesman said that the probe was ordered after the US  embassy here lodged a verbal complaint that Fay and two other  American boys being similarly investigated for vandalism  suffered severe abuse.    The US Embassy was given a full account of the probe's  findings but "did not respond nor pursue the matter further,"  the spokesman said.    THE NEW YORK TIMES said Monday that Fay had insisted to  family and friends that he was forced to confess to  spray-painting cars during a police beating, claiming that he  was innocent.    Fay is serving a four-month jail term at Queenstown Prison  while lawyers prepare an appeal for clemency in a bid to get the  authorities to drop the painful, potentially skin-splitting  lashing.    The appeal is expected to reach Singapore President Ong Teng  Cheong on Wednesday.    The spokesman said that Fay's conviction was based on a  guilty plea he entered to charges of spray-painting two cars,  pelting the vehicles with eggs and keeping stolen property, not  on his confession statement.    "In short, the statement had no bearing on Michael Fay's  conviction," he said.    The spokesman said that allegations that Fay was being  singled out for punishment because the government wanted to send  a message to Singaporeans about "decadent Western ways" were  also unfounded.    He said that 14 others, among them two foreigners, were  caned  for vandalism between 1989 and last year.    Another American, a Hongkonger and two Malaysians arrested  along with Fay were also facing charges of vandalism.    "It is therefore absurd to say that Michael Fay is being  singled out, and then concoct some theory to support this  allegation," the spokesman said.    Fay has drawn extensive publicity since his conviction last  month, and Singapore has received appeals urging it to spare the  rod from President Bill Clinton, several US senators and human  rights groups like Amnesty International.    US newspapers have described caning as barbaric, and THE NEW  YORK TIMES has urged American multinationals operating here to  pressure Singapore to drop the caning.</p>

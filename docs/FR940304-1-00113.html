			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has considered these expenses in the analysis of direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating equipment. The increase in consumer expenses caused by a design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option includes not only the increase in retail price, but also any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation and maintenance expenses that result from incorporating that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design option into the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern Gas Association contended that more efficient direct heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment would have a severe economic impact on lower-income and elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers, and that low usage in Southern states should be evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 7,10). Minnegasco also commented on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of low usage by urging DOE to consider regional usage when performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the engineering analysis. (Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has lowered its usage assumption by using the modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burner operating hours contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned above for furnace test procedures. The proposed burner operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours for direct heating equipment has been revised downward to account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regional distribution of this product disproportionately to the southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> half of the Nation. The Department has no data with which to measure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards' impacts on elderly and lower-income consumers in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a standard level is economically justified; however, DOE will consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the financial effect that the standard has on such consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Advance Notice for this rulemaking, the Department described how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it performs sensitivity analyses to help it understand the effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forecasted impacts because of changes in the exogenous variables and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions. (55 FR 39633).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those sensitivities were developed at the national level, and no effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was made to link them with any specific population groups. With the exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the direct heating equipment analysis discussed above, the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis assumed that nationwide average appliance usage rates, energy prices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and efficiency applied to all consumers in all areas of the nation, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department recognized that there exist large variations in each of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors. The Department seeks additional information concerning the extent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which any proposed national efficiency standard is likely to affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifiable groups of consumers disproportionally and, especially how best to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider such impacts in the selection of efficiency standard levels. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is also seeking additional data to help it better assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate impacts on such groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Mobile Home Furnaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermittent ignition device design is not appropriate to mobile home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnaces. The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated there is almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no flow through the heat exchanger during the off-cycle. If the intermittent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignition device failed, a gas-air mixture could build up and possibly lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an explosion when the intermittent ignition device is activated. (Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department accepted Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment and did not consider an intermittent ignition device plus vent damper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an engineering design for mobile home furnaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed intermittent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignition devices and vent dampers be separately considered and that two-speed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or variable-speed blowers be evaluated. (American Council for an Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has accepted these approaches. The intermittent ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device with fan-forced combustion has been considered as one option, while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion box damper has been considered as a separate option. A combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> box damper has the same effect on efficiency as a vent damper for isolated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion-type systems. Mobile home furnaces are required to have isolated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion systems by the Housing and Urban Development code. Both two-stage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and continuously modulated burners were included in the final list of design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

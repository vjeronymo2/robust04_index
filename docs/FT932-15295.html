			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: FR Group shows 9% improvement to Pounds 23.3m - Healthy niches in aviation and defence markets FR GROUP yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 9 per cent at Pounds 23.3m for the year to December 31 as the company appeared to demonstrate there are some healthy niches within the depressed aviation and defence markets. Cutbacks in the aviation programmes of most aircraft makers, however, meant the company was continuing to rationalise that side of the business in the face of 'a significant downturn in demand' from the high levels of the late 1980s. Sales were also up 9 per cent at Pounds 182.8m while earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 21.48p. A proposed final dividend of 4.74p brings the total for the year to 7.2p, up 8 per cent. Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said that while the aerospace and defence industries were experiencing significant falls in demand there remained continuing demand for FR's products and services. On its military side, governments were going to spend an increasingly large slice of the smaller defence cake on products and services like FR's surveillance, high tech training capability and its air-to-air refueling systems. On the aviation side, Mr Page said FR was reacting to the flow of cutbacks in civilian aircraft programmes by the likes of McDonnell Douglas, Airbus and Boeing by closing some sites and developing an ability to supply integrated systems rather than components on their own. The group was cutting 170 jobs this year and last and was closing one factory and integrating the operations of two others. Substantially all the associated cost had been provided within the 1992 accounts. FR ended the year with net cash of Pounds 9.4m, up from Pounds 7.8m, in spite of an increased interest charge on un-hedged foreign exchange denominated debt. The company has also begun to develop non-military applications for the technology involved in air-to-air refueling. Mr Page said the company should this year announce a venture in which it would be able to apply its fluid handling and couplings technology and expertise in the petrochemical or water treatment industries. COMMENT Western countries are for some time going to spend considerable amounts on defence, notwithstanding the peace dividend they are all trying to cash. The trick for investors is to differentiate between those companies metaphorically making submarines and those supplying what the armed forces will continue to need. Judging by the 40 per cent increase in FR's share price since last October, the company has gone some way towards demonstrating it might be a defence contractor with one of the rosier futures. But FR cannot avoid the pain being felt in aviation, even if it has now put what should be a lucrative components business on a sounder footing. Profits forecast at Pounds 25m for this year, would give earnings of 23.2p, and a prospective p/e that might appear relatively cheap at 12 times. On balance this price level is, however, probably about right.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: SMOKING OUT HOLLINGS  </P> <P> All politicians say things they later regret.  </P> <P> Michael Dukakis said: "This campaign is not about ideology; it's about  competence."  </P> <P> George Bush said: "Forty-seven years ago to this very day (Sept. 7, 1988) we  were hit and hit hard at Pearl Harbor."  </P> <P> And Richard Nixon said: "I am not a crook."  </P> <P> Now we have Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), a man I have always liked. I briefly  covered his 1984 presidential campaign -- it lasted only briefly -- and he was  a charming guy, a guy I loved to listen to.  </P> <P> Not any more.  </P> <P> Last week in opposing a ban on smoking on U.S. airline flights, Hollings said:  "The Indians were smoking when we got here!"  </P> <P> And you thought the era of great debate was dead.  </P> <P> Congress banned smoking on domestic airline flights shorter than two hours on  April 23, 1988. This ban is due to expire April 23, 1990.  </P> <P> The Senate Appropriations Committee voted last week, however, to ban smoking on  all domestic flights, no matter how long they are.  </P> <P> The ban makes sense. Cigarette smoke causes lung cancer and other diseases. And  airplanes have lousy air circulation systems. As studies have shown -- and as  any nonsmoker can tell you -- smoke from the smoker's section of a plane is  circulated very quickly to the nonsmoking section.  </P> <P> The logical answer is to ban smoking on all flights.  </P> <P> This is not logical to Hollings, however. All politics is local, the old saying  goes, and Hollings comes from a tobacco-producing state.  </P> <P> So in the committee hearings he spoke vociferously against the ban. And  afterward, there was this fascinating scene, as reported by Alan Fram of the  Associated Press:  </P> <P> "Minutes after the Senate Appropriations Committee's decision last week to  expand the smoke ban aboard airliners, tobacco-state Sen. Ernest Hollings stood  in a Capitol corridor talking about the meeting.  </P> <P> "Interrupting the conversation, a bald, rotund man in a suit sauntered up from  behind the lawmaker and reached out to shake his hand.  </P> <P> " 'Thanks on behalf of R. J. Reynolds,' he told a smiling Hollings (D-S.C.),  who had just been on the losing side of two votes aimed at diluting the  prohibition. 'It was a good try, but it was stacked against us.' "  </P> <P> Not that the fight is over. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) won't rule out a  filibuster when the bill comes to the Senate floor and there is still the House  to contend with.  </P> <P> And, as the exchange between Hollings and the R. J. Reynolds lobbyist shows,  the tobacco producers know a thing or two about lawmaking. They know money  fuels the engine of democracy. According to Common Cause, the cigarette  industry gave members of Congress $261,000 in speaking fees last year, more  money than any other industry.  </P> <P> You can see why: The cigarette industry needs more than 1,000 new smokers each  day to replace those who die each day from smoking.  </P> <P> Even most smokers support a ban on airline smoking. A poll sponsored by the  American Assn. of Respiratory Care showed that 51.7% of smokers approve a ban  on smoking on airlines, and nearly 60% of smokers favor the current  short-flight ban.  </P> <P> But Hollings has a rejoinder: "The Indians were smoking when we got here!"  </P> <P> It is true. Smoking is an American tradition. The Indians were doing it when we  came here to steal their land. And I think they gave us tobacco as revenge.  </P></p>

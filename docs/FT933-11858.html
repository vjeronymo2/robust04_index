			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SPIRITS were lifted in stock index futures as interest rate cut hopes gained momentum ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council, writes Christine Buckley. Optimism made a reappearance after a prolonged absence from the market as dealers became more hopeful that Germany would be forced to reduce its interest rates to save the European exchange rate mechanism, so creating a climate more conducive to rate cuts in the UK. Any market relief at the parliamentary progress on Maastricht was tempered by concern over the Christchurch by-election. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index began at 2,839 and embarked on an upward course, reaching the day's peak in mid-morning trading at 2,860. Apart from interest rate optimism there was some feeling that the contract had suffered from over-selling in recent sessions and was due for a rally. That comeback floundered slightly in the afternoon session and September drifted towards a close of 2,858, with a modest volume of 6,444 contracts recorded. Turnover in traded options contracted from Friday's level, with 22,088 lots changing hands against 27,566. British Steel was the most heavily traded stock option at 1,630 lots, with much of that action coming from one purchase of October puts.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> MGM/UA Communications Co.: The Beverly Hills-based film and entertainment  company reported a third-quarter net loss of $7.1 million, compared to a net  loss of $8.3 million a year ago. Revenue totaled $267.8 million, up 53%. The  firm noted that although revenue was boosted by the worldwide box-office  performance of the films "Rain Man" and "A Fish Called Wanda," losses were  incurred due to a decrease in the number of feature films in production, higher  non-recurring corporate expenses (including those related to MGM/UA's merger  with Qintex Entertainment Inc.), and writedowns on recent motion picture  releases.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPION LOPEZ'S 69 TIES DANIEL FOR LEAD IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> Defending champion Nancy Lopez shot a bogey-free 69 to overcome a 3-stroke  deficit and tie Beth Daniel for the lead after three rounds of the Ladies  Professional Golf Assn. Oldsmobile tournament.  </P> <P> Lopez birdied the 17th hole with a 12-foot putt to pull even with Daniel, who  shot even-par 72 for a 54-hole total of 7-under-par 209 on the 6,333-yard  Stonebridge Golf and Country Club course.  </P> <P> A hole in one and 4 birdies helped Dottie Mochrie come from 6 strokes off the  pace to gain a brief share of the lead. But the second-year pro, looking for  her first tour victory, bogeyed No. 18 for a 67 to fall a shot behind Lopez and  Daniel.  </P> <P> Jane Geddes (69) and Jody Rosenthal (71) are next at 211. Lopez, with husband  Ray Knight standing in for her regular caddy, birdied the first hole to move  within 2 shots of Daniel. She also birdied No. 8 to take a share of the lead  Daniel built by shooting 69 and 68 in the first 2 rounds.  </P> <P> Mochrie, who earned $137,293 as a rookie last year, got her hole in one on the  11th hole with a 3-iron that bounced twice and rolled into the cup 169 yards  away.  </P></p>

John Osteen.  </P> <P> She suffered burns when she opened a package delivered to an office of the  independent charismatic Lakewood Church. She was hospitalized in good  condition. Police Sgt. J. C. Mosier described the device as "some sort of pipe  bomb." A spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said  it was doubtful that there was any link to recent bomb attacks that killed a  judge and a lawyer.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THE NEW, MATURE BALLESTEROS IS PUT TO TEST WHEN HE FOUR-PUTTS  GREEN  </P> <P> Augusta wind came up, so Seve Ballesteros decided to lay up short with his  second shot. No way would he go for this 15th green -- maybe even under normal  conditions. Not from atop this hill. Not on a 500-yard hole. Not with this pond  in his way, inviting him to come on in, take a dip, get his ball washed.  </P> <P> Maybe Gene Sarazen did double-eagle this damn thing by whacking a four-wood  across the water and holing it, but that was 54 years ago. Old news.  </P> <P> Safely in front of the pond, lying two, Ballesteros punched a nine-iron. In the  air it looked lovely, but on the ground it spun crazily. The ball squirted 25  feet from the pin.  </P> <P> Seve sighed.  </P> <P> OK, bad luck, but no big deal. This was only Friday, not Sunday. He would keep  that world-famous hot blood from spilling. None of those Hispanic histrionics  of his. After all, he was still three-under for the round, still playing  splendidly on a windy day in Georgia when hardly anybody in the Masters seemed  capable of breaking 70.  </P> <P> Only Nick Faldo was ahead of him on the leader board at this point. Lee Trevino  had momentarily faded. Ballesteros, the Masters champion of 1980 and 1983, the  British Open champion of last summer, could make this 25-footer for a birdie  and put himself right at the front of the hunt.  </P> <P> So, he putted.  </P> <P> And putted.  </P> <P> And putted.  </P> <P> And putted.  </P> <P> The first one refused to break, and stopped three feet wide of the cup. The  second one slid three feet past. The third missed by inches. A four-putt green.  A seven for Seve. The gallery parted for him with that same combination of fear  and respect traditionally reserved for Ballesteros, who on given days is likely  to plow right over somebody, leaving spike marks.  </P> <P> But the new Ballesteros, more mature, recently wed, dare we say mellow -- a  connection there? -- did his best to shrug the whole thing off.  </P> <P> "For some reason, the ball would not go into the hole -- two times," he said.  "I tell you, I try my best.  </P> <P> "I guess everybody has to pay duties at the Masters. I hope I pay mine on the  15th hole today."  </P> <P> No temper. No tantrum.  </P> <P> Not even one word?  </P> <P> "Well," Ballesteros had to admit, "I say: 'You son of a bitch.' "  </P> <P> Grinning.  </P> <P> "In Spanish. Hijo de puta."  </P> <P> Funny round all around for Ballesteros, who finished right where he began: one  under par for the tournament. He had a 68 in his sights until that 15th hole  swallowed him whole, but this was one of those days when everybody said bye-bye  to birdies, a day when Andy Bean and Nick Price and Hal Sutton and Gary Koch  were as close to 90 as they were to 70.  </P> <P> Yes, it was a day for laughing off four-putt greens.  </P> <P> "Maybe five, six years ago, could have been a disaster," Ballesteros said.  </P> <P> On the course that he calls his absolute favorite, in the country where he so  seldom plays, Ballesteros always aims to please. He wants to do well at  Augusta, and usually does. With a little luck, he says, he could have five  green jackets. Five championships in one decade. He placed second in 1985, left  his 1986 chances in the 15th-hole pond, and lost a 1987 playoff.  </P> <P> He likes it here, and it likes him. Of course, the locals did not exactly make  him feel at home at this year's pre-tournament banquets, serving up a variety  of exotic fare ranging from Scottish haegis to Southern chitlins. One needs  intestinal fortitude -- pun definitely intended -- to digest either dish.  </P> <P> Asked later what he thought of his meal, the Spaniard proved himself an  ambassador of diplomacy.  </P> <P> "Was free," he said.  </P> <P> Supper aside, rarely has Ballesteros had a more challenging day than Friday,  when the wayward wind made him step away from putts to regain his balance. On  two holes alone, the 15th and 17th, it took him seven putts to get down. Yet,  Ballesteros insisted he has never putted better. A tip from his brother Vicente  has him hunching with his eyes more directly over the ball.  </P> <P> So, putting problems?  </P> <P> "No, no, no, no," Ballesteros said. "What happened at 15 was an accident,  that's all.  </P> <P> "I am very happy with my game. When you play Augusta and don't miss one green  all day, that means something. I am sure there are not many players here today  who can say they did not miss one green."  </P> <P> Not many players could say they missed four putts on one green, either.  </P> <P> Ballesteros didn't go on or go off about it.  </P> <P> He just paid his duties and played through.  </P></p>

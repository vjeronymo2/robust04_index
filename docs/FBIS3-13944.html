			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al- Bid </F> by Amin Muhammad Amin in Aden; date not given]    [Text] Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has warned that  there is a plan being implemented against the Arab nation to  spread terrorism and extremism, undermine the Arab and Islamic  nation's aspirations, and isolate it from the world. In an  interview with AL-AHRAM, he said that this terrorist plan has  clear features and is targeted against Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt,  Sudan, Yemen, and other Arab states.    Al-Bid called for confronting this plan by discussing it on  a  pan-Arab level. He also called for confronting the backward  mentalities which want to impose their will on the Arab and  Islamic nation. He welcomed any Arab effort to help Yemen avoid  the specter of civil war, continue the democratic and peaceful  march of unity, and adhere to the pledge and accord document.    Al-Bid renewed his call to President Mubarak and to eldest  sister Egypt to play an influential role in the Yemeni arena,  given Egypt's relations with Yemen and its past sacrifices for  Yemen's sake. Egypt must play a pan-Arab role because there can  be no strong Arab nation without it. This is what he proposed  to President Mubarak during their recent contacts. He said:  Our recent meeting with him was greatly reassuring because it  showed that Egypt pays great attention to Yemen's problems.    Al-Bid said: We cannot allow Yemen to be a way station for  exporting terrorism to Egypt because this hurts us and runs  counter to our loyalty to Egypt. It is illogical for us to  offer terrorism instead of loyalty.    On the situation in Yemen, al-Bid said that despite events  he  is optimistic and will remain optimistic about realizing the  grand design of Yemeni unity, which was always an excuse for  fraternal warfare. In the 1972 and 1979 skirmishes, we used to  stop after battles and call for unity. In 1989, we called for a  united Yemeni state with a peaceful spirit, a democratic basis,  and with the logic of the modern age. However, a short time  after the march of unity began we faced some obstacles. The  most important thing was not to resort to fighting, especially  as violence is not the road to unity but a completely different  road. The road to unity is peaceful and democratic and is based  on convictions and goals. Unity must not be exposed to farces  and vituperations.    He explained that with time it turned out that the proper  conditions and the proper leadership to accommodate the  aspirations for unity and achieve a common vision and goal were  lacking in Yemen. Al-Bid said that the existence of  disagreements between the two leaderships in Yemeni, the fact  that this subject in all its political dimensions was not  submitted for discussion, and the fact that no attempt was made  to pinpoint the mistakes and negative manifestations placed the  unity plan in a predicament. This happened despite popular  consensus on unity and determination by the various sincere sons  of the Yemeni people to achieve it. Al-Bid said: During our  short experience, we have discovered that a reactionary  terrorist plan is being prepared against the Arab nation with a  view to returning us to the Middle Ages and perhaps excluding  us, as Arabs and Muslims, from the modern world. All the plots  and sedition being concocted against the Arab nation are also  directed at the Islamic nation. In Yemen we are suffering from  this terrorist plan opposing unity. We discovered in time that  there are several terrorist acts and assassinations aimed at  jeopardizing the march of unity. Therefore, it was necessary to  adopt a stand against terrorism and those who support it, to  protect the Arab nation's unity and solidarity, and to find a  logical formula to confront this plan.    The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  said that the Gulf crisis was another factor that affected the  unity of Yemen.    He wondered about the reasons for the success of some  fundamentalist calls and terrorist acts. He said that this  success is the result of the existence of basic unresolved  problems in some societies. These terrorist elements exploit  such situations. They also exploit the youths who are suffering  from a moral void and the absence of a pan-Arab concept to cling  to. He clarified that despite this, the fundamentalist formula  advocating terrorism under the slogan of the true Islamic  religion--which in fact has nothing to do with them--did not  gather momentum by itself. The Afghan experiment does not apply  in the Arab world.    He affirmed that the most important problem impeding a state  of unity is the fact that a number of leaders have not quite  assimilated this great pan-Arab development. This is why the  document concentrates on establishing a unified state and its  mechanism. Unfortunately, the search for a state that would  subsume such competition and development in the various fields  in these circumstances was unsuccessful during the transitional  period. The situation then deteriorated into assassinations,  explosions, and military confrontation instead of dialogue.    The Yemeni vice president then discussed the developments  that took place after signing the Pledge and Accord Document in  Aden [place as published]. He clarified that hours after the  signing ceremony, clashes erupted between the Yemeni Army units,  which was the first time this had happened on this scale and in  this way. For the first time since unity, orders were issued to  soldiers of the Yemeni Army to kill their own brothers in the  Army. Despite this, I issued orders not to respond with  violence in order to avoid the shedding of innocent Yemeni  blood, because the victor in this kind of battle is the loser  and such fighting would push Yemeni unity into a new dark  tunnel. Fighting is not our method, because it kills unity.    This is why we adhere to the Pledge and Accord Document. But  when we proposed the implementation of the first article in it,  the reaction by the other side was to fight harder to silence us.    Al-Bid confirmed the need to try those accused of the recent  assassinations in Yemen. He said: We all have to work hard to  implement the agreement, which enjoys national consensus from  the various groups of people.    At the same time, we need Arab efforts alongside the Yemeni  efforts.    Al-Bid said that unfortunately we have encountered  narrow-minded people who cannot think logically and try to take  over the institutions. They were not up to the standard of the  grand national project for unity.    Regarding the deadlock Yemeni unity is facing in  implementing  the Pledge and Accord Document as a result of the differences  between the YSP, which is demanding that the defendants be  arrested and the first article of the document be implemented,  and the People's Congress, which is insisting on uniting the  state institutions before anything else, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said  that some people had believed that signing the document would  end the crisis. This was wrong. The truth is that by signing  the document we recognized that there was a crisis and  established all the conditions for resolving it. The situation  requires that we move toward implementation under the  appropriate circumstances.    The document's seventh article calls for several security  and constitutional guarantees that should have been annexed to  the document. The prime minister, brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-  'Attas, made a lot of efforts over the past month to persuade  the brothers in Sanaa to offer or implement security guarantees,  but his efforts bore no fruit. In Amman we submitted a YSP  paper that explained our views on how to implement the  agreement, beginning with gradual normalization and following up  with clear steps and maintaining the earnest drive to implement  the accord.    The vice president explained: Wanted suspects were not  pursued, the country became involved in a crisis, and we had to  leave Sanaa. There were officials in the state's institutions  protecting well-known criminals. When we feel that some  officials are linked to killings, how can we feel safe? I want  to say this frankly: Some people are opposed to the document,  and for this reason I hesitated before signing it as I did not  want to be hasty. I was afraid that the signing of the document  would inflame the security situation; and this actually happened.    Regarding fears of a possible military confrontation, the  vice president said these fears are real and the Military  Committee must get help from the Arab countries.    He added: We support the expansion of Arab participation,  particularly by our Egyptian brothers, and cooperation in  bringing the views closer. We are seeking to avoid a civil war  and to pursue our democratic process. If we are dragged into a  conflict, this will bring destruction to Yemen. We call for the  supremacy of law and demand an investigation into the serious  events that have occurred to determine who was at fault.  Despite our efforts four brigades have been mobilized in  al-Bayda' in the north against one brigade in the south.    We draw comfort from the fact that the citizens are opposed  to infighting. Furthermore it is difficult for any one party to  control Yemen by way of killings and terrorism. Sit-ins and  civil disobedience have begun in various areas. This happened  after my call to the citizens to abide by the document. I  expect popular support for the democratic process to grow until  we are able to build one state.    Civil disobedience is a legitimate action, particularly  because some officials are exploiting the state to promote their  own personal interests. They are pointing the state in the  wrong direction. Hence our only possible course of action is to  go to the people and encourage democratic struggle. What is  important is not to let the guns speak.    Al-Bid affirmed that it was his awareness of the existence  of  sizable oil reserves in the south that made him hasten to  promote unity with the north. He declared that this resource  must belong to a united Yemen, adding: We did our utmost to  promote unity. Our reward was assassinations and threats.    Al-Bid concluded his remarks to AL-AHRAM by saying: Some  al-Jihad members are in Yemen. I regret that some people are  dealing with these terrorists and encouraging them. Details  will become known in due time. This cooperation with the  terrorists does not serve our cause or honor it. The main  terrorist camp is found in Sa'dah in the north. The terrorists  also began to assemble in the south but we are able to pursue  these terrorists pockets and expose them. However, we find it  totally unacceptable that the terrorists should enjoy the  support of some people in power and some Army units. When they  are left without official support, it will be easy to besiege  them and get rid of them.</p>

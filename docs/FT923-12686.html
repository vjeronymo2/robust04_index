			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Forecasts reworked as euphoria dies - The FT-A World index finished the quarter 10 points down in sterling terms, as global equity markets produced a negative 7.5 per cent return / Equities THE CONSERVATIVES' general election victory prompted an upsurge in London's stock market during much of the second quarter. But the market had come under hefty selling pressure towards the end of the period. The slide accompanied disappointing news about the UK economy and some dire news from some of the biggest companies. Notable among these was BP, where the chairman was ousted in a palace coup amid strong hints that the oil group's dividend would be cut for the first time since the first world war. ICI delivered a gloomy review of prospects, causing analysts to chop their profits estimates by up to 8 per cent. Over the three months, the FT-SE 100 share index rose 81.1, or 3.32 per cent (from 2,440.1 to 2,521.2). While the Tories' win confounded many pollsters and commentators, the stock market wasn't entirely taken by surprise. Having been in decline throughout March, the Footsie was languishing at just below 2,400 the day before the election. Polling day, however, brought a distinct change of heart, with dealers scrambling to close short positions built up just before the election when the opinion polls had pointed to a Labour win. The following day saw the Footsie soar 136 points, with turnover reaching the highest levels since the days before the crash of October 1987. The euphoria lasted exactly a month, with the index climbing to a peak of 2,737.8 on May 11. Equity market strategists spent that period reworking their end-of-year Footsie forecasts. Many foresaw 3,000 and beyond, reflecting hopes that emergence of the economy from the longest recession since the 1930s would be rapid. Events proved otherwise. Forecasts of gross domestic product for the current year were repeatedly chopped, with zero growth now expected; while the Danish rejection of the Maastricht accord created a mood of political uncertainty around the European Community. The succession of big gains by share prices coincided with a series of big placements and a Pounds 154m rights issue from BICC. In the days either side of Footsie's achieving its record, Lord Hanson orchestrated the placing of the controversial 2.82 per cent stake his company acquired in ICI, and BTR sold its 4.1 per cent holding in Pilkington. Other big post-election stake sales included Williams Holdings' placing of the 9.9 per cent stake in Racal. The Kuwait Investment Office sold its 10.5 per cent Midland Bank stake into the market. These placings, fears of more rights issues and the Government's gilts funding programme all served to starve the equity market of new money. And fund managers conserved their cash allocations, to accommodate a long list of new issues in coming months - to say nothing of the latest call on BT, which itself will account for almost Pounds 2bn. County NatWest recently estimated that, this month alone, Pounds 4.4bn will be absorbed by new issues. The eleventh-hour withdrawal of the GPA flotation and the postponed flotation of 3i were symptomatic of the general unease throughout the world's stock markets. The outlook for the third quarter is uncertain, with the behaviour of Wall Street and Tokyo likely to be crucial to London's performance.</p>

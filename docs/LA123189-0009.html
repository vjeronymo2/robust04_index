			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEVER GIVE UP  </P> <P> Regarding Joselito Paule's Dec. 17 letter, I must say that if the writer gives  up his dream of becoming a film maker based on one sentence by Steven  Spielberg, then he never believed in it to begin with.  </P> <P> Mr. Paule states that he "can't afford (the) risk" of trying to make films of  "personal satisfaction" in a competitive industry. But I ask Joselito Paule if  he can afford the risk of knowing that he sold out on his dream, that he didn't  even try. This is the stuff of mid-life crises.  </P> <P> I share the same dream, an undying passion to tell a good story, and no band of  cutthroat businessmen is going to keep me from it.  </P> <P> I am a steadfast idealist who believes that the best life a person can live is  the one closest to his or her dreams. And I believe Steven Spielberg would  agree with this.  </P> <P> PERRY J. KING  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

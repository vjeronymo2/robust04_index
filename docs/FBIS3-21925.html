During the  operations conducted by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] forces in  several of the Federation's states, 20 persons presumed guilty  of crimes against health were arrested.    Eight vehicles used to commit these crimes were seized,  including a speedboat employed to transport drugs. The  confiscated drugs would have put 100 million doses into  circulation. [passage omitted]    The PGR branch office in Sonora announced that, at the  highway checkpoint (Precos) set up on the outskirts of the town  of Hermosillo, Arturo Huerta Castaneda and Leopoldo Guzman  Ortega were arrested. They were carrying 22 kg and 500 grams of  cocaine on a Mexican Interstate Line passenger bus. The drugs  were bound for the border at Tijuana, Baja California. [passage  omitted]    As for marijuana, the largest seizure was made in the Sonora  municipality of Benjamin Hill, at a highway checkpoint, where  the PJF located a shipment of 5,595 kg of the grass. It had been  packed and concealed in freight car 104533, owned by Ferronales,  which was making the run between Guadalajara and Mexicali, Baja  California.    The PGR's state branch office revealed that, as a result of  an anonymous phone call reporting the transport of said  shipment, the cannabis contained in 897 packages was confiscated.    Furthermore, federal agents arrested Jose Francisco Arevalo  Alvarado, who was driving a Federal Public Service Torton truck  bearing the firm name "Autotransportes Valladolid," with  domicile in Morelia, Michoacan. The vehicle was stopped when its  load was noted to be overweight. The driver claimed to be  carrying earthenware to the town of Reynosa, Tamaulipas.  However, during the inspection 78 packages of cannabis were  found, with a gross weight of two tons and 727 grams. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Hydraulics prefer water to oil Danfoss, the Danish manufacturing group, has launched a programme of hydraulic components based on water rather than oil, the liquid normally used in hydraulics machinery, writes Hilary Barnes. Water reduces pollution and waste disposal problems, but can cause problems such as corrosion, which the company claims to have overcome. Danfoss, based at Nordborg, believes its range of water-based hydraulics, which includes a hydraulic motor, will be especially suitable where hygiene is paramount, such as the food and pharmaceutical industries.

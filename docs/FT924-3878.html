			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Uproar over Pakistan atom bomb report INDIA yesterday reacted strongly to a US television report that Pakisan built seven nuclear bombs and considered using them during a flare-up in border tensions in 1990. Even though Pakistan denied the allegations, the report based on CIA sources, caused uproar in the Indian parliament. The report could escalate tensions between the two countries which are already running high after two Pakistanis were shot dead in October by Indian security forces in the troubled Indian province of Punjab. India has said the two were agents aiding local terrorists - a charge Pakistan has denied. The report said Pakistan prepared seven atom bombs, each the size of the weapon which destroyed Hiroshima, and considered using them in the event of a conventional Indian attack.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> EMIGRE MOVES UP IN POLISH POLLS  </P> <P> A previously unknown millionaire emigre who has suddenly become a contender in  Poland's presidential race jumped ahead of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in  the polls today, trailing only Lech Walesa.  </P> <P> The latest survey by the government polling service showed 42-year-old  businessman Stanislaw Tyminski was backed by 20% of respondents.  </P> <P> Walesa, the Solidarity chairman, was favored by 27%, Mazowiecki by 17%, and the  remaining three candidates shared a total of 12%. Twenty-four percent were  undecided or did not plan to vote.  </P> <P> If no candidate wins more than 50% in Sunday's election, the top two  vote-getters will compete in a Dec. 9 runoff.  </P> <P> A pro-Mazowiecki newspaper lamented Tyminski's meteoric rise in a front-page  commentary today: "Poland used to be the conscience of Europe, and now we have  a chance to become the laughingstock of the world."  </P></p>

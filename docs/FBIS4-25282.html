			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank  approved a loan of 380 million U.S. dollars here today to  support the national highway project in China.    The loan, the bank said, will be used to build the 340  kilometer superhighway between Shijiazhuang and Xinxiang in  central China, which is part of the divided, four-lane  Beijing-Shenzhen expressway.    The part of highway supported by the bank, according to  senior bank transport specialist Hatim Hajj, is one of the most  heavily traveled corridors in China.    Highway traffic in China grew 14.1 percent between 1982 and  1992. China is now planning to construct a 25,000 kilometer  national highway system equivalent to the U.S. interstate  system, the bank said.    Bank lending to the highway sector in China since 1981  totals  over one billion dollars.</p>

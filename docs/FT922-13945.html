			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Questionable wisdom of holding trade in services to ransom Sir, Our friends at the US Coalition of Services Industries have again raised their concerns about free riders in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Services (Gatts) negotiations: Margaret Wigglesworth's letter, appearing coincidentally on April 1, may be primarily intended to tease us, but perhaps it is wise to take it at face value. We fully expect the CSI's continuing efforts, alongside our own, for market access commitments. This is certainly crucial. But to leave the argument as Margaret Wigglesworth does risks stranding us all in the era of bilateral reciprocity instead of seizing this historic chance to conclude a pact on services trade principles and rules among the major trading nations. There are already nearly 50 offers on the table, accounting for about 95 per cent of world trade in services; thus a critical mass appears assured. Naturally at this stage we are not looking at the bottom lines, but the OECD group and a number of notable others promise to be comprehensive and very acceptable. Thus the US, as the world's largest economy, representing a quarter of world GNP, presumably has in its sights half a dozen worst offenders - most of these unable to take advantage of the US and EC open markets. For this target, is it wise to be holding to ransom, through the exhaustive US list of threatened most favoured nations exemptions, the progress of the past five years' negotiations? Under the proposed multilateral trade organisation, of which Gatts will form part, there will be two yearly chances to press for progressive liberalisations from member countries which lag unfairly in their obligations. But should the Uruguay Round fail, future governments and new officials will be condemned, like Sisyphus, to roll another Round back up the hill, following much loss of time and wealth foregone. If we focus too closely on short-term gains we may live to regret not having taken a longer-term, wider view.

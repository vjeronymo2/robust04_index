			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Dawson Intl restructures for growth DAWSON International, the UK's fourth biggest textiles company, is restructuring its businesses to prepare for further launches of its US-made goods into European and Japanese markets. In a radical change for the group, primarily known for its Pringle and Ballantyne knitwear brands, a structure based on geographical division between the US and elsewhere is being replaced by exploitation of its brands. 'This will allow us to learn from best practice around the company. Before, we were like little boxes,' said Mr Ronald Miller, executive chairman. The moves are accompanied by a board reshuffle that reduces the number of executive directors from six to three. Mr Nick Kuenssberg, who joined the company from Coats Viyella in September 1991, moves from chief executive UK to run the Premier Brands unit, covering yarns, fabrics and the woollen brands. Mr Philip Kemp, formerly chief executive US, will run consumer products, mostly sports clothing. Ms Ann Burdus, director, communications and marketing, Olympia and York Canary Wharf, joins as a non-executive director. Dawson's products have historically divided neatly by brand. US-made goods have been sold almost entirely domestically. Many are sports clothes often using cotton or polyester fabrics and are a far cry from Dawson's expensive UK-manufactured woollens and cashmeres.</p>

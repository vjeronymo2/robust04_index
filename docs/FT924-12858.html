			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Moves to protect futures may prevent a repeat of the past FIVE years ago today, on Black Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 508 points as the US stock markets flirted with a complete meltdown. In an eerie reprise of that day, two weeks ago the Dow fell 104 points in the first two hours of trading of a Monday morning. The decline was so rapid some traders on Wall Street began to talk about a reprise of 1987. But this time, the markets pulled back from the brink, and the Dow finished the day 22 points lower. After the dust had settled, a good deal of the credit for halting the slide was given to 'circuit breakers' that were introduced to limit volatile prices swings after the 1987 crash. An examination of that day's trading patterns, however, revealed that the New York Stock Exchange's main circuit breaker - which curbs computerised programme trading by limiting use of the NYSE's automated order execution system whenever the Dow falls by more than 50 points - failed to stem the decline. The Dow crashed through the 50-point loss mark almost without pausing. What saved the day were the circuit breakers protecting the futures markets in Chicago. Although the first of Chicago's breakers - the rule that stops futures prices from trading lower for 30 minutes after the key S&amp;P 500 stock index contract has fallen more than 12-points - did not hold, traders proved unwilling to push prices so low that they triggered the next breaker, which comes into operation when the S&amp;P contract drops 20 points. That morning, futures prices began to recover when the S&amp;P contract was down 19.9 points, a hair's breadth away from setting off the second circuit breaker. Once futures rallied, the cash markets in New York followed suit, and the Dow began a slow ascent from its unnerving 104-point loss. The NYSE's backstop circuit breakers - which halt trading for one hour after a 250-point drop and for another two hours after a 400-point drop - were never needed. Although circuit breakers sometimes do their job, they do not offer complete insurance against a repeat of October 19, 1987. Non-computerised selling does not stop when the Dow falls 50 points, and there is nothing to prevent the market from falling further once the one- and two-hour halts are over. As Mr Laszlo Birinyi, one of Wall Street's best-known market analysts, says of circuit breakers: 'All they do is slow the selling, not stop it. It's like telling a drunk driver that he cannot use third gear any more. So he just uses first and second gear, which makes him no less dangerous.' Moreover, the measures introduced since 1987 have done nothing about the potentially harmful link between the cash and futures markets. The latter has long had the potential to inflict great damage on the equities market. The 104-point sell-off two weeks ago, which was sparked by 'extraordinary' selling of futures in Chicago, proved how much damage futures prices can do. One answer to the problem of having two separate, equally-volatile markets trading securities which by design are inextricably linked, is to create a single regulator. Proponents of such a solution have called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to be given the responsibility for setting rules in both the cash and the futures markets. But political turf battles between regulators in Washington DC have put paid to moves to create a single authority. Fortunately, the introduction of circuit breakers was not the only thing about the market that changed after 1987. Some of the trading strategies and techniques that created so many problems five years ago, such as computerised programme trading, index arbitrage and portfolio insurance, are much less influential today. Programme trading still goes on, but it is not the force it once was. NYSE figures show that programme trades currently account for between 7 and 8 per cent of Big Board daily volume, compared with between 10 per cent and 12 per cent a few years ago. Portfolio insurance, a strategy designed to hedge portfolios against big market declines that was widely blamed for much of the 1987 crash, is no longer widely used. And index arbitrage, another bugbear five years ago, is now practiced by many fewer trading firms than before, primarily because it is less profitable. Merrill Lynch, for example, abandoned the strategy in 1989.</p>

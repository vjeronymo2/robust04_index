			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Jackson back in the black Shares of Jackson Group, the Suffolk-based contractor, rose 11p to 66p yesterday on news of a swing from restated losses of Pounds 1.21m to profits of Pounds 924,000 pre-tax for 1993. Turnover improved from Pounds 58.5m to Pounds 61.5m. Earnings worked through at 2.6p (losses 4.7p) and a proposed final dividend of 1.3p lifts the total from 1.5p to 1.8p. Interest charge was Pounds 494,000 (Pounds 1.1m) while tax took Pounds 354,000 (Pounds 194,000 credit). Year end gearing stood at 36 per cent (78 per cent). Mr Frank Jackson, chairman, said the group's expectations of further business improvement in 1994 were 'not dependent on a general economic recovery but would . . . be enhanced should a lasting upturn materialise'.</p>

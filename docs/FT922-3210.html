			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Threat to Bond Corp reconstruction AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (Acil) yesterday withdrew from the management committee overseeing the financial reconstruction of Bond Corporation Holdings, formerly run by Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt entrepreneur. The withdrawal, announced in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, could cause the collapse of the reconstruction, and force Bond Corp to put its few remaining assets into liquidation. It follows an earlier decision by Acil to stop working capital payments of up to ADollars 1m a month, provided for under a scheme of arrangement worked out last year between Bond Corp and its creditors. However, officials said Bond Corp might be capable of financing its scaled-down operations from other sources, allowing it to continue the reconstruction without the co-operation of Acil. Acil, formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources, is Bond Corp's largest secured creditor. It would emerge with about 11 per cent of the group's capital under a scheme of arrangement worked out last year. Acil is believed to be in dispute with Bond Corp management over the group's use of its working capital payments, and the repayment of Bond Corp's debt to Acil of about ADollars 168m (USDollars 128.20m). Most of Bond Corp's assets have been sold to pay debts. The group retains small shareholdings in BSkyB, the UK satellite television operator, and G. Heilemann, the US brewery. It also owns land in Australia. Separately, Acil announced the cancellation of a proposed ADollars 220m flotation of the Bass Strait oil royalties owned by Weeks Petroleum, a wholly-owned subsidiary company. Mr Colin Henson, executive director, said the acquisition of Acil by Rossington Holdings, a bidding vehicle controlled by Sir Ron Brierley, had 'changed the assumptions on which the float was to proceed'. Rossington, jointly-owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand and GPG, Sir Ron's quoted UK company, owns 85 per cent of Acil following a protracted takeover battle. Rossington made no secret of its opposition to the float of Weeks' royalties, which it claimed were being disposed of too cheaply. At one stage, Rossington took court action to delay the despatch of the offer documents. Mr Bond, who was jailed for two and a half years last month for breaches of company law, is expected to remain in Royal Perth Hospital for several days for tests to determine the cause of chest pains. His condition was said to be stable. The state's supreme court is expected to rule today on an application for bail pending an appeal against conviction and sentence. In Sydney, the federal court granted an order to Mr Robert Ramsay, trustee of Mr Bond's bankrupt estate, freezing the assets of Mr Bond's ADollars 2.7m pension fund. The order restrains the trustees of the fund from dealing with the assets other than in an administrative way until the court decides who is entitled to them. Mr Ramsay claims the assets belong to Mr Bond's creditors.</p>

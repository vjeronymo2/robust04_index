			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PLANNERS URGING PIERSIDE CUTBACK  </P> <P> City planners are urging the Planning Commission to scale back a portion of the  controversial Pierside Village proposal, which commissioners are scheduled to  consider at a special meeting tonight after a series of delays.  </P> <P> The planning staff is recommending that the commission eliminate 6,250 square  feet of shops included in the developer's proposed restaurant complex.  </P> <P> Jonathan Chodos, builder of the downtown redevelopment project, says the retail  space is necessary to make the complex financially viable.  </P> <P> But in a staff report, city planning officials maintain that the shops are "not  necessary to serve the beach-going public."  </P> <P> The City Council has tentatively scheduled a Nov. 5 meeting to consider giving  final approval to the project, which has sharply divided council members and  planning commissioners.  </P> <P> Pierside Village is a proposed complex of as many as five restaurants to be  built on bluffs next to the Municipal Pier at Main Street and Pacific Coast  Highway. The land is now paved for street-level beach parking.  </P> <P> Critics argue that the project would block ocean views and ruin the beach's  natural atmosphere, while supporters contend that it would attract more  visitors who, because of the project's plazas and promenades, would also have a  chance to see the ocean.  </P> <P> In addition to the retail-space issue, commissioners said they have concerns  about other details of the project, including the adequacy of parking  facilities and a potential state Lands Commission lawsuit to bar the  development.  </P> <P> However, commissioners interviewed Monday said they believe the proposal will  be approved, although slightly modified.  </P> <P> Project critics have charged that Chodos and council proponents have pressured  commissioners to quickly approve the proposal so that the council could vote on  it before the Nov. 6 election. Voters will elect at least three new council  members and decide whether to approve two ballot measures, including a  limited-growth initiative that would likely block Pierside Village if it has  not yet been approved.  </P> <P> "If anything, if I were the developer, I'd say this has been the biggest stall  I've seen in years," said Commissioner Ken Bourguignon, referring to the  commission's repeated postponements of its Pierside Village decision.

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Asbestos lawsuits against CSR dropped CSR, the building products and sugar group, says it has been dismissed from a number of asbestos-related liability suits in Louisiana. This follows acceptance by the plaintiffs' lawyers that there was no evidence that products containing asbestos supplied by CSR were sold to the shipyard where the plaintiffs worked. CSR remains a defendant in a number of other asbestos-related cases in the US, notably in Mississippi.</p>

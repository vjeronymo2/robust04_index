			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" Newscast] </F>   [Text] As for foreign relations, the Venezuelan Government  today decided to withdraw Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Burelli's candidacy for OAS secretary general.    [Being Burelli recording] As unusual practices developed  during the elections, the OAS's spirit of equality and democracy  was exceeded. The OAS has always maintained the alternation or  rotation principle, by which a country, regardless of how  honorable its aspirations are, should not occupy the OAS post if  that country has already occupied it in the past. Such an  attitude would be detrimental to those nations that have never  occupied it.    Of course, this attitude does not mean that the merits of  the  other candidates for this post should not be recognized. On  those grounds, to continue serving the hemispheric cause with  dignity, which is definitely important, the national government  makes public the withdrawal of its candidacy for OAS secretary  general, because there are no concrete objections to the  autonomy of the elections.

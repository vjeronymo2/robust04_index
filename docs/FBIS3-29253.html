			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- The compromise between  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is  just enough to ride out the immediate crisis with both sides  purposefully skirting the key questions.    Seoul officials unanimously welcomed North Korea's decision  to reallow IAEA inspections but agreed it marks only a  beginning, with even tougher negotiations than before probably  still ahead.    It's progress since the IAEA can at least resume safegaurds  activities in North Korea and reload batteries and film in  inspection cameras that stopped functioning months ago.    The chief aim is to check whether nuclear materials at North  Korea's seven declared facilities have been diverted for  non-peaceful purposes since the last full-scale inspection in  February last year.    Just verifying that there have been no covert nuclear  activities in North Korea will significantly ease international  concern for the present.    North Korea and the United States are now closer to holding  the next round of high-level talks, an event that should defuse  the threat of war and give peace a chance. But the situation  has only returned to that of before last March 12, when North  Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-  proliferation Treaty (NPT).    In fact, the situation is in deeper limbo since North Korea  and the IAEA intentionally haven't settled whether Pyongyang has  fully returned to the NPT.    The wording of the North Korea-IAEA agreement leaves this  issue in a vague state. North Korea claims it isn't party to  the NPT and thus not obligated to permit routine IAEA  inspections. Its decision to accept IAEA checks is purely  voluntary, it maintains.    The agency insists otherwise, asserting that inspections are  part of NPT obligations.    The compromise was not reached to settle this dispute. The  IAEA is simply going into North Korea to reload the inspection  cameras and to check on possible nuclear materials diversion.    Under the compromise, the IAEA got the scope of inspection  it  demanded. North Korea, in return, saved face by not admitting  to having NPT obligations.    While the agreement on inspection breaks the present  impasse,  North Korea can always refuse further inspections because it  never admitted to the obligations.    Once talks get underway for full-scale inspections, North  Korea and the agency will have to tackle this dispute once again.    It has been Seoul and Washington's policy to take one step  at  a time. The immediate goal was to re-enter North Korea to find  out if there is cause for concern about its suspected covert  nuclear weapons program. The North Korea-IAEA agreement assures  just that. But officials here see higher mountains to climb --  special inspections of North Korea's undeclared sites and  inter-Korean talks that must reopen before the United States  will hold high-level contacts with North Korea, for starters.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf fate lies with CIBC BANKERS yesterday accused Canada's second biggest bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, of threatening to put O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings, developer of Europe's biggest new office development, into administration under UK insolvency legislation. O&amp;Y Canary Wharf is a subsidiary of Olympia &amp; York Developments, which is today meeting its 15 biggest bank creditors to discuss its proposal to alleviate its difficulties by restructuring Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of debt. Today's meeting will discuss the prospects for the contributors to a Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to an O&amp;Y subsidiary, Olympia &amp; York Resources Credit Corporation. A banker said yesterday that contributors to this loan could lose a third of their money. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is understood to have lent Dollars 750m of the Dollars 2.5bn. Meanwhile there have been separate meetings of the 11 providers of bank finance for the Canary Wharf project in east London. At a meeting on Tuesday, 10 of the 11 lenders indicated they would be prepared to support a plan to provide Canary Wharf with Pounds 30m to meet its needs for the coming month, but bankers said CIBC refused to provide any new money. The banks will only provide the Pounds 30m if all 11 contribute. Without the Pounds 30m, O&amp;Y Canary Wharf would go into administration. Bankers said CIBC was threatening to 'pull the rug' on Canary Wharf. The banks have until tonight to say whether they will provide the Pounds 30m, because Canary Wharf runs out of cash at the end of the week. CIBC is said to have told other banks that it was pessimistic about the long-term outlook for Canary Wharf and believed it would be wrong to inject any new money into the project. Bankers say CIBC's stance is surprising, as it is the biggest lender to O&amp;Y's worldwide oper-ations, with about Dollars 1bn of loans outstanding, and it has the most to lose if O&amp;Y's subsidiaries file for bankruptcy protection. Loans to Canary Wharf total about Pounds 1bn. However, these loans are guaranteed by the parent company in Canada. If Canary Wharf lenders face losses, they can demand reparations from the parent - with potentially damaging consequences for the rest of O&amp;Y.</p>

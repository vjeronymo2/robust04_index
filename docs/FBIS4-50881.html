			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chu Tzu-ju (2575 1311 5423): "Lei Mingqiu Denies He </F> Will Become First Commander of PLA Troops Stationed in Hong  Kong"]    [Text] With the approach of 1997, the footsteps of the  People's Liberation Army [PLA] to be stationed in Hong Kong also  have come closer! More contact can promote understanding, and  deepened understanding can bridge distances and reduce  misunderstandings.    On 30 April, the leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region --  including Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao; Deputy Commanders Wang  Shen, Zhou Yushu, and Tao Bojun; Deputy Political Commissars Gao  Tianzheng and Liu Xinzeng; Political Department Director Lei  Mingqiu; Chief of Staff Gong Gucheng; and Logistics Department  Director Chen Tianlin -- gathered together to welcome guests  from Hong Kong.    Deputies to the National People's Congress and members of  the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong region, members of  the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Economic Region [SAR], and Hong Kong Affairs Advisers -- more  than 100 people in all -- made a special trip to Guangzhou to  visit the troops stationed in Guangzhou. This reportedly was  the first time since the founding of the People's Republic that  so many Hong Kong residents had visited PLA troops in an  organized manner.    The Central Military Commission has begun forming the troops  to be stationed in Hong Kong, and the specific work reportedly  is handled by the Guangzhou Military Region.    It is rumored overseas that the first commander of the PLA  troops stationed in Hong Kong will be Major General Lei Mingqiu  (1942-), director of the Political Department of the Guangzhou  Military Region. However, in a conversation on 30 April with Li  Kuo-chiang, chief editor of this journal, Lei officially refuted  the rumor, saying that there was absolutely no such possibility  because another one would take up the post.    The Guangzhou Military Region administers a land area  covering 864,000 square km, a sea area covering 2,100,000 square  km, a population of 220 million, over 3,000 islands, and 678 km  of land borders (principally with Vietnam). It is linked with  the Hong Kong and Macao area in the southeast, stretching over  the Zengmu Ansha on the Nansha Islands in the south and  bordering on the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and  Indonesia. The Nanhai Fleet, one of China's three major fleets,  is also under the command of the Guangzhou Military Region. It  guards the southern gate of China, helps the local authorities  stabilize the situation, and is responsible for disaster-relief  work.    According to Tao Bojun, deputy commander of the Guangzhou  Military Region, Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang  Zemin recently issued a 10-point requirement, including: The  Army must obey central orders absolutely; the party should  command the Army; and the Army should unswervingly carry out the  central line, overcome the erroneous tendency toward the  mountain-stronghold mentality and factionalism, and obey orders  in all their actions without slackening efforts. The Army  should seek truth from facts, promote democracy, and conduct  political education. Army organs should manage cadres well. It  is necessary to strengthen work among company units, step up  technical training, improve skills, select talented persons who  have both ability and political integrity, and take the lead in  carrying forward a fine work style.    Tao said: Having fought successively in different parts  north and south of the Chang Jiang, the troops under the  Guangzhou Military Region have brought forth heroes in large  numbers. They took part in the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the  Long March, the battle of Pingxingguan, the 100-Regiment  Offensive, the Liaoxi-Shenyang, Peiping-Tianjin, and Huaihai  campaigns, the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the  battle of Xisha, and the war of self-defense against Vietnam.  Among these troops, there are the Red First Company, which  joined in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927, the Heroic  Company Crossing the Dadu He during the Long March, the Five  Fighters of the Langya Shan during the war of resistance against  Japanese aggression, the Heroic Regiment of Tashan during the  Liaoxi-Shenyang campaign, the Heroic Company of Huangcaoling  during the Korean war, and the heroic fighters of the Faka Shan  who gave a good account of themselves in defending the territory  of the motherland at the Sino-Vietnamese border in 1979.    Tao quoted Deng Xiaoping's remark, saying: "Deng Xiaoping  said the stationing of Chinese troops in Hong Kong is a  reflection of sovereignty and is needed to ensure Hong Kong's  future stability and prosperity. He said: "Aside from  stationing troops in Hong Kong, what else can reflect the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong?" "The stationing of  troops in Hong Kong has another function, namely, to prevent  turmoil. If those who want to stir up turmoil know that there  are Chinese troops in Hong Kong, they will have to think twice!  Even if there should be turmoil, it also can be solved  promptly."    Tao quoted Article 14 of the Basic Law as saying: "The  central people's government is to be responsible for the defense  of the Hong Kong SAR. Military forces stationed in the Hong  Kong SAR for defense are not to interfere in the local affairs  of the region. When necessary, the government of the Hong Kong  SAR may ask the central people's government for assistance from  the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster  relief. In addition to abiding by national laws, members of the  garrison are to abide by the laws of the Hong Kong SAR."    Major General Tao disclosed: The Central Military Commission  has started making preparations for the garrison. The troops to  be stationed in Hong Kong are being formed. The central  authorities have set very high criteria and very strict demands  for the selection of the troops. They must be powerful, heroic,  and civilized.    Tao compared the Red First Company, a crack PLA unit with a  glorious history, with the future garrison in the Hong Kong SAR,  saying that the garrison will have more distinguished features  than the Red First Company.    Another knowledgeable general confirmed to this journal that  the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong are being formed. The  officers are being selected and trained, but the soldiers have  not been selected yet. As officers and men are transferred once  every three years, the training of soldiers to be stationed in  Hong Kong will be conducted later because there are still three  years to go before 1997. The venue will be in the Guangzhou  Military Region. In addition to the ground forces, the Navy  also will be an important component.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Whitbread rises 32% despite lower beer sales: Restaurants and leisure help brewing UK group towards a 'respectable outcome' A strong performance by its pub food, restaurant and leisure operations helped Whitbread offset lower beer sales and a reduced contribution from its leased estate to report higher full-year profits yesterday. The brewing, retailing and leisure group reported a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 234m in the year to February 26 from Pounds 177m, a figure depressed by non-operating losses. Turnover from continuing operations edged ahead to Pounds 2.36bn (Pounds 2.32bn). Sir Michael Angus, chairman, described the results as 'a respectable outcome' against the backdrop of a subdued economy and fierce competition. Profit before tax and non-operating items increased 5.8 per cent to Pounds 231.7m despite an additional Pounds 15m charge for pensions. Interest costs fell from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 25.1m. Earnings per share improved to 34.88p (22.73p) and a final dividend of 13.8p makes a total of 18.8p (17.75p). The shares slipped 9p to 563p. Whitbread Inns, the group's managed pubs, raised profits 6 per cent to Pounds 91.7m, on turnover 5.7 per cent higher at Pounds 538.3m. Average food sales per pub increased by 15 per cent, drinks were up 5 per cent and machine income rose by 7 per cent. The growth in food sales reflected good performances from the 200 Brewers Fayre outlets and the cask ale houses. Profits from Pub Partnerships, the leased estate, declined 13 per cent to Pounds 49.7m, from Pounds 57.1m, as the average number of pubs fell by about 400, with the year-end total amounting to 3,100. The restaurants and leisure division increased profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 55m (Pounds 48.9m) on turnover of Pounds 1.09bn. Wider margins and lower overheads helped Beefeater raise its profits 19 per cent, while Pizza Hut increased market share with a 7 per cent growth in turnover. However, Thresher's profits declined, reflecting tough competition and the impact of cross-channel shopping. Hotel operations benefited from a substantial improvement at the renamed Country Club Hotels Group. During the year 27 Lansbury hotels were sold and 15 budget Travel Inns opened. Profits from beer and other drinks fell by 5 per cent from Pounds 70.4m to Pounds 66.9m. Overall Whitbread's beer volumes declined 4 per cent against a beer market drop of 2.5 per cent. Boddingtons was the best performer with total volume up 16 per cent and draftflow cans up more than 25 per cent making it the market leader in take-home trade. Meanwhile Stella Artois further consolidated its leadership of the premium lager sector. Lex, Page 20</p>

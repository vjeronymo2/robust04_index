			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (8): Warming the image of the country - Trade and Investment AFTER YEARS of neglect and indifference Finland is promoting itself on international markets. Several organisations have been established recently to sell the image of the country abroad to potential buyers of Finnish products or investors. An 'Exclusively Finland' campaign was launched earlier this year in Britain to try to dispel popular ignorance about the country among the UK business community. A survey of executives carried out for the campaign last December found that as many as 59 per cent of respondents knew of no manufactured Finnish products at all while 79 per cent were unable to identify Finland's main industries and manufacturers. Yet Finland exports over Pounds 2.5bn worth of goods to the UK a year. As Exclusively Finland concluded, the findings suggest that most executives thought that Finland was 'cold and bleak, with an economy based almost entirely on small traditional cottage industries and forestry'. The myth of Finland as a Soviet satellite may have long been exposed but it could need a big promotional effort to alter misconceptions about the country's economy. As the campaign admitted: 'In contrast to Sweden, very little is known about Finland, except for its cold climate, low population and forestry.' It intends to spend just under Pounds 2m over the next two years to try to change the false picture business has of the country. In co-ordination with the Finnish Foreign Trade Association in Helsinki and Finland Trade Centre in London, the campaign wants in particular to 'raise the profile of Finnish companies and brands operating in the UK, raise the profile of Finnish industry and raise the profile of Finland itself'. Eight Finnish companies have joined the campaign across the wide spectrum of the country's export products. These are Abloy Locks, the security firm which is part of the Metra group, Finlandia Vodka owned by Alko, the state-owned alcohol company, Finlux, which makes audio-visual equipment, Finnboard, the packaging company, Fiskars, the oldest industrial corporation in Finland that makes high quality scissors, kitchen utensils and garden tools and acquired in 1988 the Wilkinson Sword group of the UK; Kulta Beer brewed by the Hartwall Beverages company, Panda Liqorice and Saab Valmet, the top of the range Saab 9000 CS car maker. At the same time there is an increasing interest in Finland in encouraging inward investment. In August the government introduced legislation expected to come into force from the beginning of 1993 which will lift most of the controls and rules that have inhibited foreign companies from moving production capacity and offices to Finland in the past. The new laws will end the current division between restricted and free shares by making all shares free and therefore acquirable by foreigners without limitation. Finnish companies do not have to amend their own articles of association for this change to come into effect. The reform will also enable the transfer of a Finnish company into foreign ownership without being subject to restriction. However, the transfer of the largest 100 Finnish companies with over 1,000 workers on their payroll and a turnover or year end assets totalling FM1bn or more into foreign hands will be monitored until 1996. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will have to approve if the buyer wants to acquire ownership or control of at least a third of the voting rights in the company. The state will continue to have the right to intervene if it believes the acquisition by a foreign company of a large Finnish concern jeopardises the national interest. But the government has made it clear it would use its blocking powers against an individual deal 'only in very extreme circumstances'. After 1996 the monitoring system will end except for companies that manufacture defence equipment. It is not just industrial companies that are to be covered by the new law. Banks and insurance companies will also be included. Moreover, real estate acquisition by non-residents of Finland will no longer be subject to government permission though a permit will still be needed where the transfer 'is intended for leisure-time dwelling or for recreational purposes'. Earlier in the year a new body called Invest in Finland was established at the Finnish Foreign Trade Association with the specific aim of supplying potential investors with detailed information on the country's business environment. Mr Erkki Karmila is the first head of the new bureau. He believes Finland's geographical position can be of real advantage in attracting overseas investors as a 'superb gateway' to Russia and the newly independent Baltic states with rapidly improving road and rail networks and telecommunication links 'We are going through our most fundamental change since independence on our way into an integrated western Europe,' explains Mr Karmila. 'This is a very good time for foreigners to invest here with the low value of company shares on the bourse.' Several foreign companies - Asea Brown-Boveri, ICL and the Norwegian Kvaerner group - already operate in Finland. The Saab Valmet plant is the pride of Saab Auto AB for the high level of its shopfloor productivity. But as Mr Karmila points out, before 1939 Finland's prosperity owed much to the involvement of foreign capital. The industrialisation of the country in paper, shipbuilding and engineering stemmed in part from British, French and German investment. In other words, the integration of Finland into the western economies over the next few years will bring the country back to what it was even before its independence in 1917 from Russia, part of a wider and open international trading system.</p>

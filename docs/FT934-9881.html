			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / State urged to scrap controls STATE CONTROLS on Japan's economic activity must become the exception rather than the rule, with 'no sanctuaries' from deregulation, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business federation, said yesterday. He heads a government-inspired panel that has called for a central body to carry out a five-year economic deregulation plan. The panel's report follows government departments' resistance to reductions in extensive powers they apply through regulations. It aims to deliver a more concrete report by the end of the year. All of Japan's more than 10,000 official regulations should be reviewed or considered for abolition, the report says. It singles out as urgent examples 500 rules, on top of the 94 proposals put forward by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the first steps of his deregulation drive in September. They include the rice import ban and the resale price system, which requires some products such as books and cosmetics to be sold at producers' recommended prices. Regulations in several sectors where public interest or safety is at stake should be relaxed and clarified, rather than considered for abolition, the report says. These include public utilities and oil supply, finance, securities and insurance, land and housing. The tradition of 'administrative guidance', used by bureaucrats to wield wide informal powers, should only be applied in a clear manner within the law, the panel added. The proposals would be enacted by a deregulation office, to be set up by next April under control of the prime minister, whose efforts would be supervised by a powerful independent watchdog. The establishment of such a body would place the success or failure of deregulation directly in the hands of Mr Hosokawa and his successors, rather than in the government departments concerned. Even at this interim stage, the report has been rewritten after Mr Hosokawa and Mr Hiraiwa rejected a first draft. Mr Hosokawa has told the panel to halve the deregulation timetable from the 10 years advocated by some members of the 15-strong panel of business leaders, economists and former officials. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-finance minister, gave the report a lukewarm reception. He had no 'fundamental philosophical objections' and hoped to implement it 'sincerely'.</p>

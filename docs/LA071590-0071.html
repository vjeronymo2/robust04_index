			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WORST-CASE EXAMPLE OF POLITICAL SHENANIGANS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PROTECTING EMPIRES THAN DOING RIGHT  THING  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council's latest exercise in political chicanery was on  display last week, and, to no one's surprise, its machinations on  reapportionment produced no shortage of maneuvering. It took less than 24 hours  for the Chicano Federation to take the entire matter back before U.S. District  Judge John Rhoades. That's probably where this mess belongs.  </P> <P> The redistricting battle has been brewing for some time in City Hall offices,  where council members' number-crunchers have been plotting strategy to gain  maximum political advantage from the required rebalancing of populations in the  eight districts. No surprise there; that's how the system works, sort of.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, an advisory redistricting panel appointed by the council had  been holding public hearings to redraw district lines.  </P> <P> Its map wasn't free of political taint, either, offering significant advantages  to some of the council's conservative Republicans. But it was based on months  of public testimony and debate.  </P> <P> On Monday, the council's liberal, pro-environment "Gang of Five," which  controls city policy on many issues by the narrow margin of a single vote,  produced a map that only its bloc members had seen before. Then it tentatively  adopted the boundaries by a 5-4 vote.  </P> <P> It appears that the decision violates a provision of the 1988 legal settlement  of the Chicano Federation's voting rights suit against the city. In that  document, Rhoades ordered the council to allow minority community  representatives a meaningful role in shaping the map.  </P> <P> By Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue had barred the council from formally  adopting the map, a decision that was the best course of action under these  circumstances.  </P> <P> The majority's sin pales before the unparalleled political cowardice of  Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who voted for new boundaries that remove Scripps  Ranch from her 5th District. Bernhardt won an upset victory over incumbent  "bulldozer" Ed Struiksma last November with the zealous volunteer aid of  Scripps Ranch environmentalists, who believed the promises that she would  protect Miramar Lake and the I-15 corridor from development.  </P> <P> Those problems apparently have proven more intractable than Bernhardt foresaw.  With another major headache -- the reopening of Pomerado Road through Scripps  Ranch -- on the horizon, Bernhardt simply fled the district.  </P> <P> Who takes over as Scripps Ranch's representative? Bruce Henderson, the reigning  pro-growth councilman. Henderson, by the way, was the victim of a naked  gerrymander designed to make him more vulnerable to defeat in 1991.  </P> <P> At the behest of environmental activists, the burgeoning I-15 corridor was  Balkanized into three council districts so that the council could not dump the  city's growth on one council member. That may have been a clever growth-control  tactic, but the fact remains that, in testimony before the advisory panel, many  I-15 residents asked to be lumped together in one district.  </P> <P> The main issue facing Rhoades, however, is whether the council obeyed federal  guidelines requiring it to augment the voting power of Latinos and other  minorities. The adopted plan contains an 8th District that is 51% Latino,  compared with the 52.2% on the advisory commission map.  </P> <P> That is a small difference. But Chicano Federation lawyers make a compelling  argument that the ruling bloc, by excluding some fast-growing Latino districts  in favor of the heavily white neighborhood where incumbent Bob Filner  conveniently bought a house during the redistricting process, the council  demonstrated its intent to curb minority voting power.  </P> <P> Rhoades will have to sort that one out. We don't know if the reapportionment is  legal. We do know that, so far, the process has been a crime.  </P></p>

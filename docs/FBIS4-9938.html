			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Figueroa] </F>   [Text] Montevideo, 2 Apr (EFE) -- The visit by Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Montevideo on 4 April has  divided the Broad Front leftist coalition--the country's  third-largest political force--and is threatening to cause an  internal crisis just eight months before the general elections.    Diplomatic spokespersons have said that Robaina begins his  tour in Montevideo that will include Argentina, Paraguay, and  Peru "seeking to re-insert Cuba into the Latin American  framework."    Francisco Rodriguez Camusso is a veteran Uruguayan  legislator  with several decades in Congress who in 1989 was elected deputy  to represent a group that includes, among others, the  communists. He said he will not participate in the session of  the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies  which will receive Robaina on 4 April.    The committee comprises seven members; Rodriguez Camusso is  the only representative of the Broad Front Coalition. He said:  "I represent the Broad Front bloc on this committee, which fully  supports the Leninist regime of Fidel Castro."    "I totally disagree with this and I would like to strongly  discuss with Mr. Robaina the violations currently occurring in  Cuba. This would mean contradicting the majority of my sector  and for the sake of party discipline I will not participate in  that session," the congressman added.    During the past few months he has been criticized by the  most  radical sectors of the Broad Front, which includes socialists,  communists, Trotskyists, Leninists, independents, and former  Tupamaro guerrillas, among others.    The decision not to participate in the session to honor the  Cuban foreign minister and the congressman's harsh criticism of  Castro's regime may provoke an internal crisis within the  leftist coalition.    For the first time ever, the Broad Front in 1989 won the  municipality of Montevideo where half the Uruguayan population  live. Mayor Tabare Vazquez, a socialist and doctor, will be a  presidential candidate in the 27 November elections.    The latest polls show the Broad Front currently in second  place after the Colorado Party, which has traditionally governed  and which is now the main opposition party ahead of the Blanco  Party.    Robaina, 38, is the youngest foreign minister in Cuba's  history. He will meet in Montevideo with Uruguayan President  Luis Alberto Lacalle and with Tabare Vazquez. He will not meet  with former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti--the  leader of the Colorado Party who, according to the polls, is  most likely to win the elections--because he is currently abroad.    During Sanguinetti's presidency (1985-1990), Uruguay renewed  diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1985, after a 20-year  rupture.</p>

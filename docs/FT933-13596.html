			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Disposal may signal revival of fortunes for large glassmaker PILKINGTON, the UK glass group, and Techint, the Italian-Argentine industrial concern, are this week expected to sign a contract to buy Siv, Italy's lossmaking glass producer. The deal marks the first big disposal in the year-long liquidation of Efim, formerly Italy's third-biggest state holding company. Pilkington and Techint, advised by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, are paying L210bn (Pounds 88.9m) for Siv, which lost L61bn before tax last year. The price represents a substantial discount on the company's net asset value of about L300bn. However, the purchasers are taking on L250bn in debt. Buying joint control of Siv will boost Pilkington's geographic and product range and narrow the gap with France's Saint Gobain, Europe's market leader in glass. The Italian company is the biggest European producer of car glass, where Pilkington is relatively weak. The acquisition will also raise Pilkington's profile in Italy and Spain. Siv has two float glass lines and two car glass plants in Italy, and a third car glass operation in Spain. The company, which had sales of L670bn last year, has about 4,000 employees. Its earnings have been hit by chronic overstaffing and the downturn in the European automotive sector. Talks on the sale were complicated by the need for agreement on redundancies at Siv plants, concentrated in the high-unemployment area of southern Abruzzo. The deal involves 450 job losses, fewer than half those originally sought, according to Italian press reports. However, further job cuts are virtually certain over the long term. The purchasers are expected to invest about L100bn in the next three years. Pilkington joined forces with Techint, which specialises in steel and which has plants in Italy and Latin America, to improve its chances in the bidding process. In the end, however, the two partners were the only bidders. Techint is cash-rich and has already participated in a number of Latin American privatisations. It, too, has been keen to raise its Italian exposure. Combined ownership may provide the boost needed to turn Siv around. While Pilkington has great expertise in glassmaking, it has little management experience in Italy. Techint is a stranger to glass, but has considerable management knowhow in the complex Italian market.</p>

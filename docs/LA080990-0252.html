			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HAD DUKAKIS WON, WIFE SAYS, SHE'D HAVE GONE OVER THE EDGE  </P> <P> Kitty Dukakis says that if her husband had become President, the pressure of  life in the White House would have sent her over the edge.  </P> <P> "I am certain the first crisis would have sent me out of control," the wife of  Gov. Michael S. Dukakis writes in her book, "Now You Know," excerpted in the  current issue of Good Housekeeping and reported in today's Boston Globe.  </P> <P> "I am equally certain that, thrust into the smothering, protective confines of  the White House, I would not have been able to seek proper help."  </P> <P> Dukakis, who acknowledges her drug and alcohol addiction, says she panicked  before the New Hampshire primary in 1988 when she realized her husband could  win.  </P> <P> "Michael was good enough to be President, for sure, but was I worthy to be his  partner? In my despair, I turned to alcohol," she writes.  </P> <P> Dukakis tells of periods of heavy drinking during the campaign and after her  husband's loss to George Bush.  </P> <P> She says she began a typical day at 9 a.m. by canceling her appointments and  downing three or four ounces of straight liquor.  </P> <P> "Then I'd go upstairs, shut the blinds, unplug the phone and read till I passed  out -- a process that usually took no more than 10 minutes. Two and a half  hours later, I would wake up and repeat the process," she said.  </P></p>

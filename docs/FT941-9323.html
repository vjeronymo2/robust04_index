			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar sharply lower Market activity was yesterday dominated by the dollar which fell to a five-month low against the yen, as investors sold the US currency in the wake of last week's failed trade talks, writes Philip Gawith. After closing at Y107.1 in New York on Friday, the dollar was heavily sold in Asian and European trading. It touched a low of Y103.50, before recovering to close in London at Y104.100, its lowest level since September. The currency fell further in New York and was trading at Y103 yesterday evening. Investors sold dollars for yen in anticipation that the US administration would try and talk up the Japanese currency as a means of curbing Japan's large trade surplus with the US which reached Dollars 60bn in 1993. It was the failure last Friday of President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to reach agreement at their Washington summit on measures to deal with this long-standing problem that prompted yesterday's sell-off. Rumours of intervention by the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve helped stabilise the currency temporarily, but many dealers felt the market would probably see if it could push the dollar lower, towards Y100. The US administration has in the past talked up the yen as a weapon to exert leverage on Japan in the trade talks. Yesterday's movement clearly reflected market nervousness that this scenario was likely to be repeated. Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, said the US would be considering its options all week and would not be making a hurried response. He did say, however, that it was up to the Japanese to re-open talks. Apart from a stronger yen, a further option would be imposing sanctions. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that the Clinton administration has decided to impose sanctions on some Japanese imports to bolster its negotiating position. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, believes the dollar will probably go as low as Y100 unless the US administration speaks out and makes clear that it disapproves of the current level. The Fed was last reported intervening for its own account at the Y103 level in August. Yesterday there were market reports of the Bank of Japan and the Fed intervening to support the dollar, but no indication that the Fed was intervening on its own account rather than in concert with the BOJ. Mr Cunningham believes that the Fed will intervene from its own book when it thinks the market is short of dollars - that is, when there is maximum chance that intervention will have some effect. With the market not having had enough momentum to go through the Y103 level, the Fed may still have doubts about whether the market is in a corrective mood. Notwithstanding talk of further yen strength, analysts are already warning that the currency looks unsustainably high. Nomura Research Institute put out a note saying it would be 'wary of chasing the yen too far', adding that 'the renewed strengthening is distinctly bad news for the Japanese economy'. It will undermine confidence further, squeeze corporate profits and raises the prospect of more job losses. Also, 'further yen strength would undermine the stock market and could lead to a flight of capital out of Japan, ultimately reversing the currency's strength'. Observers noted that this scenario offered little cheer to the US either. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, commented: 'Even from the US point of view there must be a recognition that a Japanese economy that is expanding is preferable to one that is flat on its back.' Mr MacKinnon said, however, that the onus was with the Japanese to make the next move. 'For the market to be convinced that the US is going to refrain from jaw-boning the currency, there are going to have to be some proposals from the Japanese.' Sterling closed at DM2.5622 in London, slightly down on Friday's close of DM2.5685. The weakness of the dollar took some pressure off the currency, which closed at Dollars 1.4693, up from Dollars 1.4663 on Friday. Investor sentiment was also improved by the release yesterday of producer price data, lower than forecast, which lent support to last week's much criticised easing of policy by the Bank of England. The D-mark maintained its recent mild uptrend against other EMS currencies. Dealers said trading was mostly a function of how individual currencies were holding up against the yen. It also closed higher against the weak dollar, finishing at DM1.7438, up from Friday's London close of DM1.7517. The German currency was also supported by the market view that the Bundesbank council is unlikely to ease policy at its meeting on Thursday. This view was encouraged by the Bundesbank's announcement that this week's repo would be at a fixed rate of six per cent. The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money markets with late assistance of about Pounds 460m. Earlier the bank had put put Pounds 748m liquidity into the market at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent for outright sale of bills and 5 5/32 per cent for repo transactions. This compared with its forecast of a Pounds 1.5bn liquidity shortage, revised up from Pounds 1.4bn.</p>

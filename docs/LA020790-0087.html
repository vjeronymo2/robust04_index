			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEMIEUX NEARS GRETZKY'S MARK  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux's back problems are getting worse. He is wearing a brace and will  require surgery to fix a disk that is rubbing on nerves and his spinal cord.  </P> <P> Although he is having trouble sleeping and says that at times the pain is  unbearable, he plans to wait until the NHL season is over before having the  operation.  </P> <P> Opposing goaltenders have trouble believing the streaking star of the  Pittsburgh Penguins is really hurting. They would just as soon he had the  surgery now.  </P> <P> Lemieux assisted on a goal just 2:20 into the first period Tuesday night  against the New York Islanders at Pittsburgh to extend his point-scoring streak  to 43 games. Aching back and all, he has the second-best streak in league  history, behind only Wayne Gretzky's 51 consecutive games.  </P> <P> It doesn't help either Lemieux's physical or mental condition that the Penguins  continue to flirt with last place in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> Although Lemieux scored two goals and had three assists, the Penguins lost an  8-7 overtime thriller. Lemieux set up the tying goal with two minutes left in  regulation, but veteran Don Maloney scored with just 36 seconds remaining in  overtime for the sizzling Islanders.  </P> <P> New York leads the division and is nine points ahead of the Penguins. The  Islanders have charged from last place by posting a 13-3-1 record in the last  17 games. The Penguins' team physician, Charles Burke, said a damaged disk  between the fourth and fifth vertebrae in Lemieux's lower back has gotten  increasingly worse. He also said the injury was not career-threatening.  </P> <P> But Lemieux was unable to practice Monday. "Some days I feel great, sometimes I  feel terrible," Lemieux said. "There seem to be more of the latter lately."  </P> <P> Edmonton 2, New Jersey 2 -- The Oilers, who have been without goaltender Grant  Fuhr most of the season, lost his capable replacement in a game at East  Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> Bill Ranford, who kept the Oilers in the battle for first place, was knocked  unconscious early in the game in a pileup in front of the net. Pokey Reddick  came in to play in a league game for the first time.  </P> <P> He just missed the victory. With three seconds left in regulation, Patrik  Sundstrom scored on a power play to get the Devils a tie.  </P> <P> Washington 12, Quebec 2 -- Dino Ciccarelli, one of the most prolific scorers in  the game, had not had a goal in eight games, but he scored four times to lead  an easy victory in Landover, Md. He had a second-period hat trick.  </P> <P> Boston 2, Detroit 0 -- The Bruins practically gave goaltender Andy Moog the  night off at Detroit.  </P> <P> The Red Wings had only 14 shots on goal. Most of Moog's saves were easy, and  Boston stretched its lead in the Adams Division to five points.  </P> <P> St. Louis 6, Toronto 4 -- Brett Hull became a part of hockey history when he  scored his 50th goal of the season in this game at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Bobby Hull and Brett became the only father-son combination to reach the 50  plateau.  </P> <P> Brett's father was on hand for the historic event.  </P> <P> Vancouver 5, Winnipeg 3 -- Dan Quinn scored twice at Vancouver to lead the  Canucks to the victory.

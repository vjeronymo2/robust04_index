			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Personal View: Faulty picture of multimedia world A remarkable conventional wisdom has emerged among business executives and consultants in the television, computer and telephony industries. It is that they are inexorably converging. While some blurring of boundaries is undoubtedly happening, the importance of this trend compared with some other changes under way has been exaggerated. The computer and telecommunications industries have been eyeing each other longingly for many years without ever consummating their relationship. Now entertainment has entered the picture, with media conglomerates like Time Warner of the US courting telephone companies. Cable operators are nibbling at BT's local telephone monopoly. BT is toying with movies-on-demand over telephone lines. To add to the confusion, everyone is babbling about multimedia, a term even more elastic than back to basics. By 2000, according to the pundits, the distinctions between content and carriage, medium and message, will be so blurred that television, telephone, publishing and computer companies will all be subsumed in one vast multimedia 'infotainment' industry, worth more than Dollars 1,000bn. This is fanciful. All of these industries are certainly going through tumultuous times. Broadcast television has ceased to be a protected oligopoly. In the US, the old networks' share of total viewing has already dropped by half. In the UK, the BBC and ITV companies will inevitably lose market share to new cable and satellite channels, as will traditional broadcasters in continental Europe. Competition in telecoms has, to date, been introduced by regulatory fiat in the US and UK, and largely confined to long-distance traffic. However, new technologies like cellular telephony, satellite and cable, offering genuine alternatives to the old copper wires, will push prices down. The computer hardware industry has already become ferociously competitive. The leadership of IBM and Apple has been seriously undermined, barriers to new entrants have dropped, and prices and margins have tumbled. The economics and structure of the broadcasting, telecoms and computer industries are thus changing fundamentally, and generally to the disadvantage of carriers and broadcasters. In a much more competitive marketplace, created largely by technological change, the cost of delivery of programming and information relative to content will fall dramatically. Some profess to have identified more opportunities than threats. The multimedia services of the future, according to the new conventional wisdom, will be on-line: movies-on-demand, home-shopping and banking, video games, distance learning, and a galaxy of interactive facilities. There are two flaws in this vision. The first is that it exaggerates the value of on-line delivery - many interactive services are already being satisfactorily implemented on off-line media such as CD-Rom. Second, it confuses the question of competition between different distribution systems with that of possible markets for new services. Technology can change the basis of production, but it cannot by itself create new markets. That depends primarily on the appeal of the accompanying programming or software to a particular set of customers. The main advantage of the intelligent TV for the average couch potato is initially likely to be that it will make choosing from a bewildering array of programming much easier. It will not seriously reduce demand for passive viewing, nor will it endow network or cable operators with skills in programme making, interactive or otherwise. That is why it is fanciful to think of this as a single new industry. The players in the complex new set of overlapping markets will have distinct roles, which will be determined more by their capabilities than by their assets. Success will come from applying those capabilities imaginatively, and from competing and collaborating intelligently, not from acquiring companies in unfamiliar businesses. The beneficiaries of the new media order will be the publishers of programming and software, particularly those that can redefine their businesses in the way that Reuters and Microsoft, for example, have done. The biggest challenges will face those that have been accustomed to regulated markets and outright monopoly. Telephone and cable companies, when the regulators permit, will be challenging each other not so much for the new multimedia markets as for each other's core businesses.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand's economy continued to sustain impressive  growth during the first quarter of this year as a result of  higher exports, consumption and investment by both the  government and state enterprise agencies, according to the Bank  of Thailand.    Private sector investment, however, weakened during the  period due to a decline in investment from abroad. Slow progress  in mega-infrastructural projects also contributed to a slowdown  in private investment.    Production in the manufacturing construction, trade and  service sectors continued to expand from the last quarter of  last year while production in the agricultural sector weakened.    The bank, however, pointed out that higher consumption and  lower agricultural output contributed to higher commodity  prices, leading to higher inflation in both the food and  non-food sectors.    The consumer price index rose 4.8 268460064uring the first quarter  of this@ year, compared with a 3.3rise during the same period  of 1993.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose 6.2, while  non-food prices went up 3.9    Concerning external trade position, exports rose 16.8as a  result of the improving economy of Thailand's trading partners--  particularly, the US. The removal of Thailand from the US  priority foreign country list (PFC) also contributed to higher  exports.    Imports rose only 12.4 268460064uring the first quarter of this  year. Imports of oil products dropped, but imports of non-oil  products-- particularly, consumer goods -- rose considerably  causing the country to suffer a trade deficit of 68.8 billion  baht during the period or about the same level as the deficit  recorded during the same quarter last year.    The current account deficit rose marginally from the same  period of last year to 47 billion baht.    Net capital inflow totalled 80 billion baht, a small  increase  from the same period of last year, while payments surplus  remained nearly constant at 21.52 billion baht. Official  reserves, as of the end of March, stood at US$26.67 billion or  an equivalent of 6.6 months of imports.    The Government's fiscal position weakened somewhat during  this quarter as import and excise taxes on car imports dropped  considerably. The cash account surplus was only 10.58 billion  baht during the period, compared to 27.61 billion baht for the  same period of 1993.    But Phisit Lee-artham, a central bank spokesman, said that  during the first half of this fiscal year (October 1993-March  1994), the Government's expenditures rose 22.82000060040ver the same  period of the preceding year, while revenue rose only 13    As a result, the Government suffered a cash deficit of 17  billion baht compared to a surplus of 9.5 billion baht recorded  during the same period of the preceding year.    This is the first time in seven years that the Government  has  suffered a cash deficit during the first half of its fiscal  year, but he said he expects the situation to return to normal  during the second half.    Mr Phisit said deposit at banks, as of the end of March,  stood at 122 billion baht, which represented a decrease of 38  billion baht from the end of last year. He said the drop in  bank deposits may stem from the fact that the public had  invested over 30 billion baht in mutual funds in the period.</p>

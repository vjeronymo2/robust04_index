			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Pascal Barollier] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 20 (AFP) -- Sarajevo marked its 100th  day of a ceasefire to the sound of steady gunfire Friday. UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Rob Annink noted that  between 100 and 200 violations of the truce were recorded daily.    The 100-day anniversary of the ceasefire agreement signed  February 10 by Bosnia-Herzegovina's warring parties was greeted  overnight Thursday with "the usual ceasefire violations" in the  capital consisting this time of heavy machine-gun fire, the  United Nations said.    The shooting lasted for more than an hour in the capital's  Serb- held downtown neighborhood of Grbavica. Major Annink  added, however, that the violations did not amount to a breach  of the 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone  imposed by the United Nations around Sarajevo. He said the  ceasefire violations were perpetrated with "rocket launchers,  hand grenades, mines, machine-guns and small arms," which, he  added, "do not pose a direct threat to the city." But although  the city itself may not be threatened by the continuous  violations, several of its residents seek treatement for bullet  wounds at local hospitals each day. Soldiers from both camps --  the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army and Bosnian Serbs -- are also  killed daily by sniper fire.    Although the UNPROFOR says that the exclusion zone  forbidding  heavy weapons within a 20-kilometre (12-mile) radius around  Sarajevo is generally being respected, it admits to various  violations in that area. Annink said the Serbs had deployed six  heavy guns inside the zone along with several tanks which were  not placed under UN control at various collection centers. The  Serbs managed to sneak one of the tanks into Grbavica earlier  this month as it was being transported from Bosnian Serb  headquarters at Pale.    Annink said the UNPROFOR did not believe the heavy weapons  were a threat to the city and preferred "negotiation to force"  in resolving the matter.    In other developments Friday, Annink said the Bosnian Army  was continuing its offensive along several fronts in central  Bosnia. He said UN peacekeepers counted 140 explosions Thursday  in the region of Kladanj, located midway between Sarajevo and  the northern town of Tuzla.    The situation was also tense in the regions of Travnik and  Turbe where Annink said the Bosnian Army burned a Roman Catholic  church. He did not have any further details on the incident,  but Roman Catholicism is the religion of Bosnia's Croats, who  engaged in bitter fighting aginst Moslem troops earlier in the  war but recently reached an agreement to set up a Moslem-Croat  federation in the former Yugoslav republic.    The latest fighting came as several Western countries  threatened this week to pull their troops out of ex-Yugoslavia  unless there was a breakthrough in the peace process. France,  Spain and Britain, together supply around 35 percent of the  33,253 UNPROFOR troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

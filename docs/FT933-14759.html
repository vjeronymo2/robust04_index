			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Wandsworth faces schools unrest SCHOOL support staff in a flagship Conservative local authority last night voted to hold a strike ballot in protest at wage cuts. A walkout by the 700 workers in the London borough of Wandsworth would close all its primary and special schools, unions claimed. A meeting of workers including meal supervisors, transport attendants and special school helpers voted unanimously to hold a strike ballot over the next few weeks. Strike action could hit the schools in September. A council spokesman said the planned pay cuts affected workers once employed by ILEA and on higher rates than those paid by Wandsworth.</p>

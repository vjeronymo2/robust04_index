			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the </F> Islamic Jihad Organization, by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus; date  not given; from the weekly "The Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Shaqaqi] First, this military act [the 7 April  Ashdod attack] falls in the context of our continuous jihad and  struggle against the Zionist occupation. It also falls in the  context of our response to the massacres of our Palestinian  people, especially the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It is  unreasonable for us to see our people being slaughtered in front  of our very eyes and to remain idle. This act of jihad by us  also falls in the context of responding to the Oslo agreement.  We do not agree that it is a plot to liquidate the Palestine  question. We do not hide our objection to this agreement. We  do not conceal that we are doing our best to thwart this  agreement.    [Al-Imam] Mr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Israel may withdraw from  Gaza  and Jericho and hand the authority there to the Palestinians or  the PLO. In case of your continued resistance and military  operations, do you not fear that inter-Palestinian  confrontations may take place?    [Al-Shaqaqi] First, if it [Israel] really wants to withdraw  from Gaza, as you are saying, then there will be no need for  confrontations in the Gaza Strip. This is because there will be  no Israelis. But if Israelis remain there--army and  settlements--this means they will not withdraw. Actually, the  Israelis are redeploying their troops in the Gaza Strip. In  fact, the future in the Gaza Strip is vague. Nobody, neither  Rabin nor 'Arafat, can define the picture in Gaza after one or  two months. However, in any case, the Gaza Strip and Jericho do  not constitute more than 2 percent of the size of Palestine.  This leaves 98 percent of Palestine. We will have the right  to confront the occupation anywhere there. Our jihad and  struggle will continue in the land occupied in 1948, the West  Bank, and Jerusalem. We will do our best to escalate this jihad  and struggle. As for the Gaza Strip, as I said, the situation  is vague. If there is a real withdrawal, there will be no need  for our continued fighting. But if there is no real withdrawal,  then it will be our right to chase the remaining  occupation--troops and settlers alike. However, I would like to  emphasize that our struggle and jihad against the Zionist  occupation does not in any way mean that it will collide with  any segment of our people. We will not collide with any other  Palestinian force. We will do our best to avoid being driven to  such a point. I believe that many options are available to us.  Such options can spare us such a collision.</p>

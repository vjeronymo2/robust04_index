			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE FORBIDDEN ZONE BY MICHAEL LESY (ANCHOR BOOKS /  DOUBLEDAY: $7.95)  </P> <P> On the advent of his father's mortal illness, Michael Lesy sets off to confront  the subject of death, the "forbidden zone."  </P> <P> "Our culture is permeated by images and accounts of death," Lesy writes, "but  they are only fictions, the works of the imagination, counterfeits. The real  thing is carefully hidden."  </P> <P> Lesy travels across the United States interviewing pathologists, homicide  detectives, undertakers, slaughterhouse workers as well as murderers,  executioners and mercenaries, all of whom distance themselves from their work  -- through humor, ritual, religion.  </P> <P> Among the conversations Lesy relays, a Charleston undertaker tells him that  Charles de Gaulle's protection against death by poisoning was to take a pinch  of arsenic every day. "A little death every morning to live through the big  one." From an AIDS physician, Lesy hears: "You die the way you live. There are  very few last-minute transformations."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ACLU STYMIED BY ORDER IN PROSTITUTION LAWSUIT  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday effectively lost its chance to  intervene on behalf of more than 100 Harbor Boulevard prostitutes who have been  targeted by the city in an unusual public-nuisance lawsuit.  </P> <P> While Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald granted the ACLU's request to  appear at a Wednesday hearing as a "friend of the court," he also required that  the organization first give individual notice to each defendant.  </P> <P> Practical and financial realities will almost certainly prevent the ACLU from  doing that in time for the hearing, said Rebecca Jurado, a lawyer for the ACLU  Foundation of Southern California.  </P> <P> The 116 suspects, arrested by Santa Ana police in what has been a monthlong  roundup, will thus probably be without a unified defense, Jurado said.  </P> <P> City officials, spurred by complaints from Harbor Boulevard residents, have  sought to bar women suspected of continued prostitution from the street  altogether as public nuisances.  </P> <P> City attorneys will ask McDonald to order that prohibition Wednesday. Civil  libertarians, led by the ACLU, have objected to the ban as unconstitutional.  </P></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Winter storms kill over 100 in eastern US BUSINESSES, commuters and home-owners along the eastern US seaboard struggled to return to normality yesterday after a winter storm left a trail of devastation in its wake and cost up to 115 lives. In Florida, hard-hit by Hurricane Andrew last August, the storm system spawned about 50 tornadoes; in the New Jersey, Connecticut and New York state region around 300,000 homes were left without electricity and up to 17ins of snow were recorded. In New York hundreds of motorists spent yesterday morning digging parked cars out from mountainous snow-drifts, many created by the weekend's snow-ploughs. East Coast airports were crowded with people trying to get away after being stranded through the weekend, when the nation's air transport system suffered one of its worst-ever disruptions. Major motorways were reopening yesterday, but many smaller roads remained blocked, with some travellers still snowbound. Yesterday afternoon, A M Best, the US rating agency which specialises in the insurance sector, estimated that the storm produced about Dollars 800m in insured damages. However, some companies said it was too soon to attach a precise number to claims. 'We just don't know at this stage,' said Allstate, the large Illinois-based insurer. The American Insurance Association, whose property-claims division provides industry-wide estimates of catastrophe losses, also said it was only just beginning to receive reports from member firms. A M Best suggested the bulk of damage would come in the southeastern states and central Florida. It estimated that the storm which hit the Northeast in December was probably more damaging to that region. The December storm caused more widespread flooding and coastal damage, and resulted in around Dollars 650m of insured claims. The latest disaster comes after a run of heavy catastrophe losses for big US property-casualty insurers and will exasperate the financial pressures on the industry. The bomb blast under New York's World Trade Centre complex this month is estimated to have caused over Dollars 1bn in insured damages, while Hurricane Andrew produced a record-breaking Dollars 16bn-worth of claims. In Florida, high winds battered grapefruit and orange crops, and frosts on Sunday and yesterday caused scattered damage to the fragile flowers that form next year's harvest, according to Mr Bobby McKown, of Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest growers' organisation. The damage was 'minor' in comparison to storms and freezes that devastated Florida citrus in the 1980s, he said. Storms lift sugar price, Commodities Page</p>

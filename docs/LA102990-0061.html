			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Paulmania: Paul McCartney won't wait another 13 years to return to the road, as  he did before his 1989-90 tour.  </P> <P> The one-time "cute Beatle" is already making plans for an international stadium  tour beginning in late 1991, and possibly some smaller club shows before then.  "There are plenty of small places we can go without having to have the  organization we had last time," McCartney said in a statement released through  Capitol Records. "There are many exciting little gigs, and I'm into that,  really, just to keep our hands in." A live album from the recent tour is due  Nov. 12. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

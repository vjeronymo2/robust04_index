			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Aissa Garcia] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina traveled to  Indonesia today, the first stop of a 21-day tour through seven  south Asian countries, with hopes of expanding trade.    Robaina and accompanying delegation will also visit India,  Malaysia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia,  as reported during a news conference at Jose Marti Airport  minutes before takeoff today.    The foreign minister said one of the purposes of the trip is  to learn of the economic results that are being achieved in many  of these countries.    We also intend to explain the goal of our project, bearing  in  mind the difficult situation we are facing, he said.    There is not only curiosity in the Asian nations about what  we are doing, but we are also very interested in finding out  what they are doing, because Cuba not only has to explain its  situation but has to listen as well, the Cuban minister said.    He also said in addition to its needs, Cuba has useful  things  to share with other countries.    He explained he does not intend to sign specific economic  agreements, because the fundamental mission is to expand and  open up opportunities for cooperation.    Among the topics to be discussed with the different  governments are the role that can be played by the nonaligned  nations, especially during its next foreign ministers conference  scheduled to take place in Cairo in late May.    In addition, the Cuban foreign minister denied press reports  of an alleged expulsion of Cuban diplomats from Canada, and he  said the island will not close down its mission in that country;  "there will only be a rotation of personnel working there."    He also announced Luis Suarez, America Research Center  director, will attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new  Chilean president, Eduardo Frei.    The Chilean authorities did not send an invitation to the  Cuban Government and instead sent it to four individuals, among  them Suarez.    Asked about the meeting scheduled to be held in April  between  Cuban authorities and the exiled community abroad, he said a  list of participants, which will be publicized during the next  few weeks, is being drafted.    In this regard, he recited the exclusion of those whose  attitude does not correspond with the "parameters of  nonaggression and nonhysteria." "Those who did not even expect  an invitation and have already replied (negatively)" will be  excluded.    As for the latter, he said "if they replied without being  invited, it is because they understand the message is not for  them."    The Cuban Government announced recently a Nation and  Emigration Conference scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April, during  which Cuban emigrants interested in the normalization of ties  with the country will participate.    Concerning a possible visit to Spain, he said it will  possibly occur in May but that a reply from the Spanish Foreign  Ministry was needed.    Robaina visited the PRC in June 1993, and he visited eight  Caribbean countries in late November. He also visited Mexico  and Colombia.    The Cuban foreign minister also toured five African  countries  in January of this year.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bad weather dampens US maize hopes COLD, WET weather and early snow storms ended the maize harvest prematurely in some parts of the upper midwest last week, and set market bulls in Chicago talking about quality problems that could reduce the size of the bumper crop. However, state agronomists and crop analysts say the quality problems are localised. The US maize crop is so large, and the quality of harvested grain is so high, that there is little chance that the US Department of Agriculture's estimate of a 9.33bn bushel crop will be revised downward by more than a few million bushels. The USDA next reports preliminary crop estimates on December 10. Final numbers on the US maize harvest will be released in January. Still, high moisture content in much of the nation's maize crop will require costly drying and special handling, trimming grower's profits. And in scattered areas, high moisture and a short growing season have lowered test weights and generated mould growth - a condition that leaves the maize unfit for export or livestock consumption. 'What we have is an abundance of good quality corn (maize) nationally, and an abundance of low quality corn in small areas,' says Mr David Miller, an Illinois-based American Farm Bureau analyst. The US maize harvest is usually complete by the end of November. However, about 7m bushels, or about 20 per cent of the crop, is still standing in the fields in Iowa and Illinois, the biggest maize-producing states. About 30 per cent of Indiana's maize crop is still in the field. Most of that grain will eventually be harvested, although farmers might wait until mid-winter freezes make the muddy fields safe for combines. In the meantime, the grain will be subject to moisture and mold. The situation in northern states is more severe. Only half of Wisconsin's maize crop has been cut, and in Michigan, three quarters of the acreage is awaiting harvest. Those states were projected to harvest about 500m bushels, with more than half grown for on-farm livestock feed. Much of that crop will not be harvested. Green, or underdeveloped, kernels and mold have reduced the value of the maize there. County officials report that farmers are plowing some fields under, or chopping the maize for silage. 'Very little of our corn is intended to be abandoned, but a lot may end up that way,' says a farm agent from Wisconsin's Sauk County.</p>

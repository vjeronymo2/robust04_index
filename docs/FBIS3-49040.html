Good evening.    [Silajdzic] Good evening.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Silajdzic, there is probably no sensible  person who understands this war in your country, which has, as  we have heard, claimed 140,000 lives and has brought incredible  suffering, above all to the civilian population. Do you  understand it?    [Silajdzic] Yes, absolutely. It is the result of the  expansionist policy by the Belgrade government and the passivity  of the international community. You have just seen [in a  previous report] the scenes in Sarajevo. This has been going on  for two years in Sarajevo, but also in other towns, such as  Vukovar, where it started. The international community has not  only done nothing, but has prohibited our defending ourselves.  With that the international community has condemned Bosnia to  death. I think this has to come to an end.    There are only two solutions: Either the international  community intervenes -- this time on our side and not on the  side of the aggressor, because we have an embargo on military  equipment -- or it will permit us to defend ourselves.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Prime Minister, I do not want to -- and I  cannot do it, anyway -- play arbiter here, but do you not make  things a bit too easy for yourself? Even though this embargo  exists, your soldiers are advancing and are involved in the  fighting pretty heavily.    [Silajdzic] We have light military equipment and the things  that we have assembled ourselves. It is a shame for Europe that  we are forced to fight against hundreds of tanks with weapons  that we have made ourselves. We are advancing because we are  defending our very lives. This is a question of life or death  for us.    [Oberhauser] This intervention from outside that you have  just mentioned -- is this the only possibility to put an end to  the war?    [Silajdzic] The international community must respect its own  resolutions and the basic principles of the civilized world.  According to these, it must either intervene or permit us to  defend ourselves. Our hands are tied. If no diplomatic  solution can be found, only these two solutions are left.    [Oberhauser] If this is true, Mr. Prime Minister, what is  then the point of negotiations, such as the ones that are  currently being held in Vienna? I do not even know how many  have already been held.    [Silajdzic] These are talks between Bosnia and Croatia,  between the Bosnians and the Croats. They are currently in  conflict, but they are in conflict because the international  community has not stopped the aggression against Bosnia. This  is one result of the aggression.    [Oberhauser] What do you expect of the Vienna talks? What  can the results be?    [Silajdzic] Today we talked about humanitarian issues; we  have already made some progress in this field. Today we also  discussed the status of the town of Mostar, and I can tell you  with joy that we have come to an agreement, that the Croatian  side is also supporting the project of giving Mostar to the  inhabitants of Mostar. This means that all those who have been  driven away from Mostar may return to Mostar. This means that  this is a victory of civilization over barbarism. Those who  destroyed the Old Bridge do not belong there. Unfortunately,  many will not return because they are dead. The least we can do  as a debt to our civilization is to bring the people in this  town back to their houses.    [Oberhauser] No matter how much we discuss tactical issues  here, I do not assume that we would make any progress in this  respect. Let us talk a bit about the people in your country.  You have talked about humanitarian aid. In the West, we have  heard that hundreds of thousands are threatened with death this  winter, because they will starve or freeze. Is there a  possibility to help these people? What is the situation?    [Silajdzic] There are possibilities. In Geneva we have  agreed that humanitarian goods may pass. The UN forces have  also been given the mandate to fight against those who stop  these convoys. This mandate is not being exercised. Therefore,  the convoys do not get through or they arrive too late. The  entire problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the attempt to stop the  aggression with words.    [Oberhauser] Does that mean that the UN soldiers in your  country do not fulfill their task? Do you mean that?    [Silajdzic] I think they have not been given any orders at  all.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being our  guest. I hope that, despite the hopelessness that is conveyed  by your words, at some time in the future it will be possible to  put an end to this madness. Shortly before we started our talk,  I received a press agency report saying that French Defense  Minister Leotard today came out in favor of U.S. intervention in  the Balkans. He wants to present this wish at the NATO summit  in Brussels next week. Would you welcome that?    [Silajdzic] It means that Europe's conscience is not  completely dead.    [Oberhauser] Once again, thank you and I hope that your  people will soon have the situation that they desire. Thank you.</p>

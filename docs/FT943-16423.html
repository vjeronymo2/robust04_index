			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Kuwait plans spending cuts to curb deficit The Kuwaiti government and the parliament's finance committee have for the first time tabled specific plans for eroding the Gulf state's high benefits in an attempt to curb the budget deficit, officials in Kuwait City say. The two sides have agreed to plans for raising KD100m (Pounds 218m) from increased customs fees on 200 currently exempted imports, along with higher mail, telegram and telephone charges. They also propose a KD250m cut in the government's original spending plan for 1994-95, made by cancelling construction and transport projects, and slicing KD178m from 'miscellaneous expenses'. Officials said the proposed cuts were modest, but it was the start of an 'educating' process for Kuwaitis, accustomed to cheap government-run services and, for more than 90 per cent of Kuwait nationals, high-paid government jobs. 'This is the first acknowledgment that we have to be not quite so generous,' one official said. The budget proposal now goes to the National Assembly for debate and final approval this month, even though formally Kuwait's fiscal year began on July 1. The proposed cuts follow pressure from the parliament finance committee to cut the original projected deficit of KD1.8bn for 1994-95 by 20 per cent, amid growing concern in Kuwait over fiscal deficits after the Gulf war. They show increased resolve within the government to attack what are seen as unsustainable state spending. The formula would leave Kuwait with a budgetary gap of KD1.5bn for 1994-95, based on targeted spending of KD4.14bn and revenues of KD2.63bn. The revenue figure is understood to assume Kuwaiti crude oil prices will average about Dollars 12 a barrel for the fiscal year. Kuwait's fiscal deficit for 1993-94 was budgeted at KD1.2bn and is expected to turn out at about that figure, with revenues buoyed during the last quarter by the upturn in crude prices. For the first time, the 1994-95 budget includes an item for defence expenditure, an inclusion which largely results from National Assembly pressure, and which renders difficult direct comparisons between this budget and those of previous years. The proposed budget savings, if approved by parliament, will relieve rather than remove pressure on the government's coffers. In July next year, Kuwait will have to begin repayments on the Dollars 5.5bn foreign loan to pay for Gulf war costs. The first Dollars 2.5bn principal repayment falls in the next fiscal year, with a Dollars 3bn payment in the one thereafter. Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, finance minister, has said he does not rule out an attempt to reschedule repayments of this debt. He and other officials are understood to believe that Kuwaitis, in any case, eventually face far deeper cuts into their welfare state than at present proposed.</p>

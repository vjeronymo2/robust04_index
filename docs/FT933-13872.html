			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices plunge on fears of Iraq-UN export deal WORLD OIL prices plunged to three-year lows yesterday as traders feared Iraq was close to agreement on limited exports in talks with the United Nations. Although London and New York prices recovered slightly after sharp drops in late trading on Wednesday, the price for North Sea Brent crude remained at its lowest since June 1990. During the day the North Sea Brent blend price for September delivery slipped 22 1/2 cents to Dollars 16.45 a barrel from the official close on Wednesday, but in after-hours trading on Wednesday it had touched Dollars 16.25 a barrel. By yesterday's close it had steadied to Dollars 16.66 a barrel but traders were not ruling out a renewed decline. 'It's dropping like a stone and there's no bottom in sight yet,' said Mr Peter Gignoux at Smith Barney in London. Iraqi officials, who were attending the UN talks in New York, left on Wednesday for Baghdad with a draft agreement, but it did not cover all the technical points necessary for the oil sale. The Iraqis want to sell Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil to pay for humanitarian aid. UN officials said the talks would resume next week although they declined to specify on which day. If an agreement is reached on the sale, Iraq will probably be able to deliver between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day for six months. But it is unlikely that oil would reach the market before September. Prospects for the oil market until then look pretty bleak. Traders say buyers are reluctant to return to the market until the uncertainty over the oil sales is removed. In addition, speculation over action by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been heightened by the weak market. 'Traders are trying to come to terms with the impact of possible Iraqi sales and any remedial action Opec might take,' said Mr Andrew LeBow, analyst with EDF Man, the New York trading house. Opec has continued its telephone diplomacy, with several ministers including the Kuwaiti oil minister denying the need for an emergency meeting. But the organisation cannot really act until it is clear what will emerge from the Iraqi talks. Opec members are still producing more than their ceiling and they will come under a lot of internal political pressure to counteract the slide in oil prices. However, to hold an inconclusive meeting before there is any resolution of the Iraqi talks could be worse than holding no meeting at all.</p>

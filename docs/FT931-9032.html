			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Clinton 'call to arms' over tax rises and job plans PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night issued a 'call to arms' to Americans to back the economic programme that he will unveil in his State of the Union address to Congress tomorrow. In a televised address from the White House, he acknowledged openly for the first time that he would have to raise taxes on the middle class, as well as on wealthier taxpayers. This, he said, was because forecasts of the federal budget deficit were now much worse than his own estimates or the worst government projections. But the president promised that 70 per cent of the extra taxes he will demand would be paid by those earning more than Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 71,000) a year. He also promised a 'pay off' in the form of 500,000 jobs created this year and next year by a federal infrastructure spending programme and 'millions of jobs' over the longer term. He appealed for backing with a 'call to arms to restore the vitality of the American dream'. Mr Clinton's TV address was intended to prepare the way for his economic plan, much of which is expected to provoke opposition from a variety of interest groups. White House officials insisted earlier that no final decision had been on the package but it is expected to combine short-term tax incentives and government spending increases with higher taxes designed to help reduce the budget deficit. A new USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published yesterday showed half of those questioned were willing to pay higher taxes in order to reduce the deficit. The main components of the package are expected to be: Investment tax credits for business worth around Dollars 15bn this year. Dollars 16bn of additional government spending this year, mostly on infrastructure. An energy tax levied on the thermal content of fuels. A rise in the corporate income tax rate from 34 per cent to 36 per cent. Taxation of a greater proportion of retirement benefits. Spending cuts totalling an estimated Dollars 34bn over four years. Mr Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said this would come close to achieving the Dollars 145bn reduction in the federal budget deficit that Mr Clinton promised by 1997.

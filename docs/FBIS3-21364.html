In an interview with the French daily LE FIGARO, Mr. Sekkat  indicated that the speeding up of privatization at the end of  1993 paved the way for a resumption of foreign investments,  which amounted to $500 million (one-fourth of which was used to  acquire equity in privatized companies), compared with $460  million in 1992.    This is the equivalent of 5.029 billion dirhams, reflecting  a  "still more spectacular" 15.9-percent increase, according to the  central bank governor.    To reinforce this trend, Mr. Sekkat said, the Al-Maghrib  Bank  set up an Investment Impetus and Follow-Up Committee comprising  the directors of the seven leading Moroccan bank; their  objective is to "solve problems" that may crop up either when  projects are being worked out--"financial engineering is not  always up to what investors would expect"--or when applying for  the various local, regional, and other permits.    The Al-Maghrib Bank governor also expects growth to improve  as a result of adequate rainfall, if it keeps up "at least until  the end of March." "If that is the case, growth might range  between 7.5 and 10 percent."    Mr. Sekkat also mentioned a projected reduction of the  budget  deficit to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product, which will  enable the Treasury to make "less extensive use" of bank  financing and thus "promote a rollback" of interest rates.    As for foreign-currency reserves, they increased by $300  million in 1993, to $3.8 billion, the Al-Maghrib Bank governor  also indicated.</p>

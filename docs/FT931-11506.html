			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Bronfman shares hit by restructure worries STRAINS IN the property and financial-service arms of the business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family have heightened fears of a wider restructuring of the vast Canadian industrial and financial group. Shares of several Bronfman-controlled companies continued to slide yesterday amid concern that the group will either be forced to sell assets or raise funds from other sources to support the haemorrhaging property and financial-service businesses. Brascan, one of the group's main holding companies, tumbled CDollars 1.13 to close at CDollars 8.25. Hees International, the merchant banking arm, lost 62 cents to CDollars 5.13. Brascan and Hees shares stood at CDollars 13.75 and CDollars 8 respectively at the beginning of the year. Share prices of almost all companies in the Bronfman orbit are at their lowest point in recent years. The Bronfman group makes up about 6 per cent of the total market value of the Toronto stock exchange. Companies controlled by the family and their senior managers include Noranda, the diversified resources producer; John Labatt, the brewing group; and Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer. Noranda shares lost CDollars 1 to close at CDollars 15. The most immediate problems are at Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest trust and loan company, and at Bramalea, a debt-laden property developer. RT is seeking an equity injection from an outside financial institution. Bramalea filed for court protection from its creditors last year.</p>

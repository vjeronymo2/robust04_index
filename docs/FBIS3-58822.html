It's not that the  journalists are short of ideas or copy. But all of rue de la  Loi is seemingly paralyzed, unable to really concentrate on  anything else. And rightly so, as the affair raises so many  political and ethical problems, as the impact assumes growing  importance and is now touching upon the very future of our  democratic system. And it is going to continue. It is  impossible to settle just like that, with just a few statements  of principle, an affair which has kept the legal profession busy  for two and one-half years.    And that is the whole problem: Our country cannot afford the  luxury of such a paralysis, especially saince it is accompanied  by the harbingers of a crisis. Since the debates by the Chamber  of Deputies and the "signals" which its partners have sent to  the PS [Socialist Party], in practice the coalition has ceased  to exist in parliament while Jean-Luc Dehaene gives no more than  half-hearted support for his first deputy prime minister, Guy  Coeme. Especially also as the damage increases: Public opinion  is becoming increasingly scornful of politicians, certain  journalists are happy to rely on anonymous informers to launch  scathing attacks, and a party as important as the VLD [Flemish  Liberals and Democrats] does not hesitate to play the dangerous  card of an extreme right- wing, antiparliamentary formation.    Government paralysis, coalition in danger, deteriorating  climate and attitudes: The diagnosis is clear and calls for  urgent measures. We respect the right to defense and the  presumption of innocence. But we know that a nation, a  community, a party, and a coalition cannot remain insensitive to  the concept of greater interests. As the politician responsible  for the helicopter affair, Guy Coeme has but a few days to  convince. Or to resign: Fuse wires are sometimes necessary.</p>

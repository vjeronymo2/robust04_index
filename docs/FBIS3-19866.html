			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, Italian Popular Party </F> secretary, by unidentified correspondent in Piacenza; date not  given: "The Center Is Better Than the Two Clowns" -- first two  paragraphs are IL MESSAGGERO introduction]    [Text] It is 0800 AM. Piacenza is still drowsing, wreathed  in a veil of mist. Mino Martinazzoli steps down from the  sleeping car that has brought him up from Puglia and vanishes  into a hotel. He begins the day's first election rally. He  accuses [Achille] Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of  the Left, PDS] of being "a Dr. Strangelove." The RAI [Italian  Radio and Television]: "It is no good their inviting us to an  extra debate to make up for all the time that they have taken  away from us. What they ought to do is show us what happens in  the wings, where the third-rate showmen who fawn on us from the  right and left put on their silk stockings and plaster  themselves with greasepaint. That way, everyone would realize  that it is all a show." He has it in for the PDS again: "If  what they call new is a throwback to [former communist party  leader] Togliatti-style duplicity, I am becoming a reactionary.  The new is on the way, and by that I mean way out." To Don  Dossetti, who called on Catholics to subject themselves to a bit  of purgatory, he replies: "We already have done so, while  others are selling false paradises." The audience (not a very  large one at this time of the morning) wakes up and claps. He  goes on: A blow to the Left and a blow to the Right.    "Occhetto? He has been to London and has elevated Gramsci  and Trotsky to the ranks of liberal-democratic thinkers."  [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi? "Those who are quick  to promote their own interests are usually not so good at  promoting other people's." What is more: "You get three for the  price of one vote: Berlusconi, [Northern League Secretary  Umberto] Bossi, and [National Alliance leader Giafranco] Fini.  Berlusconi holds their hands, while they kick each other in the  shins." The Mammi Act [on media ownership]? "The regulation of  a sector like broadcasting is a matter of freedom. A public  service in the true sense is a must, as is real pluralism on the  private front." Bossi? "I have known lots like him in the  taverns of Lombardy. Fun, but only there, in the taverns...."  Fini? "I would buy an ice cream from him, but nothing more."    [Correspondent] What is it like, Senator Martinazzoli, at  the  center? In Rome they would say in the middle, as in "caught in  the middle...."    [Martinazzoli] And they would be wrong...    [Correspondent] Mrs. Thatcher's adviser, the one who  "updated" Macchiavelli's The Prince, said that those  in the center get knocked down.    [Martinazzoli] Yes, if we are talking about the center of  the  road...    [Correspondent] But?    [Martinazzoli] But the center is a political point of view.  It is not a matter of geography, but of ideals.    [Correspondent] According to MSI [Italian Social Movement]  Secretary Fini, you are utterly failing to get into the game.  You are at the center of a tennis court, watching the ball  bounce backward and forward.    [Martinazzoli] What I really see is people battering one  another over the head with their rackets, both on the Right and  on the Left. Bossi versus Berlusconi. Occhetto versus  [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti. Just what sort of a game  is this?    [Correspondent] There you are, you see: You want to umpire  the game.    [Martinazzoli] No, all I ask is a bit of reasonableness. I  am offering the Italians a serious pact.    [Correspondent] In a match played by others?    [Martinazzoli] No, in a match played by us as well. This is  not a two-man race. It is like a cycling race. There will be  candidates who will be voted in by just one vote, and the idea  that there are those who have already won is simply grotesque.  So I am calling for votes for the center. To win.    [Correspondent] Is that not an overambitious goal?    [Martinazzoli] Not at all. We are gaining ground.    [Correspondent] Is the center running to win?    [Martinazzoli] Why else should it be running?    [Correspondent] However, the opinion polls show you  struggling.    [Martinazzoli] Claiming that our disappearance is  inevitable,  almost as if we had no right to be around, is a tactic devised  to further the designs of the Right and the Left.    [Correspondent] To put it in a nutshell, you deny that a  vote  for the center would be a wasted vote, as Berlusconi and Fini  are claiming?    [Martinazzoli] If I remember rightly, Fini lost against  [Rome Mayor] Rutelli....    [Correspondent] What do you mean by that?    [Martinazzoli] I should merely like to remind moderate  Italians that the reason why the Left won the last local  elections was that the center had been bombed, and its opponent  was this highly radical Right.    [Correspondent] But now there is Berlusconi as well.    [Martinazzoli] This, in my opinion, merely aggravates the  phenomenon, because Berlusconi's major contribution has been a  thorough application of mass psychology. What you do is  proclaim yourself the winner, invent a string of opinion polls  predicting a landslide victory, and call on gamblers to bet on  you, thus guaranteeing victory. But what do you win? Without  political consistency, I fail to see what moral consistency  success can have.    [Correspondent] Is this the reason why you did not side with  Bossi and Berlusconi?    [Martinazzoli] The proposal that they made us for merging  with their alliance was that we should disappear, no more and no  less. It was an unacceptable option.    [Correspondent] Nevertheless, you have said that you are now  watching the League with interest, explaining that it is "at a  crossroads."    [Martinazzoli] Yes, it strikes me that it has reached a  critical point of transition, that its strategic weakness is now  emerging. Bossi could not keep the protest vote unless he could  hold out a chance of entering government, which is why he sided  with Berlusconi. But now he does not know how to explain to his  supporters (who are tradespeople, manual workers, and small  farmers) what they have in common with this capitalist. That is  why he attacks him. It is an ambiguous position that, in my  view, is worth watching.    [Correspondent] Do you mean that you are watching this side  more than the other, expecting changes?    [Martinazzoli] Yes, I believe there could be developments on  this front. More so than on others.    [Correspondent] [Pact for Italy member] Valerio Zanone has  identified the League, AD [Democratic Alliance], and some  fringes of Forza Italia as potential associates for the center  in the event of no party winning outright and alliances having  to be sought. Do you agree?    [Martinazzoli] Yes, although talk of this type tends to  become excessively vague. If there is no outright winner, we  must work out what the electorate was calling for with its vote.  However, we shall definitely never enter into alliances with  the Rete, the MSI, or Communist Renewal.    [Correspondent] But when you reject a government of  "technicians," are you also rejecting the Ciampi hypothesis of  an institutional, or caretaker government?    [Martinazzoli] I simply refuse to join in this pointless  juggling with names. Apart from anything else it is  unpleasant....    [Correspondent] What is?    [Martinazzoli] That Ciampi's name should be taken in vain by  the very people who never did anything to help him over recent  months, and by that I mean the Left. We were the strength of  the Ciampi government. As to the rest, my position concerns the  limitations of "technical" governments in general. Politics  must be brought back onto the field.    [Correspondent] It might be pointed out that Italy has had  quite enough of incompetent politicians appointed ministers just  because they were the leaders of this or that wing of a party.    [Martinazzoli] But you would have to be stone deaf to give  what I said that meaning. I am not calling for a reversion to  the old ways of conducting politics. What I want is to put  authoritativeness back in politics. Because technical  competence is not neutral.    [Correspondent] Which do you fear most: a victory for the  Right or for the Left?    [Martinazzoli] In both cases, not I, but the Italians, ought  to fear something. There is nothing reassuring in those camps.  With their unrealistic promises, which they are not in a  position to keep, Right and Left are the two sides of the same  coin.    [Correspondent] And are you equidistant from both?    [Martinazzoli] I have already said that if I win I shall  govern, and if not I shall go into opposition.    [Correspondent] And if nobody wins?    [Martinazzoli] I repeat: We shall have to work out what the  electorate is demanding of us. As to the allegation that we are  the Trojan horse of the Left, my answer is: Stop pestering me  with this nonsense. That is not the way it is. If the Left has  been kept out of government in this country, the merit is ours,  not anybody else's.    [Correspondent] Do you regret passing the law adopting this  electoral system?    [Martinazzoli] It was the only one possible. We are not its  only progenitors. It was the...least common denominator.    [Correspondent] There is talk of changing it, perhaps  turning  it into a two-tier system.    [Martinazzoli] I have no hesitation about saying that it  should be corrected if possible.    [Correspondent] How?    [Martinazzoli] Moving toward a two-tier system; not the one  with a second ballot. That way they will no longer be able to  say that the center is against alternation. The center is  against a crazy, deceitful idea of alternation.    [Correspondent] Who is it that is lying?    [Martinazzoli] Those who appeal for votes from the center  and  then retreat into their right-wing or left-wing strongholds,  doing deals with their extremist fringes.    [Correspondent] But if all this had not happened, where  would  the Popular Party be? On the Right or on the Left?    [Martinazzoli] As far as I am concerned, the answer would be  easy. I am not a man of the left. Be that as it may, the party  would have had to reflect on this scenario.    [Correspondent] Does Catholic unity in politics still have  any meaning?    [Martinazzoli] What I defend is a tradition, values. I force  no one. Of course, I would not want Catholics to take up arms  to defend somebody else's values.    [Correspondent] Do you agree with [Interior Minister]  Mancino  on the Mafia vote?    [Martinazzoli] I do not know what information Mancino has.  All I know is that the Mafia will certainly not be voting for  us.    [Correspondent] Who will be the next secretary of the  Popular  Party?    [Martinazzoli] I do not know. As far as I am concerned, if I  succeed in upholding the future of our tradition in this  difficult moment of transition, I shall be content. I shall  have done my bit.    [Correspondent] So you confirm that you will not be running  for the party leadership again?    [Martinazzoli] Precisely.    [Correspondent] Do you have a favorite of your own for the  succession?    [Martinazzoli] No.    [Correspondent] Not even a short list?    [Martinazzoli] Neither a short list nor a Rosy [Bindi].</p>

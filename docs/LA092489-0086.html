			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE:: SAINT-SAENS: "SAMSON ET DALILA." CHRISTA LUDWIG, JAMES KING, BERND  WEIKL; CHORUS OF THE BAVARIAN RADIO AND MUNICH RADIO ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY  GIUSEPPE PATANE. EURODISC 7793-2-RG (TWO COMPACT DISCS).  </P> <P> In Patane's lackluster approach, Saint-Saens' most familiar opera still sounds  like an oratorio with moving parts. Neither sufficiently suave nor enjoyably  vulgar, the conductor offers little assistance to a mismatched, unidiomatic  international cast. Even in 1973, when the recording was made, Ludwig sounded  hollow at the bottom, and a voice never noted for pure sensuality makes rough  going of Delilah's lush musical line. King's reliable, stolid Samson misses Old  Testament fervor and even a dram of poetry. Originally issued on RCA, the  compact disc remastering is excessively reverberant. Allan Ulrich  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jan -- What is important now is to focus  attention on bringing to completion the process of political  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otherwise the world will  continue watching the tragedy unfold, said Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin.    In his exclusive interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent  upon  his return from Geneva on Saturday evening, where another round  of talks between the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict had  taken place, Churkin said that with every unsuccessful round it  was becoming more difficult to hope for success of the talks on  the Bosnia settlement.    Churkin said that the last round was unsuccessful. He noted  that it was at the previous round of talks in Brussels last  December that another opportunity to achieve accord was missed.  At that moment the international community lacked determination  to bring the matter to a logical end, and now it is lacking even  more. The deputy foreign minister believes that in essence, the  participants of the talks are now going round in circles, that  is to say that this time they did not touch upon the problems  that appeared to be the main and final problems at the last  round of talks. They discussed some other, completely different  questions. For instance, if last time it seemed that the  questions on the Muslim republic's access to the sea and the  Sava river, that is to say, the questions connected with its  life support system, were the first and most important obstacles  for achieving the final settlement this time, these questions  were not mentioned at all. New problems have appeared and one  could have the impression that the previous fifth and sixth  rounds of negotiations did not exist at all. Churkin said that  this situation confirms the anxiety of the Russian side that if  the clear position is not taken and if the sides are not  encouraged to sign the agreement, disputes about the various  aspects of this agreement may continue indefinitely.    What worries me most of all, said Churkin, is that it looks  like the world community, to say nothing of the participants of  the talks, has lost its bearings, and that a certain confusion,  bordering on panic, has emerged in respect of the idea that  nothing can be achieved, and important but secondary issues are  being brought to the forefront. He underlined that: It is my  deep belief that without a political settlement the humanitarian  issue, no matter how hard it is pursued, will continue to find  itself in a tragic state because while the war continues -- when  each side goes on thinking about a military victory -- it will  not be possible to satisfy the humanitarian requirements of the  population. At present, one has the situation, the deputy  minister continued, where the political side of the matter has  been somewhat forgotten and very important though still  secondary humanitarian issues including even individual episodes  of the general humanitarian situation are being brought to the  forefront.    Churkin said the Serb side, the Bosnian Serbs, had assured  him, in particular, that there will be no problem with relieving  the Canadian battalion by a Dutch unit in Srebrenica. He was  also assured (by Dr. Karadzic and President Milosevic) that when  the plan for monitoring the airport in Tuzla to ensure its  non-military use is drawn up, the Serb side will consider it.  This is a fundamentally different position, Churkin said. If,  in the past the Serbs would simply refuse to consider the issue,  this time they agreed. There are three landing strips in Tuzla  and a comprehensive monitoring plan should be drawn up in order  to fully guarantee that none of the strips is used for  delivering military cargoes. In brief, he said, all these  issues could be resolved but, if there is no political  settlement, the world will watch a continuing tragedy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    As far as the question of air strikes in Bosnia are  concerned, Churkin pointed to the corresponding UNSC [UN  Security Council] resolutions that refer to the possibility of  such actions within the framework of assistance to the UN  peace-keeping forces in Bosnia- Herzegovina and assistance to  the humanitarian measures of the world community.    Speaking about the position of the Russian side on this  question, it cannot be said that Russia is a priori, opposed to  any air strikes, he went on. If a situation suddenly arises  where the UN troops indeed become the target of a direct attack  by any of the conflicting sides, Churkin said, explaining his  personal view, then I would recommend (and I am sure that a  political solution will be adopted) that this measure be  supported. Or take another instance: a malicious act might be  carried out and one of the sides refuses to allow humanitarian  aid to reach the dying. In these cases, he stressed, the  toughest measures may well be taken.    But when there is talk of inflicting air strikes virtually  straight away in order to help the operation to replace the  battalions (the replacement is actually scheduled for  mid-February, there is an accord on enabling this replacement in  Srebrenica), then in Churkin's opinion, such proposals are aimed  at diverting attention from the real problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to imagine, he went on, how air  strikes would help to open the airport in Tuzla or serve to  carry out the replacement of the Canadian battalion with a Dutch  one. It is entirely clear that if air strikes are inflicted in  the Srebrenica area, there will be no replacement -- combat  activity will continue and any sort of humanitarian aid will be  absolutely out of the question.    As for the dissatisfaction with Lord Owen's activities over  a Bosnian settlement that certain circles and people have been  voicing recently, Churkin believes that the replacement or  resignation of one of the co-chairmen of the London  international conference on a settlement in former Yugoslavia  would now be a serious mistake. Lord Owen, Churkin said, is the  only person who has been dealing with the issues regarding the  settlement from the very start: He has concentrated all the  threads of the negotiations in his hands and if he were now to  be replaced, then: Those from any of the three sides in Bosnia  who do not want an accord could simply take advantage of this  circumstance in order to continue to deceive everyone, raise  more and more fresh issues, or return to old ones and so on and  so forth.    Churkin recalled that Lord Owen at one time adopted a very  tough stance -- an anti-Serbian one -- calling for air strikes  against individual targets, and: Now, when this is no longer  the case, we start hearing calls for Lord Owen to be replaced.  The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister believes that it is now  very difficult to find a worthy replacement for Lord Owen, and  without losing the tempo of the talks process, simply  impossible. This would, in effect, mean, he said, that the  world community would be resigning itself to its own  powerlessness and it would then be a question of a completely  new long round of political efforts with obscure prospects for  success.    The next round, Churkin said in conclusion, has been  arranged  for 10 February in Geneva. That meeting has been set more  modest tasks, and it will be attended by fewer participants.  Representatives of the Bosnian sides [as received] will gather  to discuss confidence measures, so it will be a meeting with  limited goals.</p>

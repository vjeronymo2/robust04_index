			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE FIRE KILLS MAN IN NEWPORT  </P> <P> An elderly Newport Beach man died Friday in a fire that swept through his home  overlooking Lido Marina Village.  </P> <P> William Womble, 78, was killed in the 2:20 a.m. blaze in the 2900 block of  Cliff Drive, said Fire Capt. Ray Pendleton. It took firefighters half an hour  to control the blaze, which probably was started by a cigarette or cigar,  Pendleton said.  </P> <P> The fire caused an estimated $325,000 damage to the wood frame house and its  contents, Pendleton said. It also caused minor damage to a house next door.  </P> <P> Neighbors said Womble spent most of his time alone and apparently lived off his  investments.  </P> <P> "He was a very sweet man," said Corinne Spence, who lived across the street  from Womble for 17 years. On Halloween, she said, "kids loved trick-or-treating  there because he always gave big Hershey bars." He also allowed neighborhood  children to play handball on his garage door, neighbors said.  </P> <P> "He was very kind and gentle," said Rich Demmer, 22, a neighbor who remembers  eagerly visiting Womble every Halloween.  </P> <P> Spence said Womble's family built the house before World War II. During the  war, she said, the Wombles kept a telescope in the house to watch for enemy  submarines.  </P> <P> Neighbors also said Womble's house was cluttered because he collected  newspapers, magazines and antiques.  </P> <P> "The whole house was a fire hazard," Demmer said.  </P> <P> Another neighbor, Betty Glass, 86, said Womble "saved everything from 1900."  </P> <P> "I always wanted to go there and look things over because he had a lot of  antiques," said Glass, whose house suffered minor damage in the fire.  </P> <P> On Friday, neighbors began leaving flowers in front of Womble's home. They plan  to hold a memorial service at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at Cliff Drive Park, 2900 Cliff  Drive in Newport Heights.  </P> <P> The county coroner's office Friday evening was still looking for Womble's next  of kin.  </P></p>

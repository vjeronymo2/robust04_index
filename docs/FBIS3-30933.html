Fahrudin Orucevic, an electronics engineer, is the director  of a military institute. He was recognized by a collegue from  work who was watching the SKY NEWS program.    The footage, broadcast by Belgrade Television on Tuesday,  shows Orucevic trying to avoid a British reporter who asked him  what he was doing at the market as he was seen measuring  something. He then walked away, ran across the street and  entered a parked vehicle.    His former collegue, who asked not to be named in order not  to jeopardize the security of a number of people from the  institute, categorically claims that Orucevic could have been in  charge of a timer -- part of the mine which exploded at the  Sarajevo market.    He claims that, before the war, Orucevic was employed in  Sarajevo's firm SDU which manufacutred remote control systems,  and that one year before the start of the war he was in Turkey  as the manager of the remote control in a mine.    As soon as the war broke out, Orucevic was appointed as  director of the Unis Institute, one of the numerous military  factories in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  which manufacture weapons and ammunition for the Moslem army.    Unis was founded and managed by current Moslem Presidency  Vice-Presidemt Ejup Ganic who is one of the leading ideologists  of the fundamentalist Islamic followers of Alija Izetbegovic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Enrile A Good Choice"] </F>   [Text] By appointing Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile over more  senior nominees as Armed Forces chief of staff, President Ramos  reaffirmed his policy of not appointing any officer to key  positions in the uniformed service if they are retiring within  six months of their appointment. The policy was earlier upheld  when the president reappointed Superintendent Umberto Rodriguez  as director-general of the Philippine National Police (PNP).    The new appointment has been generally welcomed by various  sectors. It helps that General Enrile is popular and well-liked  in the defense and military establishment. This early, it is  easy to see that Enrile's appointment will breeze through the  Commission on Appointments and public opinion circles, unlike  the Rodriguez appointment which has been hounded by controversy  since the start not because of the PNP chief's qualifications  but of the overall problematic state of the police.    It also helps that General Enrile has more or less been  groomed for the post. The new chief of staff was catapulted  into national prominence when as superintendent of the  Philippine Military Academy, he negotiated the surrender of army  mutineers in the 1989 coup attempt against [former President]  Corazon C. Aquino. He was a possible successor to Renato de  Villa when the latter retired as chief of staff in 1991; Mrs.  Aquino, however, chose Lisandro Abadia and named Enrile army  chief President Ramos chose General Enrile as the new chief of  staff over more senior officers without risking a backlash from  the military establishment. Such would have been inconceivable  three years ago when the air was charged with recrimination and  suspicion over appointments to the military service, a hangover  from the martial-law years when the military controlled the  political life of the nation. In fact, Mrs. Aquino suffered the  indignity of having to justify her choice of Abadia when the  deputy chief of staff at that time, Alexander Aguirre, protested  that he had been bypassed and charged that the appointment was  politically motivated.    It is to the credit of Abadia that he had stayed  non-partisan  during his stint, thereby proving Aguirre wrong. During the  1992 synchronized elections, the military under Abadia tried to  stay above politics and ensured a democratic and peaceful  turnover of power. Minus his unfortunate indiscreet and rather  arrogant remarks on how he refused businessmen's offers to lead  a coup against Mrs. Aquino before the 1992 election, Abadia was  a good chief of staff who was successful in disciplining and  professionalizing the Armed Forces. It is hoped that Enrile  would continue with Abadia's reforms.    There is another dimension to the Enrile appointment. The  naming of another Army man as chief of staff and not, say, Vice  Chief of Staff Mariano Dumancas who is a Navy man, shows that  despite the dwindling fortunes of the various insurgencies, the  military will still play a prominent, though diminishing, role  in counter-insurgency. Earlier, the deadline for the PNP to  take over the counter-insurgency operations from the military  was extended for another two years. It is expected that by  1996, the insurgencies would have abated as to allow the  military to turn over the offensive against rebels to the police.    By that time, the military would be able to concentrate  fully  on its essential role: defending the country against external  aggression and other threats to its national security. To speed  up the transition, it would do well for Congress to finally pass  the bill modernizing the Armed Forces and keeping our defense  capability at par with that of our neighbors in the region who  have embarked on an alarming arms build-up.    The modernization bill has been held by bureaucratic  incompetence; apparently the military and the Executive could  only provide ballpark figures on the costs of modernization that  are much like those aimless growth and fiscal targets churned  out regularly by our economic planners. The senators doubt the  veracity of the figures. There is support for the bill in  Congress, especially the Senate, but the Armed Forces and the  Executive must get their act together.</p>

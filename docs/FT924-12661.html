			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Backbench appetite appears satisfied IT SHOULD have been a gentle prelude to the new parliamentary session. But as Mr John Major tucked into salmon pate and lamb with the executive of the backbench 1922 committee yesterday, there must have been times when he felt he was dining with the enemy. Good-natured and amiable the prime minister's departure may have been after more than two hours at the disposal of the men in grey suits, but Sir Marcus Fox's remark on entering that the Carlton Club lunch - convened in honour of the 1922's 70th anniversary - was 'a social occasion' fooled nobody. Since its formation at a meeting of Conservative MPs which defied the party leadership by repudiating the coalition with Lloyd George's Liberals, the 1922 has become the most powerful voice of Tory backbench opinion. Though compliant and supportive when times are good, it has showed time after time that it is not a body that the government can trifle with. The executive members with whom Mr Major and his right-hand men Lord Wakeham and Mr Richard Ryder lunched yesterday comprise the most senior and respected of Conservative backbenchers. With a weak, seemingly directionless government husbanding a Commons majority of just 21, the power of the committee under Sir Marcus - its wily and publicity-conscious chairman - has seldom been greater. The 1922's rebelliousness should not be overstated, however. Yesterday, Sir Marcus himself was rebuked by colleagues in front of the prime minister for his outspoken criticism of the handling of the coal issue. So the chances are that the committee's grandees will this week content themselves with having demonstrated that they have the government on a tight leash by helping to persuade Mr Major to slow down the pace of the proposed shutdowns. Certainly, the mood was relaxed enough as yesterday's lunch broke up. 'The members of the executive were very happy with what the prime minister had to say,' said one of the lunchers. Lord Wakeham beamed. Sir George Gardiner, MP for Reigate, simply flashed a thumbs-up sign.</p>

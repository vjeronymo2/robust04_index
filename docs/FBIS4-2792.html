			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday, Tianjin Municipality held a  mobilization rally on carrying out the "222 project." Gao  Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed out  in his speech: Grasping the "222 project" is one of the  important moves of municipal economic work to be carried out  this year, because it affects the overall situation of Tianjin's  economic development, reform, development, and stability. It is  necessary to proceed from Tianjin's industrial reality,  concentrate efforts on grasping major enterprises and major  products that affect the overall situation at all levels and  rapidly turn them into key enterprises and competitive products  in an effort to invigorate Tianjin's industry and promote a  sustained, rapid, and sound development in the entire economy.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave  an important speech at the rally. Li Huifen, member of the  standing committee of the municipal party committee and vice  mayor, attended and addressed the mobilization rally. Zheng  Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the municipal party  committee and secretary general, attended the rally.  Responsible comrades of the municipal economic commission  offered suggestions for carrying out the "222 project." The  first light industrial bureau, Chinese medicinal herbs  enterprise group, and the communications broadcast company  introduced their ideas and measures for implementing the "222  project."    In line with the plans defined at the second enlarged  session  of the sixth municipal party committee and the second session of  the 12th municipal people's congress, and keeping in mind the  work ideology of carrying out package reform with breakthroughs  in key areas, the municipal industrial sector will implement the  "222 project" this year. The main substances are: The  municipal authorities will grasp two major items; the municipal  economic commission will grasp 20 major products; and all  districts, counties, and bureaus will grasp 200 major products.  A good job in organizing efforts to implement the "222  project," supporting the development of a batch of major  products with high level, large scale, and good efficiency,  realizing rapid development, and rapidly forming an atmosphere  are of great significance in invigorating Tianjin's industry  and promoting a rapid economic development in the municipality.    While touching on the targets which we must attain in  carrying out the "222 project," Gao Dezhan pointed out: Through  grasping the "222 project," we should attend to Tianjin's pillar  industry and form a number of products which have great  influence domestically and internationally. This is the  orientation of Tianjin's industrial development. To grasp the  "222 project," we must grasp the new and important economic  growing point and invigorate the number of economic units in  reserve. To grasp this project means to deepen and develop the  work of ending deficits and increasing profits. Specifically,  we should grasp major tax and profit delivering households and  key financial revenue earning units because they are the  priorities of the work of increasing profits. Grasping this  project means to materialize the package reform with  breakthroughs in key areas. We should turn these enterprises  into examples of reform, management, and development, use  typical examples to bring along the ordinary enterprises, and  promote the whole municipality's industrial development. To  grasp the essence of the "222 project" means that we must seize  the priorities, turn them into competitive products, promote  development, and revitalize Tianjin's industry. The hope of  Tianjin's industry lies in whether we can successfully carry out  this project. In order to grasp the "222 project" well, we must  further improve the plans and implement measures; give special  emphasis to some items and develop them step by step;  concentrate energy on managing several major affairs, push key  enterprises forward, dynamically grasp one group of products  after another, and make Tianjin's industry enter the path of a  well-rounded cycle.    Gao Dezhan stressed: The main objective of grasping the  "222 project" should be manifested in two aspects. One is to  raise economic efficiency, and the other is to intensify the  development momentum so that enterprises have efficiency at  present and development momentum in the future. By the end of  1995, the automobile industry should form a capacity of  producing 150,000 cars and create 2 billion yuan in profits and  taxes by 1996. By the end of 1996, the steel pipe company  should attain the designed production capacity and realize 1  billion yuan in profits and taxes. The 20 varieties of key  products developed by the municipality on a priority basis will  involve 39 enterprises. This year we must realize 2.6 billion  yuan in profits and taxes and break the record of 3 billion yuan  by 1995. The 200 varieties of key products grasped by  districts, counties, and bureaus should produce 3.3 billion yuan  in profits and taxes this year and break the record of 4 billion  yuan by 1995. In this way, by 1996, all enterprises that  involve in the "222 project" will increase their profits and  taxes by 100 percent over 1993 and reach 11 billion yuan in  profits and taxes. It will be arduous to realize the  aforementioned objectives and tasks. We must fulfill  responsibility, mobilize the people deeply, fight to win or die,  adopt practical and effective measures, and resolutely  accomplish the "222 project."    Gao Dezhan urged: To successfully carry out the "222  project," we must have new ideas and new methods and enter the  path of regarding raising economic efficiency as the central  task, relying on scientific and technological progress, and  enhancing the quality of laborers. This work should be carried  out throughout the main line of reform. It is necessary to  regard reform as the motivation, cultivate the ideology of  relying on reform to promote development, proceed from reality,  and strive to successfully carry out the work in 10 aspects,  such as deepening reform, expanding the degree of opening up,  readjusting the structure, conducting technological  transformation, strengthening management, developing products,  building leading bodies, training staff and workers, building  work shifts and groups, and building spiritual civilization.  Enterprises across the municipality should attend to these  tasks. Major enterprises should exert greater efforts to their  work, seek more rapid progress, and achieve better results. It  is necessary to persist in proceeding from reality, give  different guidance to different cases, suit the remedy to the  case, comprehensively manage enterprises, and grasp each and  every enterprise until good results are achieved.    Gao Dezhan pointed out at the end of his speech: The key to  grasping the "222 project" well is to make earnest efforts to do  practical things. Enterprises should improve their internal  skills and all departments should start up the green light. At  present, all enterprises must make overall plans and  arrangements, start to plan what items they should grasp and how  to grasp as quickly as possible, and step up efforts to carry  out the items, and must not remain in the stage of discussion.  They must study practical methods and pay attention to actual  results. All enterprise leading bodies, cadres, and workers  must have a good mental attitude, further enhance spirit,  immerse themselves in hard work, and be determined to fight well  this battle to tackle the most difficult problems. All  departments in charge of comprehensive work, pertinent  departments, and administrative law enforcing departments should  try by all possible means to do practical things for  enterprises. The questions raised by enterprises are the key  points for doing practical things. We should conscientiously  implement the system of assuming responsibility over a certain  work target, give strict evaluation, give awards and punishment,  and implement this project firmly. In the course of carrying  out the "222 project," we must discover and solve problems in a  timely manner, hold coordination meetings regularly, and turn  this practice into a system. As long as the whole municipality,  from the higher to the lower level, reach an identical view,  clarify the objectives, strengthen leadership, adopt effective  measures, and make concerted efforts to grasp the "222  project," Tianjin's industry will be revitalized, and will  create brilliant achievements.    In the mobilization speech, Li Huifen touched on three  issues: First, fully understand the importance and pressing need  of successfully carrying out the "222 project"; second, adopt  effective measures to accelerate the pace of implementing the  "222 project"; and third, fulfill responsibility and render good  service.

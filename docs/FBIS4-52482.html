			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- At least 71 Japanese have  left Yemen by ship and air for Djibouti, but 19 other Japanese  are still in the strife-torn country, Foreign Ministry officials  said Tuesday [10 May].    They said the ministry urged the 19 to leave Yemen as soon  as  possible. The stranded Japanese nationals are considering  leaving the country by aircraft of other countries, the  officials said.    The 19 still in Yemen are five employees of  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., one Nissho Iwai Corp.  official, and 13 Japanese Embassy personnel and their dependents.    The Japanese Embassy in Sanaa advised Japanese residents and  tourists to evacuate from the Yemeni capital Saturday, three  days after the Yemeni Government declared a state of emergency  because of fighting between northern and southern army units and  shelling in the capital.</p>

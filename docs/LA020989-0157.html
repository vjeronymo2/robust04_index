			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EVICTION OF DRUG PEDDLERS FROM RENTAL UNITS SOUGHT  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl F. Gates proposed Wednesday that  landlords in Los Angeles be required to evict tenants arrested for peddling  drugs from their apartments or rented houses.  </P> <P> The proposed law, which Bradley sent to the City Council for consideration at a  later date, would give landlords five days to start the legal process to evict  suspected drug dealers. If a landlord failed to act, the city would evict the  tenant and could charge the property owner up to $5,000 in fees.  </P> <P> The ordinance would require only an arrest, not a conviction, to begin the  eviction process.  </P> <P> "We're determined to make it tough on those who engage in the sale of drugs,"  Bradley told a City Hall news conference. "We are not going to surrender an  inch of our territory to these hoodlums, to these peddlers."  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden, who is challenging Bradley in the April 11 election,  said he questioned the legality of the proposed law and will carefully analyze  it when it comes before the council.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to get every dope pusher out of the city of Los Angeles. But at  the same time, we should design laws that will not infringe on the rights of  the innocent," Holden said. "Just to get at the criminal, you don't want to  violate the rights of the law-abiding citizens who may also be using that  apartment or house."  </P> <P> Before the eviction process could begin, investigators would have to indicate  evidence of drug dealing, such as scales, large quantities of drugs, large sums  of money or drug-packaging material, Gates said. Also, police would have to  show that undercover officers had made drug buys at the home or apartment.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance would require landlords to ask the suspected drug  dealers to move out and, if they refused, to take them to court to force them  to leave.  </P></p>

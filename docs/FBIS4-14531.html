			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian head of state and </F> chairman of the Supreme Council, to the Supreme Council in  Tbilisi -- live]    [Excerpts] I would like to associate myself with the  general aspiration and mood and general assessments in  connection with today's incident. It is very regrettable in any  case, but especially because it happened today [on third  anniversary of referendum on Georgia's independence]. It is a  pity that Georgia has once again made itself infamous. I have  already been told that various versions of events are being  transmitted on all radio stations: that the authorities have  been overthrown; the Supreme Council has been imprisoned; and  what not. I am saying this not only for the benefit of the  Supreme Council but for the benefit of the people who  voluntarily or maybe unintentionally participated in this  incident. I would not say that this could happen spontaneously.  I do not think it would be honest if I did not say the  following: I have certain claims against Shota Kviraia, against  individual leaders, and the collegium of the ministry. You know  that the minister had been ill for some time before he met the  collegium. Then the leadership of the ministry went to the city  police department and an agreement was reached that everyone  would do his own job.    There may be certain foundations for claims put forward by  Davit Zekidze and then again, there may not. All this requires  checking. It may be remarkable by itself when it is alleged  that an operation has been carried out and big money has been  taken there, but this requires investigation, this should be  confirmed. These sort of things are said about other people too.    Why am I saying this? Whatever the background, whatever the  nonconformity, whatever the facts in the possession of the head  of the police department of the capital city or any other, there  is no justification for what has happened here. Actually, this  means the ruining of what has been built for years by the  1,000-strong collective.    Any kind of assessment can be given. If we say that this was  an attempted coup d'etat -- if the Supreme Council says so --  the lawyers will try to substantiate this. There may be a  different assessment, like an attempt to disperse the Supreme  Council, as Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Mikheil  [not further identified] said. Perhaps an armed raid can better  explain what has happened. Whatever we call it, it is a  shameful stain in our history. [passage omitted]    There has been quite a lot to reprimand Zekidze as well. I  think it should be sufficient for the chief of the city police  to be fired, that the city prosecutor was killed, and nothing  has been revealed so far. The manager of the tobacco factory  has been killed and the case has not been revealed so far.  Hundreds of examples like this can be listed -- a lot of  kidnapping and the like. But on the other hand, this is a  collective that will have to implement all edicts, and I am sure  that the young people who came here today, through being misled  or with some other excuses -- will accomplish any task given by  the state. [passage omitted]    Notwithstanding all the good I have said about the  activities  of the city police and its head, I believe the Supreme Council  has to pass a very serious resolution and a strict assessment.  Raiding the Council building is absolutely inadmissible.  [passage omitted]    Certain concern has been expressed over the current tense  situation on Georgian railways. About six or eight weeks ago I  met a delegation of engine drivers. The meeting was very good,  humane, friendly. They are having hard times, like everyone,  although their salary is five and even six times higher than  that of a worker of any other sphere. The only thing we have  managed, the only help we have been able to provide, was this:  Using some income the railway is getting from transporting  various goods we were able to purchase foodstuffs that we sold  for coupons to engine drivers and some other leading  specialists. This is all the state is capable of doing today.    I know the railway people are listening to this and I want  to  appeal to them. I want to tell them that to go on strike and  stop transport today means that famine will begin in Tbilisi,  famine will begin in Kutaisi. I have told you that wheat is  being delivered to Georgia. We have overcome the most serious  crisis, but stopping the railway today means dumping the state  in even a graver situation than now.    There is a similar movement in the Metropolitan [subway]. We  have to help them with everything the city and the state has,  but we will not be able to give them what we do not have.  Therefore, I appeal to them myself and on behalf of the Supreme  Council to cope with the present hardships and not to desert  their area of work.    I cannot help speaking about a very delicate issue. We  approved a candidacy of the head of our security service  yesterday. We put our trust in him. I do not know who declared  or how it was declared that he was involved in some agency  network. I would like to appeal to everyone. We should not  speak of anything of which we are not convinced, of which we  have not seen with our own eyes, or about which we have not  received any documents about. He was approved by 149 votes in  the Supreme Council yesterday. I do not know when and how it  was said, but please do not commit a sin. I am not addressing  the Council now, I am addressing those who are listening. The  same sort of thing is very often said; I mean, they say so much  money has been spent there. Of course, such things happen, but  as the people say, the one who does commits one sin and the one  who blames commits a thousand sins. In a country like ours it  is not necessary to further aggravate the situation by blaming  each other in excess.    Two deputies have strictly put forward an issue of having an  agents' network, the people involved in the network examined.  No one is going to conceal its existence. Every state has it.  The old authorities had it, and they had it deformed, and this  service apparently still exists today. It exists in every  democratic state. While a state exists this will be one of its  attributes, a source of information. If the Council decides, I  will not object to it at all. However, one thing should be  taken into consideration. There must be two or three people  whom we trust most of all, those who will not take the  information out into the streets. [passage omitted] Those who  will be chosen for this task should be the conscience of the  nation and the people. [passage omitted] If these two or three  people find something that is essential and causes a certain  suspicion, we will get down to discussing what to do next.  [passage omitted]    I cannot help expressing my gratitude to every one of you;  to  everyone who has given a sound assessment to the incident; to  everyone who expressed their reproofs towards the head of state  and other structures, because in all this, one subject was  guiding, the one that showed that we have to be together in  ordeals like this and always because we are building one  country, one state. I cannot imagine anyone here who could be  against democracy, against constructing a democratic state. We  are united by national and people's interests.    We are reminded of the necessity for unity by the Abkhazian  tragedy. You know very well that we were ruined by the lack of  true unity and elements of treachery. We are reminded of the  issue of unity and togetherness by events that took place in  Western Georgia. These have been becoming manageable lately and  will hopefully become history soon. We are reminded of the  issue and the necessity of unity by the hard days we are living  in now; I mean, the most difficult social situation, the most  complicated situation, hardships every family is facing. And if  we remain together we will be able to manage something, we will  be able to ease the hard fate of these people and come closer to  the days when Georgia's territorial integrity is restored. I am  sure this will happen. Whichever road we choose -- this one or  that one -- it will lead us to this great aim provided we are  unified.    This does not rule out differences in ideas, heated  discussions in the Supreme Council. We will sometimes feel  offended or sorry. We can sometimes feel angry. Someone can  slam the door. All this is not very good but the Council is  unified in the main and essential thing. We are together in a  struggle for one, integrated, democratic, and independent  Georgia and I would like to thank you for this. Thank you.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fixing your mortgage rate - Avoiding some of the pitfalls The property market recovery is still some way off but many first time buyers are now starting to wonder whether the time is right to buy a house. Interest rates have come down, albeit in yo-yo fashion, from 15 per cent three years ago to 9 per cent today and house prices fell by an alarming 3.1 per cent last month, according to the Halifax building society. Downward pressure on interest rates continues but the fall in the value of sterling means that a rise in base rates, if only for a short time, cannot be ruled out. Deciding between fixed, capped and variable mortgages is one problem. Where to go for your mortgage is another. And, if you already have a mortgage, is it worth switching between a fixed rate and variable mortgage, or moving to another lender? LENDERS HAVE had a difficult time in the last three years. Now they are trying to pull in business with bargain basement rates for first time buyers but customers should beware: miscellaneous fees and charges can make a nasty dent. These include early redemption penalties - the fee for early repayment of the loan, usually expressed as several months interest payments. There may also be another charge, called a sealing fee, when you pay off your loan. Look out too for product tie-ins. First-time buyers, for example, will usually find that their discount is conditional on taking out insurance-related products, which bring the lender commission from the insurance companies and which you are likely to find more cheaply elsewhere. Ask yourself how well lenders treat existing borrowers. Lenders want to attract new customers and are much slower to pass on the benefit of interest rate cuts to existing borrowers. Some building societies, for example, Bristol &amp; West, are not reducing their rates to existing customers until December. TO FIX OR NOT TO FIX? The government's short-lived attempt on Black Wednesday at putting base rates up to 15 per cent, in spite of the recession's depth, shows how the impossible can happen. Many city analysts expect rates to fall but pressure on sterling and the absence of a clear economic policy mean there is the risk of a yo-yo route to lower interest rates again. For this reason, many people may find appeal in the security of a fixed-rate mortgage. The drawback with these (apart from an interest rate fall), are the fees. Also, they are rarely available on a repayment mortgage. The rate is usually fixed for a relatively short period so borrowers should make sure that the lender offers a competitive variable rate mortgage. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is offering one of the best fixed-rate mortgages on the market. Fixed at 8.25 per cent for two years, the arrangement fee is a relatively sober Pounds 100 and it is available on all mortgages but the redemption penalty is three months interest. The rate compares favourably with current variable rates of around 9.99 per cent. C&amp;G's own variable rate is 9.75 per cent. Abbey National has launched a fixed-rate mortgage at 8.49 per cent until November 1994, available on endowment, repayment, and investment-linked mortgages. But there is a Pounds 250 administration fee and a charge of 90 days interest if the mortgage is redeemed before the fixed rate term ends. The clearing banks offer fixed rate mortgages less often than other lenders but this week National Westminster put three fixed-rate mortgages on the market. These are aimed at new borrowers, rather than existing ones, who can fix their payments at 8.99 per cent (APR 10.3 per cent) until October 31 1994 or 9.49 per cent (10.3 per cent APR) until October 31 1997 or 9.99 per cent until 2002. There are arrangement fees of Pounds 195 for the two year mortgage and Pounds 250 for the five and ten-year ones. Early redemption penalties vary from two to six months interest. Midland has three and five year fixed rates for endowment and pension mortgages at 9.49 per cent and its existing variable rate customers can switch into the fixed rate. There are two strings: a fee of Pounds 195 and an obligation to arrange any new endowment insurance through Midland Life. If you think that interest rates will fall two or three percentage points further, but do not feel confident to rule out base rate increases, capped products - mortgages which have a fixed ceiling to their interest rates but which can fall below it in line with the market - can be a compromise. For example, Stroud &amp; Swindon Building Society has launched a limited issue fixed rate mortgage which offers a fixed rate at 8.25 per cent for the first six months and a capped rate for the next 18 months of the mortgage term. This is an interest-only mortgage: there is no need to assign life policies to the society. But there is an application fee of Pounds 150 and the mortgage is tied to the sale of building insurance cover from the society. DO YOU ALREADY HAVE A MORTGAGE? Few lenders offer fixed-interest mortgages targeted at their existing borrowers - these appear at times when lenders want to avoid having existing customers poached - but, if you are an existing borrower with a loan from Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest building society, you can take advantage of its 'Cascade' mortgage, to reduce your payments by 3 per cent to 7.99 per cent over 15 months. It is worth noting, however, that Bristol &amp; West has one of the highest standard mortgage rates of any large society - 10.24 per cent. There is an administration fee of Pounds 195 and an early redemption penalty of interest to the end of the month plus three months interest. If you are stuck in an unsatisfactory mortgage, think hard before converting. The costs of arranging a new mortgage, even with the same lender can outweigh the potential savings. Mark Bolland of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe says, 'It is highly unlikely that it will be in most people's interest to convert.' He gives the example of someone stuck with a fixed rate mortgage of 10.5 per cent until the end of 1993 - another 15 months. If their loan is Pounds 100,000, the net monthly payments would be Pounds 809.38 on an interest-only loan. The payments on a variable rate mortgage of 9.75 per cent would be Pounds 751.56 - a difference of Pounds 57.82 per month and, therefore, a saving of Pounds 867.23 over the same period, assuming the variable rate did not change. But to get out of the fixed rate mortgage, you will have to pay a penalty, usually three months gross interest, in this case, Pounds 2,625. Add to this a conversion charge of perhaps Pounds 250 and you will have paid Pounds 2,875 in order to make a 'saving' of Pounds 867.23. Even if you wanted to swap your fixed rate of 10.5 per cent for a fixed rate of 8.5 per cent over the same period, you would lose out. The new monthly interest payment would be Pounds 655.21 against Pounds 809.38 - a saving of Pounds 2,312.55. Transferring to a new lender would be even more expensive since it means facing the full costs of re-mortgaging. DO YOU NEED A BROKER? If you know what you want, you can go straight to the bank or building society of your choice. But mortgage brokers can come in useful if your needs are more complicated because of their knowledge of the market and contacts. But beware whom you go to. You should make sure that the broker you select is not going to sell you an insurance product. That means paying a fee to the broker, likely to be equivalent to around 0.5 per cent of the mortgage loan. A good broker will not only scan the market but should offer views on lenders.</p>

But with a shortage of new bond issues from UK companies and subsiding concerns about credit quality as the UK comes out of recession, many analysts expect yield spreads to remain at tight levels. According to BZW, the yield spread between secured and unsecured stocks in the sterling bond market is 'at an all-time low'. The risk premium on unsecured paper, by this measurement, is now less than 20 basis points, compared with around 80 basis points in early 1990. Factors driving the narrowing of spreads include the search by investors for higher yields as UK interest rates have fallen, as well as the relative scarcity of new paper from UK companies. Mr Hugh Corbett, an analyst at UBS in London, added that the experience of Queens Moat Houses - trading in whose debentures was halted at the end of March - and London and Provincial Shops, which prepaid a debenture issue earlier this year, had also weakened faith in secured bonds. 'People like solid corporates - (confidence in) asset-backing of property has been blown apart in the last year.' According to BZW, in its latest quarterly review of the outlook for the sterling bond market, there has been a distortion of 'the relationship between credit ratings and spreads along the (yield) curve and the question of where value lies in now a difficult one.'

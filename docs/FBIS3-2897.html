			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Dahong (2621 1129 1347): "How Long Can the </F> `Last Hong Kong Governor' `Hold Out'?"]    [Text] The "last Hong Kong Governor" Patten published an  article entitled "Braving the North Wind" [carried by THE  SPECTATOR], which implies that he will resist China to the end  on the Hong Kong issue.    However, people must ask how long can Patten "hold out"? In  fact, it is not difficult at all to answer this question. As  long as we look at how many cards he has, the answer is all too  obvious.    Let us look at his "homeland card." When Patten came to Hong  Kong, the first thing he did was to show this "trump card." At  that time, with almost "unanimous" support in domestic political  circles and the British press, Patten was in high spirits and  vigorous and made a showy display of his abilities. However, he  never thought of the "fire in the back yard" which is now  occurring, and he has even stopped boasting about "full support  in London." On 8 December 1993, Percy Cradock, a former foreign  affairs adviser to the British prime minister and a former  ambassador to Beijing, and two other former ambassadors to  Beijing--Alan Donald and Richard Evans--were present at a public  hearing on Sino-British relations held by the British Foreign  Affairs Committee. They criticized Patten's political reform  package as a policy of "self-destruction" and called on the  British Government to immediately stop the "rash and risky  policy of unilaterally implementing political reform in Hong  Kong." At a Conservative Party meeting held in the middle of  January, former Prime Minister Heath blamed Patten for causing  unnecessary damage to Sino-British relations." Early this year,  former Labor prime minister James Callaghan and former foreign  secretary Geoffrey Howe also objected on many occasions to  Britain's threatening and antagonistic attitude in handling the  Hong Kong issue. On the other hand, Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA  MORNING POST reported that when the House of Lords debated the  Hong Kong issue not long ago, "only one person said he supported  Patten," while in the House of Commons, "many people voiced  their disapproval of the consequences brought about by Patten's  policy." Meanwhile, there are divergent views within the  British Government. The FINANCIAL TIMES published an article  last December on the failed Sino-British talks. The article  quoted high-ranking officials, who said that to everyone's  surprise, Patten did not take heed of the fact that in 1990 the  Chinese foreign minister and his British counterpart had  discussed and reached agreement on Hong Kong's 1994/95 elections  when he drafted his political reform package. The article also  revealed that following the 15th round of talks, the British  side had drafted a memorandum of understanding in accordance  with the Chinese side's suggestions, but Patten had insisted on  adding a clause that a single-seat, single-vote system would  also be applied to the Legislative Council [Legco] elections,  thus sabotaging the Sino-British talks.    The British press criticized Patten in a more candid way. On  20 December 1993, THE SUN published an editorial entitled  "Patten--the Most Cynical and Impudent Swindler." The editorial  blamed Patten for wrecking Anglo-Chinese relations due to his  hypocritical preaching of democracy in Hong Kong, which  consequently made it difficult for large firms such as British  Aerospace and Rolls-Royce to win contracts in China. The  editorial held that what Patten had done was for his own  personal honor. Before taking up the governorship of Hong Kong,  Patten lost an election in his Bath constituency, and this  result even cheered his Conservative Party colleagues. Hence,  after taking up the governorship of Hong Kong, he has to try  every possible means to rehabilitate himself and his political  career. The editorial pointed out incisively that it was  "really stupid" for Britain, which had never held any democratic  elections in Hong Kong during its 150-years rule, and to  antagonize China with less than four years to go before turning  over ruling authority was "really stupid." "The price is too  heavy if Hong Kong is sacrificed for Patten's personal  ambitions." THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH also published a commentary  which pointed out: "For those British businessmen who want to  get into the China market, they do not understand why the  Westminster model of democracy has to be introduced at a time  when Hong Kong will revert to China three and a half years  later. Hong Kong Governor Patten is engaging in a political  gamble, but Britain has to pay a price in employment  opportunities and investment prospects."    It is even more obvious that British business circles, which  always set great store by business interests, are dissatisfied  with Patten. Early this year, several British newspapers  successively reported that since the British Government had  implemented its antagonistic policies toward China, a  considerable number of British-invested financial groups had  found that their London background had become a "burden" in  China trade. Some British firms which are eager to get into the  China market would rather do business with Beijing through their  overseas subsidiaries for fear that their London background will  spoil everything. Hong Kong's MING PAO reported on 29 January  that Carter, president of Britain's Birmingham Chamber of  Commerce, had told British Foreign Secretary Hurd at a dinner:  "British moves in Hong Kong will damage Anglo-Chinese trade."    To put it in a nutshell, the very foundation from which  Patten received "unanimous" support in Britain has been shaken.    Let us look at his "international card." Patten once  traveled far and wide to make Hong Kong an international issue  so that he could bully people on the strength of his  connections. However, he has been disappointed with the response  of the international community so far. Former Prime Minister of  Singapore Lee Kuan Yew has publicly exposed, on many occasions,  the British Government's and Patten's political aims and has  criticized Britain's antagonistic policy towards China. After  that, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser wrote an  article in THE AUSTRALIAN for the third time not long ago to  attack Patten. Fraser said that the fact that Patten was trying  so resolutely to build up "democracy" in Hong Kong at a time  when British colonial rule was about to end could only be  interpreted as "mischief and stirring up chaos," which is "a  kind of wanton behavior." He urged the Australian Government to  advise "Britain to suspend and for Patten to withdraw this rash  and misleading policy." On 6 January, (Chan Chek-yu), head of  the Bureau of Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Canadian Foreign  Ministry and who was visiting Hong Kong and China, publicly  denied that Canada had expressed support for Patten's political  reform package. He reaffirmed that the Canadian Government  supported the Sino-British Joint Declaration. As reported by  the HONGKONG STANDARD on 4 February, even the United States,  which has a special relationship with Britain, "is not willing  to reaffirm its support for the Hong Kong governor."    Playing the "public opinion card" is Patten's specialty, but  how is Hong Kong public opinion now? Allan Rogers, foreign  affairs spokesman of the British Labor Party, said that after  listening to views expressed by various circles in Hong Kong,  among those whom he came into contact with, most were primarily,  and to a far greater extent, concerned about their own lives and  the question of whether or not the transition of Hong Kong would  be smooth than about reform of the political system. (Adeley),  chairman of the Chinese Affairs Subcommittee of the British  Parliament, did not even mince his words. He said that Patten  had not consulted Legco and the people of Hong Kong at all  before he did anything in Hong Kong, so how could there be  "public opinion"? After all, playing the "public opinion card"  to portray an image of "keeping in close touch with the people"  is the consistent work style of a politician. As indicated by  an opinion poll at the end of January conducted by an  independent market research company which was entrusted by MING  PAO, there is a markedly growing number of citizens who are  asking for Patten to be dismissed from his post. Hong Kong's  SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST even reported on 23 January that Hong  Kong's Liberal Party, which is "one of the most influential  parties in Hong Kong," announced that they are "withdrawing  their support given to Patten's package."    Perhaps some people praise Patten for his courage, but more  and more people understand that this is a kind of irresponsible  courage. Just as Craddock, former foreign affairs adviser to the  prime minister of Britain, said: "If it is you who bears the  consequences of your own act of heroism, your heroism is above  reproach. But if you carry out a heroic act at the expense of  others' interests, and particularly the interests of those who  trust you--as we are doing in Hong Kong--it is precisely a  different story." Patten's willful acts will inevitably  endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and stability at present, and  after 1997, but he will not be the one who will bear such  consequences. He will simply go away after 30 June 1997 and the  chaotic situation stirred up by him must be cleared up by the  people of Hong Kong. So here is the "last Hong Kong governor"  who always claims to think about the interests of Hong Kong  people but who is not as good as his word.    Now, the British Government has been thrown into confusion.  The UK correspondent of Hong Kong's DONGFANG RIBAO [ORIENTAL  DAILY NEWS] reports that when Patten and senior British cabinet  officials discussed the issue of whether or not he should table  the remaining part of his political reform draft to Legco, they  held divergent views and differences between them were gradually  widening. Senior officials in the Foreign Office, including  Foreign Secretary Hurd, have leaned towards supporting a prudent  direction, saying that the original package must be greatly  amended so that the "Chinese side will feel that the British  side still strictly abides by the stipulations of the Basic Law  and the Sino-British Joint Declaration."    Why has Patten, who was once smug, fallen into such a  predicament? Apart from the fact that his unjustifiable moves  are unpopular, another important factor is that mainland China,  which is full of vitality, is absolutely able to maintain Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997, is marching to the  world with great strides, and has become a vital force in the  international economy. Recently, such key western countries as  the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia, and France  have conformed to the trend of the times and have successively  reviewed their policies towards China to strive for friendly  cooperation with China and to get into the China market in order  to achieve huge economic gains. However, Britain is going  against the tide and is inevitably in an isolated and passive  position. Patten still insists on "braving the north wind," but  how long can he hold out?</p>

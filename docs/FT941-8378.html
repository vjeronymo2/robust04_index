			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going Shopping / In the third part of our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers look at how the people of five major cities dress to go shopping On a Saturday afternoon in Paris there is only one place to go to see the French strolling around in their very best leisure clothes - the Conran Shop on rue du Bac. It is there that you can spot the few Parisian families who have not fled to spend the weekend in their country homes. The children are a charming sight. The little girls racing around in Bon Point smocks under brightly-coloured duffle coats and the boys bundled up in Levi jeans with matching jackets. Their mother's weekend uniform for this winter is a dark blue pea-coat, generally tossed over slim black leggings and shiny lace-up boots. The truly chic will have rummaged around their own mother's attics and the city's antique couture shops to unearth an original 1960s Yves Saint-Laurent pea-coat. The merely fashionable will have settled for a nice new Prada pea-coat, often enlivened with an expertly twisted Hermes silk scarf. The young and funky will have trawled the flea markets to find authentic US Navy pea-coats in chunky wool with blue anchor buttons. Fathers look as dapper at the weekend as they do on weekdays. Impeccably faded Levis, with jackets and open-neck shirts are the norm for the bon chic bon genre crowd in their 30s and 40s. Their groovier counterparts favour battered black leathers finished off with motorcycle boots. President Mitterrand and Edouard Balladur, his prime minister, set the tone for the grandfathers' generation. They favour the traditional style of tweedy weekend clothes that the French always think look English, but are so smart they could only come from France. The only blots on this stylish landscape are the sulky adolescents who may have been bullied into joining the family shop. Teenagers get a raw deal in France. The tedium of listening to the Euro-babble that passes for French pop music, coupled with the trauma of swotting for the baccalaureat, has produced a pallid, pimply crop of Gallic adolescents, generally lowering the sartorial tone in their colourless clothes.</p>

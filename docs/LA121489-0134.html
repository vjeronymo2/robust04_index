			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMIC CRISIS SEEN AS THREAT TO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT;  </P> <P> SOUTH AMERICA: CURRENCY IS DEVALUED IN AN EFFORT TO STEM THE TIDE. THE WHITE  HOUSE REACTS CAUTIOUSLY.  </P> <P> Argentina has plunged into an economic crisis that analysts here fear could  ultimately threaten the stability of the government of its new Peronist  president, Carlos Saul Menem.  </P> <P> The sudden decline of the Argentine economy over the past several days has  reportedly led to incidents of civil unrest. Railroad workers began a  nationwide strike Wednesday. There were reports of bus-burnings and other  violence in Buenos Aires and other cities.  </P> <P> The economic situation appears to be worsening almost by the hour. Capital  flight has intensified sharply. Wages are running out of control. Inflation is  wreaking havoc. Food prices soared between 25% and 200% after an easing of  price controls last weekend.  </P> <P> On Monday, in a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the government devalued the  Argentine currency by 35%, from an official exchange rate of 650 australs to  the dollar to 1,000, and by Wednesday it was trading informally at 1,350.  </P> <P> The increasing instability has alarmed some U.S. policy-makers and private  analysts, who fear the turmoil is becoming so deeply rooted that it is  threatening the Menem government.  </P> <P> A senior Treasury official is due in Buenos Aires this week, ostensibly as part  of a trip that includes visits to several Latin American countries. Some  analysts expect Menem to seek a short-term loan from the United States to help  head off any run on Argentina's dwindling reserves.  </P> <P> So far, however, the Bush Administration appears to be reacting cautiously. The  White House National Security Council and intelligence agencies are reported to  be following the situation closely, but the White House has yet to authorize  any action.  </P> <P> The chaotic situation is the culmination of a steady deterioration in the  economy since early last summer, when Menem assumed power early from President  Raul Alfonsin, who was the first democratically elected Argentine president in  modern times.  </P> <P> A wage-and-price control program that held wages down more firmly than prices  eventually cost Menem the support of organized labor, which split over whether  to continue cooperating with the new government. When labor balked, capital  flight mushroomed and the austral plunged.  </P> <P> The sudden collapse of the past several days followed Menem's declaration last  weekend of a moratorium on servicing domestic debt.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, government officials scrambled desperately to try to enlist the  support of business, labor and the country's disparate political parties in  forging a new social compact. e But it was facing an uphill fight.  </P> <P> Argentina has not been totally without Western help. On Nov. 13, the  Washington-based International Monetary Fund approved a $1.4-billion loan to  Buenos Aires. Less than two weeks later, the country's central bank president  resigned, charging interference by Menem aides.  </P> <P> Menem's initial program also was endorsed by the Bush Administration, which  hailed it as a step in the right direction. However, Argentina still has not  qualified for help under the Brady Plan, the new debt-reduction program  outlined by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.  </P> <P> An Argentine effort to reduce government borrowing by converting inefficient  state-owned industries to private firms also has foundered. Argentina has not  paid interest on its loans from U.S. and other foreign banks in 20 months, and  is now about $5 billion in arrears.  </P> <P> Argentina repeatedly has promised the IMF that it will reduce government  spending. Its latest agreement with IMF pledges to slash the nation's budget  deficit to 1.25% of the country's total output next year, from 16% in 1988.  </P> <P> But as late as last August, the budget deficit as a percentage of national  output had increased from its 1988 level, and analysts here say it appears to  be headed even higher in the face of the current turmoil.  </P> <P> Alan J. Stoga, international economic analyst for Kissinger Associates, notes  that December and January usually are quiet months politically because it is  the vacation season. "The toppling of Alfonsin's government actually began in  February," Stoga said.  </P> <P> But the situation is deteriorating so rapidly that many analysts believe Menem  may not have the luxury of the traditional December-January hiatus and will  have to act quickly or face a serious threat to his ability to govern.  </P> <P> "He's got to break the circle and regain credibility," Stoga said Wednesday.  "It's do-able, but very difficult."  </P></p>

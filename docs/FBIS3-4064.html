When it comes to the economy, however,  Zhu Rongji is actually the archenemy. His position and official  duties can help give authority to his remarks on China's economy  on one hand, while they easily turn him into a target of public  criticism on the other. His ability to rein the economy, which  he displayed last June when he took charge of macroeconomic  control and regulation, has once again shown his talent in the  economic field. Up until now, however, he continues to insists  on carrying out macroeconomic control and regulatory measures,  remaining firm on his stance even when described unfavorably by  some local officials as "a man who believes in withdrawing and  centralizing power." Some important figures at the central  level have also made veiled criticisms of him, thus adding to  the pressure on his work. Such a situation is a clear  indication of the existing divergence between the central  authorities and local governments on the future direction of  economic development, especially on the question of whether  autonomy should be withdrawn from or delegated to lower levels  and whether we should centralize or decentralize power. Although  the "50 Provisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee have already answered this question  through the assertion that only the establishment of a market  economic structure can solve this problem, friction between the  central authorities and regional governments are increasing  during the process of the planned economy's transformation into  a market economy, and Zhu Rongji is naturally the first to bear  the brunt.    Sources from Beijing have revealed that, in the speech he  delivered in his capacity as State Council vice premier and  president of the People's Bank of China at the national  financial and monetary work conference in mid-January this year,  Zhu Rongji reaffirmed the results of last year's campaign of  rectifying the financial and monetary order, stressing the need  to unremittingly abide by the "three-point law" formulated at  the previous national financial and monetary work conference in  July last year. Some local officials do not agree with him,  however, and have called for "a serious study of last year's  campaign of rectifying the financial and monetary order and  stepping up macroeconomic control and regulation." Some have  even accused Zhu Rongji of being "a man who advocates the  planned economy under the cover of reform" and "plays a role in  resuming and reestablishing the planned economic structure."  <H5>  Suffering New Pressure From the "Eight-Character Canon" </H5>   What merits special attention is that Tian Jiyun, NPC  Standing Committee vice chairman, delivered a speech entitled  "The Eight-Character Canon of 'Reform, Opening up, Delegating  Greater Power to Lower Levels, and Relaxing Control'" at a  recent symposium on the study of Deng Xiaoping's market economy  ideology, which was attended by many famed economists in  Shenzhen not long ago. In his speech, Tian Jiyun asserted that  the "Eight-Character Canon" is the only way to promote China's  market economy, and raises a question on whether we can continue  to abide by this "Eight-Character Canon." Tian Jiyun's speech  won the general approval of most participants. The basics of  the "Eight-Character Canon" include persistent efforts to  "delegate greater autonomy to lower levels" and oppose the  "centralization and withdrawal of powers." It is believed that  such remarks are directed at Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic control  and regulation, putting new pressure on the man.    However, an economist who is in favor of Zhu Rongji's  economic reform strategies believes that the delegation or  centralization of power is an inevitable phenomenon under the  planned economic structure. The "50-clause" policy decision  made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee is precisely aimed at breaking with the format of the  delegation or centralization of power so as to establish a new  market economic structure. Judging by the standards of the  market economy, the delegation of power is not necessarily the  synonym of reform, while the centralization of power does not  necessarily antireform. It will prove more beneficial to the  establishment of a market economic structure if we can  centralize the powers that are abused in arbitrary fund  collection and investment, and concentrate our financial  strength on infrastructure construction projects, which have a  great bearing on the national economy and the people's standard  of living. The macroeconomic control and regulation advocated  by Zhu Rongji is aimed precisely at achieving this goal.  <H3>  The Charges Made by Regional Officials Against Zhu Are Not  Totally Groundless </H3>   Sources have said that, according to the analysis of some  economic experts, the charges made by the regional officials --  though involving misunderstandings in many areas -- are not  totally unwarranted. Some local officials believe that the  enthusiasm displayed by both central authorities and regions  help form the basis of development, and reform is also aimed at  bringing the two enthusiasms into full play. All they have said  is quite right. The most striking feature of mainland China is  its imbalanced economic development. It is impossible to carry  out development and reform at the same pace in different  localities.    The forced implementation of a policy or a program  formulated by the central authorities throughout the country  will either intensify or suppress the imbalance, both of which  will have an adverse effect on the entire economy. Therefore,  uniformity should not be imposed on different localities and  regions; instead, development plans need to be drawn up in light  of local conditions. For example, under the new financial and  taxation system, the central authorities put forward a  "financial and tax refund" policy, by which the central  authorities will first centralize local tax revenues and then  make pro rata refunds to different localities in accordance with  the basic figures of their financial expenditures. This policy  is aimed at strengthening the central authorities' ability to  keep control of the local economies. When it comes to reality,  however, regional governments feel restrictions in many ways,  and they all worry about a slowdown in their economy if the  central authorities fail to keep their promises. What is more,  with the defects of overcentralization, major waste, high  accumulation, and poor economic efficiency, the central  authorities have had hardly any success in the projects that  they were committed to over the past many years, thus making the  local government very skeptical about the central authorities'  capacity to set up a powerful macroeconomic control and  regulation system, even though they have such major centralized  financial power in their hands.    People from Beijing's economic circles have pointed out that  Deng Xiaoping once aired his view on protecting the enthusiasm  of different localities on the eve of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Deng said: "It is necessary  to strengthen macroeconomic control and enhance the authority of  the central officials. We should not use the old methods of the  planned economy to reach our goal, however. The central  authorities should have a clear idea on what they should or  should not handle and should never restrain the enthusiasm of  the localities and enterprises by keeping all power in their own  hands. To this end, we need to carry out reform and rely on  reform to build up the central authorities' capabilities in  macroeconomic control and regulation." Zhu Rongji, who is in  charge of economic work and macroeconomic control and  regulation, needs to heed the warning in Deng Xiaoping's  remarks. The principal officials of the central government must  pay attention to protecting the enthusiasm of local governments,  for in this way they can dissolve contradictions between the  central and local governments.  <H5>  Raising the "Theory of Moderation" During His Japan Visit </H5>   Sources have indicated that, despite the local officials'  misunderstandings and unfavorable comments about Zhu Rongji, the  CPC top leadership and senior statesmen still affirm and support  Zhu's work. At the start of last year's campaign of rectifying  the financial and monetary order, Deng Xiaoping warned "not to  interfere in Zhu Rongji's work." Recently, Deng Xiaoping again  affirmed Zhu's accomplishments in rectifying the financial and  monetary order, saying "To succeed in reform, we must advance in  an orderly way under leadership" and "successful macroeconomic  control should be reflected by the authority of the central  authorities," for "if the party Central Committee and the State  Council lack sufficient authority, the situation will get out of  control."    On many occasions, Zhu Rongji has stressed the need to  "carry  out Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory in a positive,  comprehensive, and correct way." We should be good at seizing  favorable opportunities, yet we also need to restrain ourselves  from making blind moves. Another CPC senior statesman Bo Yibo  also said recently: "The pace of development and economic  efficiency must be integrated organically. While speeding up  the pace of development, we should persistently seek truth from  facts, proceed in everything from reality, and never compete  with one another to attain faster growth." He also stressed the  need to "acquire an accurate and comprehensive understanding of  Deng Xiaoping's thought." All these represent powerful support  for Zhu Rongji.    However, it has been known to all that one of Deng  Xiaoping's  major theories reads "Development is the last word." How will  Zhu Rongji put this theory into practice? The "theory of  moderation" that he raised during his visit to Japan in late  February this year is fresh and new to everyone. Zhu Rongji  said: "In 1992, China's economy entered a phase of high-speed  development, and its economic growth rate has gone as high as 15  percent for two years running. Such rapid growth also resulted  in an overheated economy, however. The macroeconomic control  measures we have adopted since last June have helped bring a  swift and favorable turn to the situation. From this, we have  realized that we should remain moderate in everything we do.  Here we emphasize once again that there should not be big  fluctuations in China's national economic growth, and we should  maintain sustained, healthy, and rapid economic development.  Any move to abruptly slow down the speed will prove  destabilizing to society. Therefore, it is highly essential  that we maintain a certain speed. This year, China will achieve  a fairly high economic growth of 9 percent, and we expect to  maintain this rate in the coming several years. We are all  oriental countries which believe in the doctrine of the mean,  and moderation is the essence of the doctrine of the mean." If  what he says is true, China stands a very good chance of success  in maintaining healthy economic growth.</p>

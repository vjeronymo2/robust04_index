Ciren Zhuoga, vice chairman of the regional government, made  a speech: "Earnestly Implement the Conference Guidelines, Work  Hard To Establish a New Economic System." Xiao Huaiyuan,  director of the regional economic research center, chaired the  closing session, during which Zhang Zijian, deputy director of  the regional finance department, explained the progress in  appraising the fixed assets and circulating funds of enterprises  in the region.    The main achievements of the conference are: First,  increasing the awareness. After diligently studying Executive  Vice Chairman Yang Chuantang's important speech and other  relevant documents, the conferees renewed, deepened, and  increased their awareness of the necessity of accelerating the  pace of reforms and the urgency of strengthening the intensity  of reform. At present, along with the continual deepening of  reforms and growth of the economy, deep- rooted contradictions  in the regional economic system have gradually surfaced. To  solve these contradictions and problems, reform is the only way  out and regression will absolutely lead us nowhere. Second,  grasping the policy. Through study, discussion, and exchange of  views, the conferees understood comprehensively the ideology for  guiding reform in the region, which calls for "overall promotion  and breakthrough in key areas" and for "converging with the  whole nation in terms of framework and system." Third,  clarifying the tasks. The conferees clearly defined the "three  key areas and six major tasks" of reform for this year. Fourth,  enhancing the confidence. Officials from all comprehensive  economic departments and departments in charge of enterprises  pledged to transform functions, delegate authority to  enterprises, and eliminate red tape for them in accordance with  the principle of separating government administration from  enterprise management so as to give rein to enterprises to  develop themselves. For their part, representatives from  enterprises said specific and preferential reform measures,  which have proved effective for improving the external  environment of enterprises and invigorating their internal  vitality, will definitely promote the comprehensive growth of  enterprises.    Vice Chairman Ciren Zhuoga put forward a five-point  requirement for implementing the conference guidelines: First,  it is necessary to earnestly study, comprehend, and transmit the  conference guideline. [passage omitted]    Second, it is necessary to ensure good groundwork for  establishing a modern enterprise system, which is a key area of  the enterprise reform in 1994. [passage omitted]    Third, while promoting overall and supplementary reforms,  all  prefectures (cities) and counties must never neglect reforms in  farming and pastoral areas. [passage omitted]    Fourth, the regional and prefectural (city) economic  restructuring departments should work hard to organize and  coordinate the implementation of various reform measures slated  for this year. [passage omitted] Fifth, it is necessary to  relentlessly carry out reform measures. [passage omitted]</p>

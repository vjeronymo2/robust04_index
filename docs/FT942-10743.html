			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Johannesburg Exchange committed to reform The Johannesburg stock exchange announced its intention to reform itself last week writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. In a report - expected to be legislated by the new government later this year - the authorities declared their commitment to overall restructuring of operations, with emphasis on increasing market participation by both foreigners and black investors. The exchange will run a series of investor workshops and encourage the listing of small black companies, while also permitting limited corporate membership and some foreign ownership of local brokerages for the first time. After years of sanctions and isolation, during which many overseas buyers, particularly Americans, stopped even considering South African stocks, interest has resurfaced over the past six months. The recent boom, which has seen the major indices hit a series of new highs, has been largely foreign driven. Several specialist Africa funds have been formed, most notably Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m Africa Fund and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern Africa fund, both of which are overwhelmingly concentrated on the South African market. More are expected. As South Africa is increasingly added to global market indices, such the IFC data base on emerging markets, a greater proportion of international investment capital will almost certainly make its way to the country. With a current market capitalisation in the region of Dollars 160bn, the exchange is the 11th largest globally, and much more mature and sophisticated than most comparable markets in the developing world. With foreigners expected to be allowed to participate shortly, it is already widely rumoured that major London firms have expressed interest in partnership with local brokerages, a move that will likely generate further foreign business down the line.</p>

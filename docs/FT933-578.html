			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Lifting of sanctions boosts SA JOHANNESBURG rallied as investors had their first opportunity to respond to news late on Friday that sanctions were to be lifted following an appeal from Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, to the United Nations in New York. However, some dealers commented that, while hopes for an early merging of the financial and commercial rands had given shares a boost, the day's gains were mainly driven by speculative buyers. The industrial index added 81 at 4,446 and the overall index was 65 ahead at 3,795, but the gold shares index eased 3 to 1,595 as the price of bullion weakened. De Beers was up R5, or 6.6 per cent, at R81.</p>

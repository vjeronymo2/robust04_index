			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: The band strikes up again - A revival on disc of the Gershwin brothers' musical There were at least three versions of the Gershwin brothers' musical Strike Up the Band. The first in 1927 was a resounding flop. It folded in Philadelphia after two weeks. George S. Kaufman's satirical book lampooned war - a dangerous subject to try to be funny about even then. Today the show's underlying whimsy, whereby the US declares war on Switzerland, with yodelling as a secret weapon, seems quaintly off-key. 'Oh, this is such a charming war,/ Whoops] what a charming war]/ It keeps you out in the open-air' sings the chorus of soldiers in one of Ira Gershwin's lyrics. In the 1930 version Kaufman's book was drastically re-jigged by the comedy-writer Morrie Ryskind, who structured the show around the popular vaudeville duo of Clark and McCullough. In this form it had a respectable Broadway run of 191 performances and then petered out - only to be re-written once again in a 1940 film version with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney for which not even the most ardent fans of Busby Berkeley, its director, have a good word to say. Meanwhile a couple of numbers from the show - the title song, a spritely military march, and the evergreen 'The Man I Love', acquired a life of their own. The latter had been popping in and out of various Gershwin shows for some years until it settled down as a self-contained torch song variously interpreted by Ella Fitzgerald, Liza Minnelli and many other singers. Now, thanks to a welcome recording project Strike up the Band (Elektra Nonesuch 7559-79273-2), stemming from the Gershwin archive preserved in the Library of Congress, we have the opportunity to hear the song as a duet with its counterpart, 'The Girl I Love'. In the event it is less effective here and completely eclipsed by another duet about first love, sung by Jason Graae and Juliet Lambert, entitled '17 &amp; 21'. These two artistes are not at all well known to us. But like their colleagues on the disc - Don Chastain in the principal part of a millionaire cheese-manufacturer and Brent Barrett as the sceptical newspaperman, with Rebecca Luker and Beth Fowler as their womenfolk - they are thoroughly at home responding to the testing demands of the stage musical. They breath fresh life into words full of dated jokes and references, lines written when lyricists were permitted some pretty tortuous rhymes. Mercifully, there is no attempt to turn the show into an operetta as in some recent recordings of more recent musicals. Here a specially recruited orchestra conducted by John Mauceri with a complete cast and chorus are content to do a lively job of period reconstruction. On two CDs lasting almost two hours they sing all the numbers from the original 1927 version, frequently cued in by its spoken dialogue, and then they give us some additional items from the second version, including its hit song 'I've got a crush on you'. This 1930 version of Strike Up the Band has also been recorded in full and will be released later. The production has been planned by Tommy Krasker, the Gershwin archivist appointed by the trustees of the Estate under the aegis of Mrs Leonore Gershwin. Krasker's scholarly approach to the task comes at a time when there is a universal revival of interest in American musicals of the 1920s. In one or two songs here where the original orchestrations have been preserved these have been re-created; in the majority fresh orchestrations have been commissioned from people who know how to dispense the authentic period sound. A troupe of dancers was in addition assembled for this recording. Under the lead of Randy Skinner, some dazzling tap routines ring out as if they were being performed on the floor one's room. Anyone who has the recordings released two years ago of Of Thee I Sing and Let Them Eat Cake, two other shows in the same pre-Porgy and Bess style when the brothers were trying to compose a la D'Oyly Carte, will certainly want to have this set as well.</p>

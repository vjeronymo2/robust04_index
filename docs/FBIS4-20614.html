The sintered feed and grown  crystals consist of  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] phase, but the first-scanned feed includes  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/]O[.sub]6+[/]  and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]  Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1) phases as minor phases. The  grown single crystal samples exhibit higher superconducting  transition temperature and the narrower transition width  compared with the sintered and first-scanned feed samples. The  high resolution electron microscope images and electron  diffraction patterns indicate that the single crystal samples  have an incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis with a  period of about 5a. The superconducting transition temperatures  (zero resistivity values) along the a-, b- and c-axis for the  single crystal samples have nearly the same value of 83 K.  _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] and  _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] at room temperature are 1.67  and 250 respectively.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Materials[.sup]1[/] are divided into congruently and  incongruently melting categories according to their melting  behavior. Congruently melting material, corresponds to A or C  phase in Figure 1, can coexist in equilibrium with the liquid  phase of the same composition above melting point. While  incongruently melting material, corresponding to B phase in  Figure 1, decomposes into the solid and liquid phase of  different compositions upon heating.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-68A>      Figure 1. Congruently and incongruently melting compound. </FIG>     Compound B starts to decompose into the solid and liquid  phase upon heating at temperature T[.sub]o[/] through  peritectic reaction, then the solid and liquid phase have  compositions A and X[.sub]1[/] respectively at temperature  T[.sub]1[/]. If compound B is slowly cooled from high  temperature, solid phase of A starts to precipitate at  T[.sub]E[/] and the composition of liquid changes from E to F  with decreasing temperature. If temperature is further decreased  below T[.sub]o[/], solid phase of B precipitates while the  composition of liquid phase changes from F to G. Therefore,  composition A precipitates from the liquid phase between D and  F, but composition B precipitates between F and G. Namely,  congruently melting material can be grown from the liquid phase  of same composition, but incongruently melting material should  be grown from the liquid phase of different composition. In the  case of incongruently melting material, an undesirable solid  phase may be precipitated later because the composition of  liquid phase changes continuously with precipitating solid  phase. Therefore, we keep the composition of liquid phase  unchanged by supplying additional B compound as much as  precipitated, when we grow single crystal of composition B from  the liquid phase between F and G.    Most of the high-temperature oxide superconductors are known  to be incongruently melting materials. High-temperature  superconductors have been grown by various methods such as slow  cooling,[.sup]2[/] directional solidification,[.sup]3[/]  top seeded solution growth (TSSG)[.sup]4[/] and travelling  solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method.[.sup]5-7[/] High quality  single crystals have been obtained by the TSFZ method because  this method has the merit of no contamination from the crucible  compared with the other methods. Takegawa et al.[.sup]5[/]  first succeeded in growing  Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] single crystal from the liquid phase of  Bi[.sub]2.4[/]Sr[.sub]1.5[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]1.8[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] by the TSFZ method. They reported that the  single crystal grew along the a-axis and had the same  composition as the feed prepared through the solid-state  reaction within experimental error.    In this work we have grown the  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] (hereafter, Bi(2212)) single crystal by the  TSFZ method and investigated the structural and electromagnetic  properties of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and the  grown single crystal.  <H5>  2. Crystal Growth </H5>   The feed and the solvent (act as a liquid phase from which  the single crystal grows) were prepared through the solid-state  reaction using powders of Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  CaCO[.sub]3[/] and CuO as starting materials. The starting  materials were mixed in the nominal compositions of  Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] for feed and  Bi[.sub]2.4[/]Sr[.sub]1.5[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]1.8[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] for solvent, and calcined in air at 810C  for 12 h. The calcined materials were pulverized and pressed  into rods of 8mm diameter and 100mm length under a pressure of  20 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. Then the feed rods were sintered in air  at 850C for 62 h with intermediate grinding, and the  solvent rods were sintered under the same conditions for 12 h.    The feed, solvent and seed were arranged in an infrared  radiation furnace with double halogen lamps and ellipsoidal  mirrors (NEC, SC-35HD) as shown in Figure 2. The infrared  radiation from halogen lamps is focused by ellipsoidal mirrors  and melts the solvent located at the focal point of the mirrors.  The feed, solvent and seed are shifted synchronously downward  slowly during the crystal growth. Then, the feed composition is  precipitated at position I[.sub]2[/] as much as dissolved at  I[.sub]1[/] while keeping the liquid composition unchanged.  The details of the crystal growth can be found  elsewhere.[.sup]5,8[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-69A>      Figure 2. Schematic representation of the configuration of seed, solvent and feed in an infrared radiation furnace. The </FIG>     A part of liquid phase may be sucked up into the feed by  capillary force if a porous feed is used. In such a case the  feed should be shifted downward additionally in order to supply  sufficient liquid for the crystal growth. But this induces the  change of the liquid composition and an undesirable secondary  phase may be grown as explained in the introduction. So, we  first prepared a dense feed by performing the first-scan at a  high rate of 8mm/h as shown in Figure 2(a). The first-scanned  feed consisted of very small single crystal. The density of the  sintered and first-scanned feed was about 45% and  90% of the  theoretical value of Bi(2212) phase respectively.    The first-scanned feed was used as a feed for the  second-scan  (single crystal growth). The amount of solvent was 1.5 g and 0.5  g for the first- and second-scans respectively. The feed and  seed were rotated in opposite directions at a rate of 13 rpm  during each scan in order to homogenize the molten zone. The  crystal growth was carried out for 3-4 days at a rate of  0.5mm/h, and we obtained crystal boule of _P_ = 6-7mm and l =  35-40mm as shown in Figure 3(a). However, the crystal boule is  not a single crystal as a whole, but consisted of many single  crystals. Figure 3(b) shows the single crystals separated from  the crystal boule with a wire cutter and a knife. Single  crystals were easily cleaved along the c-axis due to the weak  bonding between double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers. The well  developed surface in Figure 3(b) is c-plane. Moreover, we could  also easily distinguish between the a- and b-axis because  Bi(2212) crystal is well known to grow along the a-axis. The  density of the single crystal was above 95% of the  theoretical  value.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-70A>      Figure 3. Photographs of (a) the crystal boule grown by TSFZ method and (b) single crystals separated from the crystal </FIG>   <H5>  3. Structural Properties </H5>   Powder XRD patterns of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed  and grown crystals were observed using CuK_a_ line as an  incident radiation. We have measured the XRD pattern of the  grown crystal after powdering it in order to compare it with  those of feeds and to check whether impurity phases are involved  or not. Figure 4 confirms that most of the sintered feed and the  grown crystal consisted of Bi(2212) phase, although very tiny  peaks of Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/]  O[.sub]6+[/] (hereafter, Bi(2201)) phase are observed  around 22 and 26 for the crystal samples. However,  Bi(2201) phase and  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/]  (x-1) phase are distinctly observed in the first-scanned feed  grown at a high rate of 8mm/h. This tendency is consistent with  the result of Kubo et al.[.sup]8[/] They reported that the  volume fraction of Bi(2201) phase decreased with decreasing the  crystal growth rate.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-70B>      Figure 4. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystal. </FIG>     The  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/]  (X-1) phase, which was first observed by Ikeda et  al.,[.sup]9[/] and identified by Sato et al.,[.sup]10[/]  appears in a sample annealed in nitrogen or below 700C in  air, namely, in an oxygen-deficient condition. Hence, it is  considered that the oxygen content in the first-scanned feed is  lower than that in the sintered feed or grown crystal. The peak  positions of Bi(2212) phase in each specimen are nearly the  same, suggesting that the compositions of the grown crystal is  nearly the same as that of the feeds.    We have observed the backscattered Laue diffraction pattern  for the grown single crystal using continuous CuK_a_ line as an  incident radiation. As shown in Figure 5, the Laue diffraction  pattern consists of layered spots due to the layered structure  of the crystal along the c-axis.[.sup]11,12[/] However, we  could observe no Laue diffraction pattern with the incident  radiation along the a- or b-axis.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-70C>      Figure 5. Laue X-ray backscattering photograph of the grown single crystal taken with an incident beam parallel to the </FIG>     Figure 6 shows the high resolution electron microscope image  of the grown single crystal taken with an incident beam along  the a-axis. The whitish spots represent the oxygen atoms or the  vacancy. The large dark spots just upper and below the whitish  lines along the b-axis correspond to the Bi atoms. Double  BiO[.sub]2[/] layers repeat along the c-axis with a period of  about 30 Angstroms. Five less dark dotted lines, corresponding  to the Sr, Ca and Cu atoms, also can be observed between double  BiO[.sub]2[/] layers, which confirms that the grown single  crystal is a Bi(2212) phase.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-71A>      Figure 6. High resolution electron microscope image of the single crystal viewed along the a-axis. </FIG>     Figure 6 shows that the double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers are  modulated into the Bi rich and Bi deficient regions. The dark  region, Bi rich region, and less dark region, Bi deficient  region, in double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers are repeated along the  b-axis which induce a superstructure along this direction. The  superstructure has a period of 10 atomic distance for the  majority part, but a period of 9 atomic distance for another  part in Figure 6, this implies that the single crystal has an  incommensurate superstructure[.sup]13-15[/] along the b-axis  with a period of about 4.8a. Moreover, the atomic layers of Sr,  Ca and Cu are also modulated into the honeycomb pattern due to  the effect of the modulation of double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers.    The superstructure along the b-axis can be observed more  distinctly in the electron diffraction pattern. Figure 7 shows  the electron diffraction pattern of the single crystal taken  with an incident beam along the a- and c-axis. The period of the  principal diffraction spots along the b-axis is nearly the same  as that along the a-axis suggesting that the averaged atomic  distances along the a- and b-axis are nearly the same. However,  there are also minor diffraction spots along the b-axis with a  period of about 1/5 of the principal period. The period of the  real lattice is inversely proportional to that of the  diffraction pattern because the diffraction pattern is  represented in reciprocal lattice space. Therefore Figure 7(a)  confirms that Bi(2212) phase has a superstructure along the  b-axis with a period of about 5a which is consistent with the  result of high resolution image. The superstructure along the  b-axis can also be observed in Figure 7(b) taken with an  incident beam along the a-axis. Figure 7(b) shows that the  lattice parameter along the c-axis is about 6a.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-71B>      Figure 7. Electron diffraction pattern of the single crystal with an incident beam along (a) the c- and (b) </FIG>   <H5>   4. Electromagnetic Properties </H5>   The dc magnetization measurements were carried out using a  Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Figure 8 shows the field  cooled magnetization curves for the samples of sintered feed,  first-scanned feed and the grown crystal taken at a field of 10  G. As for the crystal, electromagnetic properties were measured  after air annealing. The crystal was heat treated at 840C  for 30 min. and cooled to 400C at a rate of 12C/h,  then furnace cooled below 200C. The magnetic field was  applied parallel to the c-axis for the crystal.  T[.sub]c[/](onset)s for the sintered and first-scanned feed  are nearly the same. However, the transition for the  first-scanned feed is broader than that for the sintered feed,  presumably because of the mixed secondary phases, such as,  Bi(2212) and  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/]  (x-1). The single crystal specimen shows not only higher  T[.sub]c[/](onset) of 84 K but also narrower transitions,  _D_T[.sub]c[/] (10-90%) of about 4.5 K, as compared to the  feeds suggesting that the grown crystal is more homogeneous than  the feeds.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-72A>      Figure 8. Field cooled superconducting transitions of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and crystal taken using 10 G </FIG>     Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for  each specimen. Electrical resistivity was measured using the  four-probe method with a current of 1-2 mA. Current was along  the a-axis for the single crystal. Each specimen shows metallic  resistivity behavior in the normal state. T[.sub]c[/](zero)  increases with processing, from the sintered feed to the single  crystal. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s for the sintered feed,  first-scanned feed and single crystal are about 45 K, 58 K and  83 K respectively. In case of the magnetization vs. temperature  relation, the superconducting transition of the first-scanned  feed is broader as compared to that of the sintered feed as  shown in Figure 8, although the T[.sub]c[/](onset) for the  first-scanned feed is nearly the same as that for the sintered  feed. However, it is considered that the first-scanned feed  shows not only higher T[.sub]c[/](zero) but also narrower  _D_T[.sub]c[/] compared to that of the sintered feed in  resistivity measurements since the density of the first-scanned  feed is about two times of that of the sintered feed, so that  the superconducting path is well connected in the first-scanned  feed. The resistivity of the first-scanned feed is larger than  that of the sintered feed because of the presence of mixed  secondary phases of Bi(2201) and  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/]  (x-1) phase.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-72B>      Figure 9. Temperature dependence of the resistivity for the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and single crystal. The </FIG>     The temperature dependence of resistivity along the a-, b-  and c-axis of the grown single crystal is shown in Figure 10.  The resistivity curves in CuO[.sub]2[/] plane show metallic  behavior in the normal state while that along the c-axis makes a  small peak around T[.sub]c[/].   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-73A>      Figure 10. Temperature dependence of the resistivity along the a-, b- and c-axis of the single crystal. The dimension of </FIG>     Although _r_[.sub]a[/] and _r_[.sub]b[/] are well known  to show metallic behavior in the normal state, _r_[.sub]c[/]  is controversial. Martin et al.[.sup]16[/] reported the  semiconductor like _r_[.sub]c[/] with  _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 1.5 x 10[.sup]5[/], but  Yasuda et al.[.sup]17[/] obtained metal like _r_[.sub]c[/]  with _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]ab[/] - 500 which is  consistent with our results. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s along the a-,  b- and c-axis have nearly the same value of 83 K. Anisotropic  ratio of _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]ab[/] for Bi(2212) is much  larger than that for YBCO phase[.sup]18[/] suggesting the  two-dimensionality is more evident in the Bi(2212) phase.  _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] and  _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] values are about 1.67 and 250  in this experiment, but Martin et al. had obtained different  results with _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 0.5 and  _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 1.5 x 10[.sup]5[/]. It is  considered that the difference may come from, (i) although  Martin et al. had measured the resistivity anisotropy for  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2.2[/]Ca[.sub]0.8[/]Cu.O[.sub]8+[/]  single crystal,  Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu.O[.sub]8+[/]  single crystal has been used as a specimen in the present  measurement, and (ii) Martin et al. had measured the resistivity  by Montgomery method,[.sup]19,20[/] but we have measured by  conventional four-probe method in our experiment.  <H5>  5. Summary </H5>   We have grown  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] single crystals in air by the travelling  solvent floating zone method through twice scanning process. The  density of the specimen increases with processing from the  sintered feed to the grown single crystal. Most of the sintered  feed and the grown crystal consist of  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/]  O[.sub]8+[/] phase, but the first-scanned feed grown at a  high rate of 8mm/h involves  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/]O[.sub]6+[/]  and  Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/]  (x-1) phases as minor phases. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s of the  sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystal are about 45  K, 58 K and 83 K respectively. The susceptibility and  resistivity measurement show that the single crystal not only  higher has superconducting transition temperature but also  narrower transition width suggesting that the grown single  crystal is more homogeneous as compared with the feeds. [as  published] The high resolution electron microscope image and  electron diffraction pattern show the single crystal has an  incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis with a period of  about 4.8a. The resistivity anisotropy of  _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] is about 250 which is larger  than that of YBCO phase suggesting that the two dimensionality  is more evident in Bi(2212) phase.

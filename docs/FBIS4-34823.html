			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Luis Felipe Duchicela, National Secretary </F> for Indian Affairs and Ethnic Minorities, in Guayaquil; date not  given: "Above the Differences"]    [Text] Duchicela intends to seek Indian unity. "I have good  friends within the Indian leadership, such as Luis Macas,  Bolivar Tapuy, and Ampam Karakras," the new government official  declared.    Guayaquil -- "The fact that we are descendants of royalty  was  not the reason the government sought us out," Luis Felipe  Duchicela Shyri XXVIII, the recently appointed National  Secretary of Indian Affairs and Ethnic Minorities, told HOY as  he gave our newspaper a detailed explanation of the policy he  proposes to follow as head of that secretariat.    "I shall carry out a policy that is not linked to any  political sector, religious or political," he said. "I shall  seek the welfare of the Indian sector and of the nation in  general. My policy will be to work hard in behalf of the Indian  population, and to coordinate projects and efforts with the  other cabinet ministries and governmental and nongovernmental  institutions -- such as foundations -- with a view to  implementing this program in the Indian sector."    He emphasized that his secretariat will make certain that  the  resources allocated by the government for projects in the Indian  sector will actually reach those who most need them.    "At the same time," he added, "we shall succeed in  strengthening our nation's credibility in the eyes of the  international institutions that provide financing for social and  economic development."    The interview was conducted as follows:    [HOY] Do you acknowledge that there is disunity in the  Indian  sector?    [Duchicela] Definitely. That is precisely why the guiding  principle of the Secretariat will be to avoid politicization or  capture by this or that political movement, and instead to  remain above politics and above the doctrines that the various  religious sects are imposing on the Indian population.    [HOY] How can the unity of the Indian sector be achieved?    [Duchicela] That will be our principal objective. We shall  propose the following to the Indian organizations: Let us sit  down and talk, and let us identify those areas in which we can  get to work immediately.    [HOY] But will some sectors say "no" to you?    [Duchicela] It is only natural that a problem as complex as  the Indian problem will involve some areas in which we shall  initially be unable to reach an agreement. I believe, however,  that President Duran Ballen definitely wants to make this  secretariat function efficiently, and that above all else he is  seeking unity and positive results.    [HOY] Do you believe the government has the political will  to  implement these changes that you are proposing?    [Duchicela] I believe so. The government has successfully  established a policy of macroeconomic stabilization, and I  believe it is prepared at this time to step in with a strong  plan and program in the social area.    [HOY] Why have these concrete measures been taken in the  Indian sector?    [Duchicela] This secretariat was created precisely in order  to avoid a situation in which some organization or other would  have to take de facto measures because no one had paid any  attention to the Indians or listened to them. With the creation  of this secretariat, we shall have sufficient time to take such  measures.    [HOY] Many have expressed the opinion that you were  appointed  to carry out a symbolic social policy for the government. What  is your opinion in this regard?    [Duchicela] I believe these interpretations are not correct.    [HOY] There has been speculation concerning the reasons why  the government chose someone such as yourself who is not  necessarily active in the Indian sector. What is your response?    [Duchicela] Because of the disunity within the Indian  community, the government had great difficulty finding someone  who could remain above all this; hence my appointment.    [HOY] But why Luis Felipe Duchicela? Why not someone fron a  tribe, from the Conaie [National Commission for Indian Affairs],  or from the Cofanes?    [Duchicela] The Indian problem cannot be managed efficiently  at the governmental level by someone who is not equipped with  the administrative and technical tools used in the areas of  finance, human resources, and systems. Why is this so? Because a  secretariat is an executive entity. We will be coordinating  projects. As we go forward, we will be interested in getting  results rather than in making speeches.    [HOY] But don't we need someone who understands the reality  of Indian life?    [Duchicela] Of course we do. In that connection I believe  the  press has not been very accurate, perhaps because they have not  been informed about my career and do not know about it.    [HOY] Haven't some people said that you sought this  appointment in order to focus attention on your royal ancestry?    [Duchicela] Although it is true that we are very proud of  our  ancestry, we are prouder of our Indian roots and our culture  than of being "noble," because we are modern persons. We have  never proposed that we be conceded anything, or granted  anything, merely because we are descendants of the ancient  Shyris. This is because we have earned everything we possess  through our own efforts. My grandfather was an Indian who  emigrated from Caccha to Guayaquil -- as hundreds of Indians did  -- and I had the good fortune to excel intellectually and to  progress. As a result, I was the first Ecuadoran to be hired as  an attorney by Chiquita Brands in Ecuador; in its 60 years of  existence, all of the company's attorneys had been gringos. We  must give the community something in return for the progress  that we have made as professionals; that is the way we can show  how we feel and give something in return. The fact that we are  descendants of royalty was not the reason the government sought  us out.    [HOY] Some columnists have wondered how this secretariat  could possibly be entrusted to someone who among other things  lives in a residential district of Guayaquil such as Urdesa.  What is your interpretation of this evaluation?    [Duchicela] This is one of the mental chains that has to be  broken. The columnist in question is saying that this post must  be given to an Indian who was born and raised in the Sierra. But  what does this mean? Does it mean that we Indians who after one  or two generations have been able to get an education, rise to  another level, and excel in the world of the white mestizos have  ceased to be Indians? This is precisely what we wish to combat.    [HOY] Have you encountered any resistance from the Indian  sector?    [Duchicela] No. I do not think so. I have not heard of any.  What Conaie said was that they opposed the action because the  secretariat would be just one more bureaucratic jurisdiction and  would prove to be an obstacle to communication with the  government. I say that is not what is going to happen.    [HOY] Haven't some people said that you are an unknown in  the  Indian movement?    [Duchicela] Although it is true that I have lived these past  11 years in Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras, I have always kept  in close touch with our community of Caccha in Chimborazo.    [HOY] What was your background before the appointment that  you are pointing to with pride?    [Duchicela] During my university years, instead of going to  parties or soccer matches I went to the Indian communities,  where I made many friends among the peasant leaders of that  time. Some of them are top leaders today, such as Luis Macas,  who has been my friend since we were fellow students at the  university; Bolivar Tapuy, who is deputy for Napo; Anpam  Carakras; Sharine Shiguango, who has been named to a post in the  Ministry of Social Welfare; and others. We worked together with  them, and in those days I came to know the Indian reality. My  degree thesis dealt with the reality of the Indian peasants of  the Sierra and involved a study of the various forms of material  development in the sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Moldavia Enters CIS Amid </F> Screams From Opposition"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Moldavia [Moldova] has  entered the CIS amid screams from the opposition about the loss  of independence and a new form of imperial oppression. But the  opposition can hardly now exert influence on the decisions  adopted by the ruling Agrarian majority. Especially since  everyone is aware that the people who are screaming most loudly  about the loss of the republic's independence are those who are  least interested in it. They are mainly people who favor  unification with Romania and who regard Moldavia's joining the  CIS as another major obstacle to realizing their secret dream.    However, the question of the CIS should not be viewed solely  in black and white. It is far more complex. Among its  opponents are also people who are not dying to join Romania, but  who are afraid that a powerful country like Russia will dictate  its political and economic will and turn Moldavia into a  satellite. "That is the mentality of small countries," I was  told by economist A. Muravskiy, an Agrarian deputy. "They  differ from large countries in their pathological sensitivity to  any encroachment on their rights."    The so-called "Westerners," seeking a panacea to all ills in  the opposite direction to the east, also take a suspicious view  of the CIS. But many economists believe that the Republic will  be unable to break into the Western market in the near future.  For instance, during the first two months of the year imports  from the wider world were quadruple the amount of exports.  Moreover, the bulk of the deliveries were paid for in hard  currency.    Paradoxically enough, it is easier for Moldavia to get  closer  to the West via the eastern market. Experts think that Western  investors regard it as a kind of bridge in that direction. So,  however you look at it, the CIS may be a case of bleak or  longed-for necessity, but necessity nonetheless.    Based on the results of the first two months of the year  Moldavia's foreign trade turnover with CIS countries totaled  around 75 percent, with Russia remaining the main player. It  accounts for almost 62 percent, followed by Ukraine (8.5  percent) and Belorussia [Belarus] (2.3 percent). But here too  the balance of trade is by no means in Moldavia's favor.  Imports exceed exports by 137 million leu, of which gas  shipments from the Russian Federation make up the lion's share.    Joining the CIS means hope for Moldavia -- according to the  corresponding article of the treaty -- of freer movement of  goods, services, money, and manpower, coordinated money-credit  and tax policy, and more acceptable customs duties....    However, what is for some people a long-awaited and for  others an unwanted decision will not per se instantaneously ease  the situation. That is already clear to even the staunchest  supporters of the Commonwealth -- people who have gotten over  the period of naive romanticism, when it was thought that all  that was needed was to sign the treaty and the economic wheel  would turn toward stabilization. The political train has gone a  long way, crushing the old economy. Time will tell whether it  has gone forward or backward, but the fact that different  realities have taken shape is indisputable. Just as something  else is also obvious: A new economy has not so far emerged to  go with them. At the moment losses are being calculated.  Moldavia has been left without an industry. Whereas a few  years ago it accounted for 67 percent of the budget, last year  the figure was only 9.3 percent. And the slump has not stopped.  Orientation on the agro-industrial complex alone is depriving  the republic of any hope of ranking as a developed country.  Even the CIS itself still looks pretty vague and unsteady. So  it will hardly prove possible rapidly to restore the severed  ties. And it is the loss of these ties that Moldavian Premier  A. Sangheli sees as one of the main reasons for the current  crisis, added to the vast material losses that the Republic  sustained owing to its refusal to ratify the treaty in the first  place. This refusal not only cost Moldavia a large sum of  money, but also brought about the early resignation of the  former corps of deputies and the government. The election  winners have come to power; and rapidly signed the treaty. The  first step has been taken. It is still hard to say whether they  have won or had victory thrust upon them, although a policy of  interest and compromise does seem to be replacing the policy of  confrontation in Moldavia. However, it is too early to say  whether this is the end of the story. There is probably more to  come.</p>

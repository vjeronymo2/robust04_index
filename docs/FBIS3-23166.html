			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] London AL-WASAT in Arabic in its 21-27  February issue carries on pages 10-14 an approximately 3,500  word report on visits made by its correspondent in Yemen to "the  prisons of Aden, Abyan, and Lahij early December last year where  he interviewed several detainees accused of carrying out several  explosions in the economic capital of Yemen in 1992, of  assassinating officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party, and  attacking others over the past three years." Report also  mentions that AL-WASAT interviewed Jamal Najib Muhammad  al-Nahdi, the main defendant in these explosions "in an Arab  capital, during which he refused to be photographed" and after  receiving assurances that "the interview will be published at  least two weeks later to give him time to go to another place."    The report says that al-Nahdi, age 22, was "one of the  hundreds of Arabs who had joined an organization called  al-Qa'idah [the base] to form a specialized and well-trained  group of Arab mujahdin in Afghanistan in mid-1980. The report  also says that al-Nahdi said he carried out three operations  against the U.S. forces and boasted that he "confronted the YSP  and challenged the United States." He admitted that he had  fired "missiles on its forces at Aden airport, and detonated one  of its positions in one of the city's hotels while the U.S.  forces were on their way to Somalia late 1992." Later on,  al-Nahdi says that he "is proud that he had foiled a U.S. scheme  to use Aden as a rear base in its military operations in the  region, Somalia, and elsewhere." He denies YSP officials'  accusations of the "existence of an international Jihad  organization and that he is one of the leaders of a major  organization in Yemen."    Elaborating on the first attack against the U.S. forces in  Aden, al-Nahdi says: "We wanted to attack the YSP, but we  hesitated because we feared there would be innocent people and  Muslims among the losses. When the Americans came to Aden, we  saw that this was a good opportunity. This was in November  1992. We learned from officials in the government that the YSP  intended to permit the establishment of a U.S. base,  specifically on Abyan coast." He later says "We videotaped  everything, including the U.S. installations in the airport and  the tape was later taken by intelligence head 'Adnan al-Bid, the  son of 'Ali Salim al-Bid." Al-Nahdi affirms that "the idea of  striking at the Americans in Aden was my idea. There was no  organization behind us. Everything was planned and carried out  in a period of not more than five days." After speaking about  how he obtained weapons, al-Nahdi says that "the first operation  was successful as the two missiles I and Wahib 'Abd-al-Salam  fired hit their targets."    According to al-Nahdi, the second operation was "to strike  at  the espionage headquarters the Americans had established in the  Golden Coast Hotel." Al-Nahdi admits "he had placed a big bomb  in the electricity room on the fourth floor below the U.S.  espionage room. The explosion of the bomb was sufficient to  destroy a major part of that floor as well as part of the fifth  floor. The explosion killed a Yemeni hotel worker, an Austrian  tourist, and others."    Speaking about the third operation, al-Nahdi says "it was  intended to scare as many U.S. soldiers as possible in the Aden  Hotel yard." He added "We planted a time bomb that was set to  explode at the time they always return to the hotel. But, God  wished it otherwise. They were late to arrive that night" and  that having noticed this, he ran "to defuse the bomb and change  the time for it to go off. But, it exploded and I was wounded."  He then says that he was arrested and taken to hospital.</p>

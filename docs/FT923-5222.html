			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / New UK share indices to join existing benchmarks PLANS for new UK stock market indices have been prepared by a working party including representatives of the FT, the London Stock Exchange, the actuarial profession and market participants. The new indices would complement the FT-SE 100 index and the FT-Actuaries All-Share index, which are expected to remain the UK market's principal real-time index and the main end-of-day performance benchmark, respectively. The new indices would cast more light on the performance of the market, particularly of second-rank UK companies. They would also allow investors to monitor the performance of individual industry sectors minute-by-minute during the day. A broad measure of agreement on the plans has been reached, but some details remain to be settled. A formal announcement of the plans is expected in the autumn. Among the proposed new indices are: The FT-SE Mid 250, covering the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100 in size. This would be a real-time index that would contain companies with market capitalisations of roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn. These are typically substantial national companies, rather than the UK-based international companies that make up most of the FT-SE 100. FT-SE Actuaries 350 Industry Baskets, based on the top 350 UK shares (the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE Mid 250). Industry classifications would be based on the system used in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. The industry baskets would be calculated in real time. The indices have been planned in part to allow for the creation of derivative instruments, such as futures and options. In practice, these are likely to be based on the FT-SE Mid 250 and the more important industry baskets. Mr Richard Lambert, editor of the FT, said yesterday: 'The new indices will be part of a coherent family jointly sponsored by the FT, the London Stock Exchange, and the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. 'We have co-operated closely in the past, and are pleased that we will shortly be in a position to strengthen and extend the index coverage of the UK market. 'These arrangements will also enhance the role of the All-Share index, the principal benchmark of UK portfolio performance.'</p>

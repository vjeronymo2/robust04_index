			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAD OF SORROW, HEAD OF THOUGHT  </P> <P> You would think that no one  </P> <P> had the right to so much  </P> <P> distance and calm.  </P> <P> And yet how often do we see,  </P> <P> clouded and still,  </P> <P> the face of someone gone  </P> <P> out of himself  </P> <P> into stone or water?  </P> <P> The rider in the train,  </P> <P> escaped into the glass fields;  </P> <P> the watcher in the garden,  </P> <P> changed once to a leaf,  </P> <P> now to the cold light on a  </P> <P> pond.  </P> <P> Face of the storm, we say,  </P> <P> we have faced you,  </P> <P> heard you howling within,  </P> <P> quelling the atoms  </P> <P> of a bruised, exacting heart  </P> <P> . . .  </P> <P> She, who out of the tempest,  </P> <P> came to this calm,  </P> <P> gazing as if from a distance  </P> <P> made equally of granite and  </P> <P> cloud.  </P> <P> 1985  </P> <P> From "New Poems: 1980-1988" (Story Line Press: $9.95 paperback; 96 pp.;  0-934257-45-0).

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Sport: Courses with designs on the big players - Golf POINT THE bonnet of your car westwards and drive for a half hour from central London and you will arrive at some of the best golfing territory in the world. It is a finger of land rich in pine and birch trees and heather with a sandy subsoil that absorbs moisture as quickly as it falls. Here are the Wentworth and Sunningdale golf courses, among others, courses that are so close to one another it has long been an ambition of mine to take one club and as many balls as are necessary and play from the clubhouse of one to the clubhouse of the other. Or, to put it another way, to tee off in Sandy Lyle's backgarden on the Wentworth estate and hole out in Nick Faldo's front garden adjoining Sunningdale. Drive a few miles further west and a few miles further south and you will reach Wisley golf club, one of the most interesting of the golf courses being built in England. Wisley is 24 miles from the centre of London. To the south of the 225-acre property runs the river Wey. To the north stands the church of Wisley. To the west is National Trust property and to the east the Royal Horticultural Society gardens. When it opens in mid August it will have three loops of nine holes designed by Bobby Trent Jones, the son of the legendary Robert Trent Jones. There will be 750 members and no visiting societies. To describe the clubhouse as lavish would be typical British understatement. Costing Pounds 4m, it has handcut tiles on its roof, an open fireplace, an entrance hall in which Persian rugs will cover a limestone flagged floor and, elsewhere, woven carpets from Turkey and specially designed and made chairs. In an area that is known for its heathland courses, Wisley will be something of a contrast. Walk around it and the overriding impression is of an American course, mounded, shaped and sculpted to the last millimetre at a cost of more than Pounds 5m. There is water on more holes than not - six lakes have been created and two were there before work started. There are 118 bunkers, 95 tees and 800 sprinkler heads. The enormous practice ground will have four target greens. The most significant fact about Wisley, however, is the way it is being financed. Marlin Estates, a joint venture between the Arlington Group, British Aerospace's property subsidiary, and the Mannai Group, a concern with interests in real estate and leisure in Europe and the US, are raising the estimated Pounds 16.7m from the sale of shares in the golf club. This is the first time this has happened in Britain, though it is commonplace in other parts of the world. The first 100 shares cost Pounds 26,275 each and were oversubscribed. Later this month, the latest tranche of shares will come on the market. The price will be in excess of the last issue, which were Pounds 37,330 each. Marlin are gambling on recouping their investment from the sale of shares. It may be they will sustain an initial loss if the membership is not fully subscribed when the course opens in three months. 'We have sold 333 of our 750 shares,' Philip Gay, WGC's managing director, said last week. 'Although we are offering shares in the club the money is not being used to build the club. If I don't sell another share the club will still be finished as per specification and handed over to the members in August. They will own the freehold and everything down to the last teacup and oil can. The income from the sale of shares is in a loan repayment deposit account. I cannot touch it until I have handed over the course to the members.' A further 60 miles west of Wisley is the new Castle Combe golf club in the idyllically pretty village of that name in Wiltshire. The site, within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, contains a river, hundreds of oak, beech and ash trees, the earthwork remains of a 12th century motte and bailey castle and much more besides. You might have caught a glimpse of it in the film Dr Doolittle, which was made in Castle Combe. 'Many sites become available for golf courses but few have the natural beauty and ambience of Castle Combe' says Peter Alliss, the TV golf commentator, whose company has designed the course. 'Without doubt it should become one of the five best inland courses in the UK.' Clive Clark, the best of the new British course architects and Alliss's partner, has laid out the 6,200-yard course with a sympathetic eye to the riches of the surrounding environment. Traditionalist that I am, I am not sure I like the huge, 100-yard-long waste bunker from tee to green of one short hole. I question, too whether it is essential to have three lakes by the side of the 18th green. Why does almost every finishing hole on every new course have to have water on it? Castle Combe differs from Wisley in that it is a course for members. At 6,200 yards it is too short for a full-blown professional championship and there are no plans to stage championships on it. It is similar to Wisley in the way it is raising the estimated Pounds 8.5m it cost by offering shares. The first 55 will go on sale later this month at Pounds 15,000 each. These days there is a growing backlash against the number of applications for golf courses around the country. Last week, English Heritage, the Government's adviser on historic buildings and landscapes, warned that the golf boom could damage historic landscapes that have taken centuries to create. Public inquiries are to be held on proposed golf courses at Burleigh on the Hill in Rutland and Warwick Castle. Wisley and Castle Combe have avoided such controversies. They are trailblazers in their own ways, multimillion pound ventures that are as different from existing golf clubs as a hickory shafted mashie is from a graphite shafted iron. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for them.</p>

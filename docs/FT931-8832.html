			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Switzerland comes back into favour - William Cochrane reviews European equity turnover in January European bourses approached the tradition of a new year rally somewhat tentatively this year, with share price declines in France and Germany only barely offset by gains in the UK and Italy. Where there were gains, traders rather than investors seemed in the ascendant, and the effect on equity market activity was generally muted. January's bourse turnover figures, in aggregate, show a rise of 8 per cent over December, itself only 2.8 per cent lower than in the preceding month. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the figures, notes that the biggest volume gainer in January was Switzerland, which rose by 70 per cent on the month, back up to a level not seen since early 1990. Switzerland produced a barely average advance on the month, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, which had it 0.66 per cent higher over the four weeks to January 29, against a rise of 0.63 per cent for Europe as a whole. However, says Mr Cornish, it was the best performer in 1992, a performance based on a strong economy and currency and a certain independence from the strains within the ERM, and foreign investors were on feed. 'Swiss share volumes on SEAQ International (London's screen-based trading system for foreign stocks) rose by 46 per cent,' he says, 'indicating that non-Swiss investors were also busy.' Belgium had a good month, too, with a gain in turnover of 45 per cent reflecting a rise of 5.3 per cent on the month in local currency terms. The country had suffered from the stability of its own currency in the final quarter of 1992, says Mr Geoffrey Taylor of Dillon Read, but the underlying economic disciplines enabled Brussels to get its interest rates down very sharply around the year-end. This produced a lot of turnover in interest rate-sensitive stocks such as Electrabel; another utility, Tractebel, saw the placing of Petrofina's stake of around 2 1/2 per cent in mid-January inflate the turnover figures to some extent. The market also moved, says Mr Taylor, on the strength of the dollar and a strong performance in cyclicals such as Arbed, the Luxembourg steel company, Glaverbel, Solvay and Societe Generale de Belgique, whose major industrial holdings are in non-ferrous metals, steel and cement. Elsewhere, the Netherlands saw a gain of 17 per cent in response, says Mr Cornish, to the market's return to outperformance, with particular help for Royal Dutch from a 3 per cent rise in the crude oil price. The UK was up 10 per cent on the month as it reached new highs on the cut in base rates. Germany recovered by 11 per cent after a very weak December, but the attraction of the Frankfurt market to institutional investors has been realised this month, following the Bundesbank's cut in key interest rates on February 4.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                   Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse              Oct        Nov        Dec        Jan       US                    1992       1992       1992       1993   Dollars bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           47.56      43.93      43.35      62.75      1.89 France           108.08      92.39     120.72     106.66     19.58 Germany           98.85      92.20      82.80      91.67     56.97 Italy         17,112.00  24,248.80  14,210.72  13,852.04      9.25 Netherlands       14.00      11.70      12.50      14.60      8.07 Spain            687.70     619.31     790.00     653.20      5.72 Switzerland       11.78      11.60      13.10      22.30     15.00 UK                39.76      39.57      39.05      42.86     63.73  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

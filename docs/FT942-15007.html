			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: Catching a common code - What the Delta-Virgin link-up means for passengers Last week's tie-up between Delta of the US and the UK's Virgin Atlantic, the latest in a series of transatlantic deals, might lead some to conclude that a revolution in business travel is in the offing. It is not, say airline industry executives privately. The business of 'code sharing', the centrepiece of these deals, is largely to do with the financial health of the airlines and does little for passengers. It may even mean some people feeling misled about which airline they are flying. Code sharing allows airlines to book passengers on each others' flights. Code-sharing partnerships include British Airways and USAir, Dutch carrier KLM and US airline Northwest, and the triple alliance of Delta, Swissair and Singapore Airlines. One of the biggest yet, between United Airlines of the US and Germany's Lufthansa, is scheduled to start this year. In practice, code sharing means a passenger in Albuquerque, New Mexico, could ask the travel agent for a flight to London's Heathrow airport and be given a Delta ticket. That ticket will have a flight number beginning 'DL' and show that the flight goes via New York's JFK. The passenger might then fly Delta to New York and from there to London on Virgin. For the airlines, the advantage is clear. They can plug into each other's networks, claiming, for example, that they fly to destinations serviced by the partner's aircraft. They are able to advertise more destinations, and marketing is cheaper because costs can be shared within what is effectively a larger network. The risk for passengers is that they might book a flight with one airline and travel on another. 'It is something akin to false pretences if this is not made clear when the ticket is bought,' says an executive with an independent airline organisation. Virgin is at pains to say that its agreement with Delta is 'transparent' - that passengers will know exactly what is happening when they inquire about their flight. It points out that there are other aspects of the deal that benefit passengers more directly. Virgin will share Delta's JFK terminal so the connection is easier. Moreover, the airlines are linking frequent-flyer programmes, so mileage points can be earned on either. Similar co-operative arrangements are in place with the likes of Northwest and KLM, and BA and USAir. But it is possible to achieve them without code-sharing deals - as Virgin has done with British Midland and BA has with Cathay Pacific.</p>

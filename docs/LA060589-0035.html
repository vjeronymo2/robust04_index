			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: RAMONES' PUNK BRILLIANCE THRIVES ON LACK OF GROWTH  </P> <P> Can a performance be both perfunctory and truly great at the same time? This is  the question that arises when the Ramones -- a national treasure, an American  institution -- come to town each year to do another amazing-on-its-own-terms  show that's largely indistinguishable from the previous year. That they rarely  show signs of growth somehow doesn't diminish the historical brilliance of  their conceit.  </P> <P> The new album from punk's founding fathers, "Brain Drain," is one of the lesser  efforts of a 13-year recording career. Naturally, it was all but ignored during  the course of a typically relentless 75-minute show Friday at the Hollywood  Palladium that mostly reprised old classics, starting with a medley of  (speaking of American institutions) "Teenage Lobotomy" and "Psycho Therapy."  The only recent song of any import: the suitably catchy and morbidly  melancholic theme from the movie "Pet Sematary," the only memorable thing about  that inexplicably beloved motion picture.  </P> <P> As always, the band members looked like mimes girding themselves against a  wind, as if they'd rush forward and leap off the stage if the sold-out beehive  crowd's hot air didn't blow them back. Yet they're also as businesslike as ever  -- aggressive and indifferent, they are. Ramonesmania is still as senselessly  exhilarating as ever; at this late date, there remains no need to ask  gabba-gabba-why. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

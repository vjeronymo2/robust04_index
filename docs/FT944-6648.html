			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Left refuses to join move against Major Tory leftwingers yesterday ruled out teaming up with rightwing colleagues to pave the way for a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership. The move appeared to reduce the prospects of an attempt this year to topple the prime minister, and to leave the matter in the hands of the right. Leading rightwing figures behind attempts to raise by tomorrow the 34 signatures from Tory MPs needed to allow a challenge admitted at the weekend they were about 10 short of that number. The prospects of a contest looked to have diminished further when eight Tory Euro-sceptics defied government whips by abstaining on last night's crucial votes on the European Union finance bill. This means they will almost certainly forfeit the party whip and lose the right to add their names to those calling for a challenge. One young Euro-sceptic said before last night's vote that the chances of a leadership contest would be higher paradoxically if only two or three backbenchers rebelled. Yesterday those attempting to gather the 34 signatures were still not ruling out a challenge. But several Tory Eurosceptics made clear such a move would not have their support. One said: 'I wouldn't back a leadership challenge for the simple reason I don't want Kenneth Clarke (the chancellor) or Michael Heseltine (trade and industry secretary) as leader.' Another said: 'I have not been approached and I would have thought I would have been if talk about a leadership contest was serious.' He added that he would not back such a move if he was approached. Questioned on how leftwing dissidents had responded to overtures from the right seeking their backing for a leadership challenge, one leading leftwinger said: 'We are not going in with them. We have not given a positive answer to any overture.' The leftwinger said he had been approached three times about such an arrangement but the thought of joining forces with the rightwingers behind the move was 'anathema' to many on the left of the party. He suggested that the sort of arrangement proposed could be damaging to Mr Heseltine, who would be the preferred candidate of many leftwing dissidents if a challenge by a 'stalking horse' candidate forced Mr Major to step down. He said: 'The right have got to do it on their own.' Yesterday's developments came after Mr Heseltine ruled himself out as a challenger to Mr Major in an early morning radio interview. Asked if there were no circumstances in which he would stand in a leadership contest while Mr Major was prime minister, Mr Heseltine replied: 'Yes.' He added: 'I will have nothing to do with a conspiracy against the prime minister . . . I have made it clear I am a loyal member of John Major's cabinet. I expect to help him win the next general election and I have absolutely resolved in public and in private that I will support the prime minister through thick and thin.' Opinion among rightwingers on the likelihood of a challenge was mixed. One said the prospect was 'nil'. But another said he thought there would be a challenge. One former minister said he did not want a contest and 'the people agitating for one know that well enough so they haven't approached me'. But he said the atmosphere at Westminster was 'more lively' than it was immediately before the challenge to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister, launched by Sir Anthony Meyer in 1989. Another Tory Eurosceptic said he had been approached twice but had not given his support to attempts to force a challenge. Observer, Page 21</p>

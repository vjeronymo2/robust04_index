			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BEIRUT, MAIL GOES THROUGH -- AT $20 A LETTER;  </P> <P> LEBANON: TAXI DRIVERS BRAVE MINED ROADS, SNIPERS AND SHELLING TO DELIVER  LETTERS AND PACKAGES.  </P> <P> Domestic postage in Lebanon is the equivalent of three cents, but these days  desperate Lebanese are paying $20 to get a letter from West Beirut to East  Beirut.  </P> <P> With an inter-Christian war raging in the eastern sector, even the Lebanese  equivalent of Federal Express isn't working. Mined roads, snipers and outbreaks  of shelling have put a stop to the normal mail system.  </P> <P> But the Lebanese flair for finding a way around even mines and snipers took  only a short time to develop during the latest fighting.  </P> <P> Lebanon Taxi, in West Beirut, now offers a mail and grocery home-delivery  service to East Beirut. For $20, a driver will deliver a letter to the eastern  sector from worried family members in West Beirut. For an extra couple of  dollars you can send bread, bottled drinking water and fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> "At first I thought 10,000 pounds ($20) was terribly expensive," said one  Christian living in West Beirut. She had not had any news of her relatives in  the East Beirut quarter of Ashrafiyeh for two weeks after fighting broke out  last month.  </P> <P> "But when I got a letter back from them, I found it very cheap," she conceded.  </P> <P> Phone lines were ripped down by artillery, which have been fired at such close  range that few buildings remain intact in many areas.  </P> <P> When the Christian letter-sender heard the driver also would carry food, she  rushed to the nearest bakery to buy two large bags of the flat loaves of Arabic  bread that is basic to the Lebanese diet. From the vendor on the corner she  bought 30 pounds of eggplant, carrots, apples, bananas, oranges and tomatoes.  She topped off the package with bottled drinking water.  </P> <P> Within hours, the driver was back in West Beirut with a letter from her  relatives.  </P> <P> "There are tears in my eyes as I write this letter," the woman's cousin said.  "We aren't dying, but we're suffering greatly."  </P> <P> The cousin asked that her West Beirut relative telex her two daughters living  in London. "Tell them that I love them" was her only message.  </P> <P> "When the families see us coming with messages and food, the women start  crying," one of the taxi drivers said. "But inside their hearts, everyone is  crying."  </P> <P> The drivers, who are Muslims, know Beirut from the days before it was divided  into East and West. Few streets have name signs, so it is their expertise that  sees them through.  </P> <P> "If we are taking people across, like the press, we carry letters for free," a  driver explained. "It's a humanitarian gesture."  </P> <P> They admit they are risking their lives but believe that a good deed means "God  will repay us by keeping us safe."  </P></p>

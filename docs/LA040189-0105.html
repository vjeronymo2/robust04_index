			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP SEEKS TO FIGHT BANKS' 'REDLINING';  </P> <P> ASKS THAT MORE MONEY BE REINVESTED IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES  </P> <P> A coalition of community organizations has requested a meeting with federal  banking regulators and industry executives to discuss ways to persuade  California banks to provide more loans to minorities and increase the  availability of affordable housing.  </P> <P> The organization, called the Greenlining Coalition, asked Federal Reserve  Chairman Alan Greenspan and Robert F. Erburu, chairman of the Federal Reserve  Bank of San Francisco, to set a meeting within the next 30 days. The group  asked that the chief executives of the state's largest banks be asked to  attend.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the San Francisco Fed said Friday that the agency expects to  respond quickly to the letter. He also said that recent San Francisco Fed  studies have pointed out the pressing credit needs of some metropolitan areas  in the state with high minority populations.  </P> <P> The letter was dated Wednesday and said the group represents 16 organizations  for minorities, consumers and the homeless, including the Urban League, the  League of United Latin American Citizens and the San Francisco Black Chamber of  Commerce.  </P> <P> The group said it wants to discuss compliance with the federal Community  Reinvestment Act by the state's big banks.  </P> <P> The act requires financial institutions to provide loans and services to its  community without discrimination.  </P> <P> In addition, the group said big banks should help finance more affordable  housing, particularly for the homeless, preserve inner-city neighborhoods and  assist minority-owned financial institutions.  </P> <P> "Not one federal official has raised an outcry over the fact that blacks have  received less than half of 1% of the dollar value of recent bank loans," said  George Dean, president of the California Council of Urban Leagues.  </P> <P> The coalition also asked Federal Reserve officials to conduct random audits of  loan portfolios at major banks in the state to ensure that they are complying  with the CRA.  </P> <P> The letter cited remarks made by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) that all banks and  savings and loans "redline," a practice in which minority neighborhoods do not  receive a fair share of loans.  </P> <P> In testimony before a House committee on March 9, Stark said redlining is  essentially impossible to detect, and he criticized the effectiveness of  federal laws against the practice.  </P> <P> California's big banks have consistently denied that they discriminate in  lending. Many of the banks recently formed a consortium, under sponsorship of  the San Francisco Fed, to pool money and provide loans for developers of  low-cost housing in the state. The savings and loan industry has a similar  coalition.  </P></p>

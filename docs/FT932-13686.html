			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Leading Article: Private finance ONE OF the most intriguing elements of the chancellor's Autumn Statement was the announcement of a new drive to attract private finance for public services. Out went the notorious Ryrie rules which were supposed to assist in private financing but in practice threw up insuperable obstacles. In came new Treasury guidelines to allow the private sector to play a much greater role in return for genuinely assuming risk. Departments have organised seminars to attract proposals from the private sector for joint ventures. For all this effort, however, there has so far been little progress in attracting new funds for public projects. Yesterday's announcement of a change of rules in the National Health Service to encourage greater use of private finance is therefore welcome, if somewhat timid. NHS trusts and health authorities can now involve up to Pounds 10m of private finance in projects without Treasury approval, a 40-fold increase in the previous limit. In most cases, any new facilities created through such projects will be additional to existing health service plans, providing extra benefits for patients without an increase in the NHS budget. The immediate response of the opposition was to describe the move as 'privatisation' of the health service. This predictable, if depressing, reflex demonstrates nothing more than the paucity of thinking by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Aneurin Bevan's comprehensive and universal NHS, free at the point of use, is not altered by the private provision of health services. The role of the NHS as purchaser of health services for all its customers can be carried out whoever provides the services on the ground. Far from trimming to such criticism, ministers should be much more ambitious in attracting the private sector into the health service. A recent paper written for the Social Market Foundation by Mr David Willetts MP proposed six types of project which the private sector could provide for the benefit of NHS patients. These included the sort of energy-saving and equipment-leasing deals which yesterday's announcement will facilitate. But the paper also proposed using the private sector to build and manage specialist medical units, such as kidney dialysis units. It pointed out that more services could be bought in from private hospitals. And private healthcare companies could be used to provide a salaried family doctor service in London and other cities starved of primary care facilities. Joint ventures between the public and private sector should be much more than just off-balance-sheet financing, free from the constraints of the public sector borrowing requirement. The real benefits of private financing will come only if the private sector is allowed to assume more of both the risk and the management function, delivering value for money through innovative ways of providing public services.</p>

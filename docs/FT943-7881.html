			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Man in the News: Gaffes that could disable a climber - Michael Portillo In the UK Conservative party, it pays to look tough; Baroness Thatcher made a successful career out of it. Michael Portillo, Mrs Thatcher's intellectual heir, is no pushover either, as his frequent attacks on the European Union illustrate. But bashing foreigners is one thing; kicking the crutches from under the disabled is quite another, even for the standard bearer of the Tory right. Portillo, promoted from treasury chief secretary to employment secretary in John Major's July reshuffle, seems to have had no idea that his clumsy abolition of Britain's priority suppliers' scheme would cause a fuss. His reasoning was simple. The scheme, which allows companies employing mainly disabled people a second crack at government contracts to match lower tenders, was rarely used. In any case, the government's lawyers advised that it conflicted with an EU directive on public procurement that took effect in June. What is more, employers of disabled workers will keep their more important government subsidy of Pounds 10,000 per worker. David Hunt, Portillo's predecessor as employment secretary, has said that he took the decision to scrap the scheme before being replaced in the reshuffle. Portillo merely made the announcement. It all adds up to a pretty solid defence. But Portillo - dogged by demonstrators in wheelchairs on a visit to Leeds this week - looks not so much tough as heartless as he struggles to fend off the protests from organisations for the disabled. Why did he fail to ask the European Commission whether anything could be done to save the scheme before announcing its demise? Why was no attempt made to prepare public opinion before the announcement was made? And why did ministers fail to notice the impact of the directive on the scheme during talks between EU members in 1992? Portillo, who led the UK negotiating team, claims the civil service failed to alert him to the problem. The row will blow over. But it leaves Portillo looking politically inept, and adds to the question marks over his judgment that have been piling up since he achieved his current political prominence. There has been a series of gaffes this year. It was not a good idea to tell students at Southampton University that academic qualifications in other countries were worthless. The remark looked xenophobic, even to nationalistic Tories. It was an even worse idea to plan a party at London's Alexandra Palace, complete with a fireworks display, to celebrate 10 years in parliament. Portillo says the party was his constituency association's idea, but the episode reeks of self-aggrandisement, even to supporters. 'Maybe it wasn't Michael's fault, but it looked as if he was getting too big for his boots. I don't think it did him any good,' says a friendly right-wing Tory. At a broader political level, Portillo has been fighting a running battle against his party's grudging acceptance of Britain's place in Europe. In two interventions, he first ridiculed the idea that the UK may 'miss the bus' if it fails to take part in the next phase of EU integration, and then declared his opposition to a single currency. His remarks have kept the Euro-sceptic flag flying in the cabinet, and offered a rallying point for the third or so of Tory MPs who harbour suspicions about the European adventure. They have also angered the prime minister, who thought about sacking Portillo after his single currency comments, but settled for a qualified clarification instead. There is no doubt that Portillo has been damaged by all this controversy. Tory left-wingers whisper that he has been over-rated; that he has been promoted too fast; that he lacks the quality of gravitas without which no Tory can make it to the top. He is, they say, untested in a big spending department. The moment he takes charge of one (employment), the government is embroiled in an avoidable fiasco. Dismay is not confined to the left. Only a few months ago, up to 100 right-wing Tory MPs were said to be ready to back Portillo in a leadership battle against Major. Hard estimates are harder to come by now that the prime minister has strengthened his position, but right-wingers admit that his support has softened. Perhaps fortunately for Portillo, the prospect of a contest this year has evaporated, thanks to the Tories' dire but not disastrous performance in the local and European elections in the spring. So has Portillo peaked too early in his career? Most Thatcherites think not. They continue to believe that his time will come, mainly because he remains the only credible candidate of the right in any future leadership contest. Neither of the alternative candidates - home secretary Michael Howard and social services secretary Peter Lilley - has Portillo's ability to mobilise grassroots activists. For those who believe that the Conservatives can only retain power by recovering the radical, campaigning passion of the Thatcher years, there can be no other choice. 'Michael looks like a winner, and that puts him streets ahead of the rest of the right,' says a Tory centrist. Portillo has something else going for him, too. In a pragmatic party historically shy of ideas, he is one of the few leading members who is intellectually and politically self-confident enough to engage Tony Blair's reinvigorated Labour party in the battle of ideas. Almost alone among cabinet ministers, he has set out a coherent conservative philosophy, cleverly combining a passion for Thatcherite icons such as low taxation, sound money and individual responsibility with traditional Tory veneration for the Crown, parliament and the established church. He is not - yet - a conference darling, like Michael Heseltine, the consummate public performer. But he shares Lady Thatcher's dislike of fudge, and her willingness to attack on a broad front. He told an audience in Barcelona during an official visit: 'It has recently been argued that the free market is a jungle to be tamed by governments. It is at least as plausible to argue that governments are a jungle to be tamed by the free market.' That is the sort of thing that Tory activists like to hear. The greatest testimony to Portillo's continued importance as a symbol of the right is the prime minister's decision to give him a major department to run. But there is still hope in Downing Street that Portillo will overreach himself. There are plenty of temptations. The department's training budget, its involvement in the benefits system, and its responsibility for industrial tribunals invite attention from a politician committed to rolling back the frontiers of government. But it would be wrong to believe that Portillo is fervidly anxious to wield the knife. Friends say he has seen the elephant trap and is aware that any further rash actions would be dangerous. With an early leadership election off the immediate agenda, Portillo has a difficult hand to play if he is to keep himself in the public eye, but avoid further damaging controversy. It could be a long game, but if he had any doubts about the need to be more judicious, the disabled workers debacle will have dismissed them.</p>

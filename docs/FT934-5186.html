			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / People: News International Mike Ruda, deputy managing director of News International, has resigned as a director and left the company after nearly 25 years' service. Ruda, former group marketing director, is 63, and all the signs are that the parting was amicable. He will continue to be available for advice on advertising and marketing. Ruda has spent his entire newspaper career working for newspapers that Rupert Murdoch either owned or was to acquire; he started off at the Daily Herald from 1954, a Labour-supporting paper which eventually became the Sun. He joined Murdoch in January 1969 as advertisement manager when he acquired control of The News of the World. By 1974 he was advertisement director of News Group Newspapers; he joined the News International board in 1988 and became deputy managing director two years ago.</p>

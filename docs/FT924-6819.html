			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / PowerGen rises Pounds 1m after cost savings THE GOVERNMENT review of UK energy policy has raised questions over the operations of PowerGen, the UK's second largest generator, according to Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, who unveiled interim profits yesterday. It was unclear how the review would affect the electricity industry's operating environment, he said. It was also uncertain whether PowerGen would obtain authorisation for a new gas-fired powered station at Connah's Quay in Clwyd, which forms a large part of its future plans. The increase in gas power has been blamed for contributing to the coal industry crisis, and the government has been under pressure to curb its growth. Mr Wallis said the government was unlikely to overturn agreed projects. But PowerGen would maintain a cautious dividend policy until the future of the industry became clearer. Yesterday saw the dividend raised 9.8 per cent to 3.35p. PowerGen earned Pounds 98m in the six months to September 30, up from Pounds 97m. The increase was more marked at the operating level which excludes interest earnings from cash holdings. Here, PowerGen's earnings rose 24 per cent from Pounds 79m to Pounds 98m as interest fell from Pounds 18m to zero. The underlying increase was due entirely to cost savings, Mr Wallis said. Some 40 per cent of the staff at the time of privatisation in 1990 had gone, and productivity had improved by 28 per cent over 1991. Sales in the half year were fell 3 per cent, and PowerGen had lost some market share, mainly to nuclear power. PowerGen continued its heavy investment programme with outlays of Pounds 475m, and the period saw the start-up of its new Pounds 300m gas-fired plant at Killingholme on Humberside. The rate of spending will tail off in the second half. One of PowerGen's heavier costs is the high level of coal stocks, accumulated as a result of its long-term contracts with British Coal. These stand at 16m tonnes, compared with a need for 6m. Mr Wallis said PowerGen hoped to run these stocks down under the new contracts with British Coal next year. But there was a chance that the government might mandate higher stocks to boost coal demand. Lex, Page 24</p>

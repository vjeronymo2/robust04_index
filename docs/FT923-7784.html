			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Dieppe, a disaster beyond words: Fifty years ago this week, 20 journalists were allowed to accompany the Allied raid: one of the first big propaganda exercises of modern warfare. What they, in fact, saw was a tragic and costly fiasco LORD LOVAT, commanding officer of No. 4 Commando, was in expansive mood as he talked to his men on the eve of the Dieppe raid. 'They tell me the propaganda's terrific,' he told them. 'All our families will be glued to their radio sets when they hear the BBC announcement tomorrow morning.' Among the many preparations discussed at the London headquarters of Combined Operations in the early months of 1942, publicity had indeed been a prominent issue. The war was not going well for the Allies. The year had begun with the fall of Singapore; troops in the Western Desert had suffered a series of reverses; Hitler's armies were advancing across the Soviet Union. A successful raid on the French Channel port was a chance to boost morale at home and reassure Britain's hard-pressed Russian and American allies. Public relations was a new-fangled notion, foreign to the training and temperament of most senior British officers. But at Combined Operations' headquarters, Lord Mountbatten's youthful and eager PR team  - which included several ex-Hollyood professionals - took a more opportunistic view. COHQ's brief - to mount raids on occupied territories - clearly offered tremendous scope for action stories. Cameramen and reporters had accompanied raids on the occupied Lofoten Islands and Vaagso, in Norway, with gratifying results. The film record of Vaagso, in particular, with its shots of flaming factories and commandos creeping across snow-covered terrain, was convincing proof of the propaganda value of allowing the media into the front line. Hopes were, therefore, high for Dieppe - far more ambitious and code-named 'Operation Rutter.' The plan involved an attack by a force of 6,000, largely Canadian, on a 10-mile front of the French coast. Flanking raids on the villages on either side of the port would be followed by an attack on Dieppe itself, after which troops would move inland to attack the Luftwaffe fighter base at St Aubin and the divisional headquarters at Arques la Bataille. The whole enterprise would be supported by naval destroyers and squadrons of the RAF. It would be the greatest amphibious operation since Gallipoli and the first time in history that tanks would be landed on beaches in the face of enemy opposition. Dazzled by the opportunities that such an operation would surely bring, and blind to the possibility that it could fail, Mountbatten's publicity officers set about making Dieppe the greatest story of the war. The press men covering the enterprise needed to be physically fit and, in the spring of 1942, a hand-picked few were given a taste of assault warfare. The Daily Herald's Sandy Austin found himself despatched to a remote part of Scotland where a new type of flat-bottomed tank landing craft was being plunged in and out of lochs. Then, late in June, six reporters were shipped to the Isle of Wight where they joined a big Canadian force rehearsing the raid on the island's cliff-rimmed coastline. Anticipation was running high; however, bad weather gave the planners doubts and, on July 7, what was to have been Operation Rutter was cancelled. But at the end of July, the raid was revived under the code-name 'Jubilee' and scheduled for the night of August 18-19. Confidence must have been high, for the re-assembled press party had now swollen to 20. Secrecy was crucial and, to ensure that no word got out, COHQ's public relations officers played out an elaborate ruse, transporting the entire press team to Bristol where it was put up in hotels and told to have no communications with third parties. Two days later, a canopied army truck appeared and the journalists were taken on a lengthy cross-country journey, arriving eventually at Newhaven, East Sussex. These efforts at subterfuge were admirable but a touch superfluous: at least three of the party - Austin, Frank Gillard and John McVane - had been given full briefings on the plan the previous month. On the night of Tuesday August 18, more than 200 ships carrying nearly 6,000 troops set out under pale moonlight. The sea was calm and, for several hours, the only sound came from the throb of propellers and the sloshing of water against hulls. But as the vessels neared the French coast, there was a sudden burst of light, with golden and red sprays criss-crossing the sky. No. 3 Commando had run into a patrol of German E-boats. For 20 minutes the raiders watched the spectacle, unaware that it was the first and most serious of the mishaps that would turn the whole show into a disaster. The first landings took place just before dawn. First ashore of the press men was Austin with No. 4 Commando. Machine-gun fire sounded from the cliff-top, but the commandos blew up the barbed-wire defences and made their way up a gully that led to a great howitzer battery at Varengeville. Later that morning, Austin was pressed into service with the troops, helping to carry messages and mortar shells up the gully. Eventually, he conveyed the triumphant news: 'Battery demolished. 6.50.' A couple of miles closer to the port, Wallace Reyburn, a 29-year-old reporter for the Montreal Standard, landed with the South Saskatchewans at Pourville. With him were two members of the army film and photographic unit, Lieutenant WT Lockeyear and Sergeant Ron Holloway, the latter only recently recruited and on his first assignment. At first, all went well. A number of German prisoners was rounded up. Then, mortar shells appeared from nowhere and Reyburn found himself heaving wounded Canadians on to stretchers. The troops advanced towards Dieppe but were met with ever-fiercer shelling, and Reyburn lost track of his photographer companions. (It emerged later that Holloway had been wounded in the eye but carried on recording the battle, only to be hit again, this time fatally - the only press man at Dieppe who did not return). Reyburn found a house where, for several hours, he was able to watch the fighting. Eventually, a wireless message was sent requesting that the landing craft come and take the raiders off. With Nazi troops advancing towards the town it was, as Reyburn reported, 'a toss-up who reached us first.' When the boats finally arrived at 11.00, Reyburn witnessed one of the most harrowing episodes of the raid as 800 troops raced from the cover of the sea wall - only to be mown down by machine-gun fire. Reyburn had spent nearly six hours ashore. To the east of Dieppe, Canadian Press reporter Ross Munro accompanied the Royal Regiment of Canada to Puits, code-named Blue Beach. A 15-minute delay lost the raiders the cover of darkness and, in haste to make up for lost time, the landing craft engines were revved at full speed, alerting the shore defences. Munro wrote: 'Down went the ramp and out poured the first infantrymen. They plunged into about two feet of water and machine-gun fire laced into them.' Munro later was stunned to realise that, of the 80 men in his craft, only 20 had re-boarded. 'On no other front have I witnessed such a carnage,' he wrote in 1946. 'It was brutal and terrible and shocked you almost to insensibility.' Some miles out to sea, Quentin Reynolds was the first of the press party to appreciate how far things had gone wrong. A personal friend of two of Mountbatten's staff officers, he had sailed on the headquarters ship Calpe, where he had direct access to General Roberts, commander of the Canadian Second Division. In Roberts' control cabin, he now heard the commmander's urgent wireless message: 'Calling Red Beach. Calling Red Beach. Calling Blue Beach.' Seemingly hours later, a faint crackle came back: 'Red Beach calling. We are being strafed by Focke-Wulfs. Situation serious.' From Blue Beach, there was silence. The headquarters signaller had been killed and his transmitter smashed by bullets. For the 14 press men hovering in boats offshore, events could only be guessed at from the gruesome evidence that now and then floated into view. Landing craft emerged from under the smoke-screen, half-filled with men - some dead, some dying, the water lapping red around their bodies. From those able to speak came dazed accounts of the past few hours: 'The bloody Jerries were waiting for us.' 'We had to land in daylight.' 'Machine-guns at 50 yards, and the place lousy with mines and mortars.' A pale lieutenant, asked how things were going ashore, could only repeat: 'You may well ask.' Back in London, with news now arriving from the Calpe, Mountbatten's publicity team faced a crisis of mounting proportions. A communique issued at 06.00 that day had produced its intended effect of galvanising the nation's news desks, and telephones were ringing incessantly. To which ports would the soldiers be returning? Could reporters be sent to interview them? With furrowed brows, the officers turned to the second communique, drafted in advance but now patently in need of revision. There was a hasty telephone call to Mountbatten at RAF Uxbridge, in north-west London. A confidential note to editors warned: 'Losses must be seen in the light of valuable experience gained.' For a full seven hours, the sky over Dieppe shook with the roar of the air battle. In the Calpe's wardroom, two doctors tried to save the wounded, dealing eventually with 500 men. At one point, the bedraggled figure of Reyburn appeared. 'This is one hell of a story,' he gasped at Reynolds. Then he passed out. Around midnight, the returning ships reached the south coast ports. The press men drove to their London offices, typed their reports and then sped over to Combined Operations headquarters where a press conference had been arranged for 10.00. The briefing was on the fourth floor. 'It was a long way up,' recalled Reynolds, 'especially for Wally, whose wounds were smarting now.' Mountbatten's expression gave nothing away. His spokesman gave a carefully-worded summary: there had been some casualties but they had no particulars yet. It was true that not all the raid's objectives had been achieved, but the main purpose had been accomplished: 'We sent a large naval force to Dieppe, kept them there for more than nine hours and suffered the loss of only one destroyer.' The reporters went away and tried to incorporate the official view into their stories, although it was scarcely compatible with what they had seen and heard. The rest of the day was spent wrangling with the four sets of censors - COHQ's and the three services' - until a version of each reporter's account could be agreed. Overall, the balance sheet read badly. The pictures taken by Holloway in the heat of the fighting in Pourville were lost. The much hoped-for film coverage was derisory: the British Movietone News cameraman had been aboard No. 3 Commando's leading gunboat, and his film amounted to little more than shots of the damaged boat and wounded crew. But things could have been worse. By a stroke of luck, the only British newspaperman to land in France had seen the one phase of the raid that had gone according to plan. With a clear conscience, Austin was able to file a gritty story about No. 4 Commando's storming of Varengeville battery, and it was this - to the censors' relief - that was blazoned across every paper's front page when the story finally reached the news-stands on Friday morning. As the weeks passed, however, word got about that all had not been well at Dieppe. There had been faults in the planning - inadequate intelligence and a serious miscalculation of German strength - while poor communications, bad luck and bad timing had let the operation down. 'Was it all worthwhile?' was the question asked by many. Within months, three of the reporters present wrote books about it - accounts which, although they gave more details than the first reports, remained faithful to the line that the raid was justified by the lessons it had taught. It was hardly the action of dogged seekers-after-truth who, having discharged their distasteful duty in reporting the raid to the authorities' satisfaction, might have been expected, thankfully, to lay the subject to rest. To be fair, the number of deaths had not at that time been released, so that the raid had not acquired the tragic aura it has today; but it is still surprising that Reyburn, who had seen the very worst of the mayhem on Pourville beach, could open his book with an earnest and reasoned defence of the official line. The fact is that those reporters given access to front-line units did so accepting that they were part of the propaganda arm. The three weeks of training for Operation Rutter had produced among the press an admiration for the raiding force that was close to awe. To have responded with carping criticism would have been to jeopardise future opportunities. The reporters' acquiescence earned trust and privileges that were crucial if the public was to be given anything more than reports drawn on official communiques. By entering this accord, though, the media lost their objectivity - perhaps an inevitable consequence of war. At the end of the day - as one of their number, author John Steinbeck, put it - the correspondents of the Second World War were a 'curious, crazy, yet responsible crew.' For the sake of the war effort, and because the war against Hitler was considered a just one, they did what was required of them. Dieppe - where nearly 1,000 men were killed and 2,000 taken prisoner - showed how well the system worked.

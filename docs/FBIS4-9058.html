			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- German  President Richard von Weizsacker today called for dialogue  between the concerned groups to remove problems of the past  which burden German-Czech relations. Speaking at a press  conference after the first round of talks between seven Central  European presidents here, Weizsacker said that the past was  still markedly affecting the two countries' relations and that  it was "important to free them of past errors which are still  affecting them."    This should be done through dialogue "not only between  governments, but also between representatives of the groups  which themselves experienced these bad times," Weizsacker said.  He stressed that not property questions, but "a moral and  historical evaluation of the past," a " typical task" for the  two countries' presidents, was of priority importance.    Weizsacker was probably hinting at the issue of the 2.5  Sudeten Germans who were expelled from Czechoslovakia after  World War Two and whose property was expropriated, and at the  German occupation of the Czech Lands during the war.</p>

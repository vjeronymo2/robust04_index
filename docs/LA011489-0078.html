			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOMPSON PLANS TO BOYCOTT GAME IN NCAA PROTEST  </P> <P> Georgetown's basketball coach, John Thompson, said Friday that he will walk off  the court as soon as today's game against Boston College starts, to protest the  new National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule on scholarships.  </P> <P> "I don't want to threaten anybody; I don't want to give any ultimatums,"  Thompson said. "But when the ball goes up, I intend on getting up off the bench  and walking out."  </P> <P> Thompson said that he might boycott more than one game and that assistants Mike  Riley and Craig Esherick would coach in his absence.  </P> <P> Thompson is protesting Proposal No. 42, approved at the NCAA convention in San  Francisco Wednesday, which will prevent high school students who meet only part  of the NCAA's entrance criteria from receiving scholarships their first year in  college.  </P> <P> The minimum criteria are a 2.0 grade-point average in a core curriculum and a  minimum score on standardized entrance examinations.  </P> <P> Under Proposition 48, which has been in effect for 3 years, students could gain  athletic scholarships by meeting just part of the standards -- either the  minimum grade-point average or a passing score on an entrance exam -- but must  sit out their freshman years.  </P> <P> Also protesting the new rule in separate statements Friday were Louisiana State  basketball Coach Dale Brown, who said the NCAA "is without compassion in  dealing with human beings," and Temple basketball Coach John Chaney, who wants  to sue the NCAA.  </P> <P> The new proposal was narrowly defeated Tuesday before passing Wednesday by a  163-154 vote.  </P> <P> "With the vote as close as it was," Thompson said, "maybe it should have been  tabled and discussed a little more, if it affects the outcome of someone's  life.  </P> <P> "In moral conscience, I feel it is my responsibility to take a stand on this,"  added Thompson, who coached the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team to a bronze  medal at the 1988 Summer Games. "I'm beginning to feel that a kid with a low  socioeconomic background has been invited to dinner, had dessert and is now  being asked to leave."  </P> <P> Thompson contended that the minimum standards on college entrance examinations  treat low-income youths unfairly.  </P> <P> "I'm in support of core curriculum. I'm in support of 2.0," he said. "But I'm  not in support of SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores which have been proven  to be culturally biased."  </P> <P> Thompson stopped short of calling the NCAA racist but said: "I feel it is a  discriminatory thing, especially for a kid who is at a low socioeconomic level.  </P> <P> "If I jump up and down and holler racism, everyone will lose sight of the issue  and focus on the words."  </P> <P> But he conceded: "Certainly, it has an effect on black people. Athletics has  been a vehicle and a way out, and in a lot of instances, the only hope a young  person had. It (Proposal 42) is closing a lot of doors. It may not have been  intended to do that, but that in fact is what it is going to do."  </P> <P> Dave Cawood, the NCAA's assistant executive director, said in a statement:  </P> <P> "I do not believe that the delegates who voted for the proposal considered it a  racial issue but as a means to strengthen the academic entrance requirements  for freshman students who will participate in athletics. Although this  legislation only may be suspended by the Division I membership in a legislative  session, I'm sure that the members will continue to closely review the subject  prior to next January's convention."  </P> <P> Thompson said he planned to inform his players of his boycott decision later  Friday.  </P> <P> Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien said he thinks that Thompson "has a very valid  point, and he feels something needs to be done right now. . . . This is going  to make a lot of noise."  </P> <P> The Rev. Timothy Healy, Georgetown's president, supported Thompson's decision.  </P> <P> "I'm totally behind John," he said. "As it now stands, if John has looked at a  youngster, and he doesn't have a 700 (on his SATs), no university aid can be  given to that youngster. That's an intrusion in Georgetown's business by the  NCAA, and that is unacceptable."  </P> <P> Thompson said he didn't know how long he would boycott NCAA-sanctioned games.  </P> <P> "It could be one day. It could be five days," the coach said. "It could be one  year."  </P> <P> Thompson also complained that the timing of the NCAA convention in the middle  of the basketball season puts coaches at a disadvantage.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, LSU's Brown also criticized the NCAA for tightening the  academic standards for athletic scholarships.  </P> <P> "This country -- which was founded by and for all people, and not a privileged  few -- must be vigilant that it does not turn into a society where those who do  not meet elite standards are officially declared second-rate citizens," said  Brown from Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Brown was in favor of Proposition 48 when it was proposed five years ago, but  he soon began to regard it as a stigma that follows a player through his  college career and perhaps beyond. He has three partial qualifiers sitting out  their freshman years this season.  </P> <P> He said the rule hits hardest at underprivileged youngsters least familiar with  standardized tests.  </P> <P> "I am shocked and saddened at this incessant desire to label kids from the  poorer strata as losers in the game of life," Brown said.  </P> <P> "The most important rule for all of us to follow is that of respecting human  dignity, and the NCAA certainly has not followed that rule."  </P> <P> Brown added: "The penalty given to those who just didn't have a high enough  score on a test is far more severe than to an athlete who illegally secures a  $25,000 automobile and other fringe benefits.  </P> <P> "He can be granted immunity by the NCAA if he turns in the guilty parties, when  he is the most guilty.  </P> <P> "A youngster that did nothing illegal, but failed to meet a standard test  score, is saved from the guillotine but is embarrassed in front of the whole  world.  </P> <P> "That is not the justice that this great country stands for."  </P> <P> Temple's Chaney, who earlier referred to the NCAA as "that racist  organization," said: "There's only one road left, and that is to take the NCAA  to the courts."  </P> <P> Calling himself, Thompson and Brown a "committee of three" fighting the new  rules, Chaney said he would consider any means "humanly possible" to change the  regulations.  </P> <P> "Every parent of every Proposition 48 youngster who is being deprived of an  opportunity to go to college is willing to go court," Chaney said, adding that  he was referring to parents he has contacted. "I see no other way out."  </P> <P> Chaney said that because nearly 90% of all Proposition 48 athletes in football  and basketball are black, the rule is also a violation of civil rights.  </P> <P> "It's a racist rule that has come up the pike by racist presidents. Forty of  them and some of the coaches in this country as well," Chaney said, referring  to school presidents who drafted the measure.  </P> <P> "It has taken us back and will continue to take us back 50 years as far as I'm  concerned. For an athletic association to dream up a nightmare for black  youngsters is totally insane."  </P> <P> An Associated Press survey last year found that almost 9 of 10 college football  players who were disqualified for the 1988 season because of Proposition 48  were black.  </P> <P> Of the 274 football players who failed to meet the NCAA's academic requirements  in 1988, the AP was able to identify the race of 213, or 77.7%. A total of 185  players were black, 86.8% of those identified.  </P> <P> All 192 colleges and universities playing Division I-A and I-AA football  responded to the AP survey, conducted from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, 1988.  </P> <P> Ursula Walsh, director for research for the NCAA, told the AP that blacks  accounted for 81% of football ineligibles in 1986, the first year of  Proposition 48, and 90% in 1987, according to an NCAA survey.  </P> <P> Overall, 9.2% of college students are black, according to a survey taken in  1986 by the Department of Education. The only data on minority football players  is a survey taken by the College Football Assn. in 1987 that showed 41% of the  players at its schools were minorities. The CFA is composed of 66 Division I-A  teams.  </P> <P> In the AP survey, Alcorn State and Bethune-Cookman, two predominantly black  colleges, had the most ineligible players, 12 each.  </P></p>

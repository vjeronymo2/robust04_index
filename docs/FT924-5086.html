			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Nothing to celebrate on ozone layer Sir, Your editorial,'Saving the ozone layer' (November 25), casts undue optimism on the outcome of the Montreal Protocol. It is progress that CFCs are now to be phased out in 1996 rather than 2000. However, the failure of the meeting to introduce real controls on both HCFCs and methyl bromide throw away much of this progress. Governments have put back original UNEP proposals for HCFCs ban by 25 years, and back-tracked on any reductions at all on methyl bromide. The lack of action has stemmed from industrial interest of the French in particular, coupled with the absence of European Community leadership by the British government. The director of UNEP stated that the outcome was 'not enough' and fears for the future. You are correct to state that ozone depletion cannot be predicted; the only judge is that scientists have consistently underestimated the scale of the damage. The agreement is a green light for a further assault on the ozone layer, and the next two decades will see untold damage. With all the serious consequences this brings, there is hardly a cause for celebration. Corin Millais, Greenpeace UK, Canonbury Villas, London N1 2PN</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / People: Lasmo LASMO, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday appointed Richard Smernoff to fill the vacancy created by the departure last year of Michael Pavia, the former finance director. Smernoff, 52, spent his early career with accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and with International Paper Company. He then spent 13 years with Amerada Hess, the US oil company, where he was senior vice president and corporate controller. In 1992 he spent a year with Lasmo in the US, helping in the rationalisation that followed Lasmo's takeover of Ultramar. That assignment was one factor behind his appointment, according to Joe Derby, chief executive: 'We know he will fit into the Lasmo team'. Smernoff's inter-personal and communication skills - another factor - are likely to be subjected to an early test. Full year results for Lasmo, which is particularly vulnerable to current low oil prices, are due shortly after he takes over in March.</p>

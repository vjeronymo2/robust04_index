			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (11): Critical analysis in depth  -Software plays a powerful new role CREDIT managers are looking for more from their computer services than mere credit scoring in the 1990s. During the recession, they are more likely to need help in assessing which bad debts are most likely to be repaid. As in every other sphere of business, users are looking for software which allows them to react more efficiently to change, create better control, and make better decisions. The truth about computers is they can only make the decisions they are programmed to make. Even the all-seeing Hal in the film epic 2001 was subject to that rule. Another truth is that, however comprehensive and voluminous the data they store, it is only useful as information if it is easily accessible. As an application, credit management has followed the trend of computing in general - mainframes, bureau services, then devolution to the in-house minicomputer and ultimately, the PC. At the same time, the agenda has changed for credit managers. They are looking for better and more responsive control of existing data, often achieved by attaching a PC to feed from mainframe-held data for sampling and testing. Further, the trend is to extend the grasp of useful information at all points of the credit cycle, not purely for credit scoring, before the loan is made, but later, when things go wrong. The last five years have seen growth and innovation in software for credit management. There are now an increasing number of options, in controlling different phases of the credit cycle, and in the hardware, PC and otherwise, available to run them. The first scoring techniques were developed about 20 years ago, pioneered by Fair Isaac and Co. Computerised databases made it possible to store statistics on which decisions about credit are based. The system evaluates financial and non-financial characteristics of an applicant, assigning points according to the answers. The scoring system is defined by a table, derived from past experience. For the first 10 years, the mainframe was the only practical option. The main growth of credit scoring systems has been in the last 10 years, particularly among mail order and retailing users. Fair Isaac have been joined by other dominant suppliers, CCN, MDS and Mathtec, in installing credit-scoring systems in UK banks, finance companies and other creditors, particularly in the last five years. Bureau services are available from Equifix, Scorex, and Infolink. Now, power has come to the desktop for computer users in credit management. At first sight, this is an application which needs more than PC power, because of the volume of data involved, a problem overcome by linking to the mainframe. Combined with the flexibility of fourth generation languages (4GLs), they offer speed of reaction, because 4GLs can be used to develop speedy prototypes and one-off experiments, and an ability to check and 'own' the data. 'Bureaux always have problems in making the data flexible,' comments Jalal Khoylou of Paragon Business Solutions, based in West London. 'There is always some hassle with the format.' Paragon, founded by two ex-Infolink employees, has developed a Decision Support System tailored to scorecard modelling. Its aim is to help users through the complex business of building the scorecard accurately. DSS is written in a 4GL, and is PC-based, using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for ease of use. According to Khoylou, the process of developing a scorecard can cost up to Pounds 30,000 using outside resources: for two scorecards, developed with in-house expertise, DSS is not only a cheaper solution, but more flexible. Extending the credit-scoring principle to debt recovery, SSI Nynex developed its Debt Recovery System, now used, inter alia, in Marks &amp; Spencer Financial Services, Girobank, and Diners Club. According to Andy Swain, an account manager in debt recovery working for the London-based distributor of the software, AST, the time has come for a more constructive role for computer services than purely the timing and administration of litigation. 'What we offer is a broader view of debt recovery. For as many as 250,000 accounts, lenders are having to pay heavy fees trying to recover bad debts, through structured payments or through outside debt collectors. With our system, we can select the people most likely to pay by assessing the age, balance, and other criteria.' The two advantages of using the system are, he suggests, in speed of reaction, and in establishing the recoverability of debts. This is particularly important in deciding which accounts to take to legislation, and which to allocate to agents. 'It's easier to control and monitor. The better selection and targeting of accounts makes for improved cost per pound recovered.' The problem of bad debts plagues smaller companies as well as the large institutional lenders. For the smaller companies, PC solutions are becoming available to collect and control cash, and monitor debtors. C2 is a credit management package from ACS, based in Rochester, providing daily reminders and automatic documentation for debt recovery. Business Information Technological Systems, of Ripon, North Yorks, provides a Credit Check database, updated weekly by disk, which keeps a regular check on the credit-worthiness of customers, suppliers, subcontractors, competitors, or prospects, covering companies of all sizes. Personal experience - the gut feel to distinguish between one who constantly lives in the red and another who will not be so much as a day late paying the bill - is not so easy to encapsulate as hard facts. Nevertheless, credit management has often been held up as an example of innovative use of so-called 'expert systems', in which human experience is distilled in systems which aid decision-making, and can even automate some of the processes of screening. These systems are based on a mixture of human 'gut feel' experience and statistical evidence. Nevertheless, they can never make the decisions, they can only present a statistical 'likelihood' in any given situation. As with any area of computing, there is no such thing as the ultimate answer. What there is, however, is an increasing potential for flexible solutions.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo warns about low price of oil LASMO, the independent exploration and production company, yesterday reported net profits of Pounds 20m for the first half of 1993, but warned that low oil prices were threatening profitability despite the prospect of steadily rising production. The interim performance compares with a net loss of Pounds 248m in the same period last year after a loss of Pounds 291m on the sale of businesses. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the company intended to maintain its present exploration and development programme. He acknowledged, however, that the company's business plan may have to be modified if oil prices lingered at or below the Dollars 16 a barrel level until early next year. He said any such changes would probably involve winding down exploration expenditure for 1995 and thereafter. Earnings per share of 2.2p compared with previous losses of 33.5p. The company is paying a 1.3p (2.3p) interim dividend. The board will recommend a final of 2p (1p) barring unforeseen circumstances. A scrip alternative will be offered to shareholders. The results were generally in line with market expectations and Lasmo shares closed up 5 1/2 p at 133 1/2 . Mr Darby confirmed that the company had received offers for its interest in the Markham field in the North Sea, with analysts suggesting the company could raise as much as Pounds 100m from a sale. He said additional sales of peripheral interests could be made in future, although the scale of any sell-offs would be smaller. Asset sales combined with planned shutdowns at some fields resulted in lower production, which fell to 143,100 barrels of oil equivalent compared with 156,100 b/d in the first half of 1992. Turnover was Pounds 309m (Pounds 297m), with some gain recorded from higher sterling prices for oil. Mr Darby conceded that current low oil prices and a depressed share price made the company vulnerable to a possible takeover. 'When the oil price is gloomy everybody is nervous,' he said. 'We are not doing anything to reduce that vulnerability . . . but I'm not sure there is anybody out there without problems of their own.' He said the company would focus on increasing production to 220,000 b/d by 1996, a 40 per cent increase over present levels. A key element of that would be the integrated development of the Liverpool Bay field, which will supply gas to PowerGen under a contract which is not linked to the oil price. Lasmo expects to have medium-term finance in place in the near future to fund its participation in the field. A decision on whether to go ahead with the project will be taken by the end of the year, with first production in 1995. The development programme would keep balance sheet gearing, now at 70 per cent, steady this year before rising to 80-90 per cent in 1995, after which the company expects it to fall significantly. Gearing hit 111 per cent at the end of last year but fell after the company raised Dollars 600m in the US early this year. Net debt fell to Pounds 781m at the half-year from Pounds 1.08bn at year end. Another strand of Lasmo's strategy is to cut costs. Cost of sales, including operating costs, depletion charges and production taxes, is expected to be close to Pounds 9 a barrel in 1993. Costs, which Mr Darby said have been too high, are likely to fall as Lasmo's activities change. New developments, such as Liverpool Bay, involve lower costs than many of its existing assets. Administrative costs have been cut by 20 per cent, with another 20 per cent cut envisaged in 1994. See Lex</p>

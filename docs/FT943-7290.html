			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Highest ethical principles always upheld Sir, We would like to respond to a number of points made in Andrew Jack's article on The Body Shop ('US ethical fund turns against Body Shop', August 19). There were no 'emissions' from our former New Jersey 'factory'. Rather, there were two accidental spills of 30 gallons of shampoo at our former bottling plant two years ago. In line with our policy, we immediately notified the authorities. There was no breach of environmental law, no citation, no 'emissions'. I'm sorry that we spilled some shampoo, but whenever there are human beings around, there will be minor accidents. The reference to 'oil-based ingredients' is perplexing: perhaps the Financial Times was referring to mineral oil. If so, then you should be aware that this is the same ingredient which has been slapped on babies' bums for generations in England without adverse effect] The accusation that I find personally most offensive is the suggestion that we lack 'commitment' to our trade-not-aid programme. No one should doubt our commitment. Some of our critics' arguments about trade-not-aid centre around a percentage game that misses the point. They say that, because our trade-not-aid purchases form only a small percentage of our total, we should not talk about it nor have prominent displays or window posters relating to it. We say that trade-not-aid is a very important part of our business, on which we spend a disproportionate amount of time and money. Let me give one example of how it works with one ingredient: Brazil nut oil is pressed in the Amazon jungle by Kayapo Indians. We use the oil in our Brazil nut conditioner. It comprises 1.5 per cent of total product volume, making it an insignificant percentage of the total ingredient list. We use 1.5 per cent because it is what works: use less and it would be ineffective; use more and your head would look like an oily mop. Financial and managerial efforts on these many projects far outweigh their naked value to us. As for the supposed lack of public information, we publish our product information manual in every store worldwide giving facts about ingredients and their properties. We are at the forefront of companies in Europe in listing ingredients on our product labels, though not yet required by law. For the third year running, we have voluntarily published an independently verified environmental statement in our Green Books. We make explicit our stance on animal testing. I sometimes think we overdose on providing information. We will continue to develop our business with the highest of ethical principles. This is why we recently institutionalised our values in amending our memorandum of association, passed by our shareholders at the recent annual general meeting. This is why we have set up the Values and Vision Centre uniting our Against Animal Testing, Environmental, Fair Trade and Human Rights departments in a group working directly with Anita. This is why we published our company mission statement, and soon will publish our trading charter. If this, and what we have done over the past 18 years, is not good enough for the cynics, that's their problem - not ours. T Gordon Roddick, The Body Shop International, West Sussex, BN17 6LS</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed BBR/CA: "Dehaene `Wants To Succeed Delors'"] </F>   [Excerpt] During a talk with Herman Van Rompuy, deputy  prime minister and budget minister (of the CVP [Flemish  Christian People's Party]), and CVP Chairman Johan Van Hecke,  Jean-Luc Dehaene expressed his wish "to succeed Jacques Delors  as president of the European Commission (EC)." DE MORGEN  learned this yesterday from senior government circles. So far,  Dehaene has left it up in the air as to whether he was  interested in or had been asked to be the EC president, uttering  only a sharp "no comment."    The report that the Germans and French had expressed their  preference for the Belgian prime minister appeared in THE  GUARDIAN in early March and led to quite a bit of excitement in  the government. Not only was it remarkable that the energetic  approach of the nonconformist Dehaene in Europe was esteemed  but, in addition, everyone knows that the current government is  identified with the person of the prime minister. Replacing him  would be a tough job and would seriously compromise the survival  of the government. Delors' succession must take effect on 1  January 1995, the government still has a bit less than a year to  go. [passage omitted]</p>

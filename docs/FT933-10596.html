			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Westpac's Ord Minnett broking arm to be sold WESTPAC Banking of Australia is to sell its Ord Minnett broking arm to Jardine Fleming Australia and Ord Minnett management, Reuter reports from Sydney. No price was disclosed, but Westpac said Ord Minnett management and Jardine Fleming would each take a 50 per cent stake in Ord Minnett, and the deal would be closed by September 30. Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming is owned by Jardine Matheson Holdings and UK-based Robert Fleming, with 50 per cent each. The buyers claim the company will benefit from the combination of Ord Minnett's strong domestic presence and Jardine Fleming's cross-border expertise and international network. Mr Robert Joss, Westpac managing director, said the sale was in line with Westpac's strategy of disposing of non-core assets. Mr Neville Miles, joint managing director of Ord Minnett Securities, said the group would focus on its underwriting business and derivative markets in Asia in the new joint venture. He said Ord Minnett had not yet finalised an arrangement to offer management and staff a stake in the broking firm.</p>

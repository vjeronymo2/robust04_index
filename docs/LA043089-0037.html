			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER FILM CENTER  </P> <P> I read with interest your April 9 article "Orlando, Fla. -- Will It Become  Hollywood East?" You dedicated a number of pages to the limited business being  generated by the Disney/MGM and Universal Studios in Orlando and ignored the  hub of the film industry in Florida. South Florida in general and North Miami  in particular have been and continue to be the center of film production in  this state. In fact, in 1988 in terms of dollars spent just by feature films  alone, we surpassed the Orlando area about 10 to 1.  </P> <P> We may not have the (Orlando-style) glitz that comes with E.T. or Mickey Mouse  ears, but we have talent, production facilities, technical know-how and  postproduction facilities that can't be found anywhere else outside of Los  Angeles or New York.  </P> <P> HOWARD NEU, Mayor  </P> <P> North Miami  </P></p>

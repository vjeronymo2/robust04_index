			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Piet van Seeters report: "Kigali Reminds Pronk of `Killing </F> Fields'"]    [Excerpts] "What is now happening in Kigali is worse than  anything I have ever seen. It is worse than the killing fields.  It is slaughter that is comparable, in terms of the number of  victims and the manner in which they are being murdered, with  that which took place in Cambodia. It is different than and  occurring on a larger scale than what I saw in Somalia, Sudan,  and Bosnia."    This was the reaction of an indignant Development Aid  Minister Pronk in Nairobi on Sunday [15 May] evening, following  a short visit to the Rwandan capital of Kigali, where heavy  fighting took place on Sunday. [passage omitted] According to  Pronk, most of the murders are being committed by government  troops. The rebels belonging to the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF) are also killing out of revenge, "but unlike the  government militia they are not making themselves guilty of  systematic, preplanned genocide," Pronk said. "After the attack  on the presidents, the entire opposition was eradicated in a  single night. And the carnage is still continuing."    In the meantime, 400,000 Rwandans have fled to other  countries. According to Pronk, in the country itself between 1.5  and 2 million people have fled for their lives.    Of this total number of refugees, 1.2 million are located in  the south. "That is the least fertile part of the country, and  it is the area that has suffered the greatest drought. The  government troops are in charge there. It is becoming a major  disaster. In the north, the situation is quieter. Aid  organizations have already been able to achieve a great deal  there and are negotiating with the RPF," Pronk continued.    Pronk emphasized that a maximum amount of aid must be  provided as soon as possible: "An airlift must be organized  because a great deal of food has to be shipped to Rwanda. And  hopefully the United Nations will be able to send a force of  5,500 men there. Everyone from the United Nations here says  that it is the minimum. I hope that the United States takes the  initiative to organize the airlift, for it is U.S. troops who  have the greatest capacity to do so. [passage omitted]    Apart from the airlift, a cease-fire must be achieved in the  near future. "However, the RPF no longer wants to talk with the  government, but rather with the military. Yet they only want to  talk if the government is present. So an impasse has been  created. And I fear that the murdering will go on, because  nobody has any hold on the militia," Pronk concluded.</p>

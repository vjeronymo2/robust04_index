			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stephan Schlote: "Ordered Blind; How the German </F> Manufacturers Intend To Regain Lost Ground in International  Competition"]    [Text] They did not make the grade, and one person knows  why: "In this industry," says Volkswagen boss Ferdinand Piech,  "no one has done his homework." Except for BMW, all German  carmakers are closing the year 1993 with red figures. Overall  grade for Germany's carmakers: Failed.    A new generation of managers is now expected to change the  course of the automotive industry. Unlike in any other sector of  the German industry, almost all of the veteran executive boards  of carmakers were removed. Achim Diekmann, manager in the  automotive industry association: "After the crisis the industry  has a totally different look." During the coming week at the  Geneva Autosalon it will make its debut.    The collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and Nicolas Hayek,  the inventor of the Swatch car is only one, albeit very  striking, example. Mercedes, the Swabian brand of tradition,  banks on the collaboration with the automotive newcomer Hayek.  Mercedes boss Helmut Werner: "Hayek can always be counted on for  innovative and clever ideas."    This is but a fraction of the "revolution" that the Mercedes  boss had promised one year ago when taking office: Roughly  11,000 jobs have been cut by the Stuttgart people in 1993 alone,  another 8,000 will be eliminated in 1994. Mercedes must get out  of the red, "however, merely stolidly reducing jobs," Werner  recognizes, "is not the solution." Unlike any other manufacturer  in Germany, Mercedes is expanding its line of products. In 1995,  the new full-size Viano from Basque Vitoria is entering the  market, and starting in 1996 the Bremen plant will build the  small SLK roadster. The production of the small A-class starts  1997 in Rastatt, practically coinciding with the opening of the  first foreign Mercedes plant in the U.S. state of Alabama. An  all-terrain recreational vehicle is produced there, whose  production figures are already in the black even with half the  capacity of 30,000 cars annually.    By the end of the decade Werner plans to produce one-tenth  of  the cars beyond the German borders und thus once and for all  replace "Made in Germany" with "Made by Mercedes." In the year  2000, Mercedes intends to produce roughly 900,000 cars  worldwide--about 400,000 more than in 1993. "One of the major  weak points in the German automotive industry," as the study by  the Deutsche Bank Research states, "the lack of globalization"  will then have been eliminated.    Werner is taking decisive measures. Only recently he reduced  the board by two heads, cut two hierarchical levels, and divided  the entire corporation into performance centers. A decision was  made to build a central development center for roughly DM800  million, and an amount of DM18.7 billion was committed for  capital expenditures planned from 1994 to 1998--10 percent less  than previously. Werner's trick: Within the next five years  Mercedes will invest about 1 billion marks [DM] additionally in  products but less in machines.    Mercedes reduces the fraction of company-produced assets by  5  percentage points to 40 percent, and, using a new purchasing  model called "tandem," the subcontractors are also getting their  chance. The basic principle: Mercedes does not demand lower  prices unless the suppliers can actually produce at lower cost.  Mercedes annually purchases parts worldwide for roughly DM20  billion.    However, Manfred Remmel, head of purchasing, plans to save  about 6 billion by 1997. Simple solution: Build simpler cars.  The technology-crazy Germans have always loved things  unnecessarily complicated. "We have to provide more than 3,600  different exhaust manifolds," complains Konrad Ellegast, deputy  board chairman of Phoenix AG, the Hamburg automotive supplier. A  comparable company in Japan needs 300--but also has fewer  subcontractors. In Germany every second one is going to fall by  the wayside.    During his first year in office Helmut Werner has already  decreased expenses by DM4 billion, in round figures. The Swabian  carmaker continues to give payroll increases only on scale.  Commentary by the French Banque Paribas in a current company  analysis: "Mercedes is on the right track."    The competition from Munich actually has arrived there some  time ago. Even during the down-year of 1993, BMW registered a  profit of roughly DM510 million. The Bavarian formula to  success: Concentration on the automotive business; new markets,  such as power-unit building, only jointly with a strong partner  like Rolls-Royce; constantly new model variations--and no  squabbling on the management level. The result: "In the German  automotive industry BMW has the most advantageous cost  structure," according to an analysis of the major Credit  Lyonnais bank. Next objective: BMW boss Bernd Pischetsrieder  intends to reduce development time from seven to three years and  cut in half the number of 900 direct suppliers within a few  years.    VW boss Ferdinand Piech intends to match BMW and Mercedes.  Piech is already striking a balance of success. And it is so  fantastic that some just cannot believe it: Within one year the  VW AG's break-even point was brought down from a 107-percent to  85-percent capacity. It is anticipated that as early as the end  of 1994 the Volkswagen make will realize profits. After all, in  1993 the VW AG has managed a thin profit of about DM70 million.    VW was able to save more than DM6 billion in 1993 alone,  train employees for lean production, and escalate productivity  in the plants by 25 percent within 12 months. Commentary by the  Deutsche Bank Research: "The 1994 VW will be out of the woods."    However, Piech lowered capital expenditures in 1993 by  almost  a half down to DM5 billion. Piech's calculation: All across the  board, he plans to build cars after the module principle so that  for the entire group only four underbodies are required instead  of the present 16.    The Czech subsidiary Skoda is presently already operating  more cost-efficiently than the Japanese. Even the managers from  the group's central headquarters are actively taking part in the  savings: Like the rest of the VW workforce, their salary is  reduced by one-fifth and consequently they have to work--at  least unofficially 20 percent less. With the introduction of the  29-hour week, Volkswagen is able to avoid 30,000 dismissals.  Nevertheless, the group must show a loss in the first quarter of  1994 the same as in the previous year. But "it will be  substantially lower," states an employee from the executive  circle.    Red figures remain the current color in Porsche's statement  so far. But Wendelin Wiedeking, at the helm at Porsche, is  working doggedly for a turnaround: Within five years almost  every fifth job has been eliminated. By 1995, Wiedeking plans to  reduce production times by one-third, and the number of  contractors from 950 to 300 by 1997.    Wiedeking has a firm hold on things. Porsche marketing, for  years the company's weak point, will from now on work again  right next door with the Porsche board in  Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. The new "Boxster," on which they set  their hopes, is slated to be ready for the market in less than  four years.    Full of pride, the young boss in Zuffenhausen pronounces:  "We  have left the low point behind us." Even in the first semester  of 1994 Porsche will earn money again for the first time in the  automotive business. In the United States the new Porsche is  being ordered "sight unseen." "We have not seen anything like it  in five years," an executive from the sales department rejoices.  Walter Gnauert, director of finance: "We have worked off half of  our competitive disadvantage to Japan."    The Japanese art of the autobus represents a shining example  even for General Motors subsidiary Opel. All of the 14 European  GM factories are supposed to learn from the new plant in  Eisenach. Initial successes are becoming apparent. The cost  disadvantage to the English GM plants for the assembly of the  Vectra was cut in half to DM450 within two years. The new Corsa  requires a quarter fewer individual parts than its predecessor;  for the new Omega the number is reduced to 40 percent. In 1992  it took 30 hours to assemble the Omega; the goal is for 20 hours  to be sufficient by 1995, a value not even reached  internationally by all of the compact carmakers.    In addition, Opel boss David Herman banks on a new company  agreement which limits future wage increases to 2 percent  annually. Also, during the change of shifts the assembly line  continues to move, and the workers do not punch the timeclock  until they are on the job in their overalls. The Christmas bonus  has been eliminated, the number of employees dropped by 9  percent, and even the number of sick persons has decreased by  one-tenth to below 7 percent. For Opel this means a savings of  roughly DM1 billion in four years. The employees are now to  benefit from this as well: For achieving the self-determined  savings objectives, Opel plans to distribute a so-called  structural bonus in March--almost one-third of a monthly wage  after all.    At Ford, on the other hand, the employees are being  motivated  with "Knecht Ruprecht" [Santa Claus' attendant] switches behind  the windshield of their own vehicle. One employee from Cologne:  "A subtle hint to colleagues who do not come to work in a Ford."  There was a time during the eighties when the Cologne Ford  plants were considered the best managed enterprise of the German  automotive industry. No longer. The new Ford director Albert  Caspers: "We are in the midst of a struggle for survival."    By 1996 Caspers plans to launch the DM12-billion capital  expenditures program at Ford--making it the largest in the  company history. The production time of 2.3 hours for the new  Zetec engine has already reached Japanese levels in the Cologne  engine plant; in the Belgian Genk factory the Mondeo is being  built with a profit at a capacity of only 65 percent. But this  does not solve Ford's main problem: The make continues to  represent the German pedestrian citizen--reliable and  respectable, but dull.    Nevertheless, Ford boss Caspers is optimistic about  achieving  his ambitious goals: "We shall be among the winners." But that's  what everyone in the industry wants. VW boss Piech, who would  like nothing better than to become the headman of the industry,  knows exactly why: "Whoever emerges first from the crisis has  the best chances."</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Big names join ICI power attack LARGE British companies including GKN and Blue Circle joined ICI yesterday in its attack on the government over the price of electricity. The Major Energy Users Council renewed its campaign for lower electricity prices for industry by meeting Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. The meeting follows a rare public statement by ICI, which yesterday said its important chlor-alkali business at Runcorn, Merseyside, could not survive without electricity price cuts. Both ICI and the Major Energy Users say electricity prices make British industry uncompetitive in Europe. Mr John Topliss, electricity group chairman of the users council, said Mr Eggar was sympathetic. He added: 'We are hopeful that he will settle the matter by the end of July or August.' ICI said the government must move very quickly to settle the electricity price row. Mr Bryan Bulloch, ICI's power services manager for the chlor-alkali business, said: 'We are losing business, it's an immediate problem.' The business, which uses as much electricity as the city of Liverpool, has seen its electricity bill - which is about 70 per cent of its variable costs  -rise 35 per cent since electricity privatisation two years ago. Before privatisation, ICI and other big electricity consumers paid a much lower bulk tariff. The Runcorn site buys power from ICI's own power purchasing subsidiary, Impkemix, a member of the electricity pool or wholesale market. ICI's move to set up Impkemix followed a suggestion from Mr John Wakeham, the former energy secretary, that large electricity users unhappy about prices should go and compete in the market. Impkemix must still buy from the pool, where prices are much higher than its pre-privatisation tariff. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the generator that supplies the bulk of electricity sold in the pool or wholesale market, said his company sympathised with ICI and had 'stood on its head' to try to help. 'Sadly, it can't be done without cross-subsidy and that's absolutely ruled out,' he said. It was no cheaper for a generator to supply a very large user than a small user.</p>

This crisis has affected the relationship between  Fadlallah and Lebanese Hizballah, which is supported by Iran.  The wing opposed to Fadlallah has succeeded in causing  organized "confusion" among its followers and supporters, both  in the southern suburb and Beirut. It seems that they have for  some time time been preparing a "bill of indictment" against  Fadlallah, pending Tehran's "verdict."    The indictment includes the following:    -- His public assertion of the weakness of the historic  Shiite story about the misdeed of Fatimah al-Zahra', daughter of  the prophet (peace be upon him) and wife of 'Ali Bin-Abu-Talib,  to Caliph 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab.    -- His opposition to the possible takeover of the supreme  authority position by 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Islamic  revolution, when the current authority Mohammad 'Ali Araki dies.    It is said that a video was sent to Tehran, showing  Fadlallah  attacking Khamene'i.    The first accusation is considered a violation of the common  Shiite belief, and the second has been exploited for political  ends in order to place the accused in a direct confrontation  with Khamene'i. [passage omitted]    The other aspect of this dispute is reflected in the context  of talk of the need for the "Shiite scene" in Lebanon to remain  separate from the religious leadership in Tehran. Maybe what  Ja'farite Mufti in Lebanon Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan said on  10 December 1993, namely that "the Islamic republic [of Iran] is  responsible for safeguarding the authority's affairs," is part  of the bid to tighten the noose around Fadlallah's movements in  Lebanon.    Fadlallah rejects this dark and tense picture of his  relationship with Tehran. He attributes everything said about  his differences with it to "people trying to fish in muddy  water." He says that anyone who tries to raise such issues is  trying to "foment sedition." He does not rule out that the  "intelligence service" could be behind this. Actually both  Fadlallah and the Iranian leadership are trying to reunite the  scene. Fadlallah may admit the existence of an overt battle  that is not in his favor with Iran. While others believe that  Tehran cannot abandon its relationship with Fadlallah, who has a  "distinctive" position at both the Islamic and Shiite levels.  [passage omitted]</p>

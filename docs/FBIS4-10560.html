			<p>CSO     [Text] The United Labor Confederation (CUT) has called for  a mass meeting in March "to inform the right wing and those who  want or intend to promote the idea of privatizing the  enterprises of all the Chilean citizens that the workers will  not allow the continued draining of the state so that private  citizens can take over the patrimony of the people of Chile."    Arturo Martinez, the vice president of the trade-union  organization, together with other leaders, met with  representatives of the Copper Workers' Federation (FTC).    Martinez offered the support of the trade-union body for the  petition being drafted by the FTC demanding clarity and  penalties for those who are guilty of causing harm.    This leader expressed regret that the executives of the  CODELCO [Copper Company], who are responsible for the  administration of the enterprise, have "betrayed" the confidence  of President Aylwin. "There is abandonment here in terms of  concern and respect for their responsibilities." And this, he  explained, applies to all of those who have had the  responsibility for the management of the enterprise. "We are  alarmed that the political right wing has seized upon this most  regrettable fact, which will mean less money to be used to aid  the poorest of the people, in order to renew their intention of  privatizing the CODELCO and other state enterprises once again."  <H5>  Atmosphere of Peace Endangered </H5>   Martinez noted that the CUT collaborated with the  establishment of democracy and the development of an atmosphere  of social peace, "very frequently postponing the legitimate  interests of the workers. But we want to warn the businessmen,  the right wing, and the political parties that this climate of  social peace may change if the efforts to privatize and plunder  the national assets are continued.    "If the modernization of the enterprise is carried out  without the workers, it goes against the workers," he warned,  proposing that there be dialogue rather than unilateral  decisions. In this connection, he noted that the FTC has  proposed a plan for CODELCO expenditures that "the enterprise  has not wanted to adopt or hear about.    "We are defending the assets of all the people of Chile. We  will proceed through every necessary measure if we are not  heard." He recalled that it was the CUT that "within an  atmosphere of bullying, ousted Pinochet and his dictatorship. It  was neither the parties nor any of the technocratic officials in  the government who initiated the battle in 1983. It was the  Chilean workers."  <H5>  No Mixed Companies </H5>   He also expressed the view that an attitude of the CODELCO  administration favorable to privatization began when some  services were transferred with the approval of the executives.  "We want the next administration to discuss the modernization of  the business with the workers, so that it will not mean mixed  companies. We are prepared to take all the necessary steps,  including separation of the divisions into departments, but not  to discuss privatization or mixed companies."    Meanwhile, Carlos Gomez, the secretary general of the FTC,  reiterated that the Investigative Commission of the Chamber of  Deputies will be asked to review the situation of all of the  divisions, the transfers to the sectors of third parties in  particular. He stated that the CODELCO has 22,000 workers, and  that it is a "deception of the nation" to say that the personnel  strength has been reduced, since there are 18,000 contractors.  He noted that there is work that has been passed on to third  parties for two years, but has had to be returned to the CODELCO  to be done by its employees because they are more efficient.    A meeting of the National Advisory Council of the FTC is  scheduled for 2 March. At that meeting, the proposal regarding  the future of the CODELCO will be analyzed. This document will  be debated at the base levels and in the social entities, and  then reexamined with a view to approval during the National  Congress in April.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI FACES PROBE ON SALVADOR TESTIMONY  </P> <P> A congressional subcommittee will investigate whether FBI agents intimidated a  Salvadoran woman and caused her to recant earlier statements she had made,  linking elements of El Salvador's armed forces to last month's murders of six  Jesuit priests in San Salvador, it was learned Monday.  </P> <P> The civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary  Committee plans to examine complaints from U.S. Jesuit officials and a lawyers  committee that Lucia Barrera de Cerna was "harassed, intimidated and insulted"  during FBI interrogation in Miami -- to the point that she changed her earlier  sworn statements about what she had witnessed.  </P> <P> California Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the subcommittee chairman, and Jim  Dempsey, its chief counsel, refused to discuss the matter other than to  acknowledge their intended inquiry.  </P> <P> Justice Department officials and a spokesman for the State Department,  meanwhile, said the questioning of Cerna and her husband by two FBI agents and  a representative of El Salvador's army was proper.  </P> <P> Cerna, the principal witness, her husband Jorge and their daughter were flown  to Miami with diplomatic protection after the Nov. 16 killings so that Cerna  could be questioned in safety about her statements that she had seen armed men  in Salvadoran army-type camouflage uniforms at the time of the pre-dawn  massacre.  </P> <P> But after three days of questioning, Cerna changed her original story, saying  she heard gunfire but saw nothing. She and her family now are living in a  secret location in the United States under the care of American Jesuits.  </P> <P> Both Cerna and her husband failed an FBI-administered lie-detector test after  they changed their original testimony, authorities said. There was no  explanation as to why the polygraph was not given earlier.  </P> <P> David Runkel, a top assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said the FBI  interviews were reviewed by department officials last week after Archbishop  Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Roman Catholic primate of El Salvador, complained  that the United States was subjecting Cerna to brainwashing and "psychological  torment."  </P> <P> "People within the department are satisfied that the entire process was  conducted in a proper fashion," Runkel said.  </P> <P> He added that the FBI is providing additional support for the Salvadoran police  investigation of the killings. The investigation was ordered by President  Alfredo Cristiani, whom the United States is supporting in a war against  leftist guerrillas.  </P> <P> Margaret Tutwiler, briefing reporters at the State Department, said a  department representative attended all the sessions at which the Cernas were  questioned.  </P> <P> "We absolutely and unequivocally deny any allegation that U.S. officials  mistreated the witness," Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> A report by the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights said Cerna changed her story  only because she was "frightened and intimidated by the harsh manner" of the  questioning. The report was given to reporters by R. Scott Greathead, an  officer and first assistant attorney general of New York state.  </P> <P> Father Paul S. Tipton, president of the Assn. of Jesuit Colleges and  Universities, endorsed findings in the committee's report.  </P> <P> The report added that Jorge Cerna, after first supporting his wife's story,  also recanted his account under pressure.  </P> <P> "Like most Salvadorans who have witnessed crimes implicating the military or  security forces . . , he has a natural distrust of government investigators,"  the report said.  </P> <P> Aside from the House subcommittee's probe of Cerna's treatment, a task force  appointed by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) will investigate all  aspects of the killings.  </P></p>

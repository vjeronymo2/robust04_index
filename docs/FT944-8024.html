			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Linklaters aims to win US securities business - Legal Briefs Linklaters &amp; Paines, the City solicitors, has appointed Edward Fleischman, former commissioner with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, to help give the firm a US securities law capability. Linklaters plans to develop the methods and resources necessary to provide US legal advice on international securities transactions. This way, it hopes to offer clients a full service, making it unnecessary for them to use US law firms when they want to access American markets. The need for US securities law expertise has arisen mainly in the past three years, as US investors have shown an increased appetite for foreign securities, and the SEC has liberalised its rules, making it easier for foreign issuers to gain access to the US markets. Linklaters says that, while this has eased part of the compliance burden on issuers, clients have remained worried about potential liability under the US Securities Act and the risks of litigation in the US. As a result, even when the clients were placing only part of an issue in the US, they have been advised to approach the whole transaction according to US domestic practice, and have used US law firms to handle the business.</p>

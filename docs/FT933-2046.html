			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / 'Nerve gas' chemical export allowed in spite of warning THE government approved the export of potentially lethal chemical products to Egypt in 1986 in spite of intelligence information from the prime minister's office that that country was being used as a diversionary route for Iraq, a former foreign office minister said yesterday. Mr Timothy Renton, foreign office minister from October 1985 to June 1987, told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that three government departments - the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry - approved a 26-ton shipment of hydrogen fluoride in September 1986. The chemical can be used in the military application of a type of nerve gas being used at the time by the Iraqis within the country and against Iran. Documents made available to the inquiry show that in January 1986 an intelligence warning was circulated among ministers by Sir Charles Powell, then foreign policy adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, warning that Egypt had bought substantial quantities of the chemical on behalf of Iraq and was planning to export more in the following months. Mr Renton told the inquiry that he had dropped his initial opposition to the export of the chemical because there had been no 'collateral' confirmation of the intelligence information provided by the Israeli secret service. He had given his final agreement on the understanding that the Egyptian government would be told of the UK's concern that the chemicals might be rerouted to Iraq and put to military use. Even then, the Foreign Office delayed conveying its concerns so as not to upset Egypt as Mr Renton was preparing an official visit to Cairo, the inquiry heard. It emerged yesterday that Mr Renton had answered an initial list of questions from the Scott inquiry in early June, saying he had no memory of countries having been used as a diversionary route to Iraq. He referred to the hydrogen fluoride licence after examining government documents supplied to him by Lord Justice Scott. Mr Renton yesterday confirmed that in February 1986 he had sided with Mr Norman Lamont, then minister for defence procurement, in approving a contract linking the government-owned company International Military Services to an Iraqi complex subsequently used for testing missiles, including French-made Exocets. Mr Lamont had written to Mr Renton stating that the IMS 'cannot be interpreted as a real enhancement of the Iraqi war effort'. Ministers admit ban on exports to Iraq, Page 8 Observer, Page 19</p>

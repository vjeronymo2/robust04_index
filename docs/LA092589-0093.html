			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAZA PROJECT'S SCULPTED TOWER WOULD GIVE L.A. SKYLINE FLAIR  </P> <P> The proposed design of the Grand Avenue Plaza development downtown by Pacific  Atlas Development is as distinctive as it is controversial.  </P> <P> Encompassing a city block bounded by Seventh, Eighth and Olive streets, and  Grand Avenue, the design attempts to meld a variety of uses in a variety of  styles in three stages of development.  </P> <P> One of the uses involves the demolition of two buildings of historic interest  on Seventh Street, a proposal that is opposed by preservationists and has  delayed the necessary approvals by the city's Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> The most clearly defined elements in the design at present are the proposed  office tower, at the northeast corner of Grand and Eighth, and a mid-block  landscaped plaza, which together compose the development's first stage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mid-Block Garden Planned  </P> <P> The tower, as revealed in plans and renderings, is to be a 34-story structure  clad in a blue-green reflective glass curtain wall that wraps around the  building. This illusion of enfolded walls is accented on the south facade by a  four-story setback cut into the upper stories.  </P> <P> Designed by Richard Keating of the local office of Skidmore, Owings &amp;  Merrill, the tower is very much a signature structure in a slick, sculpted late  Modernist style. In this respect it is similar in spirit to some of the office  buildings that the architect designed when practicing in Dallas and Houston,  and that mark the skylines there.  </P> <P> As such, the Grand Avenue Plaza tower promises to attract attention and lend an  architectural flair to the changing downtown Los Angeles skyline. Another boxy,  boring building in the severe International style it is not.  </P> <P> Promising to be equally distinctive is the proposed mid-block garden plaza,  designed by the landscape architectural firms of Michael Van Valkenburgh &amp;  Assoc. and Emmet Wemple &amp; Assoc. The plan generally is what is called a  soft design, emphasizing a diversity of plantings and a minimum of furnishings.  A free-standing restaurant edges Grand Avenue. Particularly engaging is a  suggested thick bamboo grove, on the site where another office tower is  proposed in a distant third stage of the development.  </P> <P> The controversy concerning the project centers on the Seventh Street frontage,  and the existing Brockman and Coulter building shells, built in 1912 and 1917,  respectively. The second stage of the Pacific Atlas proposal calls for a  500-room luxury hotel on the site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historic Strip  </P> <P> The 13-story Renaissance Revival styled Brockman building, with its ornate  terra cotta cornice and detailing, and the more modest four story Coulter  Building, distinguished by a curved corner bay, together hint of a time when  Seventh Street was a prime retail district. Though neither of the structures  individually is of landmark quality, their massing, scale and detailing do work  in concert with other dated buildings along the street, forming a unique  historic strip. A walk there is a featured tour titled "Seventh Street: Mecca  for Merchants," conducted by the Los Angeles Conservancy.  </P> <P> Studies have indicated that despite their ages and structural problems it is  possible to recycle the Brockman and Coulter buildings as a hotel, a position  being urged by the Conservancy.  </P> <P> However, the effort would entail costly construction problems Pacific Atlas  clearly prefers to avoid. As an alternative, it has proposed a new hotel be  designed in the spirit of the old buildings, respecting the street's 150-foot  cornice height limit and reflecting the massing, texture and tone of the  neighboring historic structures. In addition, the ground floor would be lined  with retail shops to help animate the sidewalk.  </P> <P> Pacific Atlas said the new hotel has not yet been designed, but it did show a  rendering of what the Seventh Street facade might look like. The rendering,  though somewhat out of scale and sketchily detailed, hinted at a  sympathetically massed and warmly faced and detailed structure. Renderings do  tend to present idealized scenes.  </P></p>

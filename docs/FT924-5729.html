			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Vodafone at top of expectations with Pounds 160m VODAFONE, the mobile communications group, reported a 23 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30. This was largely due to continued growth in its customer base despite the recession and improved profit margins. Profits, which were at the high end of expectations, were Pounds 160m compared with Pounds 130m. They were achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 286m to Pounds 320m. The share price rose by 14p to 401p. Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, said the results for the full year 'should be good'. He also revealed that Vodafone's UK cellular network, which accounts for the lion's share of group business, signed up 24,000 subscribers to its new LowCall service aimed at residential customers since it was launched six weeks ago. This offers customers cheaper monthly payments in exchange for higher call charges. Half the customers were new while the other half had changed from Vodafone's main business service. Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director, said the number of net new subscribers increased to 20,000 in the three months to the end of September. The proportion of customers leaving the network fell slightly to an annualised rate of 20 per cent. However, Mr Gent said that this 'churn' rate would increase in the next few months because one of the company's service providers was in the process of dis-connecting some 7,000 customers. Mr Whent said that he expected profit margins to decline in the future because most of the benefits of economies of scale had been achieved while new services such as LowCall carried lower profit mar-gins. Next spring, Vodafone will relaunch its pan-European digital service which currently has only 50 paying customers. Later next year it plans to launch its micro cellular network which will offer customers cheaper call rates. Mr Whent said that other businesses in the Vodafone group, apart from the main network company, such as its service provider and paging units were 'going well'. Earnings per share were 23 per cent up at 10.76p (8.76p), while the interim dividend rises 20 per cent to 3.43p, against 2.86p. Net cash balance at September 30 was Pounds 158m. See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [First announcer] Jose Antonio (de la Osa) today  published an article in GRANMA on AIDS, which as you all know is  the disease of the century. The article is entitled,  "Irresponsible Sexual Conduct is Suicidal." It contains very  precise data, which I find very interesting and which you should  know about.    According to this article, the AIDS prevention and control  program that the Ministry of Public Health has successfully been  carrying out has made it possible to, up to the end of 1993,  diagnose 988 patients in Cuba as HIV-positive. Of these, 236  have fallen ill, and, as of 31 December 1993, 148 had died.    During 1993, 102 seropositive individuals were detected,  from  the close to 2 million test results examined, tests made with  reagents produced by Cuba's pharmaceutical industry. There are  more details. Let's see what Dr. (Manuel Santin Pena) said. He  is the national director for epidemiology of the Ministry of  Public Health. Eddy?    [Announcer identified only as "Eddy"] Well, he said that the  blood banks are well monitored; it is therefore not possible in  Cuba to catch the disease of the century through blood  transfusions. Practically the only way to contract the virus in  our environment is therefore through sex, which makes it  dependent on an individual's sense of responsibility and conduct  in selecting a partner and using condoms properly.    Dr. (Santin) commented: Irresponsible conduct is quite  simply  suicidal. He also said that the prevention program is in the  process of being perfected. According to (Santin), sanatorium  care will continue to be made more flexible.    In the last few years, those seropositive individuals who  have become more aware regarding their illness are being offered  facilities to allow them to live within the society and within  their families. The experience gained now permits us to begin  the system of outpatient care, which can be extended to all  seropositive people who take a responsibile attitude toward the  family and the society and who, moreover, voluntarily request  such care. The Ministry of Public Health will maintain  sanatorium care, which will continue to play an important role  in the program against AIDS, while at the same time trying to  reach out further into the community. Care of the seropositive  will be the responsibility of the Family Doctor Program  physicians, and they will, through interconsultations, receive  the specialized care they require including, free, the specific  medications required by their condition as carriers of the AIDS  virus.    It is important to remember that the AIDS virus dies quickly  once outside the human body. This explains why casual contact  does not provide a vehicle for the transmission of AIDS. Can  AIDS be transmitted by a kiss on the mouth? It is true that the  virus has been found in saliva, and in tears. This discovery,  logically, provoked concern, but the truth of the matter is that  in order to transmit the disease by mouth, the virus would have  to make direct contact with the circulating blood. Up to the  present, there has not been a single report of anyone's having  contracted AIDS from a kiss on the mouth. Neither are there any  reports of people having become infected through common use of a  glass, flatware, or bed linens.    This has been an article carried in the newspaper GRANMA  today and signed by comrade Jose Antonio (de la Osa), entitled:  "In Connection With the Disease of the Century: Irresponsible  Sexual Behavior is Suicidal."</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour hopes to be champion of businesses MR GORDON BROWN will today stake Labour's claim as the champion of small and medium-sized businesses, as the party continues its co-ordinated campaign to seize the middle-ground of politics. Following party leader Mr John Smith's rejection of traditional policy dogmas on Sunday, the shadow chancellor will set out Labour's position against 'entrenched' economic interests, such as banks and utilities, arguing that their influence means businesses and ordinary citizens lost out. Urging moves towards increased competition and more effective regulation, Mr Brown will tell an audience of Labour backbenchers that the government is incapable of addressing the problems these entrenched interests create. He will call for an immediate Mergers and Monopolies Commission inquiry into the small business services provided by banks, which Labour believes are exercising too much power with too little responsibility. To back his claim, Mr Brown will publish figures alleging that, in the four years to 1991 when thousands of small companies were going bankrupt, the high street banks substantially raised their dividends. The party yesterday signalled a fresh offensive in its campaign for root-and-branch reform of financial services regulation, calling for a 'complete overhaul' of the present self-regulatory regime. In an early day motion tabled by all three junior front-bench Treasury spokesmen, Labour asserted that the present seven-year-old system had failed. It also called for a 'proper and effective' replacement 'without further delay'. The motion stopped short of demanding a supra-regulatory body, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission the motion said the new regime should be 'supervised by a majority of those representing the public interest and not by a convention of vested interests of the industry.' It noted that no 'adequate' regulatory regime was 'likely to be in place before 1994'. It said any new system 'must have sufficient power and resources to regulate the sale of financial products.' The motion concluded by attacking the government's failure to 'take any interest' in the subject, which it said illustrated it had 'chosen to side with the vested interests of the industry rather than the interests of the public'. The government has ruled out bringing forward fresh legislation, indicating it would prefer to see reform within the existing system. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said last year that tougher control of City institutions by regulators was needed to overcome shortcomings in present laws. A second Labour motion, tabled by the same group of frontbenchers, sought to highlight problems associated with home income plans - a financial product sold mainly to elderly people in the late 1980s as a means of releasing income from their homes.</p>

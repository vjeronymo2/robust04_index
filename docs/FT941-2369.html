			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets FRANKFURT Bayerische Hypobank opens the German banks' reporting season tomorrow with Hoare Govett forecasting a 27.8 per cent rise in operating profit for 1993, the strongest rate of increase for the sector. Vereinsbank, whose figures come on Thursday, is expected to show a 26 per cent rise. Full-year figures from Veba on Thursday are expected to show a continuation of the trend seen at nine months, when net profits fell 14 per cent. Tomorrow sees the start of the subscription period for Porsche's one-for-four rights issue, aimed at raising DM200m to help fund new sports car developments. PARIS A busy week is in store for financial sector, where stocks have been recouping some lost ground recently. UAP is due to report today, with NatWest Securities forcasting net profit rising by 39 per cent to FFr 1.5bn. Flat figures are expected from Cie Bancaire and Credit National when they report tomorrow. Consensus estimates are for a 7 per cent rise in net profits from Societe Generale on Friday. MILAN Another busy week for the soon to be privatised telecommunications sector is expected as the country prepares to go to the polls next Sunday and Monday. With no further opinion polls permitted ahead of the vote, the market is likely to be dominated by speculation about the likely composition of the new coalition administration. ZURICH Georg Fischer, the engineering group which is heavily dependent on the depressed German motor industry, is expected to post a full-year loss of around SFr40m to SFr45m tomorrow. However, many analysts believe that the worst may now be over for the restructured engineering group as the global economy begins to pick up. Sandoz is due to report on Thursday and consensus estimates are for a 13 per cent rise in net profit to about SFr1.7bn. TOKYO The market faces a final round of profit-taking ahead of the March book closing, although foreign demand remains strong. However, figures for household spending in January and the diffusion index of business and economic conditions could support share prices.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK markets With equity markets falling worldwide, it is hardly surprising that the UK is suffering too. Disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut rates on Friday is depressing Wall Street as well as Europe. And there is an additional fear in the US that interest rate cuts alone may not be enough to get the economy moving. Strong deflationary forces are clearly still at work everywhere. But London's 103-point fall also reflects the nerve-wracking vacuum in economic policy. With over Pounds 40bn of gilts to sell next year, the government needs the help of foreign investors. They might be reassured by a strong fiscal stance which underpinned the gilt market and, by keeping gilt yields down, also helped support equities. However, the government is poorly placed to give such a lead. Lower spending means either a bruising public sector pay round or the axing of large and politically sensitive capital spending programmes. And Mr Major would hardly have the gall to put up income tax after the election campaign. Gilt yields thus appear heading back towards 10 per cent, putting further pressure on equities. And despite devaluation, it is difficult to see where strong economic growth will come from. Consumer sectors are constrained by high interest rates, and any spurt in consumer spending would see the balance of payments deteriorate quickly. Weak markets abroad mean exporters will have to take market share from others to boost sales. The inflation position is worsening. When sterling was at DM2.50, retail price rises might have been expected to reach 4.5 per cent next year. A further 10 per cent devaluation from that point could see inflation close to 6 per cent notwithstanding the slack in the domestic economy. The equity market needs better news from overseas before it can discount a UK recovery.</p>

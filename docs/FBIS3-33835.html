			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, chairman of the Patriotic </F> Union of Kurdistan, by Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof in Arbil,  northern Iraq; date not given]    [Text] [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Mr. Talabani, when will the  new Kurdish autonomy fail?    [Talabani] We have freed ourselves from the Iraqi tyranny  and this gives us the strength to resist, the strength to bear  all difficulties.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] For how long?    [Talabani] Forever. Certainly, the economy is very bad.  But there are also rays of light. Thousands of Kurdish  villages that were destroyed by Saddam have meanwhile been  reconstructed. The people are returning to the rural areas and  they are beginning to produce food again. Last year we had  enough grain, rice, vegetables, and fruit.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Iraqi Kurdistan is surrounded by  countries that do not exhibit any sympathetic feelings for  Kurdish democracy -- in Turkey and in Iran there are also large  Kurdish minorities. And the West does not want Iraq to crumble  and chaos to develop.    [Talabani] In order to avoid chaos, our autonomy must be  preserved. We will defend ourselves against any attack on us --  this will then lead to chaos. Iraq can remain united in the  long run only as a democracy.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Or under a strong dictator.    [Talabani] No. A strong dictator has just lost. Saddam has  split Iraq. Now everybody is fighting everybody else: Sunni  against Shi'ite, Sunni against Kurd, Turkmen against Arab.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] When your people fled from Saddam  Husayn's army, the world paid attention to the Iraqi Kurds. Now  international attention is rather directed toward the Kurds in  Turkey and watches Ankara's armed struggle against the  guerrillas of the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK.    [Talabani] Turkey must remain unified. However, Kurdish  rights must be accepted in this framework. If Turkish  propaganda pretends that there is only the PKK problem, it just  helps this organization. It becomes popular.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you feel solidarity with the armed  struggle of the PKK?    [Talabani] Of course, we have differences with the PKK. We  want nothing to do with its Marxism-Leninism. We do not agree  with its tactics in Western Europe. We believe that a popular  struggle is more effective than the occupation of embassy  buildings or airline offices. Above all, we believe that it is  not a realistic demand to divide Turkey.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Occasionally you meet Mr. Ocalan, the  leader of the PKK. Do you then recommend that he give up the  armed struggle?    [Talabani] No, but I urge him to look for political  solutions. Last March he announced a unilateral cease-fire.  Unfortunately, there was no positive response the other side.  Ankara did not want to negotiate. The end of this cease-fire  was a tragedy -- 32 Turkish soldiers were massacred. We  condemned that.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Ocalan is a Stalinist. Can one actually  negotiate with him?    [Talabani] Certainly. One can hold a dialogue with anyone  in the world. You saw how Mr. Rabin shook Mr. 'Arafat's hand.  And a short time ago it was inconceivable that Her Majesty's  prime minister would talk to the IRA. Why should this not be  possible in Turkey? Mr. Ocalan has indicated to me through  mutual friends that he is willing to make peace. Whether you  like Ocalan or not: He heads the biggest Kurdish movement that  has ever existed in Turkish history. One cannot ignore that.</p>

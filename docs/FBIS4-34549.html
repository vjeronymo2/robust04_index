			<p>BFN     [Text] A trade agreement between Caricom and Colombia would  allow some Caricom producers duty-free access to the Colombian  market for four years. Trinidad and Tobago's Foreign Affairs  Minister Ralph Maraj believes that the twin republic could be  one of the principal beneficiaries. Caricom heads are expected  to sign the agreement when they meet in Barbados in July.  Minister Maraj says that while NAFTA will also be high on the  agenda, efforts to bring about a Caricom single market must  continue at least for now. Nicole Huggins tells us more:    [Begin recording] [Huggins] The trade agreement between  Caricom and Colombia will allow some Caricom producers duty-free  access to the Colombian market and a fees reduction of up to 33  and a third percent of duty on other goods. Foreign Affairs  Minister Ralph Maraj says this is similar to the agreement which  already exists between Caricom and Venezuela.    [Maraj] It is an improved agreement, even though you have  reciprocity, and I think that view is shared by the experts in  the field as well as the businessmen who will now be seeking to  take advantage of this agreement.    [Huggins] After four years, Caricom countries would be  required to provide reciprocal access to Colombian products.  Caricom heads are expected to sign the agreement when they meet  in Barbados in July. Also on the heads of government's agenda  are studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement and its  possible impact on Caricom countries. Although countries such  as Trinidad and Tobago have already applied for individual entry  into NAFTA, Minister Maraj insists it is not too late for a  regional approach.    [Maraj] I think there was a wisdom in the effects of  [passage  indistinct], and I think that that is now commonly accepted, and  I feel that as you say, we will have an even more, well a more  certain and [word indistinct] approach to the whole matter. We  also need to get more information as we engage in the  negotiating process, which is to come at a later point in time.  And once we have that information, it will strengthen our  position to do justice to ourselves.    [Huggins] The heads will also continue work on a common  Caricom currency, an integral part of the proposed single  market. Given the uncertainty of NAFTA, Minister Maraj says this  subregional effort must continue. [end recording]</p>

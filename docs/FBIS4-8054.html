			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] Gorazde increasingly resembles a mass grave. Over  100 dead and about 500 wounded are the consequence of the  frenzied attacks by Karadzic's followers. Nothing is known  about the fate of many people from the right bank of the Drina  River. Many are believed to have been massacred and left among  the charred remains of villages in the southern section of the  battlefield. The battle hospital is caring for the wounded with  superhuman efforts. There are no medicines, no surgical  equipment, no power. There is also no hope that Gorazde's  hellish experience is nearing an end. On the contrary, the  attacks are increasing.    Deadly tank shells are raining down from Ustipraca on both  banks of the Drina. Infantry attacks against the defense lines  of Kopaci are supported with fire from howitzers and all other  artillery weapons. Chetniks are also attacking the defence  lines of Gotunjak, [place name indistinct] Hill and Gradina.  They are also launching attacks on the northern side of Gorazde  from the direction of Metvici, toward the villages of Vrazalice  and Tvitjak, and the Trovrh peak.    The situation, however, is most critical at the approaches  to  the town, on the right bank of the Drina. Serbian and  Montenegrin volunteers are systematically firing at civilian  facilities. The town is being systematically destroyed with all  available weapons since 0900 -- street by street, house by  house. Many houses have been destroyed, many are in flames. It  is futile to expect anything to change here without an urgent  intervention by the international community.</p>

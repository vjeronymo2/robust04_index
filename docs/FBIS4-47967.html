			<p>BFN     [Text] Krahn and Mandingo frontline commanders of ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] have  agreed to cease fire [words indistinct]. They have also agreed  that all roads within ULIMO-controlled areas be under the  control of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and be open for free passage for  all persons.    These agreements were reached yesterday at the end of a  meeting between the two groups at ECOMOG headquarters in  Monrovia. The joint communique, signed by both groups, also  says that the hierarchy of ULIMO leadership will meet in  Monrovia Monday [9 May] under the auspices of ECOMOG and UNOMIL  [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] to effectively reunite the  ULIMO family.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: French insurer buys stake in Sauternes producer AXA, one of France's largest insurance groups, has increased its wine interests by buying control of Chateau Suduiraut, one of the best-known sources of Sauternes wine, in a deal worth around FFr108m (Dollars 20m). Chateau Suduiraut, a 17th century castle at Preignac in the Gironde region of south-west France, produces one of France's most famous Sauternes. The chateau, in which Axa is acquiring a 51 per cent stake, has an estate of 200 hectares, of which 88 are currently in production. Axa, together with a number of other French financial institutions including Groupe des Assurances Nationales and Assurances Generales de France in insurance and the Credit Foncier bank, is an active investor in the wine industry. It already has wine interests in Pauillac, Pomerol, Saint-Emilion and Burgundy. Fimat, the futures broking unit of France's Societe Generale, has reinforced its presence in Singapore by buying Babcock Fulton Prebon, one of the market's leading participants. As a result, Fimat will become a clearing member of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Right-winger hints at 'looming' violence South Africa's most prominent right-wing leader, Gen Constand Viljoen, yesterday warned that conservative Afrikaners would use violence to bolster their demand for an ethnic homeland, reflecting an apparent shift in right-wing strategy toward the greater use of violence. Gen Viljoen, who has long tried to moderate the actions of his more radical right-wing colleagues, warned: 'sometimes you have to use a little bit of violence to prevent further big violence and clashes. There is a clash looming in our country'. He said the right could prevent next April's elections altogether if it decided on a boycott. Gen Viljoen was speaking as the deadline approached for changes to the new constitution aimed at accommodating the demand for Afrikaner self-determination. All changes are due to be agreed by next Monday. Negotiators from the right-wing Freedom Alliance were meeting the African National Congress and the government to discuss possible changes, but conservative Afrikaner leaders said they expected little from the talks. The Afrikaner Volksfront, the umbrella group which Gen Viljoen heads, plans to declare unilateral independence from South Africa next Saturday unless its demands are met. It will declare its own 'transitional authority' to rival the multi-racial Transitional Executive Council set up in December to oversee the run-up to all-race elections. ANC leader Nelson Mandela said Gen Viljoen's statements were 'very regrettable.' Though he sympathised with minority fears, he would never contemplate a separate state for Afrikaners, though the ANC could accept a state where Afrikaners exercise autonomy so long as all people in it had the same citizenship and voting rights. The secretary-general of the Commonwealth invited post-apartheid South Africa yesterday to rejoin the association after a break of 33 years, Reuter reports.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BLAZERS PUTTING THEIR STAMP ON NBA THIS YEAR  </P> <P> Like 10 teams before them, the San Antonio Spurs became reluctant admirers.  Last season, they were eliminated from the playoffs in Portland when they lost  a seven-point lead late in Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal series.  They were so close to winning. They were so close to being as good as the Trail  Blazers. So it was quite surprising to them when they visited Portland the  first time this season and watched almost helplessly as the Blazers bolted to a  31-point lead after one quarter. After the Blazers strolled to a 117-103  victory, Spurs' Coach Larry Brown said the Blazers could have beaten the  All-Decade team that night. David Robinson summarized the feelings of the rest  of the league.  </P> <P> "If they do that to other people," Robinson said after the Blazers improved  their record to 11-0, "it's going to be a scary season for the rest of us."  </P> <P> The Blazers have, in a sense, come back to earth. Since then, they've had a  record of "only" 13-3, and they even lost two road games -- but not until they  won their first eight.  </P> <P> Still, there are many reasons for opponents to fear the Blazers, who made their  only Madison Square Garden appearance Wednesday, beating the New York Knicks.  And their 26-3 record -- a reflection of the outstanding group of players the  Blazers have assembled -- is only a part of it.  </P> <P> For opponents, the scariest part of the Blazers' makeup is that they have begun  to act like champions -- off the court as well as on. They've developed their  own sort of Blazers mystique, and that often can be the forerunner of rings and  trophies.  </P> <P> Blazers management has a championship attitude. After the key move of obtaining  power forward Buck Williams, whose strength was the key ingredient the Blazers  needed to reach the finals last season, the Blazers did not stand still. They  acquired Danny Ainge in the offseason, and the former Celtics' standout has  provided the Blazers with championship experience (he was on two title teams),  great outside shooting and another boost in confidence.  </P> <P> Great teams make great player moves. In the last two years, the Blazers have  made two.  </P> <P> Management also has taken steps to ensure the Blazers have no salary  controversies. Since October, the Blazers have given Clyde Drexler a one-year,  $8-million extension; given Williams a one-year, $4-million extension, and  signed Jerome Kersey to a four-year, $11-million contract. Terry Porter has a  six-year, $13-million contract and Kevin Duckworth has an eight-year,  $14-million deal.  </P> <P> Great teams are willing to spend money to win titles. The Blazers have opened  the vault, which has provided the players with a feeling of security and a  future of continuity.  </P> <P> "We have a feeling of togetherness," Drexler said. "The guys know we're going  to be around for a while. The teams that have had a lot of success are the ones  that have stayed together. That's the beautiful thing about this. The nucleus  could easily play together for five more years -- at least five years. It's a  great situation."  </P> <P> And the Blazers even have a recent championship trend on their side. Six times  since 1970, a team that has lost in the finals came back to win the title the  next season. The frustration of accomplishing so much and advancing so far, yet  ending the season only second best has been a powerful motivator. The Blazers  have felt it, and are feeling it, which is why they don't seem to be too  impressed by their impressive start.  </P> <P> "It sure does look sweet," Porter said, "but you have to keep it in  perspective. It's great to get off to a good start, but it doesn't mean  anything if you flop at the end."  </P> <P> Barring injuries, it seems unlikely the Blazers will flop. They may be beaten  but it's going to take a great team to do it.  </P> <P> With Ainge joining Drexler and Porter, the Blazers have perhaps the best  three-guard rotation in the league. Drexler again is demonstrating his  considerable all-around skills, averaging 23 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.9  assists. Porter averages 18.3 points and 8.8 assists, and Ainge averages 11.8  points in only 21.3 minutes. There is no letup.  </P> <P> Up front, Williams averages 9.9 rebounds, Duckworth averages 15.5 points with  good outside shooting and a clever assortment of inside moves, and the  acrobatic Kersey averages 14.4 points. The Blazers got a steal in the draft  last year with 6-10 Cliff Robinson, who has benefited from the experience of  his rookie year and averages 11 points. Robinson fits in perfectly with the  Blazers' other role players, 6-10 center Wayne Cooper and backup point guard  Danny Young.  </P> <P> "Everything is here," Williams said. "We've got outside shooting, we can go  quick, we can go with power, we can go with a defensive team. We can go any  which way."  </P> <P> The Blazers have even developed a little arrogance.  </P> <P> "We should have won the title last year," Drexler said. "Not to take anything  away from Detroit. They know what it took to win and they did it. But we want  to go the extra step."  </P></p>

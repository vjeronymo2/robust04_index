But if war is unavoidable, North Korea will not be  another Iraq, which suffered an ignominious defeat in the Gulf  war, the official declared in an exclusive interview with YONHAP  news agency.    North Korea has been patiently awaiting a resolution of the  nuclear issue, but "since our existence depends on it, we will  resolutely face the problem, unafraid," the official said on  condition of anonymity.    Obviously aware of a move by the United States to refer the  nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council for economic  sanctions, the official said North Korea "has managed to go on  living without help from the United States, Japan and Russia."    "They all have to know that even a worm, if stepped on,  wriggles," he said, by way of warning that North Korea would not  submit meekly to military provocation.    The official, however, made no negative comments on China,  backing up past speculation that Pyongyang has been in close  consultation with Beijing on the nuclear issue.    Asked about the possibility of contact between the United  States and North Korea prior to the International Atomic Energy  Agency's Board of Governors' meeting Feb. 21, he said he knew  nothing about it.</p>

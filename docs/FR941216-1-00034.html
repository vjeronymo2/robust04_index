			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Other special rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although most contingent payment debt instruments can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealt with under the above provisions, the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide additional rules for certain other circumstances. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, the proposed regulations provide rules for a holder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose basis in a contingent payment debt instrument is different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the debt instrument's adjusted issue price (e.g., a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary market purchaser of the debt instrument). Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations, the holder continues to accrue interest and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine adjustments based on the original projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule. The holder, however, must allocate the difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between basis and adjusted issue price to the accruals or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected payments on the debt instrument over the remaining term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the debt instrument. Amounts allocated to a taxable year are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovered as if they were positive or negative adjustments, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations require only a reasonable, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than an exact, allocation of the difference between basis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted issue price. For example, if almost all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference is attributable to changes in the expected value of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment, the holder may allocate the difference to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment. Similarly, a taxpayer may allocate a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the difference to accruals if the taxpayer determines that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion is attributable to changes in interest rates. A taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may make this determination by comparing rates on similar debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments, by looking to changes in standard interest rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indices that have occurred since the date the contingent payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument was issued, or by other appropriate means. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations require the holder's allocation to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of a contingent payment debt instrument that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange listed property (within the meaning of &sect;1.1273&hyph;2(f)(2)),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations provide a safe harbor that allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holders to account for the difference between the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument's adjusted issue price and the holder's basis under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same rules that apply to acquisition premium on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncontingent debt instrument under section 1272(a)(7) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1272&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and Treasury recognize that the method provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations for allocating the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis and adjusted issue price may be difficult to apply because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the difference may be attributable to both changes in interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates and in the expected values of the contingent payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other methods for making the allocation were considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafting the proposed regulations, but were not adopted because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were not believed to be sufficiently accurate. The IRS and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury believe that contingent payment debt instruments (other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than exchange listed debt instruments) rarely trade in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary market and, therefore, the need to make the allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will occur only infrequently. The IRS and Treasury request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also provide rules for a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument that has a contingent payment that is fixed more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6 months before the payment is due. Under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, an adjustment is made on the date the payment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed, and the amount of the adjustment is equal to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between the present value of the fixed amount and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjusted issue price is modified to reflect the adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the projected payment schedule is changed to reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed payment. The IRS and Treasury are concerned about whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this method may produce inappropriate accelerations of income or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deductions and request comments on whether other methods, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a method that spreads the income or deductions, are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed regulations provide rules for debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments that have both payments that are contingent as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time and payments that are contingent as to amount. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer has an option to put or call the debt instrument, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange the debt instrument for other property, or to extend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maturity date of the debt instrument, the projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule is determined by using the principles of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5). Under the proposed regulations, if an option to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> put, call, or exchange the debt instrument is assumed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercised under the principles of &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5), it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally reasonable to assume that the option is exercised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately before it expires. If the option is exercised at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier time, the exercise is treated as a sale or exchange of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations reserve on other types of timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingencies. The IRS and Treasury request comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate treatment of other types of timing contingencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Method for Debt Instruments Not Subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Noncontingent Bond Method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed regulations provide a method for contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment debt instruments not subject to the noncontingent bond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method. In general, the method applies to a debt instrument that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has an issue price determined under &sect;1.1274&hyph;2 (e.g., a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonpublicly traded debt instrument issued in a sale or exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nonpublicly traded property). The method in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations is generally similar to the rules prescribed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;4(c) of the 1986 proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulations, the payments on a contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment debt instrument (the overall debt instrument) are divided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into two components: (1) a noncontingent component consisting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all noncontingent payments and the projected amounts of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quotable contingent payments, and (2) a contingent component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisting of all nonquotable contingent payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The noncontingent component is treated as a separate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument and is taxed under the general OID rules (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the noncontingent bond method if the separate debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for quotable contingent payments). However, no interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments on the separate debt instrument are qualified stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payments and the de minimis rules do not apply to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate debt instrument. The issue price of the separate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument is the issue price of the overall debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See the discussion below for the determination of the stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal amount and the imputed principal amount of the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument for purposes of section 1274.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, a nonquotable contingent payment is not taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account until the payment is made. When a nonquotable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment (other than a contingent payment accompanied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a payment of adequate stated interest) is made, a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the payment is treated as principal, based on the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by discounting the payment at the AFR from the payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date to the issue date, and the remainder is treated as interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special rules are provided if a nonquotable contingent payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes fixed more than 6 months before it is due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

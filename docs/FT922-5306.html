			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (1): Victim of its own success - Singapore has become not only a regional economic power but also a country poised to jump into the very top league of industrialised countries. But behind the image of achievement and efficiency there are problems SINGAPORE is short of labour. It is short of land. But it is not short of statistics. Officials quickly deluge the visitor with sets of figures to illustrate that the island republic, only 573 sq km in area and with a population of less than 3m, has become not only a regional economic power but also a country poised to jump into the top league of industrialised countries. GNP per capita is second only to Japan in Asia. The economy grew by 6.7 per cent last year and is forecast to grow - even in the midst of a recession in key western export markets - by between 4 per cent and 6 per cent this year. Singapore's trade is 3 1/2 times GDP. It has no foreign debts and official foreign reserves of Dollars 35bn. Singapore is the world's biggest container port and the third-biggest oil refining centre. It is at the cutting edge of technology in the electronics, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals industries. It produces more than half the world's computer disc drives. It is a regional centre for the shipbuilding industry. Each year more than 5m tourists arrive in Singapore. More than 3,000 foreign companies have set up operations in Singapore. There is full employment and more than 70 per cent of the population own their own apartments or houses. The city state prides itself on its clean and green image. Most of all it is proud of its efficiency. All this in a city which in 1960 was described by a travel magazine writer as being a cesspool of squalor and degradation. 'The Chinese, who constitute the main current of the city, live in utter filth and poverty' the writer noted. 'Their poverty is phenomenal. One must see with his own eyes to believe it.' There have been changes no less phenomenal over the years. But part the carefully washed and ironed curtains of Singapore achievement and efficiency and there are problems. Mr Goh Chok Tong took over as prime minister from Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's leader for more than 30 years, in late 1990. The baton change has not been an entirely smooth one. Mr Goh has found it difficult to escape from the shadow of Mr Lee. Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Lee's son who is crafted in his father's tough, no-nonsense image, exercises considerable influence as first deputy prime minister. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP), still headed by Mr Lee, performed badly in a general election last August. There are indications that portions of the Chinese working class, once solidly behind the PAP, feel they have missed out on Singapore's economic miracle. There are now four opposition members in the 81-seat parliament - a shocking state of affairs for a government that has traditionally been loathe to listen to any opposing voice. Singapore remains one of the world's most regulated societies. Its politics, the way its government exercises control over virtually every aspect of life, is often likened to the now defunct communist regimes of eastern Europe. The difference is that Singapore works, remains staunchly anti-communist and has been able to give many of its citizens financial rewards only dreamt about in eastern Europe. But the country has become a victim of its own success. Singapore's new leadership says it is now encouraging people to make their own decisions and do more for themselves. 'We recognise the government has an overwhelming presence in the economy and in fact in every sphere of a Singaporean's life' says the prime minister. 'In recent years we have been trying to shrink the presence of the government. . . you can see there is uncertainty in people's minds. They want the government to be there as a safety net or a guiding hand or to do things for them. . . we are at this stage of development.' One of the preoccupations of Mr Lee during his last years in power was that Singaporeans, spoiled by success and an excess of consumer goods, were going 'soft'. Some managers complain that it is difficult to find staff to take responsibility: too much control has bred a generation who pass decisions upwards rather than take responsibility themselves. Many of Singapore's companies - capital rich and with little room to expand at home - have been pampered by government support and still have to learn to compete internationally. Singapore aspires to becoming a regional communications hub - what its futuristic planners describe as a 'global city'. But the island republic remains a rather inward-looking society. Its leaders do not take kindly to criticism from outside. The local media is exceptionally mild mannered while foreign publications find it difficult to operate under various government restrictions. The government stresses that Singapore is an Asian or Oriental society. It remains suspicious of what it considers to be western influences such as pornography and divorce. Yet marital breakdown is an everyday reality and divorce rates have doubled over the past 10 years. When film censorship was recently relaxed people flocked to see a series of mildly pornographic films  -not from the west but Chinese films made in Hong Kong. In the broader regional sphere, Singapore emphasises the interdependence of the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, (Asean). Says the first deputy prime minister: 'Our interest is. . . in making Asean a stronger raft to attach ourselves to.' It seems Singapore feels that raft is still not entirely stable. It guards itself against the effects of any regional conflicts by maintaining a highly sophisticated and well-armed military machine. 'We should be like the poison shrimp, with bright colours to warn others of the poison we carry,' says a government policy handbook. Singapore's economic planners have shown considerable dexterity over the years in anticipating changes in the global market. Skills have constantly been upgraded, industries have diversified. Ten years ago, financial services accounted for only 7 per cent of GDP. According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore that figure is now 17 per cent. Singapore's centralised planning and the efficiency of its system has made Singapore top of the league with many multinational investors. But economic success has bred serious labour shortages. Singapore has had to import upwards of a 250,000 foreign workers to work mostly in the lower-paid sector. 'Job hopping' has become commonplace, particularly in the electronics sector. Recently, the government disclosed that SDollars 1bn of taxes remained uncollected - due to a chronic shortage of tax officers. Home-based skills are not plentiful enough to fill demand. More automation has been one response, but labour shortages could continue to be a constraint on growth in the years ahead. Another constraint is land: Singapore is literally running out of space. It is therefore giving very energetic backing and financial aid to the development of nearby Batam island in Indonesia. Mr Richard Hu, Singapore's finance minister, feels the economy has now entered a more mature phase of lower but more sustainable growth. 'We are comfortable with a pause,' says Mr Hu. 'We have been growing too fast over the past three or four years.' But rising wages at home and greater competition from other countries in the region pose a problem. 'We are not only competing now against the likes of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea but moving very fast up the ladder are Thailand and Malaysia,' says Mr Hu. 'More worrying in the long term is the south China area - it is beginning to nibble at the lower levels of our exports. We have to move upstream as quickly as possible.' Singapore's leaders pride themselves on their vision. They have identified many of the problems that lay ahead. Even the more pessimistic government forecasts plan on annual economic growth of well over 5 per cent over the next three years, rising to more than six per cent annually thereafter. By an unspecified 'Year X' Singapore plans to increase its area by 17 per cent through reclamation and landfill. To cope with labour shortages and the effects of an ageing population, bigger families are encouraged, particularly among the more educated. Sceptics might question some of Singapore's aims. But its leaders are determined. The prime minister says Mr Lee Kuan Yew taught him never to be afraid to go against the conventional wisdom. 'People may laugh, they may snigger,' says Mr Goh 'But we must carry on. We know our plans can be effective.'</p>

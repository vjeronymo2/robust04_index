			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUM'S THE WORD AS SECRET LAUNCH TIME GETS AIRED  </P> <P> So much for government secrecy.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials had quietly passed the word among reporters covering the  space shuttle here that a satellite would be launched on a Delta rocket  Wednesday night from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as part of the  Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as "Star Wars."  </P> <P> Mum was to be the word, the officials said, until after the launch. Not even  the date, let alone the time, was to be released.  </P> <P> Never mind that shrimp boat captains had been warned to stay out of the area  between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. PST Wednesday, or that the trade magazine Aviation  Week &amp; Space Technology estimated the satellite launch time earlier this  month, or that a NASA spokesman actually announced the launch time during a  televised shuttle briefing Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Press Kit Overflows  </P> <P> Even the Defense Department's own press kit overflowed with information about  the satellite.  </P> <P> That's because the payload isn't classified, just the time of the launch, said  Terry Monrad, a spokesman for the Strategic Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> "We'll tell you all kinds of things about it," Monrad said as he handed a  reporter a complete press kit on the payload -- but only after the reporter  agreed not to break the embargo on the launch, which had already been announced  by the NASA spokesman.  </P> <P> The rocket is the third in a series of launches under the "Delta Star" program.  The satellite is designed to collect data on rockets as they are launched --  "anything that moves," as one Defense Department official said.  </P> <P> The Delta Star satellite will use eight sensors to help analysts tell what type  of rocket has just been launched and whether it is capable of carrying a  nuclear warhead.  </P> <P> The embargo on reporting the launch time was lifted at 5:27 p.m. PST, one  minute after the blastoff was postponed because of problems with gases in the  propulsion system. "The Pogo supression unit malfunctioned," the Air Force  said.  </P> <P> The new launch time is embargoed.  </P></p>

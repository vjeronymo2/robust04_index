			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Gardening: Where Rockefeller found culture - Paula Deitz visits a garden where new American money met, andfell for, old European traditions of landscaping and architecture Last week, as the New York Waterway ferry boat eased away from the Manhattan dock into the Hudson River, the captain called out that there was a fair wind and slack water. This meant a smooth cruise up the river between tides to Tarrytown, New York, an auspicious beginning to an important house and garden event: Kykuit, the country villa that was home to three generations of the Rockefeller family was welcoming visitors for the first time. Perhaps not since Mount Vernon, George Washington's mansion in Virginia, was opened to the public has there been such a stir and excitement among those interested in historic houses and gardens. Far from being the ostentatious display of a style called 'robber baron architecture', Kykuit (the Dutch for 'lookout') was essentially a home for a family that remained as modest as it was wealthy. The house sits 500ft above the Hudson at the highest point in Westchester County. It is 30 miles north of Manhattan in the middle of the Rockefeller estate at Pocantico Hills. The house and gardens were constructed between 1906 and 1913 to take advantage of the spectacular and uninterrupted views of the Hudson Valley and the river that runs through it. Although John D Rockefeller bought the land and contracted to build the house, it was the constant advice of his son, Junior, that turned the project from a simple country cottage into the important residence Junior believed his father deserved. The Rockefeller name is associated with good architecture and conservation causes that have resulted in saving land both in the US, particularly the cliffs along the Hudson, and in the Caribbean. The family has preserved the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden in Maine, designed for Junior's wife in the 1920s by Edith Wharton's niece, Beatrix Jones Farrand, the garden designer. Kykuit is interesting as a study of how Rockefeller father and son, two men accustomed to the simple life of the mid-west, began to develop an interest in the cultivated European tradition that links the house with its special landscape. The architect is recorded as Delano &amp; Aldrich, but the vision behind the Palladian design of the house and the terraced gardens was provided by William Welles Bosworth, an architect who excelled in the beaux arts style that combined Italian, French and English traditions. Bosworth began his professional life in the office of park designer Frederick Law Olmsted and continued his studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris before beginning work at Kykuit where he laid out the gardens. The villa appears to have been modelled to conform with his garden design rather than the other way around. Wharton's book, Italian Villas and Their Gardens, with romantic illustrations by Maxfield Parrish, was published in 1904. For the next few years their ideas were in the air. The figure surmounting the largest fountain in Kykuit's forecourt is of the god Oceanus, after the one by Giambologna in the Boboli gardens in Florence. This fountain is the source for the water features throughout the garden, all of which are in perfect working condition. As a compendium of garden design history nothing has been left out. There is a grotto in the style of Hubert Robert's at Versailles. The landscape is in the tradition of William Kent. Olana, the home which painter Frederic Church built further up the Hudson to offer the best river view, is also an inspiration. Where the garden is formal, as in the walk of clipped limes leading to a Temple of Venus, it has all the crispness of the best ordered green garden. This allee forms one side of an enclosed garden. At a right angle is a Moorish that terminates at the Tea House, a small pavilion of rusticated stone decorated in an ancient Roman style. Bordering the rill on either side are rows of topiary cones inspired by those in the park at Sceaux. Below this terrace on one side is the brook garden through which flows a serpentine stream with columbine, iris and pansies along the rocky banks. On the river side, the series of levels begins with an orange tree terrace with an ironwork balustrade of grapevines. This was crafted by Tiffany to Bosworth's designs, as were the lanterns and other decorative metalwork in the gardens. The swimming pool terrace below is one large oval pool with a pebble floor and spillways on either side spanned by stone bridges covered with clematis vines. North of the house is a wisteria pergola and a semi-circular rose garden punctuated by columnar junipers. Where the terraces end the rolling countryside begins. Each generation of Rockefellers left its mark. The most recent addition to the gardens is the collection of modern sculptures placed within the outdoor rooms by Nelson Rockefeller, the former vice president of the US. Because many of these works are from the 1950s, this collection already has a period look, but few sights are more arresting than Aristide Maillol's crouching sculpture 'Night' by the hedge that divides the garden from the long expanses of green. On Nelson Rockefeller's death in 1979, the house and garden were left to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund maintains Kykuit, which has also become a conference centre, thanks to a splendid renovation of its Coach Barn by the architect Herbert S. Newman. Public visits to Kykuit are being managed by Historic Hudson Valley. For reservations and advice on how to travel to Kykuit call 914-631 9491. Admission: Dollars 18 (Pounds 12.30); children and old people Dollars 16; by boat, Dollars 50. Closed Tuesdays. In her article on magnolias in the Weekend FT of April 23, Patricia Morison referred to Packard's Smetterling. The correct name of the variety is Picard's Schmetterling.</p>

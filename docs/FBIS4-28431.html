			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["United States Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher in an interview with the NBC Television on  June 7 openly declared that the U.S. stand toward the nuclear  issue of North Korea is to take a tough action through  sanctions, according to a report.    The United States is persistently crying for "sanctions",  arguing that "the possibility of measurement is lost" as regards  the reactor core refueling in the DPRK. The United States seeks  in this a heinous political aim to bar the development of the  existing nuclear power industry of the DPRK as a whole and,  furthermore, stifle its socialist system.    This has been proved with added clarity by the fact that the  United States is these days coming out with a totally  unreasonable demand for "a special inspection" of two military  sites of the DPRK under the pretext of "loss of the possibility  of fuel rod measurement".    This demand reveals its intention to disarm the DPRK.    It is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and  a  graphic expression of the policy of stifling it to demand "a  special inspection". This can never be allowed.    The current situation reminds us of that in March last year  when we declared our withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) against the "special inspection".    If the United States throw off the veil of the DPRK-U.S.  talks and resort to the strong arm, crying for "sanctions" and  "special inspection", our attitude cannot but change.    The United States must act with discretion, clearly seeing  the firm will of our entire people and whole Army.</p>

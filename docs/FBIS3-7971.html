The talks were also attended by Macedonia's Foreign  Minister.    On this occasion, they exchanged opinions regarding the  strengthening of the cooperation between the two countries and  the current situation in the region. It was jointly assessed  that the latest Greek measures, namely the closing of the  border, are illegal, harmful, and that they can cause vast  consequences to the stability in the region.    Gligorov expressed full readiness of Macedonia to resume the  Macedonian-Greek negotiations within the framework of the UN,  without previous conditions and pressure.    Mr. Schafer yesterday held talks with Foreign Minister Stevo  Crvenkovski. The two politicians exchanged opinions regarding  the situation on the Balkans and the mutual bilateral  cooperation and the possibilities for its strengthening.    Minister Crvenkovski briefed the German guest on Macedonia's  international activities and the efforts for its admission to  the international institutions. It was jointly concluded that  there are many possibilities for a development of the bilateral  relations and economic cooperation.    Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski informed Mr. Schafer of  the  latest government measures in relation to the transformation of  the Macedonian economy, particularly in the implementation of  the programme for economic stabilization, as well as the  difficulties Macedonia is facing since the introduction of the  economic embargo by Greece.    Mr. Schafer expressed hope that the newly developed  situation, following the embargo, will be overcome with an aim  of normalizing the transport of goods and services on the  southern Macedonian border.</p>

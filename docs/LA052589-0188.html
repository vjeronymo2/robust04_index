			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAFITTI COULD SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL  </P> <P> Mark Grafitti is preparing for a journey into familiar territory.  </P> <P> For the third time in his four years at Loyola Marymount, Grafitti and the  Lions are in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball tournament. And  just as he has done in his previous two trips into postseason play, Grafitti  will begin the tournament from a familiar vantage point -- the Loyola bench.  </P> <P> "I haven't had a three-year All-American career, but the friendships I've  developed and the experiences I've had with the team have been great," said  Grafitti, a backup catcher and first baseman who played at Hoover High. "I've  been lucky enough to go through something 99% of the people in the world never  get to experience."  </P> <P> Grafitti graduated from Loyola two weeks ago with a degree in psychology. So,  it's not surprising that throughout his collegiate baseball career, Grafitti  has relied on the power of positive thinking to help overcome what some players  might view as a series of major league disappointments.  </P> <P> "Anybody who plays wants to be the guy to throw out the runner or hit the home  run," Grafitti said. "But if you want to be part of a team, you do what you  have to do.  </P> <P> "Someday, you'll get your chance and you just gotta hope you make the best of  your chance when you get it."  </P> <P> In this, his final season, Graffiti is hoping for an opportunity to help Loyola  win its first national title when the Lions open play Friday against Oklahoma  in the West I Regional in Tucson, Ariz.  </P> <P> Loyola (37-22), under first-year Coach Chris Smith, is ranked 18th and 24th,  respectively, in this week's Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball-ESPN  polls.  </P> <P> Grafitti, 6-foot-2, 185 pounds, made the Loyola roster as a walk-on after  batting .335 his senior year at Hoover. Under Dave Snow, who coached at Loyola  before taking over the program at Cal State Long Beach this season, Grafitti  said he got a quick indoctrination into the importance of preparation and  mental toughness.  </P> <P> "My freshman year was difficult but it made me a lot stronger person," said  Grafitti, who earned a full scholarship this year. "I was one of a couple of  guys that Snow was on every single day. If you quit he didn't want you, because  you were weak and weren't going to be able to take it when you were faced with  adversity.  </P> <P> "I'm glad I got the chance to play for him because I think the things he taught  me carry over to the working world, family -- everything."  </P> <P> Grafitti, who is batting .274 with two home runs and 15 runs batted in in 84  at-bats, has had his career slowed by two major obstacles: injuries and junior  catcher Miah Bradbury.  </P> <P> Grafitti's physical problems began during his senior year at Hoover, when he  underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee for ligament damage suffered  during basketball season. The knee remains unstable and requires Grafitti to  wear a brace when he is on the field.  </P> <P> In 1987, Grafitti broke the thumb on his glove hand. Last season, he suffered a  broken index finger and wrist.  </P> <P> However, at 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, Bradbury has proven an even more formidable  barrier for Grafitti than his own physical problems. Last season, Bradbury  batted .345 with 10 home runs and 43 RBIs. This season, he is batting .409 with  six home runs and 44 RBIs.  </P> <P> "I think Mark could have started at most four-year schools, but unfortunately,  from a baseball standpoint, he's playing behind a very gifted player," Smith  said. "I think he recognizes that Miah Bradbury's don't come around very  often."  </P> <P> Said Grafitti: "A lot of people would have left when Miah came in and saw that  they were going to spend their junior year sitting on the bench. I just liked  the school and the friends I had here. That was more important to me than going  somewhere I could play all the time."  </P></p>

REA has considered all comments in finalizing this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of the comments were from entities that administer existing Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs) or organizations representing entities that administer revolving loan programs. These organizations feel that grants should not be directed to REA Borrowers exclusively, but also to existing organizations not financed by REA that operate RLFs, since REA Borrowers do not serve all of rural America. They also are concerned that they would be unable to compete with the REA Borrowers' revolving funds zero-interest rate loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, grants, as well as zero-interest loans administered exclusively through REA Borrowers are in accordance with directives established in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, (Pub. L. 100&hyph;102, 101 Stat. 1330&hyph;20). This law was created in a context where electric and telephone Borrowers who had made prepayments on loans into cushion of credit accounts could utilize a Rural Development Subaccount to collectively draw from the interest earnings from the Borrowers' cumulative credit resources to reinvest into local economic development projects. The provisions of the proposed rule making grant funds available exclusively to REA Borrowers, as a result of their prepayments, are governed by legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA acknowledges, however, that many rural development organizations are well qualified to administer grant funds, and they provide a valuable resource for local or regional rural economic development efforts. REA will strongly encourage Borrowers operating revolving loan funds to collaborate with existing organizations involved in rural development activities, and those organizations are urged to work with REA Borrowers in facilitating rural development projects. This collaboration and assistance could include performing local or regional studies to identify area economic development needs, assisting community leaders and other project owners in planning and implementing projects, loan packaging, technical assistance to REA Borrowers in reviewing loan applications and administering the revolving loan fund, and coordinating efforts between other entities, including public and private lending institutions, that provide assistance and/or funding to rural development projects. REA also encourages state Rural Development Councils to become active participants in planning rural development projects and coordinating activities between local governments, economic development districts, REA Borrowers and other entities operating RLFs. However, although collaboration between REA Borrowers and other enitities is strongly encouraged, legislation requires that REA Borrowers retain the ultimate decision-making authority and responsibility for REA rural development loan and grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding possible competition between REA Borrowers and other lenders, it should be emphasized that REA does not intend for REA Borrowers to compete with or replace existing services of RLFs, or other public or private lenders, but merely to augment or supplement those sources of funds. To clarify this policy, and ensure effective implementation, &sect;1703.22(b) has been revised to require Borrowers, within their RLF rural development plan, to document coordination of lending activities with local organizations operating RLFs and other area lenders. The rule requires such documentation to indicate that Borrowers will not compete with, but will supplement other legal sources of financing. Rural development plan documentation which complies with REA policy will be stipulated in RLF agreements between Borrowers and REA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters expressed concern that the administrative burden for operating RLFs would be too great and REA Borrowers may choose not to participate. REA has minimized administrative requirements; thus the burden should be no greater for the RLFs than for zero-interest loans. Although the REA Borrowers will decide whether or not to establish RLFs, REA believes the potential of significant benefits to rural residents through the RLF provisions will encourage participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

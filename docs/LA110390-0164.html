			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DO IT YOURSELF;  </P> <P> DRYWALL PROJECT? SKILL WITH KNIVES IS THE KEY  </P> <P> Drywall -- also called wallboard, gypsum board or plasterboard -- is probably  the most versatile and forgiving wall surface available today.  </P> <P> Less expensive and easier to apply than plaster, it can be frustrating to work  with in the finishing stages, as it requires some skill with at least three  sizes of compound knives -- 3, 6 and 10 inches.  </P> <P> Individual drywall panels, called boards, come in a common width of 4 feet, in  lengths from 8 to 16 feet in 2-foot increments. Thickness starts at 1/4 inch  and progresses by 1/8-inch increments to 3/4 inch. The most common size, by  far, is 4 by 8 feet by 1/2 inch.  </P> <P> Each board consists of a gypsum core covered with heavy paper on both sides.  The ends are cut square exposing the core. The long edges have a tapered  depression about 1 1/2 inches wide for the paper and joint compound that makes  a seamless surface between panels.  </P> <P> Start your installation with the ceiling, and install any electrical boxes or  fixtures first. Cut matching holes before applying panel cement to the bottom  of the joists with a caulking gun and raising the board. Adhesive makes a  stronger bond and reduces the number of nails required.  </P> <P> Make it easier to hold ceiling boards in place by tack-nailing a 40-inch-long  2-by-4 to the wall about an inch below the ceiling.  </P> <P> Support one end of the ceiling panel on this cleat while you raise the other  end and nail it in place. Then move the cleat for the next panel. Use 1  5/8-inch-long drywall nails 8 inches apart around the perimeter and across the  face of the board into every joist that's covered. Dimple, or slightly recess,  the nail heads into the paper for future filling.  </P> <P> The same methods cover the walls.  </P> <P> Place panels horizontally so you won't have to apply joint tape while climbing  a ladder. Remember to minimize butt joints with their taping bulges. Push the  upper wallboards tight against the underside of the ceiling boards. This  drastically reduces future cracking. If the ceilings are eight feet or lower, a  second board around the perimeter of the room does the job, but higher ceilings  in older homes take a third, partial board.  </P> <P> Finish in four steps: apply joint compound, embed paper tape in it directly  over the joint line, cover the tape with more compound and let it dry before  skimming the joint with a final very thin layer of compound. There are probably  as many ways of doing this as there are professional drywall installers, but  for beginners, the three-knife method works well.  </P> <P> Start compounding a tapered joint with the six-inch knife. Hold the knife at a  30- to 45-degree angle to the joint, pressing the compound into the depression.  Then wipe off the excess.  </P> <P> Tear off a length of tape to cover the entire joint. Press it in place with  your fingertips and then lightly smooth it in place with the three-inch knife.  If you see a bubble under the tape when you finish there is too little compound  in the joint. Fixing this is impossible. Remove the tape and start over.  </P> <P> Once the tape is embedded, cover it with another layer of compound with the  six-inch knife. Smooth the joint with the 10-incher. Let the joint dry for a  day and then sand with 120-grit paper.  </P> <P> Finish up by lightly sanding the whole job and applying a very thin skim coat  of compound to each joint. Wait a day for it to dry, sand the whole job with  180-grit paper and touch up imperfections before priming and painting.  </P></p>

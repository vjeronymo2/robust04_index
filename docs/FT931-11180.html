			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Romania private sector surging ROMANIA'S fast-growing private sector, concentrated in trade and services, contributed more than 25 per cent to gross domestic product last year, the national statistics commission's preliminary report for 1992 says. The 400,000 private companies and businessmen registered since 1989 handled 32 per cent of imports and 26 per cent of services last year, doubling their share of retail sales to 45 per cent. But private-sector growth failed to offset the continuing state-sector decline, with GDP falling about 15 per cent to Dollars 510 (Pounds 337) per head, making Romania the poorest country in Europe after Albania. Industrial production, more than 90 per cent state-controlled, fell 21.8 per cent last year, contributing to a 54 per cent drop in output since 1989. Agriculture, where privatisation has been faster, saw a 9.2 per cent fall in output. The report cites shortages of raw material imports as a main cause for the falls. A 13.6 per cent increase in exports helped narrow Romania's trade deficit to Dollars 938m, down from Dollars 1.3bn in 1991. Top exports in 1992 included metals and metal products, textiles and chemicals. The budget deficit jumped to 3.6 per cent of GDP, against 1.5 per cent in 1991. Inflation fell to 199 per cent, down from 265 per cent in 1991. But devaluation since the summer has pushed up import costs.</p>

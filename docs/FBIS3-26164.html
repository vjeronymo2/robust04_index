Edouard Balladur will visit Beijing on the first or last  week  of March, but this visit will be mostly symbolic: The  diplomatic and commercial impact of normalized relations between  France and China will be gradual. After a quasi-divorce, the  reconciliation cannot bring as many benefits as did the  "wedding" decided 30 years ago by General de Gaulle and Mao  Zedong.    Although delighted with his hosts' "quite warm" attitude and  "good will," Alain Peyrefitte ended his three-day preliminary  mission on a note of caution: "We must be aware that  improvements will be gradual." This comment relates to the  trade expectations of French manufacturers, who suffered from  Beijing's retaliatory policy following the sale of 60 Mirage  fighter aircraft to Beijing's rival, nationalist Taiwan.  However, improvements -- both commercial and political -- will  clearly happen under close supervision from China's rulers only.    Of course, both parties seemed to enjoy repeating that  "clouds have been dispelled." However, says Mr. Peyrefitte,  "one cannot say that the 12 January communique -- which  announced a return to normal relations -- settled everything."  It is up to the prime minister to "capitalize on that."  <H5>  A Little Help </H5>   This comment from the former Gaullist minister has probably  internal implications as well: Mr. Balladur's trip will be the  first French state visit to China since Mr. Mitterrand's, 11  years ago. Things should not happen in Beijing as they did in  Riyadh. While it cannot yield as many contracts as Chancellor  Helmut Kohl brought back from Beijing in November, Mr.  Balladur's visit must not lack panache, as befits a statesman  and potential president of the republic.    Admiral Philippe de Gaulle -- the General's son and a member  of Alain Peyrefitte's team in Beijing -- did not forget to  mention in front of Vice Prime Minister Qian Qichen that Mr.  Balladur is a "loyal proponent of Gaullist policies."    Both invoking the historical credit of the Fifth Republic  founder [Charles de Gaulle] -- the first leader of a large  Western power to open an embassy in Communist China in 1964 --  and speaking of France's high-technology achievements, Alain  Peyrefitte told Prime Minister Li Peng of potential cooperation  in fields such as energy, transport, and telecommunications. He  also pleaded for French cereal producers: Chinese resentment  stemming from the sale of Dassault aircraft to Taiwan did not  just lead to a freeze in large industrial contracts; it also  resulted in China terminating its regular purchases of French  wheat. In retaliation, after having uttered its indignation  about the sale of 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan, Beijing had  actually increased its imports of American wheat.    On the Chinese side, the message is twofold. While Alain  Peyrefitte insisted that "a new spirit of friendship has been  established," a Beijing-based observer of French interests said  that "things will not go smoothly; we do not intend to fall prey  to such delusions any more."    In the meantime, Li Peng said he was "very happy" with the  Franco-Chinese detente. His own intervention was reportedly the  decisive factor in the difficult negotiation secretly conducted  during the Christmas season by UAP [insurance company] president  Jacques Friedman on behalf of France's prime minister.    These talks made it possible for the "page to be turned."  Chinese authorities gave up their demand that the Mirage  contract be canceled, while Paris undertook to forbid French  firms to "contribute to Taiwan's armament," although it did not  forbid to "sell weapons" to the island, provided such weapons  are of a defensive nature. The compromise was guaranteed by an  exchange of secret letters between the two countries' Foreign  Ministries.    The "little help" from China's head of government -- who was  openly francophile until Western nations ostracized him  following the 4 June 1989 massacre -- is not solely due to the  fact that he would relish being invited to Paris -- and, five  years after Tiananmen, saluting Francois Mitterrand, who had  said at the time that a regime which guns down its own young  people "does not have a future."    Chinese sources explain that Beijing agreed to a compromise  with Paris and is likewise seeking an agreement with Washington  in order to reestablish a political dialogue with the West.  This has already been done with Germany, the whole strategy's  alleged motive being to "isolate" Great Britain, guilty of  trying to democratize Hong Kong's parliamentary system.    Thus Beijing admits it needs to maintain ties with Western  countries. Even if that means painting the confession with  jingoistic colors. Said the headline of a large Shangai  newspaper -- the WEN HUI BAO -- last week: "Western Arrogance  Toward China Turns Into Deference."</p>

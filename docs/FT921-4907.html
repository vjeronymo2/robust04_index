			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Indicator dashes hopes for early recovery A FLICKER of hope for economic recovery in the UK was extinguished yesterday when the longer leading indicator, which records turning points in economic activity about 10 months in advance, fell 0.6 per cent in January. In its Quarterly Bulletin last month the Bank of England pointed to an upturn in the leading indicators as evidence that conditions which in the past had accompanied recovery were in place. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the decline in optimism recorded by the Confederation of British Industry in recent months led to January's fall of the longer leading index to 102.6 from 103.2 in December. The index turned upwards in May 1990 and rose until October 1991. The shorter leading index, indicating turning points about four months in advance, also fell in January. The CSO said this was the result of less positive responses to the CBI surveys of new orders and expected change in stocks of raw materials. There was slightly better news for the government in a survey showing that an upturn in consumer spending was under way. But the report, by Business Strategies (BSL), an economic and business consultancy, said the upturn was likely to be sluggish with consumer confidence remaining fragile. BSL estimated that the overall fall in consumer spending last year was 1.9 per cent, the sharpest reduction in spending since 1948. Mr Peter Dixon, senior economist at BSL, said: 'Although consumer spending is beginning to recover, the pace of recovery is being held back by rising unemployment and continued weak house prices.' The report said that the recovery was being led by the east Midlands and the north of England. Mr Dixon predicted that leisure and other services would recover first and consumer durables would be slower.</p>

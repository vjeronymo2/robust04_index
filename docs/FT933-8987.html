			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical dips after Spanish setback A DISAPPOINTING per-formance by a recent Spanish acquisition and the loss of one big order was responsible for Holliday Chemical Holdings reporting a small fall in pro forma pre-tax profits for the half year to end-June. Profits slipped from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 6.7m on sales ahead at Pounds 54.9m (Pounds 48.6m). The results were adjusted to reflect the April flotation which raised net proceeds of Pounds 31m. The chemicals business saw profits fall from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.3m for two main reasons; the recent acquisition of Barisyntex in Spain is taking longer than envisaged to generate profits and the company lost a big order for an ingredient for hair dye. Mr Michael Peagram, founder and chairman, said: 'The loss of the order is not a huge embarrassment; it has basically been deferred until next year.' He remains confident that Barisyntex will be making profits by next year. Despite what he described as the continuing difficult international economic climate, Mr Peagram said he could see no reason why current trading performance should not be sustained. With net debt of Pounds 14m, representing gearing of 30 per cent, Mr Peagram said the group was well positioned to make further acquisitions. 'We are looking at two and hope to complete at least one by the year end'. Capital expenditure was lower than expected at Pounds 2m. It is now unlikely to run to more than Pounds 4m in the second half, although at the time of the flotation the company said it expected to spend about Pounds 8m. 'We took our eye off the ball during the flotation, which took up a lot of our time,' Mr Peagram said. Earnings per share were unchanged at 5.9p. The interim dividend is 1.6p. COMMENT It would be churlish to be too critical of Holliday just because of a 1.5 per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profits. The company has an impressive record of growth since its management buy-out in 1987. Earnings per share growth has averaged 22 per cent over the last five years on a pro forma basis and organic growth has been augmented by a string of acquisitions with a proven record. Yet by its own standards a disappointing performance from a Spanish acquisition and the loss of a big order causes some concern. It may only prove to be temporary but the cut in capital expenditure could be interpreted as a sign of the tough times. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m, the shares - up 3p to 214p - look fully valued on a prospective multiple of 17.3.</p>

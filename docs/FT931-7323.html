			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Shorts warns of job-loss plans SHORT Brothers, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, yesterday announced that job losses were inevitable following production cuts. It blamed the decision on reduced orders from Fokker, the Dutch aircraft company which uses Shorts to produce wings for its Fokker 100 aircraft. Fokker said the recession in the aerospace industry had caused its cut. Shorts, a subsidiary of Bombardier, the Canadian transportation group, employs 1,000 people in the Fokker wing production division.</p>

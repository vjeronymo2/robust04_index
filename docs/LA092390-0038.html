			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: IN 2020, THEY GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR CAR  </P> <P> The year is 2020. Baby boomers are no longer babies. They are no longer  booming. They are what the cruel call the Senile Majority.  </P> <P> Dirk Miller, 70, and his wife, Bree Wellington, sixtysomething, are coming out  of a restaurant when they hear a beggar with a synthesizer playing an old  Beatles tune, "When I'm 64."  </P> <P> Dirk starts to sing, "When I grow older, losing my brains. . . ."  </P> <P> Bree starts laughing. "That's not how it went. It's: 'When I grow older, losing  my gums, many years from now -- Will ya still be sending me some turpentine,  something, something, bottle of wine. . . .' "  </P> <P> "Whatever," said Dirk, unplugging the car from the recharging lot.  </P> <P> "Boy, that was a great meal," said Bree. "I just love Iraqi food."  </P> <P> "I know, the Date Decadence was to die for," Dirk said, switching on the  ignition.  </P> <P> "And how about that Camel Hair Pasta?" Bree said, tucking her jowls back under  the accordion skin flap. "Remember when there was a Vietnamese restaurant in  that same place?"  </P> <P> "Not really," Dirk admitted, adjusting the lens on the windshield.  </P> <P> "Hey," Bree said, opening the drug compartment. "Want a few Vitamin Es --  sublingual?"  </P> <P> "Thanks, Hon, but they're included in my subcu pump."  </P> <P> "I've got to get one of those," said Bree. "There was something I wanted to  talk to you about, but I can't remember."  </P> <P> "Something about Arsenio finally being out of the house?" he said, referring to  their youngest, Arsenio Kyle Miller-Wellington, who had finally gotten his own  apartment. Tonight's dinner was in celebration of that event. "It wasn't my  idea to have a kid in our late 40s."  </P> <P> "That old argument again," Bree said, taking off her nails. "Look, I told you,  I was afraid that if I waited until menopause the womb transplant wouldn't  work. How was I to know that in two years we'd have the technology for women to  have babies until well into their 80s?"  </P> <P> "Yeah," said Dirk, making a right onto Richard Nixon Parkway, "but they never  came up with the technology for having a teen-ager in your 60s! By the way, I  hear that with the latest research, women can continue having babies forever.  Do you believe in birth after death?"  </P> <P> "Research!" said Bree tucking her recently tucked tummy under the air bag  sensor. "That's what I wanted to tell you about. There's some new research that  shows that people who smoked marijuana when they were young have a return of  memory loss from the time they smoked."  </P> <P> "You're kidding," said Dirk, turning off the radio.  </P> <P> "What a minute! Turn that back!" said Bree, scanning. "Damn. You lost that.  That was my favorite song, 'California Dreamin'.' "  </P> <P> "The Stones, right?" said Dirk, getting off the parkway near the new McDonald's  Golden Ramen.  </P> <P> "No, not the Stones, Dirk, you dummy. It was The Mamas. The Mamas and the -- I  can't remember. But I know there was this one Mama who died tragically."  </P> <P> "In the plane crash with Ritchie Valens, wasn't it? Or was she shot as she was  going into her apartment at the Dakota?"  </P> <P> "Sperm Donors!" said Bree. "It was The Mamas and The Sperm Donors, I think."  </P> <P> Dirk stopped the car and threw up his hands. "OK, I give up. Where is it?"  </P> <P> "Not again, Honey?" said Bree.  </P> <P> But it was understandable. It wasn't senility, it was architectural  imperialism. Their complex looked just like every other complex in the Demi  Moore Valley.  </P> <P> "Just sit tight," she said, switching on the dashboard homing computer and  keying in the program to get to their unit at Flossmore, A Community.  </P> <P> Dirk lowered the seat backs and snuggled up next to Bree.  </P> <P> "While we're waiting, can you sing me a little of that song, Bunnynose?"  </P> <P> He hadn't forgotten his old nickname for her, and she hadn't forgotten his.  "Your request is being processed, Wild Thing."  </P> <P> She stroked his distinguished head and began to sing:  </P> <P> All the leaves are brown  </P> <P> And your implant is gray  </P> <P> Something, something, something --  </P> <P> If I was in L.A. --  </P> <P> California dreamin' --  </P> <P> On such a something day. . ..  </P> <P>  He kissed her chin, where it was recently pulled tightest, and the efficient  little car dinged its start-up noise and headed home.  </P></p>

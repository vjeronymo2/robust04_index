			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "More Loans For Foreign Ventures"] </F>   [Text] The Bank of China, the country's major foreign  exchange bank, pledges that it will continue to lend a helping  hands to support foreign-funded ventures.    More credit is expected to be extended to foreign-funded  ventures in 1994, said Liang Jin'e, deputy general manager of  the bank's first credit department.    But Liang declined to specify how much the total credit will  amount to. The bank last year supplied $4.3 billion in foreign  exchange to foreign-funded ventures, 28 percent more than in  1992.    It also granted 42.5 billion yuan ($4.88 billion) in loans  denominated in renminbi, a rise of 34.4 percent from 1992.    Last year's total credit amount and the rate of increase  were  records for the bank.    While promising active support for foreign-funded ventures,  Liang warned that the Bank of China will not be able to meet the  demands of all firms.    She said the bank will channel its limited capital into  supporting selected firms according to the country's industrial  policy.    The beneficiaries will include enterprises in the energy,  transportation and telecommunication industries. Priority will  also be given to export-oriented and technologically-advanced  firms.    Liang said those with high profitability and strong ability  to repay debt will also be on the preferred list.    To boost the economic links between the mainland and Taiwan,  priority will be given to Taiwan-funded firms. The bank is  trying to organize specialized loans for these firms.    The bank will closely watch the investment activities of  large and well-known overseas companies, believing that any  interest by them in investing in large projects in China deserve  priority.    Lians said the bank will be cautious in lending to  foreign-funded ventures engaged in real estate speculation or  the importation of outdated equipment.    It will also be careful with firms that have not repaid, on  schedule, loans already granted by the bank.    To those able to make up losses in the near future, the bank  will continue to give its support. But to those with no hope of  making profits, the bank will press for repayment.    Liang said the bank will supervise and urge foreign-funded  enterprises to operate efficiently.    She said the bank will try to improve its regulations on  lending to protect the bank's assets.    "It is time for us to make use of our experience and solve  the problems," Lians said.    To better manage its loans to foreign-funded ventures, the  bank will also strengthen the training of its staff.    As a major channel for utilizing foreign investment, the  Bank  of China has been following a credit policy that favours  foreign-funded ventures. Since 1980, the bank has provided  foreign-funded ventures with $18.3 billion in foreign exchange  and 135.6 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) in renminbi.    About 50 percent of the foreign-funded ventures in China  have  opened accounts with the Bank of China. Of these, 20 percent  have received loans from the bank.    Analysts said the bank's active support of foreign-funded  ventures should be strengthened by the growth in savings  deposits.    By the end of last year, the outstanding savings in renminbi  had surpassed 204.86 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) while savings  denominated in foreign exchange totalled $27.8 billion.</p>

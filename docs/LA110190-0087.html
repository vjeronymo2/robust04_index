			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> X-RAYS HELP ENSURE A SAFER HALLOWEEN  </P> <P> New to her Ventura neighborhood, Nena Doyle was playing it safe this Halloween.  </P> <P> After her daughter, Deanna, made her trick-or-treat rounds, the pair stopped by  the Community Memorial Hospital of San Buenaventura to have the goodies  X-rayed.  </P> <P> "I have a child in my class whose cousin got his throat cut on a piece of  Halloween candy," said Doyle, a fifth-grade teacher at E.P. Foster Elementary  in Ventura. "It really motivated me to have her candy checked out."  </P> <P> Deanna, 8, dressed as a ballerina, added, "They X-ray the candy so we can see  if it has any razor blades." Her candy checked out fine.  </P> <P> Wednesday night marked the seventh year that the hospital has X-rayed Halloween  candy to detect metallic objects. The free X-ray, which takes from 15 to 30  seconds per bag of candy, requires very minimal radiation exposure, hospital  representatives said.  </P> <P> "An X-ray can't detect poison or glass. X-raying the candy doesn't absolve the  parents from their responsibility to really check the candy," said Suzanne  Brockman, director of marketing for the hospital, who added that it is  difficult for an X-ray to detect foreign objects in foil-wrapped candy.  </P> <P> The hospital gave 9,000 trick-or-treat bags to the Ventura Unified School  District, which distributed them to elementary school children earlier this  month. Each bag contained a parental consent form absolving the hospital from  liability if candy that had been tampered with went undetected.  </P> <P> With her four costumed children in tow, Donna Jaco visited the hospital for the  annual candy X-ray.  </P> <P> "We want to be sure it's safe to eat," said Jaco, a nurse at the hospital.  </P> <P> Santa Paula Memorial Hospital also X-rayed candy Halloween night. The hospital  also requires a parental consent form. STEPHANIE STASSEL  </P></p>

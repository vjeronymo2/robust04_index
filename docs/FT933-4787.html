			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ASW bounces back into the black midway with Pounds 1.5m ASW HOLDINGS, the steel products group based in Wales, bounced back into the black in the first half of 1993 and announced a Pounds 10m scheme to reduce costs substantially at one of its Cardiff rolling mills. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.1m for the corresponding period and a deficit of Pounds 8.7m - including Pounds 4.6m of restructuring costs - for the second half of 1992. Turnover in the opening half was Pounds 230.5m (Pounds 190.5m). Earnings per share were 0.0p (losses 4.2p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3p. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said the company felt 'more confident than in a long time' about its main steel businesses. These activities made a first-half operating profit of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 900,000), almost all of which came in the second quarter as the benefits of price increases and higher margins came through. Mr Cox said the steel businesses' operating profit was running at an annual rate of Pounds 23m in the second quarter. This compares with a peak of Pounds 41.5m achieved in 1990 before the collapse in UK and European steel prices. He was cautious about the outlook for margins in the steel business. Currently they were not as high as in the second quarter, and predictions for 1994 would depend on the trend in the last three months. In some parts of Europe, he said, margins were still lower than in 1992. The Pounds 10m investment at Cardiff will change the cost structure for production of merchant bars - angles and other sections used in engineering. In line with ASW's policy, the investment would have a two-year pay back. ASW's much smaller construction systems business incurred a loss of Pounds 2.5m, compared to a Pounds 1.9m deficit a year earlier. But Mr Cox said a much reduced deficit was expected in the second half and expressed optimism about the division's new products. The group has not produced a balance sheet at the half year stage, but said the increased volumes and higher prices in its steel business led to higher levels of working capital. Borrowing facilities were enough to accommodate this increase and projected capital spending.</p>

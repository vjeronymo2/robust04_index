			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: NVQs: teething problems, but real progress too Sir, Over the last 10 years or so the UK has built an effective vocational training structure that did not exist before. Like any new industry, it is having teething problems, but real progress is being made, with the Americans and Germans, for example, looking at our achievements with respect. The statement in the House of Commons last week that 'inadequacies in NVQ (national vocational qualification) training systems are proving immensely frustrating for the many thousands of honourable and decent people who work in training nationally and in JHP Centres throughout the country', while clearly supportive, neglected to recognise that these are very new systems in the early stages of development ('Bogus NVQ claims raise alarm', June 1). As the country's largest work-based training organisation, JHP has 1,200 training staff with extremely wide-ranging and demanding responsibilities. These cover not only the instruction of 10,000 young people and adults a year, but also guidance, counselling and support, together with arrangement of work placements for them with 7,000 companies, and monitoring and assessment of them in the workplace. We work in partnership with the Training and Enterprise Councils and local enterprise companies to enable people to achieve permanent employment through the learning of vocational skills and attainment of qualifications. Above all, we are in the job creation business. NVQs were designed to set occupationally based standards, to recognise competence in the workplace and to provide a ladder of achievement. Much has been accomplished in work-based vocational training; we must now ensure that the development of a well-conceived qualification system is taken forward by use of uniform systems and procedures.

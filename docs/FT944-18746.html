			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Peru takes on ship debt Peru's government will have to assume a controversial and long-standing obligation with Chemical Bank and American Express Bank, according to a law passed this week. Failure to recognise the debt has been the main obstacle to renegotiation of Peru's Dollars 6.5bn commercial banking debt. The debt, thought to stand at around Dollars 72m with accumulated interest, dates back to 1981 when US banks backed the commercially disastrous purchase of two cargo ships by the then state-owned shipping line.</p>

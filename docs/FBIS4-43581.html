			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riccardo Luna: "Bordon Resigns, Del Turco </F> Resigns Again"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- There is something comical even in a  defeat. Del Turco's resignation, for example. He had already  handed it in two weeks ago, but nobody realized. Not a line was  written about the secretary of the glorious Socialist Party  [PSI]. However, Del Turco did not lose heart, and yesterday he  once again formally announced: "I am resigning as from today."  He then claimed the distinction of having kept the party alive  when everyone else had pronounced it dead. However, after the  European elections, the PSI is as alive as a mineral can be.  With its votes added to those of Democratic Alliance [AD], it  obtained 1.7 percent. In fact, yesterday former AD coordinator  Willy Bordon also resigned. "Our result is truly disappointing,  but I will not give up," the former PDS member explained,  attempting to reassure his voters ("there are 100,000 of them in  Italy overall"). The next step? "A great center-left force,  distinct from the PDS." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A former "China Beach" fan wrote to say (TV Times, Nov. 11) that she is unhappy  with the changes that have taken place on the series this season. It would have  been more comfortable to have stayed in China Beach with the characters we have  come to know and cherish, and to further explore their relationships with one  another.  </P> <P> The show's constant change in time and place is often disorienting and  confusing, but imagine what it is like for Vietnam veterans who still  experience the flashbacks. These scenes allow the viewer to understand the  emotions that trigger seemingly bizarre behavior.  </P> <P> "China Beach" is never easy to watch. It's heart breaking and gut wrenching. It  makes you laugh a little and cry a lot, but most important it makes you think  and care.  </P> <P> Patsy St. John, San Diego  </P></p>

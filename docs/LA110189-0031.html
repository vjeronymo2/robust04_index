			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ISRAEL DIVIDED ONCE AGAIN'  </P> <P> In your editorial you put the blame on Jerusalem for the immobility in the  peace negotiation. Your superficial judgment ignores the most important  contributing factor to the present unacceptable situation, i.e., the shameful  role of the U.S. Congress combined with the consistent timidity, duplicity and  lack of character in the White House.  </P> <P> Jerusalem has no incentive or logical reason to get into any meaningful  negotiation which could and should lead to a bilateral compliance with U.N.  Resolution 242. Even the token territorial concession by the Labor Party is no  more than a public relation scam. The Israelis know very well that death, taxes  and the eternal U.S. aid to Israel are the only unchangeable facts of life.  </P> <P> The Jerusalem-controlled U.S. Congress acts as an agent for Israeli interests.  If Jerusalem serves notice on Congress there is not even talk about  Gramm-Rudman, no consideration for the needs of our homeless, our sick and  destitute people, our uneducated younger generation without hope. The billions  have to be and always will be ready for the dreamers of Greater Israel.  </P> <P> Even more appalling is the fact that President Bush and Secretary of State  James Baker are fully aware of this humiliating situation and still are  continuing to perpetuate the hoax of a no-hope Arab-Israeli negotiation.  </P> <P> Stop the unrestricted flow of our money to the Israeli government and we might  see some action in the right direction.  </P> <P> STEPHEN KOVACS  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

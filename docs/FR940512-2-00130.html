			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toledo Edison Company, Docket No. 50&hyph;440, Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 1, Lake County, Ohio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 22, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the replacement of most of the analog Riley temperature instrumentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with leak detection with digital equipment from the General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric Company NUMAC product line. Technical Specification changes would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made to instrumentation surveillance requirements for temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments associated with main steam line isolation, reactor water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleanup system isolation, reactor core isolation cooling system isolation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and residual heat removal system isolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical specifications are proposed to be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform a Channel Functional Test on a semiannual frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versus the current monthly frequency for both ambient and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential temperature and for the MSL tunnel temperature timer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions, for the above listed piping lines. Additionally, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation addressees the potential for, and implications of,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common mode failures due to software, hardware and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electromagnetic and radio-frequency interference (EMI/RFI).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NUMAC instrumentation has certain design features which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to its reliability. The replacement NUMAC LDMs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> digital instruments that use a microcomputer to monitor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambient and differential temperatures (also the MSL tunnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature timer) and provide outputs and automatic self-testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and calibration. A description of the major design features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: a) isolation of the essential microcomputer by a serial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data link from the front panel display (and display  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microcomputer), b) a self-test system feature that provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatic testing of internal circuits and reports failures, c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermocouple failure detection, d) provisions to test the output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relays without the use of jumpers (reducing the threat of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spurious isolation), and e) two independent built-in instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power supplies (that automatically switchover to the other supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of failure). Also, several features have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included, among these, a) a hardware ``watchdog'' timer to monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against software cycling in continuous loops, and b) software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structured with the safety-related essential tasks running at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest priority in the system. These capabilities increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliability of the collected data, reduce the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertent isolation and plant shutdowns, reduce the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent calibrations, and reduce the likelihood of common mode  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors will maintain the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental and electrical physical independence criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (qualifications) as the existing Leak Detection System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components. The LDMs, the associated thermocouple input units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TCIUs), and relay output units (ROUs) will be mounted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seismically such that qualification of these components and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control Room panels will be maintained. The LDMs are qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the PNPP Control Room environment. The LDMs (one per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> division) will be physically and electrically independent of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other and do not share power supplies, thermocouple inputs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output relays, microcomputer logic units, display units or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosures and mounting locations. A postulated gross failure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any one NUMAC LDM, such as gross malfunction of the input unit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microcomputer logic unit or the relay output unit, will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagate to the other NUMAC LDM, such as gross malfunction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the input unit, microcomputer logic unit or the relay output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit, will not propagate to the other NUMAC LDM. Thus, a failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within one NUMAC LDM will not prevent or disable the function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other NUMAC LDM. A failure within one NUMAC LDM may cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loss of one division of the isolation trip logic. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the other redundant division (the MSLs have three other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divisions) will not be affected by this failure, the Leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detection System will still be able to perform its designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety-related function and provide the necessary system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolation. This is the same as the current Leak Detection System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The possibility of a common mode failure of both NUMAC LDM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divisions is minimized by the design of the NUMAC hardware and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software, the verification and validation (V&amp;V) of the software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce the likelihood of errors, the testing of the software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (to discover and eliminate errors), and the design of and testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the hardware to demonstrate its resistance to EMI/RFI. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUMAC instrument design features, by effectively eliminating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for common mode failures, maintain the Leak Detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System within its current licensing basis. (A discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common mode failure protection is presented in more detail in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> answer to question two.) Therefore, the design, isolation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separation criteria remain the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, as described within Chapter 7 of the Updated Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis Report (USAR), diversity is provided to the ambient and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential temperature monitoring trip functions for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various systems by alternative leak detection methods (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring steam line flow or pressure) that provide backup in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> event of the loss of both divisions of the NUMAC Leak Detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitors. These alternative leak detection methods are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physically separate from those being performed by the NUMAC LDM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and constitute a diverse, redundant, safety related backup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of responding to a design basis line break for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various systems. Therefore, a common mode failure of both LDM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divisions would not prevent any of the necessary system isolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No changes are being made to the isolation logic of the Leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detection System. No accident initiators or precursors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the proposed changes to the Channel Functional Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance intervals for the various trip functions. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of a Channel Functional Test is to check the instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setpoints. The NUMAC instrument setpoints are set digitally and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not drift. An engineering evaluation has established that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Channel Functional Test surveillance interval can be extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one to six months. The potential for common mode failures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been accounted for in the design and measures have been taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to lower the probability of this to an acceptable level (see the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> answer to question two). Also, alternative leak detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods exist for this eventuality. Since the NUMAC Leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detection Monitoring equipment meets or exceeds the design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing criteria specified for the Leak Detection System, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed upgrade cannot increase the probability of occurrence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A portion of the Leak Detection System logic causes a closure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Main Steam Isolation Valves on a steam leak signal. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient, described in Chapter 15 of the USAR, may also occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to a LDS equipment malfunction. Since this modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaces some of the existing Riley temperature monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrumentation with more reliable instrumentation the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability of this transient is reduced (no radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences are associated with this event). The LDS is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to mitigate the consequences of a pipe break outside primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment by isolating the affected system connected to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary (RCPB). The replacement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Riley instrumentation with NUMAC LDMs will not change, degrade,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or prevent the Leak Detection System response to mitigate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiological consequences of an accident. Therefore, replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Riley temperature modules with NUMAC Leak Detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitors will not significantly increase the consequences of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

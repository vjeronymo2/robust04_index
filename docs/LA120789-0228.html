			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> KELSEY-HAYES TO CUT 1,000 JOBS  </P> <P> Kelsey-Hayes Corp., formerly known as Freuhauf, said today it will begin  cutting its payroll next week by more than 15%, or 1,000 hourly and salaried  jobs, as it undergoes a major corporate reorganization into four business  units.  </P> <P> K-H Chairman John F. Devaney said further declines in the automotive industry  could cause the Romulus, Mich., vehicle parts maker to cut its 6,500-member  work force even further.  </P> <P> Devaney also cited the company's $16.9-million net loss during the first nine  months of 1989 for the cuts, to be done through layoffs, early retirements,  voluntary resignations and terminations.  </P> <P> K-H was acquired by Varity Corp. of Toronto for $579 million last month. The  company abandoned the Freuhauf name last August after it sold off its slumping  truck trailer operations to Terex Corp.  </P></p>

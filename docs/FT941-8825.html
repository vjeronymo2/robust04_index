			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe falls as Airbus loses deal News that a Dollars 6bn Saudi Arabian aircraft order was to go to the US rather than the Airbus consortium hit British Aerospace, which holds 20 per cent of the European aircraft group. The shares fell sharply early in the day, and anticipation of the US success kept the stock in the doldrums before a mid-afternoon announcement from President Clinton confirmed the order. Dealers said one US investment bank was trying to sell a block of shares but finding no willing takers and that was causing an additional drag on the share price. However, late news that BAe's space division had been chosen as prime contractor for a Pounds 300m project for two new defence satellites helped the stock recover some of the earlier drop. The shares closed 9 off at 531p after being 15 down at one stage. Ironically, BAe is believed to be in talks about the sale of its space division with Matra Marconi Space, one of the main subcontractors on the new defence satellites, thought to be the most likely purchaser. A price of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m has been suggested.</p>

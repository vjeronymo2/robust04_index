			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 23 Apr (TANJUG) -- The two-day talks  between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Yasushi Akashi,  the UN secretary general's special envoy for the former  Yugoslavia, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of  Srpska, and their aides ended in Belgrade today with complete  success. This has been confirmed by the main participants in  the Belgrade meeting -- Milosevic, Akashi, and Karadzic. In a  brief statement for journalists after today's second round of  talks, the Serbian president expressed satisfaction with the  success of the talks between UN representatives and the republic  of Srpska.    "I believe that a big step has been made toward peace,"  Milosevic said and added: "In the future, the Republic of Serbia  will continue to lend support to peaceful solutions to the  Yugoslav crisis through negotiations because we believe that  this path has no alternative, and it is the only one which leads  to such a solution." Yasushi Akashi also expressed satisfaction  with the results of the talks, stressing that "a possibility has  been created to avoid the crisis." He expressed gratitude to  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for the initiative which  resulted in the two-day meeting in Belgrade. Akashi said that  he is satisfied with the readiness to cooperate on the part of  the Bosnian Serb representatives, especially Karadzic.    According to Akashi, it was agreed over the past two days  that the Serbian forces should withdraw to three kilometers from  the center of Gorazde. "We are planning to deploy peace forces  around that town as early as this afternoon. I am convinced  that in that respect we will have full cooperation for the free  movement of the peace forces on their way to Gorazde before the  end of the day."    Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic's statement  was  in the same vein. He said that the Serbian forces will withdraw  to three kilometers from Gorazde and that relations with the UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] have been fully normalized. If  there is peace in Gorazde, and peace forces are deployed there,  that is, if the area is demilitarized and the possibility of a  Muslim offensive removed, we can hope for a total peace, the  president of the Serb Republic said in conclusion.    The initiative for the two-day meeting in Belgrade was  launched by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who based it  on the firm conviction that the crisis can be solved through  negotiations and not through escalation of the war. Milosevic  suggested that the representatiaves of the United Nations and of  the republic of Srpska should discuss three issues: the  normalization of relations between the republic of Srpska and  UNPROFOR, an end to the conflict around Gorazde, and an  agreement on a cessation of hostilities throughout the territory  of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Milosevic's proposal was accepted and a full accord was  reached on six issues. There is no doubt that the most  important agreement is the one on the immediate and total  cease-fire in and around Gorazde. Under the agreement, the  cease-fire was to come into force at noon today. The agreement  on the normalization of relations between the republic of Srpska  and UNPROFOR is also of great importance, as well as the  consensus that an agreement on a cease-fire throughout the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina must be reached.    The question now is: Whose turn is it to make a move after  the Belgrade agreement? Everything indicates that the  conclusion is that it is the Bosnian Muslims. The wish of only  one side is not enough for a cease-fire, nor is it enough for a  war. In a certain way, NATO made a move out of turn by issuing  fresh threats and ultimatums, and only to one side -- the  Serbian side.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Attention" column by Hasan al-Kashif: "America...Rise and </F> Downfall"]    [Text] It is not strange that the United States is  beginning its fall from the summit it enjoyed for a few years.  To stay on the world's summit requires much more than brute  force and technical, military, and media superiority. This  requires a humanitarian message that convinces the world's  peoples. This is something Washington does not have, as U.S.  circles admit.    Some confused people do not see the U.S. slide, but continue  to see the old upward trend. These people do not see the  opportunities in the region and the international arena.    Even more serious is the fact that these people have seen  the  U.S. progress, but they did not note -- due to their horror and  blindness -- that this climb to the summit of global positions  was due to notable collapses. This means the United States  moved forward because there was no resistance, or, let us say,  it moved ahead as a result of multiple absences. The collapse  of the Soviet Union was basically due to self-motivated reasons,  and the same was the case with countries of former Socialist  bloc. The collapse of Somalia was due to famine and fighting.  The official Arab journey to Madrid was the result of the  collapse of rulers and officials. Therefore, the U.S. rise  cannot be viewed as a victory over heroic and persistent  resistance.    The only exception during the short years of the U.S. rise  was Iraq. Iraq has been and still is the one voicing the  pan-Arab and humanitarian 'no', with faith in God, people, and  objectives. That was the reason for the 30-state aggression and  all its destruction and siege. Despite everything it did, the  United States stood helpless and defeated under the walls of the  Iraqi fortress while in the zenith of its rise.    Now, the image is different. The U.S. downfall is becoming  clearer. Iraq remained and its leadership and determination  continued without change. The Russian awakening is clear.  Somalia is witnessing the triumph of its resistance. The  people of Palestine were not deceived by the false peace and its  agreements and negotiators. Palestinians continue to throw  stones and to fire bullets, rejecting the results of the  collapse of officials and rulers.    None of us denies Washington owns huge quantities of  sophisticated weapons and possesses advanced media. We all  suffered from the air, missile, and media shelling, but this did  not undermine the Iraqis and the Arabs, and did not deceive the  Somalis and Russians for long. Army occupation does not mean  occupation of the will. Monopolizing the media does not  necessarily mean occupying the mind.    At the peak of the hostile media campaign that took part in  the destructive aggression and siege, the faith of the Arab  nation in Iraq -- leader and people -- increased, even though  Iraqi media did not reach all Arab lands.    At the peak of the military and media invasion of Somalia,  the Somali people rejected the invasion and its pretexts, even  though the Somali people did not have enough bread and lack even  modest mass media.    When all the hostile media that targeted Iraq mobilized  against the Palestinian people, and inundated them with the  promises of peace, prosperity, and stability, the Palestinian  people -- who lack their own media that believe in national and  pan-Arab constant -- were not deceived. They continued to fight  the enemy as an alternative to negotiating with the enemy.    The changes demonstrated much of what Iraq had said and  predicted during the peak of the collapses that shocked the  world, but did not move Iraq.    The United States is in the downfall stage, and Iraq --  leader and people -- and Palestine -- people and resistance --  are in the rising stage amid a clear awakening that is  demonstrated in the division in the Security Council.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, Jun. 10 (MAP) --- Moroccan Premier Abdellatif  Filali presented Thursday to the parliament the broad lines of  the action program of the new government in matters of economic,  social, cultural and foreign policies.    Priority will be given to the completion of territorial  integrity through the consecration of the return of the Saharan  provinces to the homeland and the carrying on of efforts for the  settlement of the territorial dispute with Spain over Sebta and  Mellilia and the neighboring islands, the new prime minister  said.    Filali solemnly said the government 'will see to it that  nothing put at stake the legitimate recovery by Morocco of its  Saharan provinces and that the rights and peace of Moroccan  citizens be strictly respected'.    Concerning Sebta and Mellilia, Filali said wisdom and shared  interests recommend that Spain and Morocco resort to dialog and  understanding to settle the dispute over the Presidios.    The government deems that King Hassan II's proposal to set  up  a reflection cell as the best means to reach a solution that  respects Morocco's sovereign rights and preserves Spanish  economic interests.    Underlining the national mobilization around the territorial  integrity issue, Filali said 'We hope that we can rely on this  same mobilization to address, together, the sensitive internal  issues we are facing up regarding the promotion of human rights,  the improvement of the public service, the sound management of  justice on the one hand and the improvement of the living  standards of our co-citizens, of employment and of education on  the other'.    Filali pledged that the government will endeavor to  consolidate the state of law and to see to it that all citizens  enjoy their rights before listing all the initiatives made in  this field during the past years. He said the government  undertakes to further promote the respect and protection of  human rights and to resolutely act to enhance the civil and  political rights of citizens, improve their economic, social and  cultural rights and consolidate the rights of women, children  and vulnerable populations.    At the economic and financial scale, Filali said the  government will carry on efforts for the modernization of the  Moroccan economy through the adoption of 'an economic and social  policy based, in the short run, on maintaining the major basic  balances and curbing public deficits'.    The government also pledges 'to speed up the privatization  process' and to continue the quest for a sustained development  particularly in matters of employment.    In this regard, Filali underlined that employment upgrading  will be at the core of the action of the government, which will  encourage all job-generating projects.    In the social field, the government 'will strive to meet the  basic needs of the population in matters of housing and health  through the development of a social solidarity network.'    The government will also 'continue, in line with the royal  guidelines, discussions with the economic and social partners  within a franc, responsible and constructive dialog with a view  to edifying a prosperous society that opens new horizons for the  lower layers of the society.'    The prime minister stressed Morocco's will to efficiently  participate in the edification of the grand Maghreb and to help  Arab countries settle the Middle-East problems.    As to Moroccan-European relations, Abdellatif Filali said  these relations which 'have developed through years are still  marked by some disequilibrium in trade, economic and financial  matters'. Moroccan-European discussions on a new partnership  accord 'are facing serious difficulties and suffer from a  divergence in approach and vision', the prime minister said,  adding the offer made by the union concerning a new partnership  form was deemed insufficient by Morocco, which presented, last  February, counter-proposals to the union based on a  geo-strategic vision.    'Morocco cannot conclude a new accord with the union, unless  it is founded on sound and balanced bases, guarantees a genuine  and a mutually beneficial partnership and meets Morocco's  requirements in social and economic matters', he said.    The prime minister undertook to inform the parliament on the  evolution of these questions and renewed his will to open up the  channels of dialog with the parliament and create a new climate  that consolidates the dignity of institutions.    The governmental declaration, made following the setting up  last Tuesday of a new cabinet, will be discussed by the  parliament as of next Monday before the confidence vote.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by political </F> editor Chip Tsao, in Australia; place and date not given]    [Text] [Tsao] You have mentioned on many occasions the  importance of implementing the Joint Declaration after 1997.  China sees ruling Hong Kong after 1997 an internal, domestic  issue. How can the Joint Declaration be secured by Britain  after the transition in 1997?    [Patten] Nobody is arguing for an extension of sovereignty,  nor extending British influence. It's very curious to suggest  that fair elections are a way of extending British influence.  Equally, it is a complete contradiction of the meaning of the  Joint Declaration to say that Britain has no moral  responsibility and no interest in Hong Kong after 1997.    First of all, until 2000, there will be meetings between the  Joint Liaison Group (JLG) and Chinese officials about transition  issues, and that is an agreement made with Britain and China.    Secondly, since the Joint Declaration is a treaty signed  between Britain and China, Britain plainly has an interest in  ensuring that it is properly implemented. It's a treaty lodged  at the United Nations and also a treaty between Britain and  China. We have a moral responsibility to ensure the freedoms  and values of Hong Kong are maintained and will continue after  1997.    It's a moral responsibility and a practical concern but I  totally accept it doesn't involve any aspects of sovereign  action.    [Tsao] But it is a declaration, not a treaty. It is called  a declaration, not even an agreement.    [Patten] It is a recognised treaty lodged in the UN like  other international treaties. China is obliged to abide by it.  Equally, since we are the other name on the document, we have a  continuing interest in it being implemented.    [Tsao] Can you define what you mean by continuing interest?  Would it be regarded as a challenge to China's sovereignty over  Hong Kong? China has its own glossary on the words and terms of  the Joint Declaration, especially on words like "freedom" and  "election." It is the basis of endless arguments between the  two sides.    [Patten] We can't do anything which involves sovereign  intervention in Hong Kong, but we certainly would, if we  believed the Chinese were breaking their solemn undertaking of  the Joint Declaration. We'll certainly raise it internationally.    For example, freedom of speech. There is no amount of re-  interpretation which can turn freedom of speech into brutal  intervention by Government in the affairs of newspapers or  broadcasting organisations. If China means, by elections,  arranging things so that you get the result you want, then China  should say that. But "elections" in the Joint Declaration were  never meant to imply that. Look at the debates that took place  after the document (was signed) in which people talked about a  steady development of representative government.    China can't go back on that now and make words which appear  in the Joint Declaration have meaning which they have never  borne. I'd prefer to believe China means to keep her word  rather than speculate about arrangements that we'd need to  follow if China wasn't keeping her word.    I believe China has given her word to Hong Kong, Britain,  and  the international community. But if it was apparent that China  wasn't doing so, then I'm sure there are a number of options  which would need to be followed by Britain.    [Tsao] During your trip to Australia, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans was the only cabinet  minister who expressed strong support publicly for your  democracy package. Did you not see this as a disappointingly  solitary voice when compared to the reaction you received after  you announced the dem-ocracy package in 1992.    [Patten] I have said at the outset that I haven't travelled  principally to Australia just to persuade Australians to throw  their hats in the ring on the issue of political development. I  am in Australia to encourage more people to do more business in  Hong Kong and to give a reassurance to Australian businesses  that are already in Hong Kong.    But, if you look at the support that we've had this week, it  seems to me difficult to argue that (support) has been in any  way diminished. I think every major Australian newspaper has  had a leading article supporting what we've been doing (in Hong  Kong).    We've had the support of every level of government, from the  states as well as the federal government; from right across the  political spectrum. I was giving evidence to the Foreign  Affairs Joint Committee yesterday and the support, or the  understanding [of the issues], is very considerable indeed.  Hong Kong has good friends around the world and some of our  best friends are in Australia.    [Tsao] Do you think that your Australian visit will be seen  as an attempt to gather international support for your reforms?    [Patten] Intelligent, rational discussion isn't advanced by  taking the frequently repeated propaganda of pro-Beijing  newspapers, or of United Front activists, as representing the  truth and a sensible view of the world. All this propaganda  about internationalisation is ridiculous.    Every time anybody from Hong Kong travels abroad, those  propaganda bugles play their tune about internationalisation.  It's a very curious argument. Are we to believe that when  Chinese officials go abroad and are asked about Hong Kong, they  don't set out their views and thoughts about Hong Kong? Of  course they do.    Given that, everywhere I've been, there's been a recognition  that resolving successfully the argument between China and  Britain is a matter for China and Britain. But equally,  everywhere I've been and places I haven't been, people take an  active interest in what happens in Hong Kong. They do it  because Hong Kong is such a regional and global asset. Those  are the realities. No amount of propaganda from the New China  News Agency (Xinhua) or from the communist newspapers in Hong  Kong is going to change that.    Sir Leon Brittan (Vice-President of the European  Commission) is to visit China this month to express concerns  that British business may suffer discrimination in trade with  China because of the Hong Kong democracy debate.    Is it not likely an EU (European Union) consensus may be  difficult to negotiate because Europe does not have a united  position on this matter.    [Patten] First of all, it's not for me to talk about British  trade with China. It's not one of my responsibilities.  Secondly, Chinese officials keep on saying there is no  relationship between politics and trade. I assume when they say  that they mean it.    Were they to behave in a different way, it would have  profound implications for the China-European Union Cooperation  Agreement and it would have profound implications for China's  application to join the GATT.    It would also have distorted some other arguments China is  having around the world about trade issues.    I don't believe China will be well advised to ignore what  the  Chinese leader and other Chinese officials have said. [sentence  as published] As for Sir Leon's visit, I know very little about  that. The visit has been long planned.    [Tsao] You've spent more than 10 days in Australia,  including a private holiday. Have you, since you left Hong  Kong, being in a more relaxed mood, come to a firmer idea about  when to table the rest of your bill and in what form? [Patten]  Nothing I've thought or done in Australia during my leave has  changed the decision about the legislative process made before I  came.    We still want to return to the negotiating table with China.  Realistically, that seems less and less a possibility. When the  present bill is concluded, we'll have to move on to the last  remaining legislative brick and place that in the wall.    That will depend on the timing of that and crucially, when  the present bill emerges from the Legislative Council.  [sentence as published]    It's worth noting the present bill has been in the  Legislative Council [Legco] for nearly two and a half months and  there are about four months until Legco rises for the summer  recess.    There's a recognition that if we were able to get talks  going  again, we'd have to go into a more intensified form of  negotiation -- like a week or two -- to sort things out during  prolonged negotiations. I wish time was on our side, but it's  not.    [Tsao] Although there is still no official response from  China to your latest proposal on the airport project, some  peripheral pro- Chinese voices have called for additional  injections of funding, over and above the $6bn reportedly  offered by the Hong Kong government to China.    There is plenty of money left in the government reserve. Why  is the Government still so financially cautious given that the  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) requires that $25bn be left to  the future special administrative region (SAR) government.    [Patten] We've put forward, in good conscience and with  considerable sincerity, a financial package which appears to me  to include all the points that China put to us last year. I  hope China can react positively and quickly, but I don't think I  can react to the reports of the so-called friends of China.    I just hope some of those socalled friends of China would be  friends of Hong Kong.    [Tsao] You have encouraged Australian companies to compete  in bidding for projects in the new airport plan.    You have also assured them there will be fair treatment from  the government on assessments of tenders.    But China claims unofficially that some British companies  have been given favourable treatment when contracts have been  granted for the Chek Lap Kok project.    [Patten] That's, of course, a load of rubbish. Of the large  projects, about 60 percent have been won by Japanese-led  consortia. That paranoia should be put on one side.    [Tsao] Equally pressing is the issue of the Final Court of  Appeal. Legco has reached a consensus on the agreement between  the two governments. When will there be a resolution, so that a  Final Court of Appeal, which is acceptable to Legco, will be put  in place?    [Patten] We're working on draft legislation for the Final  Court of Appeal.    We then have to put it to legislators. I hope they will take  a swift decision. I don't think there is any chance of being  able to renegotiate the settlement made in the JLG [Sino-British  Joint Liaison Group].    [Tsao] You've always said Legco's opinions should be  listened to and respected, yet they clearly rejected this  agreement.    [Patten] We'll have to see what they say when they're  presented with the actual legislation. If Legco says we prefer  no Court of Appeal rather than one which reflects the agreement  then we'll have to take account of that. That's an obligation.    We've have no other alternative. The Legislative Council has  the responsibility of legislating.</p>

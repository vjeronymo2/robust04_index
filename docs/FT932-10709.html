			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Theft from bombed buildings Sir, On May 4 we were at last given access - albeit limited in both time and number of people - to our offices in Bishopsgate, which were damaged by the IRA bomb on April 24. A look at the devastation was distressing; almost as distressing was the realisation that the premises had been looted. We have learned that theft from bomb-damaged sites has been widespread. While I sympathise with the difficulties faced by the police in dealing with the IRA, I wish they had been able to prevent theft from buildings to which access has been controlled but which were obviously visited by people who were apparently diverted from their usual habit of robbing hit-and-run victims and battlefield casualties.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Blenheim Group Blenheim Group has picked up a healthy dose of sceptical comment in recent years. With the market gun-shy about 1980s growth stocks it is not hard to see why. Blenheim expanded rapidly by acquisition and then wanted to 'smooth' earnings by bringing forward profits on exhibitions yet to be held. It switched its year-end to give a 16-month reporting period, which made year-on-year comparisons difficult. It also raised Pounds 76m in convertible preference shares only to see profits forecasts downgraded three months later. Such things happen, and much of the uncertainty is reflected in the company's share rating. Yet none of it will comfort those of a nervous disposition. The news that its chief executive, Mr Philip Soar, is standing aside to become director of planning and strategy is thus just one more thing to worry about. Staging exhibitions is an attractive business, which can generate substantial profits, but any idea that it is immune to the economic cycle is far-fetched. Blenheim's reliance on France and Germany means that the company faces tough markets for the next couple of years. One of the most alluring features of the exhibition business is its strong cash flows, with customers paying up to a year before costs are incurred. The continuing cash outflow from Blenheim, albeit arising partly from acquisitions, will make the downturn that much more painful.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 15 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government will submit an additional request as  early as this week to China, which wants to become a GATT  member this year, asking it to lower tariffs on about 300 mining  and manufacturing industrial goods, including chemical and  electric appliances. Japan has already asked China to lower  tariffs and remove nontariff barriers on some 3,800 goods. The  total number of goods, if the items on the additional request  are included, will become about 4,100.    Regarding the 3,800 goods, the government submitted a demand  last March and received a tentative answer from China in late  May. However, since the contents of the response are not  "satisfactory," (according to a government source), the  government, in addition to submitting the additional request,  plans to work on China during future bilateral negotiations to  positively accept the demands.    Regarding China's GATT membership, a GATT working-level  meeting is scheduled to be held in Geneva starting on 27 June.  It seems that Japan and China will have bilateral negotiations  at that time.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: A timely dig at American politics - Radio WHAT could be more apt, on the eve of this bizarre American Presidential election, than Ira and George Gershwins' musical, Of Thee of I Sing? The book, by George S. Kaufman and Morris Ryskind, mocks every kind of American political belief. John P. Wintergreen, the chosen candidate, is pressed for issues. 'In the first four years,' he is told, 'you don't do anything except try to get re-elected,' but a chambermaid says what is most important to her: money. And love. So Wintergreen has to fall in love; more, he has to marry Diana Devereux, the winner of the Miss America pageant. Unluckily, he falls in love with a non-contestant, Mary Turner, who wins him with her corn-muffins. Wintergreen is to be impeached for his disloyalty to Diana, but when Mary has twins, impeachment is forgotten. Kaufman and Ryskind come out better than the Gershwins; even the theme song 'Of thee I sing, baby' (from which Kaufman tried unsuccessfully to scrub the 'baby') is hardly a chart-buster. But amiable fun is made of American affairs, and the Chicago production by the National Radio Theatre, directed by Yuri Rasovski, was fine. The first President to be elected after the 1931-2 Broadway run was Franklyn Roosevelt, so the mockery did no harm. To mark European Drug Prevention Week in a fortnight's time, Radio 1 is to collaborate with Radio 5 in a warning against solvents. Meanwhile, on Radio 4's uncharacteristic Drunk last Sunday, Professor Laurie Taylor took three average drinkers, in their late 20s, from a Paisley bar to an 'Intoxication Workshop' at Paisley College. They were given a series of double vodkas-and-orange and their reactions tested after each - memorising numbers, reading tongue-twisters and so on, their speech and other reactions observed. Tall Hugh, after four vodkas, besides the pint-and-a-half of lager he had at the pub, was still legally fit to drive, whereas short Vic and female Jackie were over the limit after three, and happy to go on drinking after four. All three united at the end in singing 'Paper rose'. We should have been told the conclusions. Back to Radio 3. In its current series of plays from the 1960s, last Sunday it gave David Halliwell's Little Malcolm and His Struggle against the Eunuchs, which won him the Evening Standard Award for most promising playwright in 1966. Malcolm, sacked from his art college in Huddersfield, plans revenge on the principal. He and some fellow-students will kidnap him, steal a famous picture from the city's art gallery (Stanley Spencer's Garden at Cookham Rise) and compel him to destroy it, so revealing his real contempt for art. But Malcolm also plans to launch a Nazi-type political party, the Dynamic Erection Party, dedicated to the end of discipline, though to little else. In the event, despite his brave talk, he lacks the guts to make his effort; the only action is the wretched beating-up of his girl by his mates, and the party dissolves itself. What we liked at the time was the satirical vigour of the talk - though my diary said we needed rather less of it, and now says so again. As well as a terrific Malcolm from John Hurt, the original company included Halliwell himself and Philip Martin, here the director, so Sunday's authenticity is guaranteed. The later, more active, scenes came over better than the early 'political' parts, but I liked it all, even if some reminiscence was involved. David Streames was a decent Malcolm, but the young chaps' voices all had much the same quality.</p>

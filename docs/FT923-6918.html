			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: World airlines fall further into loss THE world's airline industry fell further into loss last year as smaller companies descended from break-even into a Dollars 1bn deficit, a survey out yesterday says, Daniel Green reports. The 20 biggest airlines cut their losses last year from Dollars 2.7bn in 1990 to Dollars 830m, largely because of the failure of two US airlines, Eastern and Pan Am. Between 1990 and 1991, Eastern's loss of Dollars 1.1bn dropped out of the total and Pan Am cut its deficit from Dollars 638m to a first-half Dollars 283m, the number included in the total for the year. The report, by Airline Business, shows American Airlines strengthening its position as the world's biggest airline by sales (Dollars 12.89bn), though it made only a Dollars 5m operating profit. American also topped the list on numbers of passengers carried and staff employed. United Airlines, also of the US, and Air France remain in second and third positions. A third US carrier, Delta, moved up from sixth to fourth place, leapfrogging Lufthansa and British Airways. BA was the most profitable airline in the top 15, the report says. Fastest-growing carrier was Virgin Atlantic of the UK, whose sales grew 81 per cent to Dollars 584m. A shift in aircraft delivery has occurred towards the larger airlines: the top 20 added 374 aircraft last year, while the next 80 reduced the size of their fleets by 123. Airline Business' figures are lower than those of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), partly because it includes non-IATA carriers such as SouthWest Airlines of the US and United Parcel Services. A A Tupolev Tu-204 twin-engined passenger aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines has made successful test flights near Moscow - part of a contract between Rolls-Royce and Tupolev signed in April that could be worth Pounds 500m.</p>

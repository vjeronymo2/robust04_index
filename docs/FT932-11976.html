			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Management: Sunrise industry, sunset directors - Technological know-how is an asset on any board Shareholder activism is generally associated with institutional investors such as the big US pension funds that have recently told companies to trim executive pay and appoint more non-executive directors. Yet as International Business Machines, the world's largest computer company, found out this week, individual investors holding only a few hundred shares can also rock the boat. About 2,500 IBM shareholders, many of them retired employees of the company, attended IBM's annual meeting in Tampa, Florida earlier this week. Angry and frustrated by the 50 per cent drop in the value of their shares over the past year, they pilloried the company's directors with questions about their competence. The board is 'too insulated and too old' one elderly shareholder charged, to applause from the crowd. 'Most of them come from the era of manual typewriters and carbon paper.' Another accused directors of operating an 'old boy network' and having been management cheerleaders, rather than shareholders' watchdogs. 'If I were a director I would be embarrassed to even show up here and have my name on the list to be elected,' said Gilbert Jannelli, a shareholder who said that he had already sold 90 per-cent of his shares. 'How can you work with that group of people when their attitudes and decisions and trusting manners have caused this company's rapid demise?' he asked Louis Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive. '(The board) surely lacks the pertinent current knowledge, skills and vision to deal with and add value to and guide IBM. I believe the board should have current chief information officers of companies, current deans of engineering schools, and current entrepreneurs, people who are really up to date,' said another. Although IBM board nominees were ultimately elected by a large majority, the questions raised by individual shareholders at the company's annual meetings may force changes in the future. 'The composition of the board and the board's ability to contribute to building this company is a subject of great interest to me and to the board, and I am sure that this board will spend a lot of time thinking about the right representatives of shareholders to carry forth what we have to do to (improve the performance of) the company,' was Gerstner's ultimate response. 'We will, and this board does already, share your statement that the board has to be relevant, appropriate and evolving as the corporation evolves.' IBM is hardly alone in the information technology industry in having a board of directors dominated by individuals whose age might suggest that they are not up to date on the latest technology. Twelve of IBM's 18 directors are over 60. The average age is 61.3. Digital Equipment, the second largest US computer company, which is also struggling to regain its momentum, has a 10-member board with an average age of 66.3 years. It is perhaps significant that the average age of directors at two of today's most successful high-tech companies is lower. Microsoft's average director age is 50.5, while Intel's is 58.25. Hewlett-Packard, one of Silicon Valley's oldest electronics companies, whose board is chaired by co-founder and octogenarian Dave Packard, has enough 'youngsters' on its board to make the average age 58.8 years. Age is hardly the best way to determine the fitness of an individual to serve on a company's board of directors. However, the conventional qualifications - experience and business achievements - generally ensure that there are plenty of grey hairs on the board. It may be time to consider younger candidates, as IBM's shareholders in Florida, the 'retirement capital of the US', suggested. Up-to-date technology know-how is a valuable asset on any board of directors, whether it be a computer company, or a company that spends heavily on information technology. Today, there are few companies that do not fall within that spectrum.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / People: Graham Watson changes teams Graham Watson, one of Scotland's leading corporate finance specialists, has become a partner of the accountancy firm Touche Ross. He wants to help make its Scottish branch into a leading adviser on corporate finance north of the border, eventually, he hopes, putting it on a par with Scottish merchant banks such as Noble Grossart. Watson, 36, worked at Noble Grossart for eight years after training as a CA. In 1991 he resigned as a director to set up Carnegie, giving financial advice to sportsmen and football and rugby clubs. He had already come up with the debenture issue which enabled Rangers to finance a new stand and had launched a similar issue for Arsenal, before advising the Scottish Rugby Union on its Pounds 37m Murrayfield stadium project. Carnegie looks after the affairs of golfer Sam Torrance and footballer Ally McCoist. Last October Watson unexpectedly resigned as MD of Carnegie because of disagreement over strategy with its main shareholder, David Murray, chairman of Murray International and of Rangers. Carnegie subsequently moved its HQ from Edinburgh to London and opened up in New Zealand and New York. Touche Ross already has two partners in Scotland dealing with corporate finance, David Shearer and Peter Holmes, who last week took credit for devising the Pounds 72m management buy-in of 25 engineering subsidiaries of Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group. Watson says that since firms like Touche Ross already provide companies with tax advice and management consultancy, 'there is no reason why we should also hand over to merchant banks the role of being corporate finance advisers as well'.</p>

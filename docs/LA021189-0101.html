			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE WATERFRONT: PACIFICA'S PRESIDENT, LIKE THE YACHTS SHE BUILDS, IS 1 OF A  KIND  </P> <P> Wanda Kipper, fashion-model thin and casually stylish, looks like she stepped  out of the pages of a yachting magazine. Her hair, makeup and manner suggest  someone who would be more at home sailing a fancy yacht than building one.  </P> <P> But appearances are deceiving.  </P> <P> As owner and president of Pacifica by Kipper Yachts in Costa Mesa, Wanda Kipper  is the country's only woman to head a major boat-building company.  </P> <P> Pacifica, which builds 36- to 77-foot sportfishing yachts that sell anywhere  from $250,000 to $2.5 million each, caters to what Kipper calls "macho  fishermen" who want big, fast powerboats that will take them all the way from  Orange County to Cabo San Lucas and back without any problems.  </P> <P> Kipper, who prefers not to reveal her age but says "I'm younger than President  Reagan," has been running the business since 1982 when her husband, Stuart,  died of cancer. There was never any question about whether she would keep the  boat-building business, which the Kippers had purchased in 1970 and had run  jointly.  </P> <P> "I did not consider selling it," says Kipper, who managed the office, ordered  parts, kept track of inventory and designed the interiors of the yachts. Her  husband designed the boats and supervised construction.  </P> <P> Today, Wanda Kipper still runs the office, orders parts, keeps track of  inventory and designs the yachts' interiors. In addition, she sells boats,  works boat shows and produces the company's ads. General Manager Bob Gunderson,  Wanda Kipper's son by an earlier marriage, supervises production of the  limited-edition yachts, which are built in Costa Mesa and Panama City, Fla.  </P> <P> "Stu and I started the business together . . . and always ran it together,"  says the diminutive and soft-spoken Kipper. He was in his late 40s and had  taken an early retirement as a problem solver/inventor for a company in Los  Angeles. She was a former artist with Walt Disney Studios and ran her own  commercial art business in Glendale.  </P> <P> Both were boaters, so after they both retired, they moved to Hawaii, where they  started a charter boat business. "We were back here looking for a better boat  for charter when we came to Pacifica Marine and Stu asked them to build him a  boat -- the way he wanted it built. The owners of the company said they  couldn't build it that way and said to Stu, 'Why don't you buy the company and  build it yourself?' Stu said, 'OK.' So, we bought the business and moved back  to California," Kipper recalls.  </P> <P> Since the Kippers took over, Pacifica has produced 135 yachts, and Wanda Kipper  can tell you exactly where each one is. Many of the owners are among the  country's wealthiest individuals, she says. "And I felt flattered when they  chose a Pacifica. They could afford any boat they want, and they chose ours."  </P> <P> The walls of her unpretentious Costa Mesa office are lined with photos of  Pacifica and their happy owners, most of whom -- like Wanda Kipper herself --  are ardent fishermen.  </P> <P> Kipper, daughter of a commercial fisherman, has been an angler most of her life  and has been boating as long as she can remember. "I have two brothers who are  commercial fishermen in Alaska," she says proudly. "And two nieces who are  commercial fishermen. One does it part time and the other does it full time.  They've been fishing since they were 8 or 9."  </P> <P> In 1984, Kipper, who fishes frequently in the waters between Orange County and  Catalina, single-handedly staged a benefit marlin fishing tournament that  attracted 34 boats and raised $17,000 for the American Cancer Society.  </P> <P> Kipper, who had watched her husband die of cancer, wanted to do her part in  helping find a cure for the disease. "I felt that if everyone in the U.S. did  something to help find a cure, then we would succeed," she says.  </P> <P> Since then, the West Coast Marlin Shoot-Out, as the tournament has come to be  known, has become an annual benefit for the Orange County unit of the American  Cancer Society. For the first 3 years Kipper ran the tournament alone. "Then  each year we began to get more and more sponsors," she says.  </P> <P> Today, Kipper serves on the tournament committee and is still a driving force  behind the event. Committee meetings are already under way for the 1989  tournament, planned for August.  </P> <P> "Right now I am doing push-ups to build up my arm muscles for fishing," Kipper  says. "In the next tournament I want to go out with an all-woman team."  </P> <P> Kipper is proud of the fact that, in the interest of conservation, the  tournament has become a "tag-and-release" competition in which all fish are  released unharmed after a hook-up has been officially recorded.  </P> <P> Talking about the tournament as she walks through the cluttered boatyard, past  the machine and electrical shops, Kipper, meticulous as ever, looks out of  place -- like the proud mother who has stopped by to visit her son at work.  </P> <P> But as she reaches the gigantic hull of the 44-foot Pacifica currently under  construction, she does not hesitate to climb the rickety ladder 10 feet up so  that she can inspect the interior of the vessel.  </P> <P> Her willingness to become involved in every aspect of the boat-building process  has served her well, Kipper says. And her fishing and boating expertise has  made it easy being a female boat-builder in the male-dominated world of  sportfishing, she insists.  </P> <P> "Being a woman in this business has never been a problem as far as the boat  owners are concerned," she says. "The only problem I may have had (as a woman)  was getting revolving credit.  </P> <P> "But as far as the boat buyers go, they know we build top-of-the-line boats,"  she says. "And when people talk to me, they know that I understand what they  are talking about. For example, when they ask me how much fuel a boat uses, I  make it my business to know."  </P> <P> Later, standing in the boatyard with the huge hull of the Pacifica 44 towering  behind her, Kipper smiles and says: "I love this business. I love boats."  </P> <P> Boat Bargains -- Boats ranging from dinghies to a 57-foot motor sailer will be  offered for sale from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. next Saturday at the Boy Scouts of  America Sea Base, 1931 W.

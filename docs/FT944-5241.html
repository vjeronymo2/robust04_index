			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: Giant with feet of clay / Tom Lloyd offers a contrasting view of business process re-engineering The passionate defence of re-engineering by Michael Hammer and Steven Stanton (FT, October 5) against what they see as misconceived criticisms is a sign that this precocious giant among modern management nostrums is suffering from growing pains. There are three reasons why the spectacular, early success of re-engineering has failed to blossom. The first is that its status, within the overall management scheme, is unclear; the second is that, as a consequence of the first, re-engineering can be extremely dangerous, and the third is that re-engineering is already out-of-date, in that it is a cost-cutting and re-structuring technique, at a time when the prevailing management focus is switching to growth. The equivocal status of re-engineering stems from the fact that it has great power to change an organisation but that, notwithstanding the protestations of its evangelists, it lacks a correspondingly powerful business philosophy. Hammer says he is co-founder of the 're-engineering movement' and if it was a 'movement' that began with the publication of Reengineering the Corporation, his claim is justified. But is it a 'movement', in the sense of the 'labour', 'co-operative', or 'building society' movements? A 'movement' is a philosophy, and a call for action. Re-engineering calls loudly for action, but its philosophy is prosaic in the extreme. It simply replaces the old 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' prescription with the more challenging and constructive injunction: 'make all your processes the best-in-class'. Its focus is on corporate mechanics, not on vision or strategy. The mistake is to claim it is something more than that. It provides no answer to such questions as 'which processes should I re-engineer?' and 'what strategic objectives will I have achieved, when I have finished?' It will prescribe the discarding of processes when their functions can be assumed by other processes, but it cannot say a process should be discarded because its function has become strategically superfluous or that a process should be out-sourced, because it would take too long, or cost too much to re-engineer. The dangers of this strategic silence were exposed in the tale of a hypothetical catastrophe recounted in the Harvard Business Review by Francis Gouillart and Fred Sturdivant of Gemini Consulting. A market-leading printing company was losing market share to a rival offering quicker order-to-delivery. The market leader's order-to-delivery process was re-engineered, by cutting its larger product line, to reduce machine set-up time. Order-to-delivery time fell, market share stabilised and a re-engineering success was celebrated. But, through a combination of competitive re-engineering and bench-marking, all firms in the industry soon had the same product line, the same order-to-delivery time and the same strategy, to become the lowest cost producer and compete on price. A better strategy, Gouillart and Sturdivant argued, would have been for the market leader to make the length of its product line a strength, and develop separate processes for short and long production runs. But this would not have occurred to the re-engineers because the only strategy they have built-in is cost-minimisation. The reason why re-engineers, armed with benchmarking data, are so dangerous is that as soon as the stimulus of re-engineering becomes discrepancies in benchmarking data, all firms in an industry start converging on a point of no difference and thus of no profit. The distinction between qualification, and differentiation criteria helps to explain the danger. Qualification criteria are attributes every firm must have to join the game; differentiation criteria give a firm an edge. It is in the nature of competition that today's differentiation criteria will be tomorrow's qualification criteria. A few years ago, quality gave an edge, but quality is a 'commodity' now. The dialectic of competition is inescapable - if a new thing works, others will copy it. A year ago re-engineering was a differentiation criterion. Now every company is re-engineering, it has become a qualification criterion, and the danger is that, left to its own devices, it will drive out all strategies except cost minimisation. Hammer's and Stanton's assertion that 'those who do it (re-engineering) right, succeed', is not only tautological; it is also dangerously misleading. The measure of the success of a re-engineering programme is not the efficiency of the re-engineered processes, but the contribution it makes to the achievement of the firm's strategic objectives.

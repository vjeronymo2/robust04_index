			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: EMPTY NEST GETS FAST REDECORATION  </P> <P> For a long time sociologists had us believing that the "empty nest" was like  some dreaded, uncontrollable disease, symptomatized by crying, long periods of  depression and an inability to function.  </P> <P> We'd hear stories about mothers who converted their grown children's rooms into  shrines and fathers who called up their married sons and begged them to "come  over and shoot a few baskets after dinner."  </P> <P> Rumors circulated that mothers automatically set the table for three for the  rest of their lives and dads gave up their bowling nights for fear they'd miss  a call from the "kid."  </P> <P> In my mind, I put the empty nest right up there with menopause and gingivitis.  </P> <P> When our last child left home, a friend called and said, "You need company to  get you through the first night alone?"  </P> <P> "Actually," I said, "you caught us as we were leaving. We're going out to  dinner."  </P> <P> "You're going to have to face that empty house sometime," she warned.  </P> <P> She was right. We filled in all the small holes left by darts and nails and had  his room painted and made into a small TV room. We had the rugs cleaned and the  oil spots removed from the driveway. After that, we went on our first vacation  that wasn't planned around a paper route.  </P> <P> I'm not saying there weren't adjustments. It was weeks before we stopped  looking for the TV tuner in the bathroom, months before our hearing returned to  normal, and I still haven't gotten over the shock of going into the garage and  seeing my own car parked there.  </P> <P> In retrospect, we have learned to live with phones that ring only when they're  for us, two loads of laundry a week and popcorn for dinner. Our friends marvel  at how well we are able to deal with the trauma of just the two of us entering  the twilight years alone. They say we are very brave. We smile and say, "Thank  you."  </P> <P> Recently the University of Nebraska researched the empty-nest syndrome and  discovered that when children leave home, the marriage of the parents not only  improves, but that they may even experience a mini-honeymoon.  </P> <P> Some say this change of attitude is due to the independence of women who go  from child raising to a second career that is just as fulfilling. I say there  was a whole generation of parents who were lying to us through their teeth just  to keep the prophecy alive.  </P></p>

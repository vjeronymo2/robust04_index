			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Italy  on Friday [24 June] agreed to hold an Anglo-Italian summit  meeting, British officials said after the first meeting between  the two countries' leaders since Italian elections in March  brought neofascists into the government.    British Prime Minister John Major and Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi agreed in principle to hold the Anglo-Italian  summit, though the date and place were not yet decided, British  officials said.    The Major-Berlusconi meeting, which took place on the  sidelines of the 51st European Union [EU] summit here, lasted 75  minutes and centred on the agenda for the meeting of EU leaders,  British officials said.    Almost immediately after Berlusconi's nomination as the new  Italian prime minister in April, British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd invited him to London for an Anglo-Italian summit.    Berlusconi ruffled British feathers by instead making his  first foreign outing last week to Bonn, visiting German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Earlier in June he also met US President Bill Clinton when  the US head of state was in Rome on a week-long European tour to  commemorate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Rome and  the D-Day landings.    The British and Italian leaders also discussed their  position  on the succession to Jacques Delors as European Commission  president, the officials said, but declined further details.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Command of Ukraine's navy has stopped supplying  the navigation services of the Black Sea Fleet with technical  information. As a high-ranking official from the Naval Staff  told INTERFAX-UKRAINA, this decision was taken because "the  Black Sea Fleet Command refuses to resolve the issue of jointly  ensuring the safety of navigation, including exchanges in  navigation information."    Meanwhile, as the spokesman for Ukraine's navy said, the  Odessa and Nikolayev hydrographic districts run by Kiev  "regularly give information to Ukrainian and Russian civilian  ships and to the Black Sea Fleet." "In the meantime, the Black  Sea Fleet Command has failed to notify us even of the  hydrographic works to be conducted in the Azov Sea in June,  though such works must be coordinated officially," said  INTERFAX-UKRAINA's interviewee.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (15): Investors in people - Training / the Tec's programme has received huge support Gloucestershire Training and Enterprise Council has attracted countrywide attention for its success with the Investors in People programme, which encourages organisations to achieve a nationally agreed standard for training and developing staff. Mr Graham Hoyle, chief executive of the Tec, which was ranked among the top 10 of England's 75 Tecs when the government published performance tables in September, describes IiP as 'central and critical to our mission'. Since the IiP programme was launched two years ago, a total of 373 local organisations - including schools, colleges and businesses ranging from those with just a few staff to some of the county's largest - have dedicated themselves to achieving the IiP award. They cover about 40,000 employees - or one in five of the county's workforce. Mr John Hazelwood, the Tec's chairman, has pointed out that the number of committed organisations is more than the total in Scotland and Wales combined. To date, the IiP award has been gained by 15 Gloucestershire-based companies, including Birds Eye Wall's, of which Mr Hazelwood is general manager, and which has the largest ice-cream factory in Europe. The Tec expects that, by March, the number committed to IiP will have risen to 500. Mr Hoyle has an evangelical view of the programme. Schemes for the unemployed, he says, have a very marginal effect in improving the overall skills base of the workforce, and what is needed is to improve the skills of the vast majority who are in work. 'We have taken a very pragmatic approach to up-skill the county,' he says. 'We realised we had a difficult issue. We wanted to see the skills base raised of the employed workforce, but there was no money for this from the government. The only route was to persuade employers that it was in their financial interest to invest in training their workforce.' In recessionary times, when companies are more likely to shed than recruit workers, it can be even more difficult to persuade them to spend money on training. But Mr Hoyle says there is no inconsistency in training people who might subsequently be made redundant. 'It is very, very simple. A company is making an absolute commitment systematically to develop and train its workforce. That workforce will go up and down, but IiP says that, no matter what is the company's trading position or size, we are committing ourselves to training everyone.' A substantial part of the Tec's resources has been channelled into the programme. Of the Tec's total budget of Pounds 13.5m, it invested Pounds 750,000 last year in IiP with technical support, providing up to 50 per cent of employers' costs. This year, the funding is less, between Pounds 550,000 and Pounds 600,000. 'A deliberate decision was made that, having created a critical mass last year, we did not need the same kind of unit cost per company to keep the programme, and that's proving to be the case,' says Mr Hoyle. 'We are now able to bring companies on, and start to drive them through the process, at a much lower cost than last year.' He adds: 'No company is going to go down this track unless they have a pretty good feeling it will benefit them financially. It would be mad to go down that route, and to put energy into what is a demanding programme, unless there was a tangible benefit from it.' He describes IiP as a statement of sound management practice - that companies need to look at their most valuable and expensive asset, their staff. Another evangelical supporter of IiP is Ms Sam Elliott, owner of the 23-bed Grapevine Hotel at Stow-on-the-Wold and a board member of Investors in People UK, launched this year by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, to promote the programme. She describes how gaining the award has given the staff a heightened motivation, which has shown up in the bottom line: 'In one year, we have turned our position round from feeling financially threatened in the midst of recession to being secure in the knowledge that we are controlling our present and future position in the marketplace.' Another company which has gained the award is Signet Armorlite Europe, in Gloucester, which supplies ophthalmic lenses. 'We want people to be achievers,' says Mr Nelson Hawkes, managing director. 'If they are achievers they are happier, more productive, more able to see the company's success as their own success.' A printing company committed to the programme is Cooper Clegg, of Tewkesbury, which employs nearly 150 people. Mr Ian Cooper, its chairman, says that, despite a lack of financial support for the costs, he strongly supports the programme. 'I cannot exaggerate how important I think it is in keeping people motivated.' PMC, a Cheltenham management consultancy with 16 staff, which is seeking the award, says the programme has created a 'disciplined and repeating cycle' of commitment, planning, action and evaluation, which are the main principles of the IiP standard. A much larger company which already has the award is Renishaw, the maker of precision measuring equipment, based at Wotton-under-Edge with 500 employees. 'Companies should naturally look to improve their assets, and people are a highly valuable asset,' says Mr John Oldham, its personnel officer. 'IiP is absolutely important to help us develop in all directions. It is the basis for the future.'</p>

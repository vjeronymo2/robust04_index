			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: FT-SE 100 will remain UK-based Sir, The impending floatation of GPA Group has publicly raised the issue of whether Irish Republic companies should be included in the FT-SE 100 Index. The Index Steering Committee (which was set up by the London Stock Exchange as an independent body comprised of investment practitioners to oversee the running of the FT-SE 100), recently confirmed long-standing practice that the rules should continue specifically to exclude non-UK companies; so Irish companies such as GPA Group, Jefferson Smurfit and Allied Irish Banks will not be included in the index. The principle rule being questioned by Irish companies is that the FT-SE 100 should consist only of 'companies incorporated and registered for tax purposes in the UK'. The Irish companies' intention is clear - they wish to improve the marketability and value of their shares and believe that entry to the FT-SE 100 will achieve this. Yet the FT-SE 100 was specifically, and very deliberately, designed to be an indicator of the performance of the UK market. The change of rules needed to to allow non-UK companies to enter the index - whether Irish, American or Japanese - would be a fundamental change to the design of the index. The FT-SE 100 measures the performance of the UK's largest 100 companies and is widely used by portfolio managers worldwide in measuring the performance of their UK assets and in managing their portfolio risks using futures and traded options on the index. It is not the only UK index - it is widely used in conjunction with the FT-A All Share Index which represents the performance of a larger proportion of the UK market. Both indices are focused on the UK market and neither index includes Irish companies. Neither index does so because they are used by portfolio managers to monitor their UK sterling denominated funds. Portfolio managers do not include Irish companies in their UK funds and they will not slavishly follow the decisions of the steering committee in deciding which stocks to hold in such portfolios. Most institutional users of the FT-SE 100 are not passive index trackers but are either active fund managers focused on the largest UK securities or are trackers of the wider based FT-A All Share Index. What use is the FT-SE 100 with overseas additions (Irish or any other) to a portfolio manager wishing to measure the performance of the largest companies within his UK fund or who wishes to use the FT-SE 100 futures and options to hedge his UK position? All other major indices make a clear distinction between UK and Irish companies - even so far as to group Irish companies with continental Europe rather than the UK when calculating the performance of the two major blocs within Europe; namely, UK and Europe excluding UK. While the committee understands the motives and the intentions of Irish companies wishing to be included in the FT-SE 100, it has no intention of turning the FT-SE 100 into a UK index with selected international additions.

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Indian unrest leads Hindalco to delay issue HINDALCO, the Indian aluminium producer, has postponed the launch of its planned Dollars 100m international equity offering because of the unrest in India. Robert Fleming, lead manager for Hindalco's global depositary share (GDS) offering, said the issue would take place 'as soon as the market is ready'. The Bombay stock exchange was closed on Monday and yesterday after the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya by Hindu militants sparked a wave of violence across the country. Grasim Industries, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre manufacturer, has completed its recent Dollars 90m GDS offering, although Citicorp, one of the joint lead managers, said it was too early to say whether the issue would be extended.</p>

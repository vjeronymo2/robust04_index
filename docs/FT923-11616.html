			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y loans hit Montreal Trustco MONTREAL Trustco, the financial services arm of BCE, Canada's largest telecoms group, has posted a first-half loss of CDollars 52.5m (USDollars 43.70), or Dollars 1.39 a share, on revenues of CDollars 673m, after special provisions of CDollars 94m. They included CDollars 50m to cover loans to Olympia &amp; York Developments. A year earlier, the company earned CDollars 29.1m, or 65 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 770m. The second-quarter loss this year was CDollars 58.5m, or CDollars 1.51, after the special provisions, against a profit of CDollars 14m, or 31 cents, a year earlier. Co-Steel, the Canadian mill group that owns Sheerness Steel in the UK, continues to feel the impact of low prices, although North American markets are improving. One of the few North American steelmakers to post a profit in 1991, Co-Steel reported second-quarter net income of CDollars 1m, or 4 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 251m. The year-to-year comparison was distorted by special tax factors.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Incentives for investment in equipment - Inland Revenue THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday acted to increase business confidence by encouraging companies to bring forward new investment in equipment and buildings. The proposals involve a new 40 per cent first year allowance for expenditure on machinery and plant (excluding cars and certain other assets) incurred by businesses in the 12 months ending October 31 next year. The Inland Revenue, in a statement yesterday, said: 'This will be given in place of the writing down allowance of 25 per cent currently available in the year the expenditure is incurred. The balance of expenditure will continue to be written down for tax purposes in subsequent years at 25 per cent per annum on a reducing balance basis. The proposed increase in first-year relief for machinery and plant will mean that over half the cost of equipment incurred between now and October 31, 1993 can be written off against tax within the first couple of years of its life. Similarly, about a quarter of the cost of new buildings qualifying for initial allowances can be written off over the same period. The cost of these new reliefs will be about Pounds 200m in 1993-94 and Pounds 500m in 1994-95. Subsequently, tax yields will be rather higher than they would otherwise be because reliefs on the balance of expenditure will be less. The legislation for these measures will be included in the 1993 Finance Bill. The intention is to publish draft clauses before the end of the year. The new 40 per cent first year allowance will be available for expenditure which is incurred on machinery and plant (excluding cars and certain other assets described in paragraph 8. below) between November 1, 1992 and October 31, 1993. At present, most expenditure on machinery and plant qualifies for writing down allowances at the rate of 25 per cent per annum on a reducing balance basis (that is to say, relief of 25 per cent of the full cost is given in the year that the equipment is bought; 25 per cent of the remaining balance is given in the second year; and so on for subsequent years). The rules for the new first year allowance will work like those which operated when similar allowances were generally available in the past. Relief will accordingly be given in place of the writing down allowance that is normally available in the year in which the expenditure is incurred, with the balance of expenditure written down in future years at the same rate as now. Qualifying expenditure will therefore be given relief at the rate of 40 per cent in the first year, to be followed by 25 per cent of the remaining balance in the second year, 25 per cent of the balance in the third year, and so on for subsequent years. Businesses will be able to disclaim all or any part of the first year allowance, should they wish to do so. For this purpose, the existing definition of 'incurred' in Section 159 Capital Allowances Act (CAA) 1990 will apply. This means that expenditure will generally be regarded as incurred on the date when the obligation to pay for the asset becomes unconditional. The main exception to this rule is where the period of credit allowed is longer than four months. In these cases, the date on which the bill for the asset is payable is regarded as the date on which the expenditure is incurred. In addition, the rule for pre-trading expenditure in section 83(2) CAA 1990 (which deems such expenditure to be incurred on the first day of trading) will not apply for the purpose of determining whether the expenditure falls within the year ending October 31, 1993. In other words, first year allowances will only be due where the expenditure concerned is actually incurred in that year. The new 40 per cent first year allowance will apply to all expenditure on machinery and plant currently qualifying for 25 per cent writing down allowances except: Cars, other than taxis, short term hire cars and mobility allowance vehicles for the disabled (as defined in Section 36 CAA 1990) Most assets which are acquired from a connected person; or are sold and leased back; or are acquired in a transaction the sole or main benefit of which is to obtain a first year allowance (ie. expenditure within the scope of Sections 75 and 76 CAA 1990). Where machinery or plant depreciates rapidly, taxpayers will be able to elect for short life treatment in the usual way. This means that a full deduction against profits can be taken for any unrelieved depreciation when the asset is sold or scrapped. The new 20 per cent initial allowance will be available for industrial and agricultural buildings which: Currently qualify for writing down allowances. Are constructed under a contract entered into between 1 November 1992 and 31 October 1993. And are brought into use for the purposes of a qualifying trade by December 31, 1994. Expenditure on structures within the definition of industrial and agricultural buildings is currently written off over a period of 25 years, normally at the rate of 4 per cent of the original cost each year, starting from the year in which the building is brought into use. The rules for the new relief will work like those which operated when similar allowances were generally available for qualifying buildings in the past. So, relief for 20 per cent of the cost of the building will be available in the tax year in which the expenditure is incurred, subject to the building being brought into use by December 31, 1994. Allowances which are given, based on an intention to bring the building into use by this date, will be withdrawn where this condition is not, in the event, met. The balance of relief will continue to be given at the rate of 4 per cent of the original cost of the building per annum from the tax year in which it is brought into use (ie the balance of expenditure, after taking the 20 per cent initial allowance, will be written off over the next 20 years). In cases where the expenditure is incurred in the same year in which the building is brought into use, both an initial allowance and a writing down allowance will be available, ie. the total allowance due in that year will be 24 per cent. Businesses will be able to disclaim all or any part of the initial allowance should they wish to do so. Expenditure will qualify for the new 20 per cent initial allowance if it is incurred under: A legally binding contract made in the year ended 31 October 1993. And the claimant was contractually committed to the expenditure by that contract. Expenditure which a person incurs by exercising an option in a contract is not expenditure incurred under that contract. It is expenditure incurred under a new contract made when the option is exercised. Such expenditure will qualify for the initial allowance where the new contract meets the conditions that are set out above. An industrial building or structure will qualify for initial allowances if it is brought into use for one of the trades qualifying for the purposes of writing down allowances, as set out in section 18(1) CAA 1990. The list includes: Factories and other premises used for manufacturing. Buildings or structures in use for the purposes of transport, dock, inland navigation, water, sewerage, electricity or hydraulic power undertakings. Tunnel, bridge or toll road undertakings. Certain storage trades. Mine, oil well or other mineral workings. Cultivating land (except where the separate agricultural buildings allowance is available). Catching fish or shellfish. Hotels which qualify for writing down allowances under the industrial buildings rules will also qualify for an initial allowance. The definition of a qualifying hotel is in section 19 CAA 1990. In summary, the hotel must be a permanent structure which meets all the following conditions: It must be open for at least four months in the season. When open it must have at least 10 bedrooms available for letting. The sleeping accommodation offered must consist wholly or mainly of bedrooms available for letting. Meals, bed making and room cleaning services must normally be provided. Initial allowances will also be available for expenditure on buildings currently qualifying for agricultural buildings allowances. This relieves expenditure incurred for the purposes of husbandry on the construction of farmhouses, farm buildings, cottages, fences and other works, such as ditches and drains (section 123 CAA 1990). The allowances are restricted for any private use by the farmer; for example, in the case of a farmhouse.' EXAMPLE 1 A company which makes up its accounts annually to December 31 makes a contract on October 1, 1993 to buy a computer for Pounds 15,000. The computer is to be delivered on October 15, 1993. Under the contract, the obligation to pay becomes unconditional on October 15, 1993 but actual payment does not have to be made until 30 days later, on November 15, 1993. In this case, the expenditure is incurred on October 15, 1993, ie. before the cut-off date of October 31. That means the company is entitled to a 40 per cent first-year allowance for its accounting period ending on December 31, 1993. The allowance (ie. 40 per cent of Pounds 15,000), to be deducted from the company's taxable profits, is Pounds 6,000. If the computer continues to be used during the following year, the company will be able to claim a 25 per cent writing down allowance against profits for its accounting period ending on December 31, 1994. The allowance will be Pounds 2,250, ie. 25 per cent of the unrelieved expenditure of Pounds 9,000. Suppose, however, that the computer is sold for Pounds 5,000 in the company's second year. In that case, if the company makes a short-life election, it can claim a deduction against profits for a balancing allowance equal to the unrelieved depreciation. The computer cost Pounds 15,000 and the first year allowance in Year 1 was Pounds 6,000; hence the balancing allowance in Year 2 will be Pounds 4,000 (which is the unrelieved expenditure of Pounds 9,000 less the sale proceeds of Pounds 5,000). EXAMPLE 2 A manufacturing company, which has a December 31 accounting date, enters into a binding contract to build a factory for its trade on July 1, 1993. The factory is completed in January 1994. The company moves in immediately and begins production in May 1994. The 20 per cent initial allowance will be due because: the contract was made between 1 November 1992 and October 31, 1993; the building began to be used before December 31, 1994. If, for instance, the obligation to pay for the factory became unconditional in January 1994, when the factory was completed, the result will be: a 20 per cent initial allowance will be due for the year ended December 31, 1994 (this is the year in which the expenditure was incurred under the rules in section 159 CAA 1990); a writing down allowance of 4 per cent of the cost will also be due for the year ended December 31, 1994 because the asset was in use by the end of that year. When a building is in use for the purposes of a trade is a question of fact in each case. Normally, the test will be met when the building is being used for the purpose for which it was built. A building is not in use for the purposes of the trade when it is being fitted out.</p>

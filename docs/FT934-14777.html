			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / W Europe car sales fall 10.7% WEST EUROPEAN new car sales fell by an estimated 10.7 per cent in September, to 845,000. Demand has dropped sharply for nine months in succession. New car sales in the first three quarters of the year declined by 15.7 per cent to 8.88m according to industry estimates. In the first nine months of the year 1.66m fewer new cars have been sold in west Europe than in the same period a year ago, as the motor industry suffers a steeper sales decline than during the recession following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s. New car sales both in September and in the first nine months were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK and marginally in Norway. The severity of the decline suffered in the first half of the year appears to have moderated slightly in the last two months, however. Among the large-volume markets, new car sales in Germany fell by an estimated 14 per cent in September compared with the decline of 19 per cent recorded in the first nine months. In Italy sales fell by 13.9 per cent in September compared with a 22.3 per cent drop in the first three-quarters of the year, while in Spain a fall of 16.3 per cent in September compared with a drop of 25.3 per cent in the first nine months. The pace of decline in France was little changed, with a drop of 16.2 per cent year-on-year in September and of 17.2 per cent in the first nine months. The UK remains the only significant market in west Europe, where new car sales are rising, with an increase year-on-year of close to 12 per cent both in September and in the first nine months. The steep fall in sales has forced nearly all carmakers in Europe to reduce their production and workforces sharply. Four of the big six volume carmakers - Volkswagen, Fiat, PSA Peugeot Citroen, and Ford of Europe - were in loss in the first half of the year, while profits have fallen heavily at Renault and at GM Europe. Among volume carmakers Volkswagen and Fiat have lost most ground this year with sales plunging over 21 per cent in the first nine months. General Motors - Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK - continued to outperform its rivals, raising its market share to 13 per cent from 12.3 per cent a year ago. Opel/Vauxhall is the best-selling car brand in Europe ahead of Ford and Volkswagen. Mercedes-Benz and Saab raised sales strongly in September, helped by the launch of new models. Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the only significant carmaker in Europe to have increased its sales volume this year.  -------------------------------------------------------------------       WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-SEPTEMBER 1993  -------------------------------------------------------------------                        Volume     Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                       (Units)  Change (%)   Jan-Sept 93  Jan-Sept 92  ------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET        8,883,000     -15.7        100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group    1,451,000     -21.7         16.3         17.3  -Volkswagen          960,000     -19.9         10.8         11.4  -Audi                245,000     -26.1          2.8          3.1  -Seat                206,000     -20.8          2.3          2.5  -Skoda*               40,000      +6.2          0.5          0.4 General Motors****  1,153,000     -10.9         13.0         12.3  -Opel/Vauxhall     1,110,000     -10.3         12.5         11.7  -Saab**               30,000     -24.8          0.4          0.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen 1,074,000     -15.1         12.1         12.0  -Peugeot             654,000     -14.7          7.4          7.3  -Citroen             420,000     -15.8          4.7          4.7 Renault-Volvo*****  1,062,000     -15.2         12.0         11.9  -Renault             932,000     -14.7         10.5         10.4  -Volvo               130,000     -18.0          1.5          1.5 Ford****            1,046,000     -14.4         11.8         11.6  -Ford Europe       1,037,000     -14.5         11.7         11.5  -Jaguar                9,000      +0.1          0.1          0.1 Fiat group******      988,000     -21.5         11.1         11.9  -Fiat                740,000     -20.7          8.3          8.9  -Lancia              140,000     -23.2          1.6          1.7  -Alfa Romeo           98,000     -25.2          1.1          1.2 Nissan                314,000      -7.6          3.5          3.2 BMW                   287,000     -17.4          3.2          3.3 Rover***              279,000     +12.8          3.1          2.3 Mercedes-Benz         258,000     -19.7          2.9          3.0 Toyota                252,000      -3.2          2.8          2.5 Mazda                 155,000     -28.1          1.7          2.0 Honda***              127,000     -10.3          1.4          1.3 Mitsubishi            113,000     -11.9          1.3          1.2 Total Japanese      1,103,000     -11.8         12.4         11.9 MARKETS: Germany             2,467,000     -19.1         27.8         28.9 Italy               1,457,000     -22.3         16.4         17.8 United Kingdom      1,451,000     +11.8         16.3         12.3 France              1,254,000     -17.2         14.1         14.4 Spain                 564,000     -25.3          6.4          7.2  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ****Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. *****Renault and Volvo to merge in January 1994.

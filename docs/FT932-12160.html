			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: SKF sinks deeper into the red in first quarter SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, sank deeper into the red in the first quarter due to weak demand from the European car industry and further heavy losses from Ovako Steel. The group's deficit after financial items rose to SKr355m (Dollars 48m) from SKr34m, with sales rising marginally to SKr7.20bn from SKr7.16bn. However, stripping out the effects of disposals and currency movements, sales were 9 per cent lower. The group said its problems centred on the European market, which accounted for 60 per cent of sales. The car market had been particularly difficult, with a number of manufacturers reducing production or closing their facilities. It noted that demand remained low in its two other main customer segments, machinery industry and after-market. A brighter picture emerged from North America and the Asia-Pacific region as sales rose in all three customer areas in both markets. The group noted it was continuing to cut staff, with 1,150 people losing their jobs during the quarter. It was scaling back inventories with production running at 5 per cent below sales levels. Sales of rolling bearings and seals rose to SKr6.68bn from SKr5.95bn, but the sector produced a loss of SKr250m, after a profit of SKr90m last year. The group's other main operation, Ovako Steel, posted a SKr109m loss, virtually unchanged on last year's SKr110m deficit, although sales slumped in the face of weak demand to SKr724m from SKr954m. Net financial expense rose sharply to SKr274m from SKr16m after being aggravated by a SKr105m exchange loss on the parent company's convertible ECU bonds. The group is not giving a forecast for 1993, although it has indicated that it expects to make another loss, following last year's SKr1.8bn deficit.</p>

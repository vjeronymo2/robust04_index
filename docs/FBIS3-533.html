			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Housing Minister Louis Shill says he will go ahead  with his 90,000 million rand housing subsidy scheme despite the  Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] order for him not to do  so. The TEC ordered Mr. Shill to stop the scheme yesterday,  accusing the government of abusing its position for electoral  gain. However, Mr. Shill said the sole objective of his  department was to enable people to obtain adequate housing. Mr.  Shill is not required to comply with the order as it has no  force or effect on the government.    Mr. Shill said the principles and details of the scheme had  been negotiated with a wide variety of organizations over a  protracted period. The scheme has being implemented within the  current budget, and no new money had been allocated.</p>

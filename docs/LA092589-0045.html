			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> FINGERPRINT TECHNOLOGY GAINS  </P> <P> A biologist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory has adapted conventional  biological techniques for staining cells to produce an extremely sensitive new  technique for recovering fingerprints at crime scenes. The new technique works  on a number of materials from which fingerprints could not previously be  recovered, such as the sticky side of adhesive tape, which is widely used in  wrapping dope, counterfeit money, and bombs.  </P> <P> "I think it is one of the top five developments in the fingerprint field," said  Deputy Agent John Piper of the U.S. Secret Service, a fingerprint specialist.  Both the Secret Service and the FBI have begun using the method, which was  developed by George Sanders.  </P> <P> The technique uses extremely small particles of gold, which adhere to proteins  left on surfaces as part of the fingerprint. The gold-labeled fingerprint is  then bathed in a silver solution to enhance the image. Among the materials on  which the technique has worked are computer disks, credit cards, bullet  cartridges, wet and dry paper, glass and Styrofoam.  </P></p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / International Press Review: Buthelezi finds himself cast as a demon - South Africa Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, is a public relations disaster, but that is only half the reason that he has featured - this week like every week - as a demon in most South African media. Most of the South African media - like the majority of the country's citizens - are frantic to put apartheid behind them once and for all. Elections must take place on April 26-28 as planned, and be declared free and fair, whatever the evidence to the contrary. That is what the country wants and that, in mirror image, is what the media wants. So it takes no great foresight to predict the line which most leader writers will take in the aftermath of elections: there were isolated problems (like Natal, where one quarter of the population lives); but overall, polling was free and fair. In short, a triumph for democracy, they will say, and one which only a demonic tyrant (the likes of Chief Buthelezi) could wish to resist. The crudest demonisation of the Chief comes, not surprisingly, from this week's Sunday Nation, virtually the mouthpiece of the African National Congress. Under the headline 'Nothing will satisfy Gatsha Buthelezi', the paper's leader writer comments on Friday's failed peace summit between the country's four top political leaders, President F W de Klerk, ANC president Nelson Mandela, Chief Buthelezi and his nephew, the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The Sunday Nation asserts categorically: 'there is absolutely nothing that the ANC and the government could possibly do to satisfy Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi', going on to conclude that 'summits with Buthelezi are nothing but a blatant waste of taxpayers' money', and that 'the only reasonable thing to do is to ignore Buthelezi and move ahead with the transition process'. No other newspaper is so blunt in its condemnation. But the message is the same from most others nonetheless: Chief Buthelezi wrecked the summit, for reasons which are incomprehensible to most leader writers. They implicitly accept the ANC's view of the summit: that the Zulu King was offered everything he could ever have wanted by the ANC - the Sunday Times, the most widely read South African newspaper, says he could have become 'a constitutional monarch in KwaZulu Natal with all his rights, privileges and status entrenched' - but this magnanimous offer was inexplicably rejected by Chief Buthelezi, on the king's behalf. Few point out that the offer would have guaranteed the king only ceremonial powers, and that the monarchy's communal lands - the crux of the dispute - would have become assets of the state. It is simply not fashionable to take the king's or Chief Buthelezi's complaints seriously. However, the Johannesburg daily Business Day regularly gives Inkatha's concerns a fair hearing, and some Durban newspapers - including this week's Sunday Tribune, which bemoans 'a failure in statesmanship all round' - also adopt a more balanced approach. But there remains a marked tendency among leader writers and radio commentators - especially the popular Johannesburg station Radio 702's Election Watch commentary - to believe that the ANC has bent over backwards to satisfy Chief Buthelezi (an impression cleverly and vigorously promoted by ANC officials), and that he has spat upon their magnanimity. There was scant local condemnation of the fact that ANC president Nelson Mandela refused to allow police (bearing a legal search warrant) to enter ANC headquarters to investigate the murder of Zulu marchers who were shot by ANC security guards in the recent 'Battle of Johannesburg'. Most media condemned Chief Buthelezi for that battle, despite the fact it was mostly pro-Inkatha marchers who died, and that all evidence suggests they did not fire first. But if most media agree that Chief Buthelezi is wrong - largely his own fault for failing to convey his position more effectively - at least there seems to be a growing consensus that he cannot (pace the Sunday Nation) be ignored. Even the liberal Johannesburg Weekly Mail, the flagship of the alternative press which bravely fought apartheid, argues for a constitutional solution to the problem of Chief Buthelezi. True, the paper wants a mailed fist used against violence in Natal (through measures which the paper opposed when used against the anti-apartheid movement); but it recognises that this will not be enough. Politics, not might, must provide the ultimate solution.</p>

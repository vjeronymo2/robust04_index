			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISASTER RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES  </P> <P> I can keep this short and to the point: How many military helicopters sat as  the recent fires consumed Southern California? I suggest some tax dollars be  devoted to water-carrying equipment for these hundreds, maybe thousands of idle  military "sorry-we-weren't-trained-for-that" helicopters.  </P> <P> We should be able to send a fleet of water-dumping helicopters to any hot spot,  especially those close to the coast.  </P> <P> We live by the ocean; fire is a real problem; fresh water is in short supply,  and salt water can put out fires. We need to plan and prepare for fires.  </P> <P> STEVE and TERI WILSON  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Aslef to hold strike ballot THE EXECUTIVE of the Aslef train drivers' union voted unanimously last night to ballot members on industrial action over the planned privatisation of British Rail. 'I can tell you now we will get a yes vote,' said Mr Derrick Fullick, general secretary. The ballot will close on April 7, five days after the first of a series of one-day strikes planned by the larger RMT rail union. Mr Fullick predicted that Aslef would organise its own series of one-day strikes. He said his members feared job cuts and changes in promotion prospects after privatisation. 'We cannot get any straight answers from the BR board,' he added. 'They have pushed us into this. It was a situation that we have tried to avoid.' BR yesterday asked for talks with RMT leaders in an effort to head off that union's first strike.</p>

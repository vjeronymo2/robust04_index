			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini by </F> Monica Setta in Rome; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LA VOCE] Minister, there is  something that is not very clear about the so-called war over  the responsibility for privatization. Should this not have been  yours?    [Pagliarini] We discussed this during the negotiation stage  of the formation of the government. However, I do not think  that there are still problems. The responsibility should go to  [Industry Minister] Gnutti. He will have to manage the layoffs  with my agreement and with that of the treasury minister [Dini].    [LA VOCE] But was there not a Northern League move to give  Lamberto Dini the authority?    [Pagliarini] We have gotten to know each other better, and I  am sure that there will be an agreement with Dini. We will not  have great difficulty. Those who are speculating about presumed  quarrels within the three-man team are making a big mistake. I  have the impression that the government will not delude  expectations, particularly on privatization.    [LA VOCE] Then let us get down to details. Let us start with  the mother of all privatization: STET [Turin Telephone Finance  Company]. Is it true that you want this to be a public company?    [Pagliarini] Certainly, we are even in favor of a super  public company. However, STET must also manage to find strong  industrial alliances. In the coming years there will only be  five giants in the world telecommunications market. STET must  have its cards in order to be one of these.    [LA VOCE] So an alliance with [French] Alcatel-Alsthom will  be all right?    [Pagliarini] Let us put it this way: I think that perhaps it  would be possible to find a partner that would offer STET better  guarantees of success by looking in Asia, or in the United  States. No, Alcatel is not the best. However, STET is open to  offers.    [LA VOCE] Excuse me if I am insistent. Will the Berlusconi  government diligently take [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's last  note on STET's privatization into consideration?    [Pagliarini] I repeat that we are in favor of a public  company. However, we will discuss everything again.  Berlusconi's privatizations will not see any clashes between  small shareholders and the Mediobanca-type shareholding.  Decisions will be made wisely, case by case.    [LA VOCE] Let us pass on to ENEL [National Electric Power  Company]. What are the government's ideas?    [Pagliarini] The hypothesis of the golden share over 10  years  is good for ENEL. We still have to discuss the AGIP [Italian  National Oil Company] issue in greater depth. We have to take  measures that favor plurality, and avoid one thing in particular  at all costs.    [LA VOCE] What?    [Pagliarini] We must avoid making harming the small saver.  It  is a risk that could be run with the privatization of STET, and  that risk must be eliminated completely. Finally, privatization  must be used to trigger off a real industrial policy.</p>

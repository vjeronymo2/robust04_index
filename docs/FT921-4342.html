			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Colombia setback Colombia's governing Liberal party won an overall majority in Sunday's local elections, taking control of the capital, but losing several regional capitals to opposition forces, Sarita Kendall reports from Bogota. A priest running for the former guerrilla alliance, M-19, becomes mayor of Barranquilla, but otherwise M-19 ran third behind the Social Conservative party. The anti-corruption platform of two former Liberal ministers gave them a strong placing on Bogota city council. Mr Enrique Parejo, an ex-justice minister, won the biggest vote, and can now aim for the presidency.</p>

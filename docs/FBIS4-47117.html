			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "PG": "Tetra Pak Into Svetogorsk"] </F>   [Text] The Swedish firm Tetra Pak has acquired a minority  share in the Russian pulp and paper kombinat [group  of enterprises] in Svetogorsk, which is currently in the process  of being privatized. The firm has also signed an agreement with  Kymmene Oy [of Finland] to help improve production there. This  cooperation pact also involves marketing of products other than  packaging cardboard.    The privatization process is already half completed, but the  company has aimed at a 20-percent ownership share, a spokesman  from Tetra Pak stated on Tuesday [7 June]. With this, the firm  would assure cardboard supplies for its plants making packaging  materials in Kuban in Russia and Kiev in Ukraine.    The pulp and paper kombinat in Svetogorsk is one of Russia'  largest and most modern forestry industry units. The kombinat in  its origin was a Finnish construction project carried out by  Finn-Stroi during the middle of the 1980's.    Production capacity is around 420,000 tons of pulp and  220,000 tons of paper annually. The packaging plant's yearly  capacity is currently 60,000 tons, and could -- with slight  additional investment -- be raised to 100,000 tons. Operations  in Svetogorsk recently have been at a low level because of raw  material shortages.    One of the cable papermaking machines in Svetogorsk has been  converted so that it can now produce cardboard for liquids  packaging. Investments of almost 60 million [Finnish] markkas  have been financed by Tetra Pak. These new investments are a  direct consequence of Tetra Pak's concentration on the Russian  market. Over the past few years the firm has invested close to  700 million markkas in Russia. The firm has four separate  production facilities for processing machines, filling machines,  and packaging materials for foods in liquid form. The company  employs almost 1,500 persons.</p>

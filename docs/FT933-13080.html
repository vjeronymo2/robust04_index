			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Strong case for UN reform Sir, Leslie Crawford, in her article, 'Rising death toll stokes Somali hatred against UN' (July 14), gives a lucid and impartial account of the tragic events in Mogadishu and of the causes of them. What should possibly be added as a comment is the urgent need to reform the structure of the United Nations - in the light of the radical changes that have occurred on the world political scene - giving more powers to the general assembly. Should this not take place, the organisation will remain, as it undoubtedly is today, nothing more than a screen behind which the US hides the most controversial aspects of its foreign policy. This will lead many emerging countries of the world to share a feeling of suspicion and mistrust towards what will increasingly be regarded as a hypocritical international tool. Luca Corabi, Via Maddalena 9, 20122 Milan, Italy</p>

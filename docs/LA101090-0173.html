			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ACTOR BRAD DOURIF CRAZY ABOUT HIS JOB  </P> <P> Brad Dourif has played so many crazies he's sometimes tempted to doubt his own  sanity.  </P> <P> Dourif's tenure as a nut case dates to the beginning of his movie career 15  years ago in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," where he played the role of  Billy Bibbit.  </P> <P> Since winning an Oscar nomination for that portrayal, the slender, red-haired  actor has appeared in 20 movies, playing a succession of maniacs, weirdos and  mental cases.  </P> <P> Still, Dourif is not dour about his plight. Like most actors, he is convinced  that lunatics are more fun to play than what passes for normal types.  </P> <P> Most recently, Dourif was seen as the Gemini Killer, possessed by the devil in  a priest's body, in "The Exorcist III."  </P> <P> How deranged can you get?  </P> <P> "That's about as far as you can go," a grinning Dourif acknowledged during a  recent lunch. "But I can't say I think any of this is type-casting. That would  drive me crazy."  </P> <P> Dourif's other roles included a murderous racist cop in "Mississippi Burning"  and the homicidal doll in "Child's Play."  </P> <P> Making a career of wackos has its rewards. In "The Exorcist III," Dourif spoke  one of the longest, uninterrupted monologues in recent memory.  </P> <P> Locked in a prison cell with George C. Scott for the scene, Dourif reeled off  20 pages of script during the single speech.  </P> <P> "I memorized it in about three weeks," he recalled. "I'd read it through over  and over for two hours every day.  </P> <P> Dourif took time out from his film career to teach acting at New York's  Columbia University for a couple of years. But the lure of greasepaint and  Hollywood greenbacks brought him back to movies.  </P> <P> "Right now I'm pretty popular with young people," he said, laughing. "They love  horror films and, believe me, I play some pretty horrible characters."  </P></p>

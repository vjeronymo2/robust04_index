			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Japan's coalition breaks up after SDP walk-out Japan's governing coalition fell apart last night, only hours after it had elected Mr Tsutomu Hata as prime minister. The Social Democratic party walked out of the coalition, depriving it of a parliamentary majority. The socialists were angered by their coalition partners' decision to form a new conservative grouping, led by Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party, that would be the dominant voting bloc in parliament. 'There is no room for further talk. We are pulling out of all forums of the ruling coalition,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the chairman of the SDP, whose party's assistance in supporting Mr Hata had been decisive. The SDP plans nevertheless to co-operate in getting parliamentary adoption of the current year's budget, already several months overdue, and in passing measures to stimulate Japan's economy - on the brink of a fragile recovery from its longest downturn since the second world war. Early today Mr Hata said he would work to bring the SDP back to the fold. The latest row threatens to prolong the government paralysis which began with the power struggle provoked by former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to resign over a financial scandal, just over two weeks ago. 'This is indeed very regrettable for Japan,' said Mr Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The new conservative group, including four members of the seven-party coalition plus two recently-formed parliamentary parties, has promises of allegiance from 130 members of the lower house of parliament, far more than the socialists' 74 seats, according to Japanese news reports. 'There is a minimum politeness in things based on mutual trust,' said Mr Wataru Kubo, the SDP's secretary-general, who had been tipped for a seat in Mr Hata's cabinet. 'Didn't we work together to form the new government? Why should they do this on the day it was to be formed?' The new group, called Kaishin, or innovation, resembles the grand union of political parties called for by Mr Hata at the weekend in an attempt to defeat the opposition Liberal Democratic party and to avoid the policy rows which finally crippled the previous government.

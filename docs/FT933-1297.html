			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Norman Hay losses increase to Pounds 677,000 Reflecting the continuing impact of moving the Heathrow operations to Coventry and of recession, which reduced volumes and margins, Norman Hay, the engineering group, suffered higher pre-tax losses of Pounds 677,000 for the first half of 1993, against Pounds 393,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 3.9m for the six months to June 30 while operating losses came to Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 454,000). The pre-tax figure was after interest payable of Pounds 152,000 against receivable of Pounds 61,000. Losses per share amounted to 4.5p (1.8p) and again there is no interim dividend - last year the final was omitted also. The directors stated that the decision to cease unprofitable processes - Hay is involved in processing, coating and finishing metals and plastics - would have a severe impact on results for 1993, but future benefits were to stabilise group trading position.</p>

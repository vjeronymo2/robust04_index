			<p>BFN     [Text] Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas  right-wing opposition, has warned that no concessions should be  made to Russia because this would mean that Russia's method of  arm-twisting has been recognized, and new pressures would follow.    This is how Vytautas Landsbergis commented on the news that  Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted in his letter to  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas that Russia linked the  implementation of economic agreements signed last autumn with  transit from the Karaliaucius [Kaliningrad] region.    Having received this letter, President Algirdas Brazauskas  told journalists that Lithuania cannot agree to Russia's policy  in this respect. According to him, the agreement signed in  Vilnius last November was the result of one stage of  negotiations, however, negotiations concerning the transit from  the Kaliningrad region and the visa regime is a matter of  further negotiations.    Vytautas Landsbergis said that he believes that President  Algirdas Brazauskas is not inclined to give in, however,  contracts and prices for transit fixed by lower-ranking  officials remain in the realm of unanswered questions. If the  income for the state budget is rejected by one's own will, then  this looks like corruption, Vytautas Landsbergis said [sentence  as heard]. This was a Baltic News Service report.</p>

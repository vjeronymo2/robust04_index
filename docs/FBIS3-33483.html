			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Juan Schiaretti, Santiago del Estero's federal  trustee, said that "social peace has been reestablished" in the  province. Schiaretti said that the protest march carried out by  state workers and teachers on 16 February "does not represent  the majority of the Santiago people's feelings."    The acting head of Santiago's Executive Branch said his  administration "has paid all public administration workers' back  salaries," adding that "the financial situation is being  balanced."    Schiaretti denied the existence of any "social unrest" in  the  province, adding that the fact that on 16 February there were  "1,000 people on the streets does not mean they represent the  entire community's feelings, particularly considering that  40,000 people demonstrated during the original outburst. [no  closing quotation mark as published]    The trustee made these remarks at government house following  a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf to analyze the  province's political situation.    Asked about the incidents the day before between police and  workers who were peacefully occupying a textile plant and which  ended with eight people wounded, Schiaretti said he regretted  what happened, stressing that the "police action followed a  court eviction order."    Regarding the beginning of the school year Schiaretti said  "classes will begin in March as scheduled."    Meanwhile, the provincial front of struggling unions called  for a mobilization on 26 February to reject the salary policy  implemented by the trustee, while secondary and university  teachers announced that they will not go to work until their  demands are answered.    The front insisted that it will present 20,000 signatures  requesting the repeal of the comprehensive adjustment law [ley  omnibus de ajuste] while the CGT [General Confederation of  Labor] regional unit offered their "unrestricted support to the  struggle of local trade unions."    The 26 February march will be the second organized by  workers  against measures adopted by the trustee. The first one was  carried out on 16 February.</p>

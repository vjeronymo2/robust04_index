			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY AREN'T THE ARABS MORE LIKE US?;  </P> <P> THE CLOSED CIRCLE AN INTERPRETATION OF THE ARABS BY DAVID PRYCE-JONES (AN  EDWARD BURLINGAME BOOK / HARPER &amp; ROW: $25; 464 PP.)  </P> <P> Richard Burton (the adventurer and orientalist, not the actor) once pithily  defined the nature of government in the Middle East as "despotism tempered by  assassination." To judge from David Pryce-Jones' absorbing new study of Arab  society and politics, things have not changed much -- unless for the worse --  since Burton's day.  </P> <P> Pryce-Jones first came into contact with the Arab world as a child in 1941,  when he was evacuated from Vichy France to Morocco in the care of an uncle, a  Spanish diplomat. His next encounter was 15 years later, as a young officer in  the British army at the time of the Suez expedition. It was not until 1967,  however, when he covered the Arab-Israeli war as a correspondent, that he began  to reflect upon the irrationalities and contradictions of Arab behavior which,  among other things, had subjected them to ignominious defeat in that war. At  intervals over the next 20 years, by means of wide reading and extensive travel  in Arab lands, he made a valiant effort to penetrate the labyrinth of the Arab  psyche, to discover, if he could, the subterranean springs of those  self-destructive urges exhibited by so many Arabs so much of the time, to the  bafflement and dismay of Western onlookers. Along the way, he published a most  perceptive study of the Palestine Liberation Organization, "The Face of  Defeat," which was noteworthy for its exposure of the way in which the rank and  file who carry out the organization's dirty work are cynically manipulated by  their leaders, secure in far-off, comfortable havens.  </P> <P> The fundamental question to which Pryce-Jones addresses himself in "The Closed  Circle" is why it is that constitutional government, as understood in the West,  has never evolved in the Arab world. Why is it that representative and  parliamentary institutions, protection under the law, individual rights and  guarantees, have failed to take root in Arab soil even though their seeds were  planted and replanted in several Arab countries by Britain and France after  both World Wars I and II? Instead, the Arabs of late years have resorted more  and more to their basic social and religious institutions, the tribe and Islam,  to provide the structure of government. Any progress toward political maturity  has been stultified by their inability to comprehend any loyalty other than  that to family, tribe or religious sect. Loyalty to the state, to the nation or  to the constitution is a concept devoid of meaning for them. In its place there  is only the tradition of obedience to the ruler; in other words, Oriental  despotism.  </P> <P> The state and its treasury are only there to be seized and plundered for the  enrichment of family, tribe or faction. (Consider, for example, the regimes  currently in power in Libya, Syria and Iraq.) Inevitably, of course, the wealth  and power of a ruler or ruling clique excite the envy of other ambitious  spirits, provoking them to challenge the existing regime. Because no  sophisticated political machinery exists for the expression of that challenge,  it will, like tribal or family feuds, be resolved by violence. Arab custom and  tradition offer no alternatives. And the successful challenger, with equal  inevitability, will resort to the repressive methods of his predecessor to  retain his new-found power. So the cycle of violence becomes perpetual.  </P> <P> Is there any hope that the Arabs will ever break out of the closed circle of  repression and violence into which they have locked themselves? Pryce-Jones  doubts it, if only because they are bedeviled by their obsession with "face,"  or what he describes as "the shame/honor concept." The trouble about the  question of face is that it is, to a very great extent, only skin-deep, i.e. it  depends upon shallow and superficial considerations. Honor is not just a matter  of manliness, family, tribal code, religious faith, etc. but also of  ostentation, magniloquence and bravado. Shame, for its part, resides not only  in the betrayal of duty or code or family but also in occupying a lowly station  in society, in being poor, or being employed in a menial occupation. In  contrast to the prevailing attitude in Western society, shame for an Arab does  not derive so much from the commission of misdeeds (what is a misdeed to a  European or an American is not necessarily one to an Arab) as from being bested  by another. Thus there is no shame in engaging in what Westerners would regard  as lying or cheating, especially in commercial transactions; for the exclusive  aim is to come out on top, regardless of the methods used. It is an attitude  that has caused much misunderstanding and ill-feeling between Arabs and  Westerners.  </P> <P> The operation of the principle may again be seen in the use of family  connections to attain wealth or high office. Whereas in the West a man who  gained high office solely by virtue of his family connections would attract a  certain degree of contempt, in Arab eyes, a man who did not use his family's  position to enrich himself or advance himself to high office would be an object  of scorn and shame.  </P> <P> Hand in hand with the question of face goes the abuse of public office for  personal gain, or, as Pryce-Jones has it, "the money-favor nexus." Baksheesh  (bribery or handouts) is so integral a component of Arab life that its  deleterious consequences are rarely questioned. To further oneself, or even to  survive, in the immense pyramid of Arab society it is necessary to placate  those above with money, deference, humility. Conversely, those above consider  themselves entitled to demand of those below abject subservience, sweetened by  appropriate offerings of baksheesh. It is a system that degrades all.  </P> <P> Much of the psychological burden carried by the Arabs originates in their  confused attitude, compounded equally of envy and resentment, toward the  Western world. Modern Arabic literature, he points out, is permeated by both  self-hatred and hatred of the West and all its works. But much of the  nihilistic vaporing of Arab intellectuals, as he also makes clear, is copycat  stuff, picked up during a sojourn in Europe or America.  </P> <P> The Arab peoples deserve something better than this from their soi-disant  intelligentsia. They also deserve, as Pryce-Jones observes toward the end of  his brave, honest and thoughtful book, a better system of government than they  have had to date, or at least a better class of ruler.  </P> <P> The omens, one regrets to say, are not propitious.  </P></p>

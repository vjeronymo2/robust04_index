			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Catalans come to Gonzalez' aid Pressure on Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, eased yesterday as Catalan nationalists in the Madrid parliament promised they would continue supporting the Socialists despite their poor performance in the European elections last week. The assurance was given by Mr Jordi Pujol, the head of Catalonia's autonomous government and leader of Convergencia i Unio (CiU), in talks at the prime minister's residence in Madrid on Thursday. The support of the 17 CiU MP's is sufficent to allow Mr Gonzalez's 141-strong Socialist group in the 350-member parliament to continue governing but Mr Pujol stressed that the backing was conditional on the government's ability to maintain both its present pro-market policies and its commitment to transfer increased responsibilities to the regional governments.</p>

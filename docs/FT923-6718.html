			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Enter the dragon into corporate sport: Team spirit and brand awareness mix well on the water SCREAMED commands and the dull thump of a drum disturbed the evening calm as a low craft skimmed across Hartlepool Marina in Cleveland, looking like a giant centipede doing the front-crawl. Twenty paddles moved in unison behind Mr Dave Price at stroke. His teeth were set in a snarl as muscular forearms shovelled water into the boat's wake. Enter Nuclear Electric's dragon boat, which is in the vanguard of one of Britain's fastest-growing corporate sports. In the five years since dragon boat racing was imported from Hong Kong, 60 clubs have been established across the UK. Last year about 380 teams took part in competitions. All teams competing in events organised by the British Dragon Boat Association must have corporate sponsorship. The reward for the companies is the opportunity to encourage team spirit while spreading brand awareness. The sport's popularity has been confirmed by its inclusion in the annual World Corporate Games, an international sporting event for company teams and individuals that is being held in London for the first time next month. Dragon boat racing originated in China, where an annual festival is held to commemorate the death of a 4th century BC poet, Qu Yuan, who threw himself into the Mi Low river after he was expelled from the royal court. Fishermen are said to have raced their boats out in an unsuccessful attempt to save him. The sport is so named because of the ornamental dragons' heads at the prows of the boats. Adopted as a competitive sport in Hong Kong during the mid-1970s, it spread swiftly throughout the Pacific rim and is believed to be the biggest corporate sport in Australia. The two-day world championships in Hong Kong are televised live. 'Over there it's akin to the FA Cup in England,' says Mr Price, who works in the Hartlepool power station's planning department. Chinese and Hong Kong boats are made of mahogany, but Mr Chris Hare, a boat builder based in Hartlepool, made glass-fibre moulds of the boats which he now constructs commercially. Nuclear Electric adopted dragon boat racing three years ago when the company was still a part of National Power before the privatisation of the electricity industry. A scratch team using a borrowed boat entered a race at Hartlepool Marina and came third. 'We found we were good at it so went to the management and asked if they would foot the Pounds 5,000 bill for a boat of our own,' says Mr Price. Mr Bill Shirra, administration manager at the power station, says: 'At the time National Power was looking for ways, like any new company, to get its name across to the public and the opportunity to have the company name and logo on the side of the boat at events around the country seemed appealing.' A year later the newly formed Nuclear Electric took over the sponsorship. The state-owned electricity generator has specific requirements on sponsorship decisions. To attain commercial viability it sees its main task as gaining public acceptance of nuclear power. 'We're convinced we have the power source for the future,' says Mr Shirra. 'But we have to get this message across to the public.' The dragon boat team is viewed as a cost-effective way of promoting the company. 'We see them as ambassadors to the public for nuclear power,' says Mr Shirra. The creation of the team had also had an internal spin-off, he says, in fostering team spirit among the workforce. Mr John Collier, chairman and chief executive, says sponsorship is a way of putting something back into communities that serve the industry. 'In addition, it is an opportunity to be involved with events which suit our company profile and values,' he adds. Nuclear Electric, he says, is attracted to events that concentrate on teamwork. The Hartlepool team came third in the national championships last year and has competed in Belgium, Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr Price says: 'It is something that you can do at all levels. We have raced against the best teams in the world, such as the Indonesian national team - the world champions - and we've raced against the Brownies and Cubs.' The Hartlepool team will be among nearly 8,000 competitors contesting 22 events in the World Corporate Games running from September 26 to October 4 at venues in and around London. The closing date for entries is August 29. The games organisers can be contacted on 071 351 1992. Further details about dragon boat racing from the British Dragon Boat Association, 071 930 2296.</p>

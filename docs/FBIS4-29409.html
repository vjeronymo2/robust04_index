			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- Although international  concern over the possibility of an all-out war on the Korean  peninsula is deepening, defense officials here in general  believe that North Korea is unlikely to provoke an armed  conflict.    The officials say their judgment is based on the North's  current military power, the combined defense capability of South  Korean and U.S. military forces, and the political stands of  major powers around the peninsula including the United States,  China and Russia.    Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this week, inviting possible  sanctions by the United Nations and heightening tension on the  peninsula.    The United Nations Security Council is discussing adoption  of  a draft sanctions resolution, while North Korea has warned that  any sanctions would amount to a "declaration of war."    As further grounds for their assessment, the defense  officials are citing vulnerable points that undercut the North's  quantitative military superiority over the South.    The performance of North Korea's weapons systems, ministry  officials explained, is not very good and the "military exercise  period" of its Air Force and Navy is only one-third that of the  South. Moreover, the ability of the North's quartermaster  supply including war material and ammunition is low, the  officials said.    In particular, shortages of oil and food would hamper North  Korea from continuing an all-out war over a certain perriod of  time. The rates of self-supply for oil and food are just 40  percent and 60 percent, respectively, according to the ministry.    On the combined defense capability of South Korean and U.S.  Forces, the ministry said that even if North Korea provoked a  war, the South Korea-U.S. combined military power could repel an  attack in the early stages.    Hundreds of thousands of ground forces, several carrier  battle groups, hundreds of warships and thousands of fighter  planes would be added to the current combined forces to produce  an overwhelming victory against North Korea in a very short  period.    With its war capacity, the Defense Ministry expects that  North Korea would not dare to provoke an armed conflict unless  Kim Il-song gave in to despair and decided to commit virtual  suicide, the officials said.    Finally, although Russia and China have not expressed  support  for a UN sanctions resolution, they do not want North Korea to  develop nuclear weapons, either. That point is an important  factor mitigating against war on the Korean peninsula, they  emphasized.    These countries are not actively supporting UN sanctions  against North Korea in a bid to increase their influence, but it  is unlikely they would back the reclusive nation militarily if  it provoked a war.    "North Korea could never provoke a war under the  circumstances," a senior official said.    "The United States can easily concentrate its military power  on the Korean peninsula since it is not intervening militarily  anywhere in the world at the moment."    But the officials are not ruling out the possibility that  North Korea may provoke a local skirmish near the truce line.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (2): Focus switches to integration - New products on the market reflect changes in fashion and demand THE SUPPLY of advanced design and manufacturing systems is not quite a fashion industry. But there are distinct trends in the relative importance attached to particular business issues and their relevant technological 'solutions'. This reflects the mix of real demand from manufacturing industry, advances in enabling technologies and a dash of marketing 'push' from vendor companies. Just a few years ago the areas of emphasis included: linking CAD and CAM so that the shopfloor made exactly what the design department wanted; networking machine tools through the emerging MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) communications standard; establishing effective standardised means of transferring CAD data between software programs from different vendors; porting formerly mainframe-based software systems onto networks of 'desktop' workstations and even PCs; slashing the price/performance ratios of hardware platforms. None of these issues has ceased to be relevant, but their provision is increasingly taken for granted as other topics become the focus for 'leading edge' products. Now the most urgent requirements are seen to include: the complete integration of design and manufacturing data with business functions so that the ordering, manufacturing and despatch of products are all part of a seamless process controlled by a single database; ensuring that such integration is based on accepted OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) standards rather than proprietary links, enabling users to mix and match software systems according to requirements; providing software systems that can support new forms of organisation and procedures, such as cellular and Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing. Products that attempt to achieve company-wide integration of business and technical information are known generically as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, or sometimes as Customer Oriented Manufacturing Management Systems (COMMS). They exploit a range of up-to-date computer technologies such as graphical user interfaces, fourth generation languages (4GLs), relational databases and client/server hardware configurations. They aim to allow access to commercial and technical data generated by multi-site, multinational, functionally-diverse manufacturing operations and to facilitate effective control of key issues such as supply chain management. Such products have started to come onto the market only within the last year or so, but are represented at CIM '93. One example is the JIT Enterprise software package already used by some 50 companies in the US and now being introduced to the European market by Fourth Shift UK. The product incorporates the Oracle relational database and has over 50 integrated application modules. The software is explicitly described as an ERP product and is intended to support 'lean,' JIT-type manufacturing procedures. Another ERP product is the Control Manufacturing system from Cincom, first launched in March this year. The company is bringing to CIM '93 a new version of the product, Control Manufacturing 7.3, which it describes as a significant step towards its aim of 'full Open Systems implementation in 1994'. One of the capabilities ERP offers is multi-language input and Cincom says options already available are English, French, German, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, kanji and Portuguese. With an eye to the emerging eastern European market Czech is under development. The Manman/X system from ASK Computer Systems is a similar product that now boasts over 130 user sites worldwide since its launch just over a year ago. A new version, Release 2.1, to be introduced at the show, demonstrates ERP's ability to cope with local demands through an option that can cope with Canadian tax laws. Ultimately, ERP is expected to sound the death-knell of the well-established MRPII (Manufacturing Resource Planning) systems currently used to integrate business and technical data. But MRPII is likely to be around for some time yet, though there are signs that systems are evolving towards the ERP model. The new Impcon 2000 MRPII system being introduced by AT&amp;T Istel, for instance, claims to combine a '4GL user interface with proven 3GL MRPII functionality'. Elsewhere, several other products emphasise the drive towards integration, though in more specialised applications. Cimtel is introducing CIM-Trak to 'close the loop' between its existing engineering data management and process planning packages through production, operator and quality performance monitoring. Cimlinc will be demonstrating how its Linkage networking product can help integrate diverse application packages from different vendors. At CIM '93 it will be implementing a network in which data will be ported between CAD software from UK vendor Radan Computational and the Supercapes process planning package marketed by PS Industry. On the hardware front Silicon Graphics will be demonstrating its recently introduced range of low-cost workstations, whose prices start at less than Pounds 5,000. But besides being able to run technical packages, such as the AutoCAD design software, the machines also have substantial digital media capabilities enabling them to be used for transmitting video images. One word starting to crop up more frequently in the engineering software area is Windows, the highly versatile PC operating system that permits easy manipulation of on-screen graphics developed by Microsoft. It provides an obvious migration path from the simpler DOS operating system - as well as from Microsoft - that has already effectively monopolised the industrial PC market. Several companies are showing Windows products. Production Modeling Corporation of Europe will be introducing ProModel for Windows, an upgrade to its DOS-based ProModel manufacturing simulation system. The company says the change greatly enhances ease of use and the variety of graphical output available. DesignCAD for Windows from PMS (Instruments) is a similar upgrade to the company's existing 2D DesignCAD for DOS product. One consequence of the change is much more potential for customisation of the system by users. But in the background there are also the beginnings of a confrontation between the Unix operating system within which most workstation-based software systems currently run and Microsoft's recently launched Windows NT product, even more powerful than basic Windows. 'High-end' PCs running Windows NT provide comparable performance to 'low-end' Unix workstations. One of the first products to exploit the situation is the Pro/Engineer parametric modelling system from Parametric Technology. The company will be showing Pro/Engineer running on a Compaq Deskpro '486' PC. The establishment of Windows/Windows NT products in the engineering software field is likely to prove one of the fundamental driving forces for product development over the next few years.

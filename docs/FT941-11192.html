			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Heavitree The recovery continued in the second half at Heavitree Brewery, the USM-traded pub operator, resulting in profits for the year to October 31 of Pounds 1.32m pre-tax, against Pounds 496,000. The Exeter-based company said the increase was the result of improved terms from suppliers, lower interest rates on lower borrowings and a cut in bad debts. Turnover was static at Pounds 8.35m (Pounds 8.38m). The pre-tax figure was helped by lower net interest charges of Pounds 346,000 (Pounds 527,000) and an exceptional credit of Pounds 40,000, against a charge last time of Pounds 60,000. Earnings per share came to 11.2p (3.3p) and an increased final dividend of 3p is recommended for a total of 3.6p (3.05p).</p>

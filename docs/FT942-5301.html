			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Party facing Northwards: George Graham finds Virginia Republicans divided One year ago, Virginia Republicans were divided sharply over the religious right-winger whom their party had nominated for the state's lieutenant-governorship. He lost. This weekend, the party selected to run in November, for election to the US Senate, a candidate who divides opinions even more sharply: Mr Oliver North, former colonel of Marines, who was one of the organisers of the Iran-Contra plot to trade arms for the US hostages held in Lebanon. The near-15,000 delegates who picked Mr North, at a festive party convention in the Virginian state capital of Richmond on Saturday, were determined to avoid the internal strife of last year and to preserve party unity. Once it was clear that Mr North had won more than 55 per cent of the delegates' votes, Mr James Miller, budget director in the Reagan administration who had also battled for the nomination, promised his full support in the campaign to unseat Senator Chuck Robb, the Democratic incumbent whose sex life has severely tarnished his prospects of re-election. Virginia Republicans are unusual in picking their Senate nominee at a party convention. The state's Democrats will hold a primary, open to a wider electorate than the party faithful who attend conventions, next week. The often fierce struggle for the Republican nomination has been portrayed as a fight between the moderate and the right-winger, but Mr Miller's political stance was as far to the right as Mr North's. Indeed, he even outflanked Mr North on the issue of abortion by refusing to accept any exceptions, even in cases of incest or rape. Although the few party moderates who attended the convention in Richmond mostly backed Mr Miller, most delegates committed to him were barely distinguishable from their counterparts in the North camp. 'It's neck-and-neck on conservative issues. I could support either one,' said Mr Harry Lee, a delegate who had picked Mr Miller mainly because opinion polls show his chances of defeating Mr Robb to be much better than Mr North's. Many Miller delegates, such as Mr William James from rural Brunswick county, on Virginia's border with North Carolina, had once backed Mr North. Mr James switched in April, but only in the last week was he able to persuade his wife, also a delegate, to change her mind. Besides the blessing of former President Ronald Reagan and most senior figures from the Reagan administration, Mr Miller also won the late support of many of Virginia's congressmen and Republican party heavyweights. But political endorsements swayed few at the convention. 'It doesn't matter which congressman is speaking on whose behalf, it matters what the person who kneels next to you in church thinks,' said Mr Kerry Burch, a North supporter. Senator John Warner, the Republican moderate who holds the state's other seat in the Senate, has called Mr North unfit for office and has thrown his weight behind Mr Marshall Coleman, a Republican and a former state attorney-general who is trying to get on the November ballot as an independent. He may even run as an independent when he faces re-election for his present job in 1996. Mr Warner preferred to attend D-Day commemorations in Europe this weekend rather than brave a party convention at which his name was often jeered. 'I think he's leaning too far to the left. He's talking about running as an independent and I can see why, because I don't think this party would support him,' said Mrs Janice Cifers, a North supporter. Yet, even in this conservative and religious assembly, however, Mr North was able to win only 55 per cent of the votes. There remain doubts over his ability to win votes from a broader electorate which remembers that he was convicted of lying to Congress over Iran-Contra. His convictions were subsequently overturned, because he had previously testified to Congress under immunity from prosecution, but he has admitted lying. In fact, the Virginia Republicans have picked one of the very few candidates against whom Mr Robb's chances of winning re-election must be rated as good. Mr North's fervent supporters are aware of the difficulties he will face in the November election, and have joined with gusto in the game of tactical voting that is expected then: supporters of the Democratic former governor of Virginia, Mr Douglas Wilder, set up stands outside the convention and estimated that 5,000 to 6,000 Republican delegates, eager to split Mr Robb's support, signed petitions to put Mr Wilder on the ballot paper as another independent.</p>

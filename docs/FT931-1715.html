			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Polypipe advances to Pounds 6.4m POLYPIPE, the Doncaster-based manufacturer of industrial and commercial plastic pipes and fittings, reported a 9.5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 5.85m to Pounds 6.4m. Turnover in the six months to December 31 increased by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 45.8m) and included a full contribution from Aquapipes and GCA Windows, both acquired in October 1991. Together the two businesses contributed more than Pounds 2m to turnover and about Pounds 150,000 to profits. Earnings per share rose 9.4 per cent to 2.78p (2.54p) and the interim dividend is raised to 0.66p (0.63p). Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the results reflected the continuing strength of the core plastic pipe and fittings business, which accounted for Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 30.2m) of sales, and the development and successful integration of more recently acquired domestic plastic product activities. Polypipe and Paragon increased their share of the above-ground rainwater, soil and waste market as did Derwent MacDee in the market for flushing cisterns, toilet and other bathroom fittings. Capital expenditure during the first half totalled Pounds 4.96m and will be about the same level in the second half when new machinery to produce large diameter twin-wall pipes comes on stream. The balance sheet remains strong with no net debt. COMMENT Polypipe continues to buck the recession helped by some astute acquisitions including Aquapipes whose lightweight twin-walled corrugated pipes use 40 per cent less raw material than their solid counterparts and are set to gradually replace clay and concrete. Only 12.5 per cent of the group's business is related to new housing with the the bulk coming from the much less sensitive repair, maintenance and improvement markets where new products are helping margins. The group has so far resisted pressure from its raw material suppliers to pass on price increases, which might not stick anyway. Given the seasonally-stronger second half has already shown some signs of improvement, full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m look reasonable. However, the shares have climbed sharply in the last six months and at yesterday's close of 137p now trade on a lofty multiple of over 18 and look fully valued.</p>

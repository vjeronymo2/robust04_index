			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo ASAHI Newstar Television Network  in Japanese at 1111 GMT on 19 June, in its regular "Sunday  Project" program, carries a 45-minute discussion on the recent  domestic political situation by Wataru Kubo, Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] secretary-general, and Kozo Watanabe,  acting Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general,  moderated by commentator Soichiro Tahara at the Asahi studio in  Tokyo.    The discussion begins with Kubo explaining why his party  decided to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to  testify before the Diet regarding his money deals with the  Sagawa Kyunbin Company. Tahara then asks Kubo about the present  political situation and the SDPJ's stand on political  realignment. Kubo says: "The Hata cabinet must resign en masse  to clean up the root cause for the SDPJ leaving the coalition.  If that condition is accepted, we will discuss ways to form a  new administration."    When asked if there could be any other way to form a new  administration other than the cabinet's resignation, Kubo says  the SDPJ will not rule out the possibility of holding  negotiations with the ruling parties to seek alternatives.  Tahara asks if the SDPJ will ask Shinseito Secretary General  Ozawa to assume responsibility for causing the SDPJ's  withdrawal. Kubo says his party will not do that.    At 1124 GMT, Tahara asks Kubo about the possibility of his  party submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata  cabinet. Kubo replies the SDPJ will not submit such a motion  now, while in the process of conducting negotiations with the  ruling parties on forming a new cabinet.    Asked if there is a possibility of the SDPJ submitting a  no-confidence motion in cooperation with the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] in the future, Kubo says: "It depends on future  negotiations [with the ruling parties] on a new administration."  When Tahara asks whether the SDPJ is willing to form even a new  coalition with the LDP, Kubo says: "Yes." But he adds since the  SDPJ cannot ally with the LDP in its present form, it wants to  find a solution in the negotiations with the ruling parties.    At 1131 GMT, Shinseito's Watanabe arrives at the studio and  joins the discussion. Watanabe also emphasizes the importance  of the negotiations between the SDPJ and the coalition parties.    Asked to give his opinion on the SDPJ's demand for the  cabinet's resignation, Watanabe says it might resign if it can  assure the establishment of a stable and efficient  administration. While noting the resignation is a decision only  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata can make, Watanabe says Hata will  make a choice that can help improve Japanese politics.    Discussing the SDPJ's position on a no-confidence motion in  the cabinet, Tahara notes the SDPJ wants the cabinet to  voluntarily resign before such a motion is adopted. Kubo  confirms his comment by saying: "That is right."    At 1137 GMT, Tahara asks Watanabe to explain the key points  in negotiations with the SDPJ. Watanabe notes that the two  sides need to agree on major policy issues and on the formation  of a consultative panel. He adds it is possible for his party  to advise Prime Minister Hata to have the cabinet resign if it  feels sure it can contribute to establishing "new improved  Japanese politics."    When Watanabe says a no-confidence motion should not be  submitted without considering current political difficulties,  Kubo reiterates it is unthinkable for the SDPJ to submit the  motion while the negotiations are underway.    While admitting the ruling parties' responsibility for  causing the SDPJ's withdrawal, Watanabe says: "We will take Mr.  Kubo's call into consideration with as much modesty as possible  to work out conditions for forming the next coalition  administration." He adds this includes the Kata cabinet's  resignation.    At 1145 GMT, Kubo leaves the studio and Tahara continues the  discussion with Watanabe. Tahara points out differences in  opinions within Shinseito over the future political realignment,  citing Ozawa's plan to ally with the Watanabe and Yasuo Nakasone  by forming a "conservatives' alliance with conservatives."  Watanabe denies this: "I do not think Mr. Ozawa has such idea."  He adds Ozawa is only trying to ally with LDP members who are  determined to achieve political reform. Watanabe emphatically  says the coalition administration's existing framework should be  respected.    Tahara notes the cabinet's resignation is the only way to  have the SDPJ return to the coalition. Watanabe says he will  advise Ozawa and Hata that the resignation should be possible if  it will assure unity within a coalition government.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: MALE CAT'S SPRAYING MAY INDICATE PROTEST  </P> <P> Q. We have three cats in our household, two females and one male. In the past  three weeks, our male cat has started to urinate in various places in the  house. He is 2 1/2 years old and is neutered. He seems to be healthy and eats  well. We are becoming concerned that he may have a bladder problem that we  heard is common to male cats. All three cats are indoors and eat the same food.  Does this sound like a bladder infection? Is there anything that we can do at  home?  </P> <P> Gladys Powell, Brea  </P> <P> A. When a cat starts to urinate outside of the litter box, there may be several  reasons. If there is only one litter box, he may be objecting to sharing the  box with the other two cats or it may be an indication that the box is not  being kept clean enough for him. You may have to get an extra litter box or  keep the current box very clean.  </P> <P> Your male cat may also be starting to exert his dominance by marking his  territory -- in this case, the house -- by spraying in various locations. Even  though he is neutered, he may still spray to show that he is the No. 1 cat in  the house. This is a behavioral situation that may require medications from  your veterinarian to help change.  </P> <P> If your cat is straining to urinate or can't seem to hold his urine long enough  to make it to the litter box, he may in fact be developing a urinary problem.  It would be wise to have him checked by your veterinarian and a urinalysis done  to rule out the possibility of an infection or cystitis. Your vet may want to  start him on antibiotics or special diets to keep the infection under control.  </P> <P> Q. My 6-year-old female cocker is starting to cough, especially when she gets  very active. She doesn't seem to be uncomfortable otherwise and eats well. I  have not seen her vomit or cough anything up. I have kept her vaccinations up  to date and her vet said she was healthy on her last exam. Could she have  developed kennel cough? She has played with other dogs at the park where we run  but I haven't heard any of them cough. Should I have her checked again?  </P> <P> Bill Eisenmann, Irvine  </P> <P> A. Since coughing is a non-specific sign of so many disorders, I would  recommend that you have your dog examined again. There are so many  possibilities -- from having a tracheal irritation from a foreign body, such as  grass, to the beginning signs of heart disease. Your veterinarian will want to  examine her thoroughly. A chest X-ray will probably be necessary. In the  meantime, I would reduce or eliminate her running exercises.  </P> <P> Got a question about your pet?

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRONICLING KIDS' FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL  </P> <P> Last December, Jill Krementz, the well-known photographer, sat quietly in the  back seat of a taxicab.  </P> <P> Nothing unusual in that, except that the entire East Side was crazed and cranky  over "Gorbylock." All around her, cabbies and truckers, pedestrians and  passengers fumed and growled over the immovable traffic stalled by the  departure of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Krementz just sat there and hummed to herself.  </P> <P> Finally, the exasperated cabbie turned around and grumbled: "Lady, I can't  believe how calm you are. How do you do it?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm Healthy'  </P> <P> She answered simply: "I'm healthy, and I'm going home to a healthy husband and  child."  </P> <P> It's the kind of thinking that comes from spending two years chronicling the  lives of 14 children with serious illnesses and disabilities. Krementz's latest  book is "How It Feels to Fight for Your Life" (Little, Brown, $15.95). It's her  26th book and the fourth in her "How It Feels" series; other volumes have dealt  with divorce, adoption and a parent's death.  </P> <P> "I try to do subjects that others stay away from," she said recently over  cappuccino at a Third Avenue bistro. "They don't scare me. They certainly have  a toll and they make me very sad, but I do them for a reason."  </P> <P> She does them for the children.  </P> <P> "I want this book to be inspiring to other children," says Krementz, who lives  with her daughter, Lily, and husband, author Kurt Vonnegut, in a four-story  East Side brownstone. "I chose the title because that's what these kids are  talking about."  </P> <P> Each profile includes Krementz's photographs and text in which the child tells  his or her life story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Just Transcription  </P> <P> "Some people think that I just turn on the tape and transcribe it," said  Krementz. "Sometimes the children think that."  </P> <P> Not so.  </P> <P> Krementz interviews parents, nurses, doctors, friends, and then reaches into  the children's thoughts.  </P> <P> "I try to put a stethoscope on their hearts so that I can listen to their  innermost feelings," she says.  </P> <P> It's a world of anger and anxiety, fear and hope.  </P> <P> "Having open-heart surgery has definitely changed my thinking," says Joey Buck,  14. "One thing I can say for sure is that now I know how to fight for my life  and never give up hope. And I know I can live through an incredible amount of  pain. When you've been as sick as I have, it makes you grow up faster."  </P> <P> Helping Krementz celebrate the book's publication will be Joey; Alisha  Weissman, 16, who is fighting epilepsy; and Rachel DeMaster, 10, who is  fighting diabetes. Also coming will be William and Helen Kleinegger, whose son,  Michael, was diagnosed with cancer of the blood when he was 15. He underwent  chemotherapy and lost 50 pounds.  </P> <P> "When you're really sick, no matter what your sickness is, you have to accept  what happened and face up to it, no matter what," Michael says in the book.  "You have to fight, fight, fight! You're not going to help yourself if you run  away."  </P> <P> Michael died on May 23 when he was 16.  </P> <P> "It was one of the saddest days in my life," Krementz says.  </P> <P> But she also sees the positive.  </P> <P> "Because of his attitude, Michael lived a much better life than otherwise," she  says quietly.  </P> <P> "He lived with hope."  </P></p>

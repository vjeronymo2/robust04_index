			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / AIG fund to invest Dollars 1.1bn in Asian projects American International Group, the US insurer, will today announce it has raised Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m) for investment in infrastructure in developing Asian countries, about half of it destined for power, telecommunications and transport projects in China. The government of Singapore, through two of its investment funds, has provided Dollars 250m of the money, signalling a policy to switch more of its international investment to supporting Asian development. The fund is backed by 24 institutional investors, most of them pension funds and others based in the US. The completion of the fund comes just 10 days after Tiger Management, one of the biggest hedge fund groups, was forced to withdraw its own planned Dollars 1bn infrastructure fund. In an attempt to kick-start that fund, Tiger and GE Investments, which manages pension fund money for General Electric, earlier this year agreed to contribute Dollars 225m between them. However, the proposed fund is believed to have suffered from the adverse publicity hedge funds attracted after some made big losses in financial markets earlier this year. The fate of the most ambitious infrastructure investment scheme announced to date, between hedge fund manager Mr George Soros and GE Capital, General Electric's financial services arm, remains unclear. In January, each side agreed to contribute Dollars 200m to the venture, which was intended eventually to attract as much as Dollars 2.5bn to invest in power projects in developing countries. Yesterday, GE Capital said that no efforts were under way to attract additional investors. 'We are focusing our energies right now on finding investment opportunities. Securing other investors was not the priority,' it said. The AIG fund will be managed by Emerging Markets Corporation, a Washington-based company set up two years ago by two World Bank veterans, Mr Moeen Qureshi and Mr Don Roth. AIG has put Dollars 100m into the fund. GE, which has backed infrastructure funds to support the sale of its own power generation equipment in developing countries, is also believed to be an investor. Around half of the Bermuda-registered fund is expected to be invested in projects in China, with the rest in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. The closed-end fund is believed to have set a target of achieving a 20-25 per cent compound annual return for investors over its projected 10-year life. Earlier this year, Mr Qureshi, a former caretaker prime minister of Pakistan, said that the fund respresented 'a sea change in the willingness of long-term investors to venture out into developing countries'.</p>

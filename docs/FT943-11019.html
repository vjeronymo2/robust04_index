			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Technology: A quick lesson in Japanese A Kyoto-based group of scientific researchers has come up with a machine than can translate a 15-word Japanese sentence into English in one-tenth of a second. Its so-called 'massively parallel' series of artificial intelligence computers translates at speeds 300 to 500 times faster than ordinary artificial systems, according to the team's leader, Hitoshi Iida. The group, from Advanced Research Institute International, a private research unit, unveiled its system at the 12th conference of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence which started last week. Iida's system differs from conventional artificial intelligence in that its software is built to give a close, rather than precise, translation of colloquial - and hence grammatically irregular - Japanese. Conventional systems match words and phrases only in accordance with precise pre-programmed grammatical rules. The Kyoto language computer has, by contrast, been fed with 100,000 combinations of certain words that are often used, but not in accordance with strict syntax. Within these 100,000 combinations, 6,000 individual words are classed in line with general concepts, such as food or action, says Iida. Words included in those concepts are further divided into three index groups of increasing levels or precision. So the machine starts with a concept and works through the index to build an English sentence most like the Japanese original. The machine chooses an expression approximate to the Japanese sentence from 100,000 combinations, by using words in the index as clues. Other artificial intelligence machines, in attempting to make a precise match between colloquial Japanese and English, either slow down or stop, says Iida. Frustrated language students may be forgiven for sympathising with the conventional artificial intelligence computers' plight.</p>

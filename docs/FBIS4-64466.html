			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a reception for German </F> soldiers who took part in UN peace and humanitarian missions, in  Bonn on 18 April: "Germany's Responsibility in a Changed World"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen, these  days, we are once again dramatically experiencing what most of  us still considered impossible a few years ago -- that war and  barbarism have made a comeback in Europe. No one should think  that the evil ghosts of the past are at home only in the  Balkans, and that racial and religious hatred and ethnic  expulsion can only happen there.    Despite all our problems and worries, such as the attainment  of internal unity, the combating of the recession and  unemployment, and the creation of new jobs, the safeguarding of  peace and liberty now and in the coming years remains the  decisive goal of German politics. Internal peace is only  possible when external peace is guaranteed. Our German  experience this century includes a recognition of the fact that  we need partners and friends.    Our security and negotiating ability in foreign policy  matters is geared to the fact that we are reliable partners and  that our allies trust us. After all, our allies stood by us in  the past, and continue to do so. When it comes to peace and  freedom in Europe and the world, Germany must not stand on the  sidelines. We must share the responsibility at the side of our  friends and partners.    The Bundeswehr's involvement in measures to safeguard world  peace within the framework of the community of nations is not  only a central issue of German foreign and security policy, but  also a question of German honor and identity. You soldiers of  the Bundeswehr are entitled to have a clear definition of  conditions so that you may agree to and fulfill your duties  without any ifs or buts.    Just as our country is growing accustomed to its new  international responsibility, so too is the image of the  soldier's profession undergoing a transformation. The challenge  concerns all of you, and with your involvement in UN operations  you have furnished the first examples of this responsibility.  In the future, the Bundeswehr's tasks will include not just the  defense of the country and the alliance, but also the  containment of crises and conflicts.    The soldierly profession is one of the few professions that  call for an existential commitment in every sense of the term,  in other words a readiness to lay down one's life. This can  also happen in peacetime if you experience a serious situation  in a crisis area beyond our borders. This provides us,  especially the politicians, with great responsibility. As  chancellor, I am fully aware of this responsibility every time I  reach a decision regarding the deployment of our soldiers.    A readiness to assume duties and participate in service for  the common good has shrunk alarmingly in our society. We are  living at a time when ruthless egoism is often hailed as  "self-fulfillment." To safeguard our future, and it is not  old-fashioned to say this, we must resort to the values that  guaranteed Germany a future in difficult times -- courage and  reliability, self- responsibility and efficiency, a readiness to  help, and consideration for others.    With your service, soldiers of the Bundeswehr, you occupy a  central position in our society. You are accorded our  recognition, and have every reason to be proud of your services.  I wish as many people as possible in all sectors of society --  in politics, in the parties, in industry, and in the trade  unions -- would follow your example.    Ladies and Gentlemen, Israel's Amos Oz, peace prize winner  of  the German publishing trade, said in St. Paul's Church in  Frankfurt in 1992: "Twice in my life have I seen the horrible  countenance of war. But still I am convinced that one can never  abolish aggression by succumbing to it."    Therefore we need your service in the Bundeswehr to permit  future generations a life of peace, freedom, and prosperity. I  ask each of you, also on a personal level, to take part in this  great future task. I thank you all for your service, and ask  you to convey my thanks to your comrades.</p>

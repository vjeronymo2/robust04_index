			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEF'S SECRETS: OH SOUP OF THE EVENING  </P> <P> I dare you to identify the mystery ingredient -- eggplant -- in this exotic  soup. Near impossible. Yet eggplant soup is one of the most popular items on  the menu at Patrick Healy's Champagne Restaurant in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I love eggplant," said Healy.  </P> <P> He must. Healy uses eggplant in all three menus (contemporary, rustic and spa)  offered at Champagne.  </P> <P> But that is not odd for an American chef whose culinary roots were formed in  the south of France, where eggplant is the king of Mediterranean vegetables.  </P> <P> "Eggplant fits beautifully into my spa menu because it is naturally low in  calories and has no fat," said Healy.  </P> <P> The thick, rather filling soup is served garnished with a merry swirl of red  pepper puree for color and flavor fillip. The soup can actually double as a dip  for vegetables; a sauce for roast poultry, game, pork or veal, or as a spread  for crackers.  </P> <P> Start scooping.  </P> <P> ROASTED EGGPLANT AND RED BELL PEPPER SOUP  </P> <P> 3 large Japanese eggplants  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Extra virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 2 sweet red peppers  </P> <P> 1 large onion, sliced  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 1 quart chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 bunch fresh basil  </P> <P> Wash eggplants and split lengthwise in halves. Lightly season with salt and  pepper and sprinkle with olive oil to taste.  </P> <P> Roast eggplants at 400 degrees 45 minutes or until tender and golden brown.  Puree flesh with skin in blender or food processor. Set aside.  </P> <P> Place peppers under broiler until skins are scorched on all sides. Place in  plastic bag 10 minutes to soften, then peel and remove seeds. Puree flesh in  food processor until smooth. Set aside.  </P> <P> Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet. Saute onion and garlic until tender.  Cover to sweat over very low heat 5 minutes. Add roasted eggplant puree and  chicken stock to onion-garlic mixture. Cook over low heat 15 minutes until  flavors blend and mixture is heated through. Puree mixture in blender or food  processor until smooth, then strain into clean bowl. Season to taste with salt  and pepper.  </P> <P> Cut basil leaves into tiny cubes, resembling confetti.  </P> <P> To serve, place serving of soup in deep bowl. Spoon red pepper puree in center  and swirl into soup. Drizzle lightly with olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle with  basil. Makes 6 servings.  </P></p>

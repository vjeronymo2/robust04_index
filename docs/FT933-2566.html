			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Singapore presses on with Japanese bond futures THE Singapore International Monetary Exchange is to go ahead with plans to launch a Japanese government bond futures contract, in spite of objections by the Tokyo stock exchange. Mr Ang Swee Tian, president of Simex, said the decision to list the contract  -from October 1 - was in response to demand from international market participants, particularly the US-based Managed Futures Association. 'We also explained to the TSE officials that we believed the development of a Simex JGB contract would generate increased interest in (the JGB market) among global users,' many of whom already trade Simex's short-term Eurodollar and Euroyen interest rate contracts, said Mr Ang. He added that the inter-market trading opportunities would be 'mutually beneficial' to the two exchanges. However, Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the TSE, strongly criticised Simex for not consulting with the exchange before the plan's announcement. The move by Simex will harm the supply and demand situation as well as the market mechanism on the TSE, he said. The Simex contract is identical to that of the TSE, with a 6 per cent coupon and a 10-year maturity. The row is expected to worsen the relationship between the two exchanges, which has already been soured by the success of Simex's Nikkei futures contract, based on the Nikkei 225 stock index of the TSE. The TSE has blamed stock futures and options trading for the volatility of Japanese shares, and has been unhappy over Simex's refusal to implement restrictions. Trading of Nikkei futures on Simex has soared while the Osaka stock exchange, which lists Nikkei 225 stock futures, has tried to curb trading by increasing regulations.</p>

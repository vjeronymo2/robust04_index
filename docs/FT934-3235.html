			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets trend set to continue If 1993's explosion of international interest is anything to go by, there is no reason why next year should not continue the trend of rapid growth in many of the world's emerging markets. At a presentation by Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets in London last week the group's chief investment officer, Mr Arnab Banerji, forecast that emerging markets were expected to grow faster economically than the OECD for the foreseeable future. Baring Securities, in a forward looking strategy document, underlines this point, noting that 'while the rich industrial countries struggle to achieve sub-2 per cent real growth rates, the emerging economies regularly clock in with 5 per cent or even 10 per cent annual expansion'. It is hardly surprising then, says Baring, that in 1993 an estimated Dollars 25bn was invested in the Asian markets alone by western institutions, representing growth of some 150 per cent over 1992. In this context, Mr Banerji confidently forecasts strong growth in a number of regions for 1994: top of the list are India and Mexico, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Taiwan and Korea. The case for Mexico sits squarely on the back of the recent Nafta agreement. F &amp; C estimates GDP growth of some 4 per cent next year. Baring sees the market gaining some 59 per cent during 1994, based on a combination of lower interest rates, higher earnings growth and a stock market rerating. India is highlighted by F &amp; C as having the potential to take off next year, in spite of a fairly lacklustre performance in 1993. Positive factors include consumer-led economic recovery and falling inflation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC MONTHLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Dollar terms                     No. of                    % Change        % Change Market              stocks      30 Nov      last month      on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)      804.40            -2.1           +38.8 Brazil                (42)      229.65            +9.8           +83.7 Chile                 (20)      495.33            +6.5           +18.4 Colombia*              (8)      545.83            +5.9           +28.4 Mexico                (56)      859.11            +9.9           +27.1 Peru**                 (7)       88.25           -25.6           -11.8 Venezuela***           (8)      588.72            -2.5           +13.3 East Asia China****             (16)      121.74            +9.6           +21.7 South Korea*****     (130)      107.27            +7.2            +9.3 Philippines           (11)      242.54            +2.5           +81.6 Taiwan, China******   (76)       90.33            +5.8           +22.4 South Asia India*******          (61)      110.02           +21.7           +17.4 Indonesia********     (31)      106.54            +9.0           +81.5 Malaysia              (61)      278.69            +1.5           +70.4 Pakistan*********      (8)      316.20           +18.7           +58.0 Sri Lanka**********    (5)      164.01           +10.5           +64.0 Thailand              (52)      372.43            +2.7           +61.7 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)      219.10            -2.5           +12.2 Jordan                 (5)      157.78            -3.9           +35.1 Portugal              (16)      110.02            +0.3           +42.4 Turkey***********     (31)      198.19           +15.1          +189.5 Zimbabwe************   (5)      176.38            -3.8            na  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Local currency terms                                                 % Change      % Change Market              stocks          30 Nov    last month    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)      493,603.97          -2.1         +39.1 Brazil                (42)   73,738,910.69         +48.7       +3435.9 Chile                 (20)          809.43          +5.4         +26.2 Colombia*              (8)          784.72          +5.0         +28.3 Mexico                (56)        1,153.32         +10.0         +27.0 Peru**                 (7)          117.12         -24.9         +17.1 Venezuela***           (8)        1,374.35          +0.2         +47.2 East Asia China****             (16)          133.83          +9.6         +33.8 South Korea*****     (130)          113.87          +7.0         +11.9 Philippines           (11)          320.23          -3.2         +98.1 Taiwan, China******   (76)           90.38          +6.1         +29.6 South Asia India*******          (61)          121.67         +21.7         +27.4 Indonesia********     (31)          121.61          +9.0         +84.9 Malaysia              (61)          263.09          +1.6         +66.7 Pakistan*********      (8)          430.07         +18.9         +85.5 Sri Lanka**********    (5)          176.20         +10.8         +76.2 Thailand              (52)          376.05          +3.1         +61.3 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)          365.25          -0.3         +28.3 Jordan                 (5)          228.18          -3.1         +37.6 Portugal              (16)          132.86          +1.4         +70.2 Turkey***********     (31)        1,276.51         +22.3        +365.0 Zimbabwe************   (5)          184.86          -1.5          na  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-month, and monthly changes are percentage movements from the previous month end.

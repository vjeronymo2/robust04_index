			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Tax changes in Manx Budget THE ISLE of Man government yesterday announced a Budget for 1993-94 aimed at stimulating economic growth while amending the income tax structure to help those on lower incomes. Presenting his fourth Budget, Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury minister, said his main objectives were 'to strengthen the foundations for the island's future prosperity and to continue and strengthen action already taken to develop employment opportunities'. The Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency, has had income tax autonomy from the UK since 1961 and is obliged to operate a budget surplus. Net income for the year is estimated at Pounds 192.8m, an increase of 3.2 per cent, and net expenditure at Pounds 202m, the balance coming from funds brought forward from the previous year. Capital spending is estimated at Pounds 44.8m, including redevelopment of the hospital and airport, and a new courthouse and general registry. The island's reserve fund will remain at Pounds 65.29m. Mr Gelling said the target was to increase this to half the government's annual expenditure. The Pounds 4.26m interest earned by the fund and by the island's currency account will be included in net income. The two-tiered system of personal income taxation remains at 15 per cent and 20 per cent. Corporate and non-resident's tax remains at 20 per cent. Personal income tax thres-holds rise for the first time since 1989. A single person's allowance is increased to Pounds 6,200 from Pounds 6,000, with income tax at 15 per cent payable on the next Pounds 8,500 - an enlarging of the band by Pounds 500 - and thereafter at 20 per cent. A married couple's allowance is double that of a single person and is fully transferable between partners. This means a single person earning Pounds 15,000 will pay income tax of Pounds 1,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 2,764 in the UK, at Pounds 30,000 income tax will be Pounds 4,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 6,942 in the UK and at Pounds 50,000 income Pounds 8,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 14,942 in the UK. Mr Gelling announced a review of residence rules relating to income tax liability of individuals. Both non-resident and tax exempt Manx companies will have their annual charges increased, but this will be mitigated by removal of statutory audit requirements. Duty on non-resident companies will increase by Pounds 100 to Pounds 600 per year and annual fees for exempt companies by Pounds 50 to Pounds 300. The proposed category of international companies and international limited partnerships, due to be instituted later this year, will bear annually a tax charge of Pounds 300 and a fee of Pounds 600 respectively. The island will introduce roll-over relief for capital allowances on sales of ships and aircraft which should benefit the growing Manx shipping register. The government also plans to amend pensions laws to attract international pension fund management companies to the island, but no details were given. Among environmental measures the road tax rate for the smallest-engined vehicles is unchanged and the rebate of 5p per gallon on unleaded petrol and diesel is retained.</p>

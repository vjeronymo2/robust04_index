			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Insurance policy EFFORTS TO rescue Municipal Mutual, the stricken local-authority owned insurance company, are running out of steam. MMI, which is the ninth largest insurance company in the UK, has ceased to sell new policies and placed a seven-day moratorium on claims payments on existing policies. The company is talking to leading insurers who might take over some parts of the business, including its portfolio of home and motor policies. But chances of finding a buyer for the rest appear slim, with the Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires no longer interested in acquiring the company. There are many facets of the MMI story which will be familiar to observers of the UK financial services industry. The company started life as a niche player, insuring local authority business. The conservative management approach won more than 80 per cent of the business. But in the 1980s, MMI expanded aggressively out of its core business into other areas of the insurance market, especially individual home and motor policies. Larger rivals were undercut to win market share. This expansion accelerated after changes in the ownership structure of the company which diluted local authority control. These were designed to meet the requirements of the 1989 Local Government Act which sought to force councils to divest themselves of commercial businesses. They also gave management more leeway to pursue expansion: premium income rose further, more than doubling between 1987 and 1991. Recent growth has been accompanied by the deterioration in trading conditions which afflicted the insurance industry as a whole. Bad weather, rising crime and civil disorder pushed up claims on domestic policies. But the core business was also hit, with increased claims from local authorities following events such as the Hillsborough football disaster and the exposure of the repressive 'pin-down' regime in Staffordshire children's homes. Claims rose threefold between 1987 and 1991, considerably faster than premium income. In May, a big increase in reserves to cover business written in the past left MMI's net assets at Pounds 4.9m and its solvency margin well below levels normally accepted in the industry. At this stage, intervention might have been expected from the Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for regulating insurance companies. Despite the company's parlous state, the DTI allowed it to continue to write new business. One factor which appears to have influenced that decision was the interest expressed by La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires in taking it over. Earlier this week, that rescue bid collapsed - apparently to the surprise of MMI, which had assured the world that the talks were still on. It is not clear whether there have been regulatory failures by the DTI in this case. But prima facie there is a case to answer. In particular, the DTI appears to have allowed MMI to continue trading with a solvency margin well below the minimum regarded as normal on the basis of a rescue bid which has since evaporated and appears not to have been a binding agreement. An independent inquiry is needed to determine the facts. Then a judgment to be made on whether the regulatory framework itself is adequate.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE LAWS MAY BACKFIRE ON U.S. FIRMS  </P> <P> To members of Congress who are seeking to protect American manufacturers from  what they regard as unfair competition from abroad, the massive trade law they  enacted last year stands as a monument of hard-nosed realism.  </P> <P> But to a wide range of U.S. businesses that stand to suffer from its  implementation, the act is only another sorry example of the law of unintended  consequences.  </P> <P> A case in point: the heightened threat of 100% tariffs against an array of 54  Japanese imports in retaliation for Japan's failure to open its market in  mobile radio and cellular telephone services and equipment to U.S.  manufacturers.  </P> <P> Motorola, the lone U.S. manufacturer that was significantly damaged by Japan's  closed telecommunications markets, prevailed upon the office of U.S. Trade  Representative Carla A. Hills to retaliate under the terms of the 1988 trade  act, which increased the likelihood that such tariffs would be imposed when  circumstances warranted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Will Be Hit?  </P> <P> Hills' office has listed 54 Japanese products, ranging from high-tech computer  equipment to cosmetics, that are under consideration for retaliatory tariffs.  Its job now is to determine which products should be hit.  </P> <P> To users of each of those 54 products, the answer is clear: Not the ones we  need. They argue that the tariffs would block their ability to buy the  low-cost, high-quality parts that enable them to compete in international  markets -- against, primarily, the Japanese.  </P> <P> "We applaud the proposed action, but . . . ," said Robert N. Noyce, chief  executive of Sematech, the new consortium of American semiconductor and  computer companies that has joined to compete with Japan in the production of  high-end microprocessors, semiconductors and other computer components.  </P> <P> It was a big "but." Sematech, which has sought government financing and partial  shielding from antitrust laws, is far from averse to the idea of managed trade,  if that would help it compete with Japan. But in Sematech's view, punitive  tariffs that could block the import of high-tech Japanese equipment needed to  produce even higher-tech semiconductors and computers would be  counterproductive.  </P> <P> "The suggested sanctions against the Japanese will, in fact, harm the U.S.  semiconductor industry by forcing American companies to pay tariff-inflated  prices for certain semiconductor equipment," Noyce told the trade  representative's office at a May 24 hearing.  </P> <P> "Since the Japanese have targeted that industry segment and have achieved  dominating technological superiority in certain segments, the proposed tariffs  would serve only to provide Japanese semiconductor suppliers with a competitive  advantage," Noyce said.  </P> <P> He concluded: "We have to be careful of the unintended actions of such  well-deserved and well-intentioned sanctions."  </P> <P> Sematech's predicament is an inevitable price of retaliation, said Lionel  Olmer, a former Commerce Department trade official who has been doing battle  with the Japanese for years.  </P> <P> "What always happens in these cases is that the same companies that are  lobbying the U.S. government to be tough are also trying to make sure the  retaliation doesn't jeopardize any of their suppliers or business interests,"  Olmer said in an interview. "But it's impossible not to jeopardize somebody's  interest. There's no question about the law of unintended circumstances."  </P> <P> "You can't avoid goring someone's ox," added Kenneth S. Flamm, a specialist in  trade and high-technology industries at the Brookings Institution. "It's a pit  full of snakes we've descended into, and it's not clear who'll get bitten and  who will survive."  </P> <P> In the case of the tariffs in retaliation for Japan's closed mobile radio and  cellular telephone markets, the lobbying is going on mostly in public. It was  concentrated in the May 24 hearing at the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative.  </P> <P> Another company testifying that day was Amdahl, one of the few remaining  players in the competition with Japan to score first with the next generation  of supercomputers.  </P> <P> Amdahl explained that its bread-and-butter product, the commercial Amdahl model  5590 mainframe computer, depends on Japanese suppliers for about half of its  components. With the 100% tariffs proposed in the telecommunications case,  Amdahl "will have no choice but to pay a penalty projected to be in the range  of $40 million to $50 million annually," said Joseph Zemke, company spokesman,  at the hearing.  </P> <P> That figure, Zemke said, amounts to about 25% of Amdahl's annual $200-million  budget for research and development -- the very lifeblood of its effort to  develop a better supercomputer.  </P> <P> "A critical requirement for success in the highly competitive global  data-processing marketplace is the unyielding need to constantly incorporate  the finest technologies available worldwide," Zemke said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Markets Are Interdependent  </P> <P> "To remain competitive in this marketplace, no company can permit either local  or national borders to limit its technology sources. On the other hand, no one  country or company enjoys a monopoly on these items for very long.  </P> <P> "Therefore, the entire industry -- including companies like IBM, Cray and  Amdahl -- have found it necessary to incorporate varying percentages of  foreign-made components and sub-assemblies in their products in order to  successfully compete within the U.S. and overseas."  </P> <P> Accordingly, Zemke said, "retaliation as currently proposed could make Amdahl  less competitive in the very market the U.S. seeks to open through this  proceeding -- Japan."  </P> <P> The ironies abound. The telecommunications case is based primarily on a  complaint by Motorola, a leading U.S. semiconductor and electronics  manufacturer that has been told by Japan it may not operate cellular telephone  services in the Tokyo area.  </P> <P> But two leading opponents of the retaliation that Motorola's complaint has set  in motion are two other major U.S. providers of cellular telephone and mobile  radio services: Bell Atlantic and General Electric.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subsidiaries Also Hurt  </P> <P> Subsidiaries of both companies explained at the May 24 hearing that the process  of opening Japan's markets for the convenience of Motorola also would cut off  Japan as a key supplier of equipment for the goods and services they provide in  the domestic market.  </P> <P> "The U.S. cellular telephone industry depends heavily upon a ready supply of  reasonably priced cellular products from Japan," Bell Atlantic said.  </P> <P> GE said that, if its mobile division is forced to pay tariff-inflated prices  for the mobile radio equipment that sustains its cellular telephone production,  "our position in the marketplace will be untenable."  </P> <P> American subsidiaries of Japanese firms also stand to be harmed. Japanese  electronics companies have made major investments in the United States, and  American subsidiaries of the Japanese-controlled international giants  Mitsubishi and Fujitsu were among the companies that testified against  retaliation.  </P> <P> Indeed, Fujitsu has established a firm foothold as a minority owner of Amdahl,  two of whose directors are top executives of the Japanese firm. To Flamm of  Brookings, such interrelationships make unintended consequences almost  inevitable when the government pursues a policy of managed trade.  </P> <P> "The interdependence of the two markets -- the United States and Japan -- has  never been more obvious than in the computer-semiconductor field," Flamm said.  "But the American computer manufacturers, who know they need Japanese  components to help them maintain their competitive edge over the Japanese, are  not very happy about it. They don't like being dependent on Japan for this  technology."  </P> <P> By the same token, however, the Japanese depend on the Americans as the main  market for the semiconductors they produce.  </P> <P> It is not quite inevitable that the U.S. trade representative's office will  order retaliatory tariffs in the case of Japan's mobile radio and cellular  telephone markets. The office has quietly informed the Japanese that they can  escape retaliation if they can negotiate a satisfactory market-opening  arrangement with Motorola by July 10.  </P> <P> Olmer would be surprised if the Japanese Ministry of Posts and  Telcommunications, legendary for its inward-looking indifference to Japan's  wider global trade interests, reverses course and strikes a deal.  </P> <P> Referring to the section of the 1988 trade law that mandates retaliation for  alleged unfair trading practices, Olmer said: "The problem is, once Section 301  becomes a body in motion, it's almost impossible to stop."  </P> <P> But it is probable that many of the products listed as eligible for  retaliation, many of them goods totally unrelated to cellular phones or two-way  radios, will be dropped from the final list.  </P> <P> At present, for instance, certain Japanese cosmetics are on the list. Estee  Lauder Inc., a major U.S. cosmetics firm, objected.  </P> <P> Lauder has established a 10% market share in the Japanese cosmetics market, and  it warns that tariffs against Japan's comparatively minor penetration of the  U.S. market would only invite damaging retaliation.  </P> <P> Harris/3M Documents Products Inc., which provides office copying services at  the middle and lower range of the U.S. commercial market, offered yet another  kind of argument.  </P> <P> A proposed punitive tariff on Japanese photocopying equipment, it said, would  damage its own business by raising costs. But it would do nothing to protect  U.S. photocopier manufacturers, which have virtually abandoned the low end of  the market to the Japanese.  </P></p>

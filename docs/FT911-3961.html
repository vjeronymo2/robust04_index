			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Leading Article: Steel - crisis, what crisis? IT IS TIME for the European steel industry to stand up and be counted. Before the muttering starts in earnest that a recession in European steel demand should be met with EC support measures, the industry must relinquish its lingering claim to special status, accept that normal competition rules apply and disavow the use of subsidies and cartels to prevent market discipline driving out the weakest and the least efficient producers. The European Commission's recently announced investigation into an alleged cartel in steel for the construction industry should mark a turning point for the industry away from cartels and towards competition. The durability of an opposite view to this reflects steel's history as a cornerstone for the construction of an integrated European economy. The 1952 Treaty of Paris, covering coal and steel, was the industrial base for the European Community. Its aim was to make Europe more stable by binding Krupp and Thyssen, two of the great industrial engines of Germany's war machine, into a European system for controlling the industry. These are the forces which made steel's difficulties in the last recession a 'manifest crisis', in EC jargon, complete with import restrictions, production quotas, price controls and official sanction of huge subsidies. Political intervention The pressures for a new bout of political intervention should not be disguised by the fact that today producers talk about long-term market stabilising positions rather than quotas; about 'orderly marketing agreements', rather than cartels. The fact that two of Europe's largest producers, Ilva in Italy and Usinor Sacilor of France, are still state-owned guarantees a political ingredient to the debate. It would only take one government to provide heavy subsidy to one producer, for private-sector companies to seek production quotas to prevent predatory pricing. Before long, we would have spiralled back to a semi-official cartel. There is no justification for such recidivism. The scale of the current downturn does not compare with the crisis which engulfed the industry between 1974 and 1988. Then, arguably, it threatened a political crisis which could have buried the common market beneath a slag heap of economic nationalism. This time, the industry faces a normal cyclical downturn, not a crisis, and it is essential that the community shows itself steadfast against measures which in the end mean higher than necessary steel prices and a weaker economy. Old temptations The last manifest crisis was only palliated at great cost, as new entrants were discouraged and technical change retarded. Politically managed capacity cuts were also too shallow and shared in an inefficient way across the industry, between low and high cost producers. The EC still has overcapacity of about 25m tonnes a year; fully open to international competition, the figure could be 50m tonnes. It would be possible to feel relaxed about the dangers of politicians succumbing to old temptations, if Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, had succeeded in his campaign to scrap or at least substantially amend the Treaty of Paris, under which the manifest crisis measures were imposed. That would have removed an important practical and psychological prop for the industry. However, there are many effective steps the EC can take short of abolishing the treaty. First, Sir Leon should be encouraged in his determination to subject the industry to stringent competition rules. If the members of the alleged construction steel cartel are found guilty they should be fined well in excess of the token sums imposed last year on members of the stainless steel cartel. More broadly than this, the EC should use the forthcoming multilateral talks on steel trade in Geneva to commit itself to a liberal regime. This is possible within the terms of the Paris Treaty. But it will need a public commitment by the EC to foreswear use of the infamous Article 58 crisis powers. That would be the right signal at the right time.</p>

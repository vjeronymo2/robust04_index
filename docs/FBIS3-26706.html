An epoch-marking event happened that day in Haicang,  which has been undergoing development for more than 300 years.    That day, Zhu Rongji, Standing Committee member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State  Council, once again inspected Haicang. That was his third visit  to Haicang, which he previously inspected in March and July 1992.    A noticeable fact was that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also  brought the principal leaders of more than 10 state departments,  including the State Planning Commission, the Economic and Trade  Commission, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry  of Finance before the expiration of the land use agreement for  the "901 Project," to which 20 square kilometers of land was  allocated. Such a large-scale and high-level group of state  leaders coming to see an investment and development zone had not  been seen in the past. This showed that the party and state  leaders attach great importance to the development of Haicang.  Of course, as some relevant analysts have concluded, this also  indicated that a final decision on the use of the 20-square-km  land preserved for the project launched by Taiwan Plastics would  soon be made. Haicang's development will then enter a new stage.    The state authorities attached great importance to every  step  of Haicang's development from the planning stages to the initial  construction.    On 20 May 1989, the State Council issued an official  document, approving the establishment of a special investment  zone for Taiwan investors in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone  and in the districts of Xinglin and Haicang, and investment  projects inside the zone will enjoy favorable policy treatment.    In January 1990, the State Council named the area of 100  square kilometers in Haicang for the investment project of  Taiwan Plastics "901 Project," and a special leading group was  set up to handle this matter.    On 2 February 1990, Comrade Li Ruihuan inspected Haicang,  and  praised the advantageous conditions there. He proposed that the  delimitation of the administrative districts should serve the  purpose of economic development.    On 24 February 1990, Premier Li Peng braved the rain to  inspect Haicang and instructed Haicang to "break conventions and  adopt special measures to deal with special matters" in its  development. He also immediately decided that the State Council  would arrange some loans as start-up funds.    Between 16 and 20 September, Comrade Qiao Shi inspected  Haicang and listened to work reports by local leaders.    Between 17 and 19 March 1992 and between 2 and 4 July 1992,  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji flew to Haicang twice to handle some  affairs in Haicang's construction. He instructed the  departments concerned to effectively carry out their tasks, thus  creating conditions for large-scale development.    Party and state leaders Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Yang  Shangkun, Yao Yilin, Zou Jiahua, and Wang Zhaoguo frequently met  with leading overseas businessmen in order to promote Haicang's  development...    In the last few years, Haicang continued to be a key focus  of  the people's attention.    On 4 February, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji led nearly 100  leaders  from all the relevant State Council departments and the relevant  institutions of Fujian Province and Xiamen City to Haicang by  ship. On the ship, the leaders first listened to the report  about the construction of Haicang Bridge. At about 1000, Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji and his entourage stepped onto Congyu Pier in  the southwest part of Haicang. They first inspected the project  of the Congyu Power Station, which was under full-scale  construction. The first phase of the project will enable the  power plant to generate 600,000 kilowatts of electricity.  There, the leaders expressed gratitude and appreciation to the  cadres and workers who were working hard on the construction  side. The motorcade then moved along the broad new roads,  Maqing Road and Wengjiao Road, and successively visited the  construction site of Xianglu Polyester Fiber Textile Plant,  which would produce 180,000 tonnes of polyester products a year,  the new downtown area of Haicang, the new office building of the  Haicang Management Committee, and the Xinyang Industrial  District. On the construction site of Xianglu, Vice Premier Zhu  talked cordially with the project's responsible people and  inquired about the project's progress and the difficulties they  were facing. Vice Premier Zhu indicated that the state  authorities would, as usual, continue to help Haicang solve  problems in its construction. In the Haicang Management  Committee's office, Vice Premier Zhu listened to the responsible  officials' work reports about the planning for the construction  of the investment zone and the conditions of the construction  projects. He fully affirmed Haicang's changes and developments  and said gladly that, as compared with the conditions in 1992,  Haicang's transformation and development are indeed impressive.    During his inspection tour, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  expressed  important opinions on Haicang's construction and development in  the next stage. In particular, he changed the name of the  "Haicang Taiwan Investment Zone" officially used by the State  Council's 1989 document into the "Haicang Project Investment  Zone." This showed that the Haicang Investment Zone would be  further opened to investors from all parts of the world, and  would welcome investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas  areas, and it would not be simply opened to Taiwan investors.  On the other hand, this indicated certain major and large-scale  projects would be introduced to Haicang.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also instructed that the  construction  of Congyu Power Plant and the coal dock in Congyu be quickened  in order to strengthen the infrastructure facilities, and that  the civil engineering part of the Xianglu polyester project be  carried out intensively, and that the equipment be installed  properly to that it may be put into operation according to  schedule. At the same time, efforts should be continued to  advance the preliminary and preparatory work of other projects,  thus creating a new situation in Haicang's development.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Bangladesh cyclone relief effort delayed by snags RELIEF efforts for the millions of people affected by last week's cyclone in Bangladesh have been hampered by a lack of co-ordination between the civilian government and senior army officials organising the operation. Mrs Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's new prime minister, who has been in office for less than two months, yesterday cancelled a visit to Saudi Arabia because she wants to head the relief effort and avert possible friction with the military . Officials admitted in Dhaka that millions of survivors of the cyclone in the coastal areas are still not getting food, drinking water and medical supplies. It could be several days before the relief operations become fully effective, they said. Small non-governmental organisations whose representatives have reached the affected areas have proved to be more effective than the official machinery. International aid pledges now total about Dollars 400m, but disbursement has not yet started. Some ships carrying food have are standing off Chittagong port, which is only partly operational, and unloading is proving to be a problem. The authorities are considering diverting the ships to another port.</p>

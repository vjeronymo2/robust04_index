			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (3): Cutting costs with gusto / Profile of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua MR Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's new chief of production and purchasing, is the most controversial figure to have made waves in the world automotive parts industry in many years, writes Martin Dickson. A Spaniard from the Basque country, his fame stems from May of last year when General Motors plucked him out of its successful European operations to help the huge task of turning around its loss-making North American automotive operations. Mr Lopez, appointed as GM's head of worldwide parts purchasing, set about the task with such gusto, and using such unusual methods, that he stirred up immense controversy among GM's US supplier base. And he caused no less of a stir in March this year when, following five days of tug-of-war between GM and Volkswagen, he quit the US company for the German one. Since joining Volkswagen, he has announced plans to build a 'laboratory production facility' in Spain which would test new methods of producing a small car in less than 12 hours. Vokswagen and GM have become embroiled in a heated legal dispute over Mr Lopez, with the US company accusing him of taking with him proprietary information which belongs to it. He denies this. Whatever the truth, there is no denying the positive effect Mr Lopez had on GM's cost base during his 10 months in North America. He is estimated to have saved the company well over Dollars 1bn by forcing suppliers to cut their prices. However, his psychological impact on GM may have been even more valuable. Arguably more than any other single individual, he brought home to both GM's employees and outside vendors that the company had finally begun changing its bureaucratic ways, and there could be no backsliding to the old order. He was personally unconventional. He called his staff 'warriors,' encouraged them to eat a diet high in fruit and low in potatoes, and said he would wear his watch on his right arm until GM was back in profit. He lectured suppliers on the supposed 'crisis' facing the US motor industry and sent 'hit squads' of productivity experts into suppliers' factories to advise on improving their performance. All this was designed to force GM into a new, and far less cosy relationship with its US suppliers. Mr Lopez demanded big price cuts from them, of up to 20 per cent or more, but in return promised long term contracts. He had already had plenty of experience in changing supplier/assembler relationships. As head of parts purchasing for GM in Europe, based in Russelsheim, Germany, between 1988 and 1992, he was a key member of the team which turned GM Europe from losses into one of the world's most profitable vehicle businesses. He sharply altered GM's relations with European suppliers, shifting a large quantity of work from high cost German components companies to cheaper manufacturers in other parts of the region. Such a history made him particularly attractive to Volkswagen, which needs to drastically reduce its cost structure. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the Volkswagen management board, said in a recent interview: 'We got to know each other and established we think alike . . .For Lopez and me it is not a question of money. It's about maintaining Europe as a centre for manufacturing industry, to defend it and make it number one in the world again.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN COMPONENT GROUPS       With auto-related sales of at least USDollars 1bn in 1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Group                      Country            Sales (Dollars bn)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Michelin                   France                  12,327 Robert Bosch               Germany                 10,829 Continental                Germany                  5,752 Pirelli                    Italy                    4,542 ZF                         Germany                  4,169 Valeo                      France                   3,966 Magneti Marelli            Italy                    3,392 Thyssen                    Germany                c2,960 GKN                        UK                       2,767 Lucas Automotive           UK                       2,609 BTR                        UK                       2,006 Hella                      Germany                  1,721 Pilkington                 UK                       1,590 Carl Freudenberg           Germany                c1,500 Fichtel und Sachs          Germany                c1,500 T &amp; N                      UK                       1,497 ECIA                       France                   1,496 Siemens Automobiltechnik   Germany                  1,490 Mahle                      Germany                  1,394 SKF                        Sweden                 c1,390 Bertrand Faure             France                   1,290 VDO                        Germany                  1,227 BBA                        UK                       1,218 Teksid                     Italy                    1,108 Saint-Gobain Vitrage       France                 c1,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exchange rates used were those obtained at the end of 1990.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (1).

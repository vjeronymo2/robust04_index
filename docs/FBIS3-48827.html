			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to various informed sources, Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh travelled to Singapore on 27  January. Observers have made different comments on the prince's  trip. They are as follows:    Some say Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh went to  Singapore  for a medical checkup because his overwork had caused him  dizziness and hypertension. But others believe that the  prince's medical treatment in Singapore was a minor issue. What  is important is that he wanted to talk to Singapore leaders in  person about buying ammunition from Singapore, since the island  state is a market place for war materiel.    Observers are watching the move to see whether their  assumption is correct and whether Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh did go to Singapore only for a medical checkup or also  to buy ammunition for the Phnom Penh Government troops, which is  conducting a military campaign in the current 16th dry season.  Some other observers hold that Singapore's intention of selling  ammunition to the Phnom Penh government appears to be improper,  because ASEAN's policy toward Cambodia is to achieve national  reconciliation and peace. This position of ASEAN is  emphatically mentioned in the ASEAN joint communique issued in  January 1993 specifying that ASEAN wants Cambodia to reach  national reconciliation and to regain peace. ASEAN wants to see  the Cambodian problem settled in accordance with the five-point  proposal of King Norodom Sihanouk.</p>

'More bottling lines will be moved here when we finish the first phase of expansion,' said Mr Li Jing, product promotion manager of the Zhengzhou brewery. Under the agreement, MBC will transfer its slack production lines to Zhengzhou, increasing output there to 150,000 tonnes from the present 100,000 tonnes. MBC's contribution will amount to Yuan14.8m. The Zhengzhou brewery will keep its Gold Star brand, but will use Landmark packaging for the additional 50,000 tonnes.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Close fight in three-way contest for TV viewers FOR THE first time in history the British people had a three-way choice of election night coverage on television. After decades of two-way competition, the BBC and ITV were joined by Sky News, Mr Rupert Murdoch's satellite service, and early evidence suggested that Sky would hold its own pretty impressively. For the BBC, anchorman David Dimbleby sat on a railed podium at the centre of a vast command room worthy of Dr Strangelove. With a wave of the hand he called up electronic graphics, an army of reporters, psephologists in the studio . . . and Peter Snow who had been given not only an updated 'Swingometer' to play with, but a video version of Downing Street. At ITV, Peter's cousin, Jon Snow, anchored a programme which looked more downbeat, but proved, as the earliest results came in, to be determined to be first by hook or by crook. While the BBC audience was being told by ace reporter Kate Adie how tremendously fast the bank clerks of Torbay were counting the votes in order to be first in the race to declare, ITV went live to Sunderland and showed their audience the first result before the BBC even mentioned it. More remarkable still, while the BBC cameras continued to show the scene at Torbay, with no declaration being made, ITV flashed the result on the screen. In previous elections the BBC has complained bitterly that ITV announces results before returning officers make their declarations, and here, sure enough, was clear proof. The Sky service was a far more relaxed affair. David Frost chaired a panel with Dennis Healey, Norman Tebbit, and David Owen, all of them now retired from Westminster, but three of the greatest bruisers in studio politics over many years. For the few able to monitor all three programmes simultaneously, the Sky faces made a very tempting alternative to the whizzing around - electronic and geographical - at the BBC and ITV. With the big turnout among the electorate leading to long counts at town halls all over Britain, all three television services dragged and viewers could be forgiven for musing on the uncannily unchanging nature of these affairs in the UK. At one moment the three programmes were showing the faces of Robin Day (ITV), David Dimbleby (BBC) and David Frost (Sky): a trio which would have been perfectly familiar to audiences in the early 1960s.</p>

This is a  precedent-setting step involving much more than a principle.    The PWC has no legal power in Hong Kong. No civil servant  should be summoned before such a body. Nor should he or she be  put in a position where personal loyalty is brought into  question. There are ample channels for communication between  the two governments and between PWC members and civil servants  on an individual basis. It is not as if all the people involved  are total strangers.    That China has chosen this course of action shows several  things: The depth of the divide between Beijing and London,  Beijing's determination to exercise some control over the  territory ahead of 1997 at any cost, and its readiness to  politicise the civil service.    This is not in Hong Kong's interest. It is not just the  civil service that will suffer. The stability of Hong Kong and,  ultimately, the life-style of the people will be sacrificed.  This is not what the return of Hong Kong to China is all about.    It would be nice to believe that we could urge the  administration that a principle is at stake and that giving in  would be suicidal. The harsh reality is that China will be the  next sovereign power and the PWC the most influential body here  long before 1997.    Pragmatism and survival dictates that we come to terms with  this new reality. Either the British make accommodations with  Beijing on political reforms or work out a way for civil  servants to meet formally with the PWC in Hong Kong. The  administration can then keep the initiative while building up  rapport with the PWC. It is in Hong Kong's interests to have a  smooth transition. If Beijing and London cannot come to terms  on political reforms, there is nothing to stop the  administration from doing whatever it can to keep convergence of  the civil service on the tracks.    Just because Beijing wants to be bull-headed does not mean  the administration must follow suit. The reverse would go some  way to dispel the suspicions which have bedevilled Sino-British  relations for so long. At the same time, Hong kong members of  the PWC should explain to China that the continued efficiency,  integrity, and commitment of the civil service is at stake.  Nothing is worth the impairment or destruction of one of the  best bureaucracies in Asia. Especially one that can contribute  so much to China's own future development.</p>

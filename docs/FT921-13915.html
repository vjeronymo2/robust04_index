			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Labour wobbles on National Insurance LABOUR'S commitment to remove the upper threshold for National Insurance contributions - welcomed by many economists but unpopular with voters in marginal London constituencies - appears to have been watered down. It is not clear exactly what Labour will do instead. Currently, you do not pay National Insurance contributions (charged at 9 per cent of income) on income above Pounds 20,700 per year. This means people with income above this level effectively pay a lower rate of tax, than those below it. Labour has been committed for four years to abolishing the upper earnings limit. It has not made any secret of the fact that this would effectively add 9 per cent to the top marginal rate of tax paid by everybody with incomes above Pounds 20,700. The Institute of Fiscal Studies described Labour's proposal as 'a welcome reform to the UK personal tax system'. In a report published yesterday, it showed that 88.2 per cent of families would not lose by this system. But in Greater London 20 per cent of families will lose, and in the rest of the South East 18 per cent. Until this week Labour had not emphasised the fact that this rise in the National Insurance threshold could be phased in gradually. This possibility has now been stressed. Such provisions were in earlier policy documents, but the Conservatives have presented this as a change of policy. Labour said abolition of the limit remained acommitment, adding:  'There are a number of ways in which we could cushion the blow to personal incomes from a sudden increase in the rate of taxation. How we do so is for the Chancellor to decide in his first budget.' If your household income is above the threshold, but not by much, this is good news. It also suggests that it is unwise to change investments in advance of possible tax changes.</p>

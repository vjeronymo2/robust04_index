He branded the present South Korean regime as a fascist,  treacherous regime seeking confrontation.    He said Kim Yong-sam has intensified the suppression of the  people, keeping intact the fascist laws and repressive tools of  the "Sixth Republic" through false reforms, wearing the  "civilian" veil.    "Kim Yong-sam has driven South Korea deeper into the  position  of double domination of U.S. and Japan, totally frozen the  North-South relations and continuously staged the nuclear war  exercises," he noted.</p>

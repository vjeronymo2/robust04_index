			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to enhance cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5). <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission finds, as it did in approving these same pricing procedures for the Long-Term Measures, that the CBOE proposal has been adequately designed to guard against unreliable or manipulated quotas. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The CBOE has been obtaining quotes from Telerate for intra-day pricing of its interest rate options without generating any concern with respect to unreliable or manipulated quotes. In this regard, the proposal merely codifies the Exchange's intra-day pricing procedures currently in effect and which have previously been approved by the SEC for use with all of the Exchange's interest rate options. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Exchange Act Release No. 33106, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Exchange Act Release No. 33106,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26938 (June 15, 1989), 54 FR 26285 (order approving the listing and trading of IRX and LTX option contracts). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the CBOE's reliance on FRBNY spot yield quotes and the backup polling procedure when those quotes are unavailable, the Commission finds as it did in approving the Long-Term Measures, that these procedures are more reliable than the polling procedures currently employed for purposes of determining closing settlement values for the IRX and the LTX option contracts. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the Commission believes it is appropriate to codify these procedures, making them applicable to all of the Exchange's interest rate options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Exchange Act Release No. 33106,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in order to permit the Exchange to begin implementing these procedures with respect to the IRX contracts as soon as possible in order to minimize any investor confusion that could arise from having varying procedures for determining closing settlement values for different interest rate option contracts. Additionally, the Commission notes that no comments were received prior to approval when these procedures were published for comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with respect to the Long-Term Measures. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAXES CREATED BY PROPOSITION 13  </P> <P> Behold the ultimate irrationality.  </P> <P> We own a one-half undivided interest in a 5-unit apartment house in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The L.A. County tax assessor in his wisdom and according to Proposition 13  assessed our half interest at $162,500 and the other half interest at $66,440.  This in 1982 when my wife's father deeded his half interest to my wife for a  "no money consideration," the other half owner being another family member; the  assessor declared that under Prop. 13 he had the "right" to reassess the half  of the property that was transferred even though there was no "sale."  </P> <P> The result: In 1988, owner A paid approximately $870 taxes on her half  ownership; owner B paid approximately $2,030 tax on her half ownership.  </P> <P> How does anyone justify this?  </P> <P> A.B. BRISTOL  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Roberto Maroni by Enrico </F> Fierro and Giampaolo Tucci in Rome; date not given: "`I Have  Put My Slippers On; The Viminale Is Safe in My Hands'"--first  paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] All of a sudden, he starts talking about [Prime  Minister] Berlusconi in the same way in which [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi usually refers to him. It happens almost  immediately, five minutes into the interview, and it comes as a  real surprise. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, the League's  least typical exponent, grasps -- to use a well-worn metaphor --  the sword of Alberto da Giussano [medieval leader of original  Lombard League] and says: "As far as I know, there will be no  election. There is not a single reason for going back to the  polls. Berlusconi, as we are well aware, is toying with the  temptation; he wants to make the most of the wave of elation and  govern by himself.... But Sunday [reference to 19 June League  rally] made it more difficult for him to bring his plan off.  Much more difficult."    [L'UNITA] More difficult? Why?    [Maroni] Because on Sunday, at Pontida, Bossi made things  quite clear. He spoke of a legislative government, and that  obviously puts Berlusconi on the spot. Indeed, the prime  minister is trying to set himself up as the sole guardian of the  principle of governability. Bossi has decided that this will  continue no longer. The League wants to govern. No traps, no  subterfuges: Bossi's speech was an unambiguous declaration of  intent.    [L'UNITA] And the independentist soul? What do League  members who see Berlusconi as [former Prime Minister] Bettino  Craxi's old buddy have to say about it?    [Maroni] On Sunday, the League formally acknowledged its two  tendencies, and for those of us who are in government, that  takes a load off our minds. At the beginning, my job was a dual  one: working with our government ally and, at the same time,  keeping my eye on him. Not any more. Others will take over the  monitoring role now. To put it plainly, we have shared the  workload between us, between the two tendencies.    [L'UNITA] The two tendencies, sure. Are they not a figment  of the imagination? The only way to avoid being absorbed,  politically speaking, by Forza Italia?    [Maroni] They are not a political fantasy. The League's  "proletarian" soul does exist, and it is a force to be reckoned  with. It is a phenomenon that I noticed two years ago. Part of  the League's grass roots criticized our entry into local  government. It wanted to be in opposition: against the old  system and in support of federalism. That is the source of the  difficulties encountered by the administrations that we lead.  There were some League city councilors, in Varese, who stopped  calling me by my first name when I became a councilor with  departmental responsibility.    [L'UNITA] Let us get back to Berlusconi. His plan can be  easily summed up: new electoral laws, back to the polls, Forza  Italia wipes the board, devouring the League and, to some  extent, National Alliance. One gets the feeling that Berlusconi  has his mind on the operation that [former Prime Minister] De  Gasperi pulled off after the war: Dumping his more cumbersome  allies and recycling the old governing classes.    [Maroni] You sound just like Bossi.... I believe that  Berlusconi is toying with this idea, because he wants to govern  on his own. Governing as such is more important to him than the  mode of government. But, after the Pontida rally, it is not so  easy for him to say that the majority is not united, the League  is unreliable, and we must go back to the polls. Bossi has said  in no uncertain terms that the guiding principle of  governability is what guides us too. In this respect, we can  even outshine the image of Forza Italia: It strikes me, indeed,  that governability is its sole guiding principle, and we do not  intend to hand over exclusive rights to that. That gives  Berlusconi the jitters, of course.    [L'UNITA] On the subject of the electoral law. Berlusconi  would like a one-round, uninominal system along British lines.  Bossi does not seem to agree. What about you?    [Maroni] A single round. That is the League's official  position, and has been for a long time now. We want to do away  with the relics of proportional representation still surviving  in the electoral system.    [L'UNITA] Do you not run the risk of extinction that way?    [Maroni] We would run the same risk with a two-round system.  If we went to the polls today, how many of the League's  candidates would get through to the second ballot?    [L'UNITA] Not many.    [Maroni] Quite. But apart from these considerations, be they  selfish or matters of principle, I think that the government  should have no say in the electoral rules. It is a matter for  parliament. So neither the prime minister nor I....    [L'UNITA] Point taken. In recent times, you seem to have  been the League member most susceptible to Berlusconi's charms.  The most malleable, in other words.    [Maroni] If we are talking about soccer, yes: I would like  to play in the forthcoming cupwinners' cup final, at least for  five minutes. But otherwise, no. My bond with Bossi is born of  a longstanding friendship, not political calculation. If I  continue in politics, it will be in the League. There are no  alternatives for me. My political career began in the League  and will end in the League.    [L'UNITA] When he was a deputy, Roberto Maroni had it in for  the [Interior] Ministry, he depicted skeletons in the Viminale's  [Interio Ministry] closets, he criticized [Police Chief] Parisi,  the secret services, you name it.... But not any more. Quite  the contrary: He praises Parisi and defends Salazar, the head  of the secret service. Were you naive before or are you smart  now? Is the Viminale swallowing you whole?    [Maroni] If the pair of you were appointed to the Fiat  board, what would you do? Would you revolutionize the whole top  management? Would you start shouting that they are all corrupt  or accomplices to corruption? For Fiat it would mean paralysis,  bankruptcy. I do not want to bring the Interior Ministry to a  standstill, I do not want total paralysis. It is not in my  interest to halt police action against the Mafia. That is what  is behind my "soft" approach. I have given myself six month's  breathing space. In those six months, I will try to understand  the people and see how the offices work. For the time being  there will be no changes, but in October or November there will  be. I arrived here with a reputation for being a revolutionary:  I have had to put my slippers on to prevent the structure  falling apart.    [L'UNITA] Was it you who saved Salazar after the allegations  of political espionage made by [former President] Cossiga?    [Maroni] I saved no one, because no one asked me for  Salazar's head.    [L'UNITA] You have publicly praised the chief of police;  [cabinet spokesman] Giuliano Ferrara has criticized him heavily.  A government split on Parisi?    [Maroni] Ferrara demanded Parisi's head after the jail break  by [crime boss] Felice Maniero. The chief of police had nothing  whatsoever to do with it. On the contrary, he had issued a  warning about the break.    [L'UNITA] Ferrara's demand did not seem to be dictated  solely  by Maniero's escape. His tone revealed a marked political  dislike of the chief of police.    [Maroni] If that is the case, Ferrara played his hand badly,  as he forced me to defend Parisi publicly, and now Parisi is in  a stronger position than before.    [L'UNITA] Stronger or impregnable?    [Maroni] No one's position is impregnable, not even the  minister's. We shall see in six months. I defend no one as a  matter of course. I will cover nobody.    [L'UNITA] Let us talk about the Mafia. The majority is  sending out ambiguous signals: daily attacks on the front-line  magistrates, fierce criticism of the turncoats. To take two  examples, Tiziana Maiolo, who chairs the Justice Committee at  Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies], casting doubt on the  measures prescribing special jail conditions for the bosses, and  Berlusconi's lawyer, [Defense Minister] Cesare Previti, accusing  [former Parliamentary Antimafia Committee chief] Violante,  Public Prosecutor Caselli, and Provincial Police Chief De  Gennaro, in an interview granted on 1 April, of hatching some  sort of communist plot.    [Maroni] I should first like to make one thing clear:  Nobody, inside or outside the government, can force me to do  things against my will. If the line that I adopt in combating  the Mafia were not endorsed, if it were contested, I would  leave, I would resign.    [L'UNITA] We were talking about the many ugly signs....    [Maroni] I would ask everyone -- members of the government,  the majority, and the opposition parties -- to let this debate  on jail conditions and Mafia turncoats drop. The rules on  turncoats are off limits, and so are jail conditions for Mafia  bosses. We are looking into ways of enhancing these measures,  not watering them down. Be that as it may, certain discussions  and statements by individuals must not be allowed to give the  Mafia grounds for hope that the government intends to treat it  kindly. That is why I call for greater caution on all sides.    [L'UNITA] Caution? Previti attacked no less a person than De  Gennaro, head of the DIA [Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate],  the body directly engaged in fighting the Mafia....    [Maroni] I have met De Gennaro. He is a very capable man.  It is true that he, too, has to cope with contradictions, but  they are objective, physiological contradictions faced by the  DIA due to the fact that it is a new structure. De Gennaro is  doing a good job. I can break the news that he will be promoted  at the next cabinet meeting. Yes, a promotion, because he is  doing a good job.    [L'UNITA] In recent months, the papers have carried the news  that a turncoat is talking about Berlusconi and his right-hand  man, [Publitalia CEO] Marcello Dell'Utri. The latter is said --  by the turncoat -- to have had links with the Cosa Nostra bosses  in the past. That is a serious allegation: Is it not an  embarrassment to you, as interior minister in this government?    [Maroni] I have discussed the matter with Berlusconi. He has  assured me that neither he nor Dell'Utri have ever had links  with the Mafia.    [L'UNITA] And you trust him?    [Maroni] How could I remain in his government otherwise? How  could I shake his hand? I await the conclusion of the matter  with equanimity. I must emphasize, of course, that no charges  have been made. Berlusconi has no problems with the law.    [L'UNITA] Anti-Mafia Attorney Siclari fears more massacres.    [Maroni] I have no particular information on that score.  There are no specific reports. I hold Siclari in high esteem,  and I believe him. His reasoning is convincing: The harder the  government fights the Mafia, the higher the risk of attacks will  be. I do not underrate that risk.    [L'UNITA] Let us turn to another issue: the introduction of  an antitrust bill. Bossi has said he would be prepared to join  forces with the opposition parties. Do you agree with him?    [Maroni] We in the League have our principles, and one of  those is to combat monopolies, all monopolies. That is why we  are prepared to fight alongside anyone, inside or outside the  majority, who takes up the cudgels on this issue.    [L'UNITA] Europe is closing the doors on immigrants.    [Maroni] I will take no steps to have the European Union  resolution adopted. Parliament will decide. Anyway, the  principles set out in the resolution are the same as those  embodied in the Martelli law. The fact of the matter is that  this law has never been fully implemented.    [L'UNITA] One last question: The Ustica disaster  [unresolved air crash in early 1980's]. You said something very  surprising on the Maurizio Costanzo Show [TV talk show]. To all  intents and purposes, you said that we would never get at the  truth.    [Maroni] Before I arrived at the Viminale, I thought that  the  secret services were hiding the famous top secret file stating:  "The aircraft crashed for the following reasons, the following  people were responsible." But it is not true, that file does  not exist, although that does not necessarily mean that it has  never existed. In my opinion, a lot of papers disappeared  between 1980 and 1990, 10 years.... There is someone in Italy  who knows the truth. The problem is that this someone cannot be  forced to talk. No examining magistrate can penetrate his  conscience and his memory. If I knew who it was, I would do  everything within my power to get him to talk.... The United  States and France have certainly not helped the investigators.  I wholeheartedly support Judge Priore's formal requests to the  judicial authorities there, but I am pessimistic. We still do  not even know what caused the crash: a bomb, a missile....    [L'UNITA] What impression have you formed: Was it a bomb or  a missile?    [Maroni] In my view, the plane was hit by a missile. That is  an impression I have formed in the light of the information I  have received and the documents I have read. The bomb theory  may be useful to those who want to prevent the truth from  getting out. Perhaps not for ever. Perhaps only until the truth  will no longer have a negative impact on international relations.</p>

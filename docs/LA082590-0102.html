			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS COPES AS HIGHER FUEL COSTS AFFECT MANY FIRMS  </P> <P> The impact of soaring crude oil prices has begun to flow to a wide variety of  businesses, ranging from Marina Del Rey roofers to Pittsburgh glass and paint  makers.  </P> <P> In many cases, manufacturing and service companies have not yet raised prices  but are poised to do so if energy costs remain at current levels -- still above  $30 a barrel -- or climb even higher as a result of the turmoil in the Mideast.  Other businesses -- faced with stiff competition -- have changed their  operations to cut energy use in hopes of avoiding hiking prices.  </P> <P> Companies that use petrochemicals to make a wide range of consumer and  industrial products have been stung by oil price rises. For example, Dow  Chemical Co., based in Midland, Mich., uses large amounts of ethane and propane  to make plastics. "When the price of oil rises, so does the price of ethane and  propane," said company spokesman Gordon Butte.  </P> <P> Dow has raised the price it charges for one plastic -- polyethylene, used in  packaging materials or grocery sacks -- by 5 cents a pound, or about 10%. Butte  said Dow normally raises polyethylene prices only 1 or 2 cents per pound when  its costs increase.  </P> <P> "If oil prices stay at a high level, it will have a dramatic effect on  manufacturing costs and . . . you're probably going to see prices going up,"  Butte said.  </P> <P> At Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries, makers of paint and glass products, the  cost of some oil-based solvents has risen, said spokesman John Ruch. The  company has also seen a rise in the cost of transporting its products, but PPG  has not yet been forced to raise prices, Ruch said.  </P> <P> "It's really too early for us to define the effects of the (new) costs," he  said.  </P> <P> Tire makers also have watched rising fuel prices with concern. "Our raw  materials are going up, and if things keep going up, we will definitely be  raising prices," said Hank Ruppel of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., which uses  petrochemicals to make synthetic rubber for its tires.  </P> <P> Southern California roofers are feeling the strain of rising prices for  oil-based tar and asphalt roofing materials. Mike Jones of United Roofing in  Los Angeles said his company has had to raise prices 7% and will honor the  prices in its estimates for only two weeks instead of the normal two months.  </P> <P> "It's just a daily thing," Jones said of rising prices for roofing materials.  "Now suppliers are not telling me what (the price increase) is going to be.  They just raise it."  </P> <P> Roofer Al Ayala in Marina Del Rey faces the prospect of raising prices when he  restocks supplies. "The supplies are OK this month," said Ayala, who purchased  his current inventory of materials before prices began rising two weeks ago.  But "the next time I load up on material, I will probably have to raise my  prices 10%. We couldn't eat that increase."  </P> <P> Airlines, trucking companies, railroads and steamship lines have also raised  prices to help cover higher fuel costs.  </P> <P> Steamship lines have been hardest hit, as a doubling in the price of fuel oil  has wiped out any profit for August. "I talked to one executive who said it  cost $1 million to fuel his ships during the first two weeks of August. That is  a huge number," said Ron Gottshall, executive director of the Transpacific  Westbound Rate Agreement, a price-setting body whose members include the  largest steamship lines.  </P> <P> The transpacific shippers, including Oakland-based American President Lines,  have announced a 10% fuel surcharge effective Sept. 7 to help compensate for  the rapid increase in costs.  </P> <P> The railroads and the trucking firms also have announced fuel surcharges  ranging from 1.5% to 4% of their rates to cover a 50% jump in the cost of  diesel fuel.  </P> <P> Air cargo firms also have raised prices to cover spiraling jet fuel costs,  which have risen 20 cents a gallon since the end of July for some air carriers.  Burlington Air Express of Irvine raised its rates by 6 cents a pound, and  United Airlines will add a 5.3% surcharge on domestic freight beginning Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Some firms have changed operations to cut costs rather than raise prices in the  face of competition.  </P> <P> Dispatchers for Airport Flyer Express, an L.A. airport shuttle service, have  tried to make sure the company's 25 vans run fully loaded to deal with a  10-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline. Said manager Dave Manfull: "If (fuel costs)  continued to go up this way, we obviously will have to increase our prices or  place a surcharge. That would be the last resort."  </P> <P> Many businesses have become more energy-efficient over the years and are better  prepared to weather high fuel prices. During the 1973-74 oil embargo, for  example, attendance at Disney World and Disneyland declined nearly 6.5%,  according to Jessica Reif, an entertainment industry analyst.  </P> <P> Now, Walt Disney Co. more heavily promotes its theme parks to local residents,  said a Disneyland spokesman. Disneyland also uses vehicles powered by natural  gas.  </P> <P> Similarly, petroleum costs have declined for many record companies because  compact discs require fewer oil-based products than vinyl LPs, according to Jim  Frische, president of Digital Audio Disc Corp. of Terre Haute, Ind., a Sony  Corp. unit that is the nation's largest producer of compact discs.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Denise Gellene, Anne Michaud, Jube Shiver Jr. and George  White contributed to this story.  </P></p>

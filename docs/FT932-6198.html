			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Policy choices facing chancellor MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday said that Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment signified no change in economic policy, but to what extent will the new chancellor's hands be tied? The first pointers will come as the finance bill implementing the measures Mr Norman Lamont announced in his March Budget completes its passage through parliament. There certainly appears to be little prospect of a U-turn on the controversial imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, much as Labour may bay for one. If he wanted to change Mr Lamont's VAT plans before the finance bill is enacted, Mr Clarke would hand Labour the chance to force two high-profile and potentially damaging Commons debates on the subject. When MPs debated the proposals this month two Tories staged an embarrassing rebellion and the government scraped home by 10 votes. But there are a number of reasons why Mr Clarke may not regard his predecessor's legacy as absolutely sacrosanct. These could give him a powerful incentive to try to persuade his cabinet colleagues to back his judgment. First, it would be unreasonable to expect the new chancellor to be as attached to every detail of the March package as was its author, his predecessor. He might be prepared to tolerate, for example, some fine-tuning of Mr Lamont's proposed reform of the North Sea tax regime - especially if he was convinced it would not cost the exchequer money. Second, there would be few surer ways of stamping his authority on his new portfolio for a politician who is not averse to dramatic gestures. Third - and perhaps most persuasively - some of Mr Lamont's proposals are not covered by the finance bill and could be altered without headline-grabbing and potentially risky parliamentary debates. Into this category falls the planned 1 percentage-point increase in employees' national insurance contribution rates, which is aimed at raising Pounds 1.8bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 2.2bn the following year. The legislation enshrining this will not reach parliament until November at the earliest. Mr Clarke could modify the proposal at any time with a simple announcement. Similarly, Mr Lamont's plans to widen the 20 per cent band of income tax are not fully incorporated into the current finance bill. The committee of MPs considering the bill is due to debate widening the band by Pounds 500 to the first Pounds 2,500 of taxable income the week after next. But Mr Lamont's proposal to extend it further to the Pounds 3,000 level is not included in the bill. Mr Clarke could send out an early signal of his intention to get to grips with the public sector borrowing requirement by announcing the second phase of this extension had been scrapped. This would save the Treasury an estimated Pounds 320m next year and Pounds 450m the year after that.</p>

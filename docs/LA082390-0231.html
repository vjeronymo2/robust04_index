			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARMENIA STARTS DOWN ROAD TO FREEDOM;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE SMALL BORDER REPUBLIC BECOMES THE FIFTH TO DECLARE A BID FOR  INDEPENDENCE.  </P> <P> The republic of Armenia passed a declaration of independence today and Estonia  began formal negotiations with Kremlin officials on separation, bringing the  Soviet Union closer to fragmentation.  </P> <P> Armenia, a republic of 3.3 million people on the border with Turkey and Iran,  is the fifth of the 15 Soviet republics to move toward complete independence  from Moscow.  </P> <P> However, its path may be complicated by the bloody two-year conflict with  neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.  </P> <P> The declaration calls for creation of Armenia's own armed forces to safeguard  the border, which this week was again the scene of violent conflict with  Azerbaijanis. The declaration also calls for Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely  Armenian area of Azerbaijan, to become part of Armenia.  </P> <P> The Armenian resolution "declares the beginning of the process of establishing  independent statehood," according to an English translation sent to the  Associated Press.  </P> <P> Armenian legislator Samvel Shakhmuradyan said he expects the republic to remain  part of the Soviet Union only during an undefined transitional period to  complete separation.  </P> <P> Armenia's decision increases pressure on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is  struggling to develop a new union treaty attractive enough to keep his nation  whole. However, Gorbachev seems to be bowing to Baltic demands for complete  independence.  </P> <P> Kremlin officials began formal negotiations with the Baltic republic of Estonia  today, the 51st anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet pact that led to Soviet  annexation of the Baltic states. The two other Baltics, Latvia and Lithuania,  are expected to begin independence negotiations with Soviet representatives  soon.  </P> <P> In addition to the Baltics and Armenia, Georgia has also declared independence  and wants to hold independence negotiations with the Kremlin.  </P> <P> Armenia's Parliament rejected a radical proposal to declare independence  effective immediately, as well as a Communist Party proposal to be "independent  but remain in the Soviet Union," said Raffi Hovannisian, an Armenian-American  who watched the debate.  </P> <P> The resolution was approved by a vote of 183 to 2, Shakhmuradyan said in a  telephone interview from Yerevan, the capital of the small republic. The  resolution invalidates the Soviet Constitution on Armenian territory and says  that only the Armenian Constitution is in effect, Shakhmuradyan said.  </P> <P> It demands a share of the Soviet national wealth including gold, diamonds and  foreign currency reserves. It calls for the creation of Armenia's own currency,  banking system and customs duties.  </P></p>

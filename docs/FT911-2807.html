			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Food: Mussels with pulling power - A dish to nourish on chilly spring days I USED to catch an occasional but lurid glimpse of the news as told in papers other than the Financial Times. My source was the fishmonger. Mussels were sold by the pint then. Dripping with seaweed, heavily barnacled, they were measured in metal scoops and the shovelfuls were wrapped in layers of newspaper to mop up the wetness as you carried them home. Back in my kitchen I tipped the molluscs into the sink and left them to soak and feed on the handful of oatmeal I gave them, rather as though they were goldfish in a tank. Then I settled down to review the soggy Page Three statistics and the amazing feats at the vicarage as revealed to Our Special Reporter, salacious titbits that added to the savour of feasting on mussels. A decade before that I used to buy mussels in a Mediterranean cove from local boys I saw with knives in their teeth swimming out to the banks where mollusc colonies flourished and where rocks were hedgehog-thick with sea urchins. They brought the seafood back, drippingly fresh, in string bags fashioned from old fishing nets, and we ate it for lunch within the hour, with only a squeeze of lemon. The waters there were wonderfully limpid and terrible tales about pollution had not been told then. I dare say it is a different story today. Now the mussels I buy are often farmed rather than wild. No longer swathed in seaweed or barnacle encrusted, they are thin shelled and graded by size. Now they are sold by the pound or in kilo bags made of perforated polythene. Less romantic, less exciting, but the mussels are still very much alive alive-o. The deliciousness and the extraordinary good value remain and there is less work for the cook. It doesn't take long to bath and barber mussels now. No massive scrubbing is necessary, no lengthy de-bearding session, and some say that the flesh of farmed mussels is plumper, sweeter and more succulent than wild. The recipe which follows is a cross between a soup and a stew, a first and main course rolled into one, my favourite sort of food for informal entertaining. Mussels need to be cooked just before eating but all the preparatory work can be done ahead. The cooking of the mussels is swift, then you can sit down, relax and enjoy the meal with the rest of the party. This is food to eat out of doors if you can or in the halfway house of a conservatory where you can feel the warmth of an April sun but be spared the bite of the wind. Serve the stew steaming hot and hand round a bowl of aioli (a mildly rather than extravagantly garlicky version is best with this dish I think) so that dollops of it can be stirred into the stew to enrich it to individual taste. Have a loaf of good bread on hand, bottles of crisp chilled wine, finger bowls and napkins big enough to use as bibs. A salad and cheese is as much as anyone will want to eat afterwards. MUSSEL, FENNEL AND POTATO STEW (serves 4-6) 5 lb mussels; 3 bulbs of Florentine fennel; 1 1/4 lb waxy potatoes; 1 onion; 1 1/2 pt fish stock; 2 long curls of thinly pared orange peel; 1 teaspoon lightly toasted and bruised fennel seeds; a good pinch of saffron; 1 bay leaf; 2-3 tablespoons chopped parsley; a little olive oil; a glass of dry white wine (or very dry cider or apple juice); a splash of Pernod (optional). Trim the fennel reserving all the feathery fronds. Put the trimmings into a stockpot. Add the orange peel, fennel seeds, bay leaf and stock. Simmer for about 30 minutes. Strain and fast-boil until reduced to a scant  3/4 pt richly flavoured liquid - remember that the potatoes will mute the flavour later. Chop the onion and soften it in a little oil in a stewpan. Cut a half of one of the fennel bulbs into fine dice and reserve these little pieces with the feathery fronds. Cut the remaining fennel into wedges or chunks. Turn up the heat under the stewpan. Sear the fennel briefly, remove and reserve it separately. Draw the stewpan away from the heat. Clean the potatoes, peel them if you like, and cut into chunks. Add them to the stewpan, stirring to coat with oil and so prevent discolouration. Cover and set aside. Clean the mussels in several changes of cold salted water, scrubbing barnacles and tugging away beards as necessary. Discard any mussels that have damaged shells or that continue to gape when firmly tapped. Choose a large shallow pan in which to cook the mussels - if the mussels are thinly spread over the source of heat they will have a better chance of cooking and opening in unison. Pour the wine into it. (Everything up to this stage can be done well ahead.) Shortly before you want to serve the stew, stir the saffron into the stewpan. Pour on the stock (and the Pernod if using it) and bring quickly to the boil. Cover and simmer for about 5 minutes. Add the wedges of fennel and cook for a few minutes more until the vegetables are cooked through. While the vegetables are cooking, bring the wine to the boil. Add the mussels, cover and cook over high heat, shaking the pan now and again, until the molluscs open. Discard any mussels that remain obstinately closed after cooking. Transfer the rest complete with their wide-mouthed shells to a warmed soup tureen, adding the cooked vegetables and the chopped fennel and parsley between layers. Strain the mussel cooking liquor through damp buttermuslin into the stewpan. Bring the combined liquids to simmering point, check and adjust seasoning. Pour the steaming fragrant liquid over the stew and serve.</p>

Bilateral talks  between senior officials in Brussels on February 2 left both  sides talking of a "friendly" atmosphere which had brought the  Europeans and Americans closer together on issues including  policy on Russia, trade with Japan and on the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade. The U.S. Under Secretary for Economic and  Agricultural Affairs, Joan Spero, said after the talks that she  hoped for gentler exchanges on EU/US trade in audiovisual  products, one of the hotly-contested elements in the recent GATT  Round of trade talks. "We would like to find a way to have a  somewhat quieter dialogue," she said, a line which the  Commission later welcomed.    Officials also agreed to set up an "early warning system" to  identify and deal with bilateral disputes, nearly a year after  the idea was first floated, and discussed the "new generation of  sectors" within GATT, notably the environment, the possibility  of a social clause in trade rules and competition issues. The  European side also sought and received reassurances from the  U.S. officials that the EU would be kept informed of the ongoing  U.S./Japan trade negotiations. Finally, Under Secretary Spero  announced that U.S. and EU scientists were to organise contacts  on possible cooperation in work on information technology.  Other possible areas singled out for EU/U.S. cooperation  include mobile satellite phones, pesticides and environmental  questions related to packaging waste.</p>

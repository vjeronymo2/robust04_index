			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eighteen comments were received during the public comment period. Most of the comments concerned the proposed closure of the Oculina Bank habitat area of particular concern (HAPC) to fishing for species in the snapper-grouper management unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Five commercial fishermen opposed the closure of the HAPC to fishing for snapper-grouper species. They stated that the closure would reduce income to fishermen and reduce the supply of locally caught fish to wholesale and retail dealers. They also stated that the closure of the HAPC to bottom fishing could result in a shift of fishing effort to adjacent areas and result in overfishing of species in the open areas. They concluded that the action would result in a negative economic impact for the Fort Pierce area, which is adjacent to the HAPC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, the Council and NMFS agree that some fishing income could be lost and a reduction may occur in the flow of locally caught fish to commercial channels. Also, some fishing effort may shift to open areas. A minor negative economic impact on local communities may occur. Fishermen may target other species within the HAPC and fish in other nearby areas; however, quantitative data do not exist to estimate these potential impacts. The HAPC is not a major fishing area for snapper-grouper species and commercial landings from that area have never been sufficient to supply local demand. The closure will not create a shortage of seafood in the Fort Pierce area. Some fishing effort may shift to open areas; however, there are sufficient management measures in place and under development to regulate any additional fishing effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presently, 13 species in the snapper-grouper fishery management unit are overfished and 14 others, with similar life history characteristics, are thought to be overfished. The Council is concerned that traditional fishery management measures, such as minimum size limits and quotas, may not be sufficient to protect fully the snapper-grouper resource. The Council considered establishing marine reserves in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states but deferred action after considering public opposition and lack of information on benefits derived from marine reserves. This HAPC closure is a management experiment to determine the consequences of establishing a marine reserve. This measure will ``sunset'' after 10 years if not reauthorized by the Council. NMFS is to report to the Council on the effectiveness of the closure as soon as data are available, but no later than the end of 2000. The HAPC area was selected because it is relatively small compared to the total area that may be fished, will have a relatively small impact on fishermen, is already familiar to the industry, and is already subject to certain fishing restrictions under regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and the FMP (see 50 CFR parts 638 and 646). The Council believes, and NMFS agrees, that the benefits derived from this management experiment will exceed the temporary costs to some fishermen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Five recreational fishermen and two sports fishing clubs opposed closure of the HAPC because it may result in reduced catches. They claimed that recreational anglers might not come to the Fort Pierce area to fish, which would be detrimental to the local economy. Also, they stated that fishing effort would shift to open areas and result in overfishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Council and NMFS agree that some reductions in catch may occur and some anglers may switch to other fishing grounds within and outside of the Fort Pierce area. Resulting impacts on the local economy are uncertain, but are not expected to be significant. Since anglers can still target pelagic species such as mackerels, billfish, and sharks in the HAPC and surrounding areas, the impacts on overall catch rates should not be major. No significant net change in domestic economic activity will result if anglers switch to other fishing grounds located in U.S. waters. The majority of recreational anglers do not possess vessels of sufficient size to fish the HAPC. As stated earlier, the Council and NMFS agree that there may be some temporary, relatively minor negative impacts. In this context, if fish become abundant in the HAPC as expected, some will move into adjacent open areas where they will be available to fishermen. Also, total recruitment may be increased, which would result in higher catches in open areas due to the increased abundance of spawners in the HAPC. The Council believes, and NMFS agrees, that the benefits derived from this management experiment will exceed the temporary costs to some fishermen. If this experiment does not produce desired benefits, the fishing restrictions will be reconsidered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Deputy Executive Director of the Council commented that the proposed rule does not prohibit anchoring in the HAPC, contrary to Amendment 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment 6 includes a prohibition on anchoring in the HAPC as an aid to enforcement of the prohibition on fishing in the HAPC for snapper-grouper species. Under the Magnuson Act, the scope of these regulations may not extend to a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  anchoring prohibition in the HAPC, or to non-fishing vessels. The Council did not intend to prohibit fishing in the HAPC for fish other than snapper-grouper species. Accordingly, a prohibition on the combination of fishing and anchoring in the HAPC more effectively meets the intent of the Council. NMFS is not aware of any fishing that would be conducted while anchored in the HAPC other than fishing for snapper-grouper species. Accordingly, the proposed rule and this final rule establish a rebuttable presumption that fishing while anchored in the HAPC constitutes fishing for snapper-grouper species, which is prohibited. Further, snapper-grouper species taken in the HAPC may not be retained. Thus, a vessel fishing in the HAPC, whether or not anchored, may not possess snapper-grouper species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

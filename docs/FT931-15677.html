			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / US court rejects Mozer plea deal US government prosecutors said yesterday they would proceed with a formal indictment against Mr Paul Mozer, the former head bond trader at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street brokerage house, on charges relating to allegations that he submitted false customer bids in auctions of government securities. The decision to pursue the indictment follows yesterday's rejection by a New York judge of a plea agreement drawn up by Mr Mozer's lawyers and federal prosecutors. Mr Mozer was due to plead guilty yesterday morning to two felony counts of making false statements to government authorities about fake bids he submitted at a February 1991 auction of Treasury securities. A last-minute hitch over the wording of a document filed by the US attorneys along with the plea agreement, however, brought the proceedings to a halt. Mr Stanley Arkin, Mr Mozer's lawyer, argued that language used in the document, which outlined the background to the case, had not been part of the plea agreement and could be interpreted as a more serious charge of mail or wire fraud. Mr Mozer's lawyers were especially worried that if they accepted the contents of the document they would be putting themselves at a disadvantage in a number of private civil suits. When Mr Mozer's lawyers and the prosecutors were unable to come up with a new agreement yesterday, Judge Robert Patterson ruled that there were still too many issues outstanding for him to accept the plea bargain. One of those issues was the question of whether Mr Mozer could still face an indictment on criminal anti-trust violations. Unless the two sides can reach a new agreement the judge's decision means that Mr Mozer will have to defend himself against criminal charges while also facing several private civil cases, as well as a broader civil suit filed last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleges Mr Mozer submitted false bids in seven Treasury auctions, and that he violated record-keeping regulations, committed fraud, and indulged in insider-trading.</p>

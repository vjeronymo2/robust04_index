			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar fades The dollar wilted on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the US treasury market responded negatively to US employment data, writes Philip Gawith. Although the market's initial response was positive, it soon changed its mind and the dollar followed Treasury bonds lower, slipping three pfennigs from a high for the day of DM1.5840 to DM1.5540 later. Against the yen, it fell from a high of Y100.2 to a low later of Y99.05. The D-Mark's firmness against the dollar helped it to end sharply higher against various European currencies. A late afternoon flurry saw it finish at L1,009 against the lira from L1,002. Sterling also suffered at the hands of the firmer D-Mark, losing nearly three pfennigs from its high for the day to close in London at DM2.4101. The sterling trade weighted index closed at 78.8, down from a high of 79.4 earlier in the day. At first glance, the payroll figures looked to be supportive for the dollar. The 179,000 increase was well below the 234,000 consensus forecast, and this should have supported US bonds, and hence the dollar. The market, however, chose to focus on the strong manufacturing data, where jobs, hours worked and overtime were all seen as indicating wage pressure. The dollar's woes were later exacerbated by the Columbia University inflation index - said to be closely watched by Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan - rising to 111.4 in August, from 109.5 in July. On top of this, there was talk in the market of an upcoming article in Forbes magazine quoting the head of business research at Columbia saying that US inflation would rise to 5 per cent later this year. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London cautioned against reading too much into the dollar's behaviour. He said it was the Friday before a long weekend, and trading conditions were thin. 'The end-users are not here. They are still on vacation. They haven't done anything.' He said the market was still being driven by short-term players. 'This is the thinnest August market in a number of years and small flows are having a quite disproportionate impact,' said Mr Chertkow. Mr Michel Sapin, a Bank of France monetary council member and former finance minister, criticised French commercial banks for raising interest rates by 25 basis points earlier this week. 'This decision is not apparently distinguished by a concern for the wider public interest. Indeed, it does not take into account the continuous and significant lowering of official Bank of France rates in the last six months,' he told Le Point weekly. The weakness of the treasury market spilled over into European bond markets, which set the tone for activity at the short end of the yield curve. The December Euromark contract traded nearly 48,000 lots to close at 94.79 from 94.84. Short sterling volumes were low and the December contract ended at 93.40 from 93.43. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 35m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 27m liquidity, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 250m shortage.</p>

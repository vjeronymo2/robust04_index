			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Vedeneyev: "To Whom Is the Public Servant </F> Subject?: The Struggle for Control of Officials of the  Bureaucracy Continues"]    [Text] One of the marks of the past year was the tense  struggle for the right to direct the large guild of Russian  bureaucrats. It should be specified immediately, though, that  their numbers are not, for that matter, as great as it would  seem to many of our compatriots plagued by arbitrary  administrative rule. Thus the number of employees of the organs  of state and municipal administration in our country is  comparable with the number of their colleagues in France,  although our population is about three times larger.    But the urgent need for the speediest formation of the  institution of a modern civil service in Russia has not lowered  the intensity of the political passions which have flared up in  this connection. The key proposals of a working group on reform  of the civil service which had been formed in the Office of the  President of the Russian Federation and which believe that it is  the latter who should be at the head of the hierarchy of Russian  officialdom in all branches of power were blocked back in the  spring on the pretext of the possible opposition of the Supreme  Soviet of the Russian Federation.    Instead of an edict on the establishment of a system of  public service itself and the creation under the president of  the Russian Federation of a body to administer it, there  appeared an edict on priority measures for a reform of the civil  service (which, strictly speaking, simply did not exist),  according to which merely a consultative body--the Council for  Personnel Policy--was formed under the president. One further  edict creating an organ of administration of public service  under the auspices of the government was prepared secretly in  parallel in the machinery of the government and with the direct  participation of the State Legal Administration (the draft edict  with official signatures was found during a search in the office  of V. Romanyukha, a senior official of the government  bureaucracy).    Attempts were made once again at the start of November to  remove from the jurisdiction of the president questions of  leadership of the civil service and to convert the government  bureaucracy into the organ of administration of public service  (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 10 November). Directive N732-rp of  the president of the Russian Federation on the formation of a  working group to draw up a draft Statute on the Federal Civil  Service of the Russian Federation issued shortly after this (and  thanks, possibly, to the prompt intervention of NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA) was, seemingly, to have tightened the control of the  actual head of state over the process of formation of a modern  civil service in Russia.    But the supporters of the utmost strengthening of the  positions of the government--even if thanks to the competent  authority of the president--still made one further attempt a  month later, more successful this time, to seize the initiative  in the solution of this key question of our constitutional  development. A tactical calculation on the inevitable law-making  commotion on the eve of publication of the Constitution was made  here.    On 23 December the president was hastily presented for  signature--before the text of the new Constitution of the  Russian Federation had been published--a draft edict on  confirmation of the Statute on Federal Public Service.    The draft represented a hurriedly reworked version of this  edict which had been prepared in secret in October-November in  the government bureaucracy with the support of the State Legal  Administration. That the Office of the President did not know  about this edict follows, for example, from a remark of Mr.  Filatov, who considered the adoption of a public service act a  matter for the very near future (see ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA for 23  December).    Given the multitude of provisions which have been referred  back and which require the elaboration of additional legal  enactments (this is precisely the task set in Edict No. 2267 of  the President of the Russian Federation), it will take a long  time for this document to become "passable" through an exacting  representative body. So the adoption of the act any time soon is  out of the question.    On the pretext of the lack of resolution of the question of  the organ of administration of public service this fundamental  issue was omitted from the text of the Statute on Federal Public  Service proposed for confirmation, although it was this matter  which could alone have justified the hasty signing of the  corresponding edict prior to the Constitution having taken  effect.    In the current situation a provision referring leadership of  the institution of a civil service functioning in all branches  of power to the jurisdiction of the president, as head of state  and top official standing above all branches of power, will have  to pass through the State Duma. There is no certainty here that  the country's new legislative body will airily agree to such  powers being reserved to the president. The present statute  reduces them to the right to confer the class rank of "actual  privy councillor."    The extension of the executive's control to an institution  which should in principle encompass all branches of power would  signify a violation of the principle of the separation of powers  and the government's impermissible interference in the sphere of  competence of the head of state.    The objective need for a strengthening of his role  determines  also the logic of the constitutional process in present-day  Russia. Under the conditions of the immature political structure  of society and undeveloped parliamentarianism, with most general  notions of what kind of judiciary we should have, with the  absence of harmony in the government, and without any experience  of work in its possible coalition composition, alternative  institutions of power based on traditional, rational-legal, or  charismatic authority (primarily the institution of the  presidency) remain the few guarantors of the preservation of  statehood in the difficult period of the implementation of  profound socioeconomic reforms.    It would be strange were the president to forgo the  prerogative, natural for his status, of leadership of the  federal civil service of the Russian Federation, agreeing to be  merely an actor in the ritual dramatizations of conferment of a  class rank, presentation of credentials, distribution of  decorations, and so forth. It will become clear in the very near  future whether the president retains this most important  instrument of realization of his competent authority or entrusts  it to someone else or whether someone who is most farsighted  avails himself of it.    Who?</p>

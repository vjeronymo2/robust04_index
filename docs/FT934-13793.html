			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Banking on efficiency formula Sir, I would ask your readers to join me in a little game. Next time you are waiting in a bank queue, work out the bank's Service Score (SS). This is calculated by applying the following formula: CP/CA x CW = SS, where CP=number of possible cashiers (ie, number of windows), CA=actual number of cashiers working, CW=number of customers waiting in the queue. I would like to start the competition with NatWest Liverpool Fruit Exchange. At 11.20 on October 15 it scored: CP=5, CA=2, CW=13, giving a value to SS of 32.5. This will take some beating, but I am confident that the banks will rise to the challenge. Perhaps the banking ombudsman could be prevailed upon to donate a small prize.

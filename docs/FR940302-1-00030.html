The rule did not affect the requirement to have an operable transponder in a TCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that requires aircraft to have Mode C equipment when operating below 10,000 feet MSL within 30 nautical miles of any designated TCA primary airport, except for those aircraft not originally certified with an engine driven electrical system or which have not subsequently been certified with such a system installed (53 FR 23356). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 14, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirements for conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule: (a) Established a single-class TCA; (b) requires the pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilot certificate, except for a student pilot who has received certain documented training; and (c) eliminated the helicopter exception from the minimum navigational equipment requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 17, 1991, the FAA published a final rule on airspace reclassification (56 FR 65655).

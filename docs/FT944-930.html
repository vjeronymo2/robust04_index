			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Ukraine secures Dollars 500m loan The World Bank yesterday approved a Dollars 500m loan to support the transition to a market economy in Ukraine. The aid, for essential imports, came after the former Soviet republic committed itself to free more prices, revive mass privatisation, and reform the ailing agriculture and energy sectors. The bank's decision follows the International Monetary Fund's endorsement of President Leonid Kuchma's economic reform efforts with a Dollars 371m loan in October. Talks on a Dollars 1.5bn stand-by loan continue next month, with disbursement possible as early as February, Ukrainian and aid officials said. While the quick disbursements reflect an effort to help Mr Kuchma overcome Ukraine's economic crisis, aid officials remain concerned about implementation. Under the IMF deal, Ukraine agreed to pay for energy imports but the failure to cover Turkmen gas imports this quarter sparked a row within the government. A top energy official last week was sacked by Mr Kuchma, who promised to pay Turkmenistan after the funds earmarked for imports were diverted. Under the bank loan, the largest amount of western assistance so far, Ukraine committed itself to sell 8,000 medium and large enterprises and 90 per cent of small enterprises. A voucher scheme will be used at pilot auctions, scheduled for February 1, which allows Ukraine to get around parliament's moratorium on cash privatisation. These steps face resistance from Ukraine's conservative ministries and parliament. To gain more control over the reform process Mr Kuchma proposed centralising authority with the president. The law was debated in parliament yesterday. Mr Kuchma told deputies: 'Without radical political changes, radical economic reforms are impossible. If the parliament cannot agree to this, I will have to ask the people directly, through a referendum.'</p>

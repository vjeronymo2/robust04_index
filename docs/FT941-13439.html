			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Bonn agrees Telekom and post sell-off The way has been cleared for the privatisation of Germany's telecoms and postal services after the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior party in the Bonn coalition, abandoned demands that the postal monopoly should be broken up for the sale. The privatisation bill for Deutsche Telekom, the national telecoms operator, the German postal services and the Postbank, now has the formal backing of all German parties, including the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). The SPD votes are needed for the bill to pass through parliament. A first reading is scheduled for next week. The Free Democrats had earlier insisted that the privatisation bill should specify when the monopolies of the postal services and of the telephone infrastructure would end. However, the bill will specify that Deutsche Telekom will lose its monopoly only on telephone voice services on January 1, 1998, to comply with a European Union decision to liberalise voice telephony by this date. There will be no other reference to the status of the monopolies in the bill. The SPD has fiercely opposed the break-up of the loss-making postal services mainly because of worries about job losses. The FDP, however, had argued that competition should be introduced across the sector, implying the stripping out of some of the profitable areas such as freight. The government is hoping the bill will be adopted by the summer so that the law could come into force at the beginning of 1995. This would in turn allow Deutsche Telekom to raise much-needed cash for investment and to reduce its DM100bn (Pounds 38bn) debt by selling a first tranche of shares in 1996. However, the liberals and the dominant Christian Democrats (CDU) seem to have reached an informal agreement for the partial liberalisation of the postal monopoly at a later date. Mr Rainer Funke, state secretary in the justice ministry and liberal MP responsible for the privatisation bill, said that Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post and telecoms minister, could decide independently to liberalise postal services other than regular mail. A letter by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Quelle, Germany's largest mail-order company, promising that the post monopoly will be broken, has already sent shock waves through the German post agency. A committee of independent experts is now studying the feasibility of introducing competition in the postal services for packages, express mail and other services other than regular letters. The German postal service has warned that such a move would result in a yearly loss of DM3.4bn. But sources in the post ministry say the post would only lose DM500m.</p>

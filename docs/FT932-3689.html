			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions PERPETUAL has proved itself capable of producing consistently above-average performance from its fund management business and its shares have reflected this success. They have outperformed the market by almost 280 per cent over the past year, so it is hardly surprising that directors see this as an opportunity to take profits. Robert Yerbury has sold 20,000 at 470p, leaving him with just 53,000. By far the largest shareholder on the board is chairman Martyn Arbib, with more than 18.5m. Shares in Yorkshire Chemicals appear to have regained institutional favour after dropping as low as 250p last September. Philip Lowe, the chairman and managing director, has sold 100,000 at 385p, reducing his holding to 74,000. The company completed a 1-for-5 rights issue in March, raising around Pounds 24m. International Food Machinery came to the market last December and has performed well. Announcing results for 1992, the board indicated that first-quarter performance was satisfactory and that it was confident about the rest of the year. Managing director John Holroyd and Sean Kelly have sold 80,000 and 50,000 shares respectively at 68p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        No of Company                    Sector   Shares   Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Berry Birch &amp; Noble        InsB     39,377      67        2 Burmah Castrol             O&amp;G     145,128   1,019        1* Claremont Garments         Text     50,000     172        1 Cowie (T)                  Motr    410,000     882        2* Dencora                    Prop     50,000      70        1 F&amp;C Pacific Wts            InTr     10,000      20        1 Hall Engineering           EngG      9,500      21        1 Intl Food Machinery        BuSe    130,000      88        2 Leeds Group                Text     15,000      72        1 Perpetual                  OthF     40,000     189        2 Tibbett &amp; Brittan          Tran     50,000     375        1 Unilever                   FdMa      4,972      51        1* Vosper Thorneycroft        EngG      2,310      13        1 Watmoughs                  Med       5,000      34        1 Willis Corroon             InsB     10,000      19        1 World of Leather           Stor    600,000     360        2 Yorkshire Chemicals        Chem    100,000     385        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Amicable Sm Enterpr        InTr     10,000      10        1 Bluebird Toys              Misc      6,000      14        1 Britannic Assurance        InsL      1,000      15        1 Fairway Group              Misc     30,000      21        1 Hammerson Prop A NV        Prop     22,000      75        1 Laird Group                Motr      6,000      17        1 Mercury Asset Man          OthF      7,888      41        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

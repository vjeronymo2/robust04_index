			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Divide and rule: Businessmen lean towards Beijing, but the people favour Patten I've heard of people's capitalism, but this is ridiculous. On February 25 the Hong Kong government postponed publication of Chris Patten's political reform bill, for the third time. Next day, the Hang Seng index shot up by 148.11 points. The delay in gazetting it, according to a commentator in the pro-Beijing newspaper Wen Wei Po, 'caused great excitement among investors. This showed that Hong Kong people wish to see Mr Patten's reform package abandoned. . . .' It is a strange, looking-glass world. One of the two reforms that Beijing most strenuously objects to is the proposal to widen the franchise of the 'functional constituencies', which are to elect half the members of Hong Kong's next Legislative Council (LegCo). Until now, many of these have been capitalist rotten boroughs. In the business and industrial constituencies, for instance, votes are cast not by individuals but by companies. Mr Patten proposes to give the vote to individual company directors. And in nine new constituencies, corresponding to broad sectors of economic activity, he proposes that every worker should have a vote. You might think this would appeal to communists: a measure to take some power away from bosses, and give it to workers. But communist China is no longer like that. It has reached the last chapter of Orwell's Animal Farm, in which the animals looked from man to pig, and pig to man, and could no longer see the difference. China's official slogans talk of the 'socialist market economy', but there is little trace of socialism in the frantic capitalist development that is now going on in China, unless it is the fact that the local capitalist employer often combines the functions of mayor and party secretary. All that is left of communism is the authoritarian political structure. Not surprisingly, then, it is Hong Kong's business community that is vociferously ranged against Mr Patten, while opinion polls suggest that the majority of the colony's population is still behind him. The business community is acutely aware of the extent to which the colony's economy is now bound up with that of the mainland. It is Hong Kong's unique position as the privileged channel, both for Chinese exports and for foreign investment in China, that is at the root of its extraordinary prosperity. Chinese sovereignty holds few terrors for people who move millions of dollars in and out of China every day. What does terrify them is the thought that Mr Patten, by his quixotic last-minute effort to introduce democracy - in a territory that has hitherto done very nicely without it, thank you - may provoke Beijing into measures that will interfere with business. Yet 'democracy' is a very grand word for what Mr Patten is trying to do, and it is not one he himself uses. Even if his proposals were to be enacted without amendment, only 20 out of 60 LegCo members in 1995 would be elected in a normal, democratic way - that is, by universal suffrage in residential constituencies. Twenty-one would be chosen by the old functional rotten boroughs, made slightly less rotten by a gentle broadening of the franchise. Nine would come from the new functional constituencies with mass electorates of working people, who thereby gain representation through their profession (an idea once associated with Italian fascism); and the remaining 10 would be elected indirectly, by an 'election committee' itself composed of elected officials, drawn mainly from the local district boards to be elected next year. China's rulers themselves are committed to introduce full democracy by stages after their takeover in 1997. But obviously, once in charge, they reckon to be able to control the process and keep out those leaders or parties they find obnoxious. What worries them about even partial democratisation under British rule is the fear that in 1997 they will find themselves confronted with a LegCo dominated by their opponents. They have not recovered from the shock of June 1989, when a million people in Hong Kong demonstrated in support of the students in Tiananmen square, and a good deal of Hong Kong money found its way to dissident organisations on the mainland. Worse still, the same people who organized the demonstrations went on to win 14 out of the 18 directly elected seats in LegCo in 1991. That is still only 14 out of 60 members altogether. At present, they are still easily outnumbered by the combined strength of the governor's appointees and the representatives of conservative business interests. Beijing's fear is that a broader franchise in 1995 might give them the majority. It is probably groundless. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the main liberal group, the United Democrats, believes his near-landslide victory in 1991 reflected partly an expression of revulsion against the Tiananmen massacre, then still fresh in everyone's memory, and partly his opponents' lack of organisation. Neither factor is likely to be repeated in 1995. In any case, Mr Patten does not expect to get his package through unamended. Either it will be modified in talks with Beijing - in which case he will have the embarrassing task of forcing it through LegCo with business support, against the protests of the liberals - or the conservative majority in LegCo will themselves amend it in a way calculated to appease Beijing. But he is determined to preserve a legislature with a degree of independence, which he sees as the best safeguard for Hong Kong's freedom after 1997. And he still hopes to persuade Beijing that it has to accept Mr Lee and his friends as part of the reality of Hong Kong - unpalatable, perhaps, but not unamenable, unless Beijing itself insists on making martyrs of them.</p>

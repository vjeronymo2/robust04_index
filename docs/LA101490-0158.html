			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> RED SOX SEASON WAS A SUCCESS DESPITE BEING SWEPT BY THE A'S  </P> <P> The Boston Red Sox never quite seem to get it right, do they? The embarrassment  of Roger Clemens' second-inning ejection. Being swept by the A's their past two  American League Championship Series appearances. The haunting specter of 10  consecutive losses in postseason play, beginning with Game 6 of the 1986 World  Series.  </P> <P> Against baseball's best team, the Sox were rendered lifeless. They scored one  run in each game. They made several key mental mistakes afield. Their starting  pitching was good, but was quickly made irrelevant -- the bullpen was pathetic.  Their only superstar, Clemens, is so full of himself that he is threatening to  become a destabilizing force, as he was in Game 4 when he didn't have the sense  to keep his profane mouth shut. However abrupt his actions might have seemed,  plate umpire Terry Cooney reminded the Red Sox of something they seem to have  forgotten: There are some rules by which even Roger Clemens must abide.  </P> <P> You had to feel sorry for the A's. In the 1989 ALCS, their victory was marred  by Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston's accusation that Dennis Eckersley was  doctoring the ball. When they finally concluded their 1989 World Series sweep  of the Giants, it had been rendered trivial and anticlimactic by the  earthquake. Then came the eruption of Mount Clemens.  </P> <P> But when you clear away the debris from the A's assault, the Red Sox had a  great season. For a team that lacked speed and home run hitting, a team that  was virtually holding tryouts for its rotation, the season -- however it ended  -- was a resounding success. Mike Boddicker saying it wouldn't be unless the  Sox made the World Series doesn't make it so.  </P> <P> Boddicker was 17-8, but he is a free agent who may have pitched his final game  for the Sox. Like Nick Esasky a year ago, Boddicker says he hasn't made up his  mind if he will stay or go. Like Esasky, word is he is leaning toward going.  </P> <P> Boddicker is supposedly miffed at some of the organization's petty ways. Who  isn't? Boddicker is a bit of a complainer by nature. Big money could make him  happy enough to stay as the reliable No. 2 starter. After losing Bruce Hurst,  maybe the Red Sox have learned something.  </P> <P> But what about Clemens? He throws like Nolan Ryan but his increasingly bizarre  actions are beginning to evoke comparisons to Elvis and Howard Hughes. On the  mound -- except for Game 4 -- Clemens is usually in control. Off it, he seems  increasingly out of control. It's no accident a placard above his Fenway  dressing stall says "Possessed Rebel."  </P> <P> Clemens is a fantastic pitcher. He also is a bully, and frequently a jerk. That  is part of his persona, part of what helps make him as good as he is.  </P> <P> Clemens' penchant for secrecy about his shoulder problems and conditioning  habits, his reluctance to be interviewed or to clearly explain himself to Red  Sox officials, that he seems to expect everyone in the Sox' orbit to live by  Roger's Rules Of Order -- and the rules often change -- has turned him into the  team's Mystery Man. When a team's Main Man becomes its Mystery Man, that has an  unsettling, and harmful, long-term influence.  </P> <P> This is not to say the Red Sox should force Clemens to conform. No way. But it  seems as if they need to try to find some way to rein him in. Otherwise, fire  Joe Morgan and make Clemens player-manager.  </P> <P> Reining in Clemens, however, may prove to be impossible. Clemens is entering  his option year, and the Sox' No. 1 priority is making him happy with an  astronomical multiyear contract. Knowing that, doesn't it strike you as a  trifle odd that, despite an aching shoulder and no new contract, Clemens  jeopardized his career in September by coming back to pitch?  </P> <P> Randy Henricks, Clemens' representative, is one tough agent. But he can't  control his client any more than anyone else can. Clemens wanted to pitch. He  pitched. Case closed.  </P> <P> While it is far too early to predict the success of the 1991 Red Sox, they  should get a lot of help from the farm. Slugger Mo Vaughn seems ready to make  the jump, as do pitchers Dave Owen and Kevin Morton. If Tim Naehring can get  over his back injury, the Red Sox might be less of a surprise if they again win  the AL East.  </P> <P> And what of Tom Brunansky? Like Boddicker, he is in his option year. Unlike  Boddicker, he has been a disappointment. Acquired May 4 in exchange for Lee  Smith, Brunansky, 30, was expected to be this season's Esasky. Hindered -- who  knows how much? -- by a slow-healing shoulder injury suffered on one of his  many outfield dives -- Brunansky hit only 15 home runs, five in the Blue Jays  series two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The Red Sox expect more from a right-handed power hitter, and their  disappointment may stall negotiations. The loss figures to be theirs, not  Brunansky's. In this market, there always will be some loon eager to meet his  price.  </P> <P> There also is a price for being a Red Sox fan. But despite the Oakland wipeout,  this season was worth the price. The Red Sox achieved more than anybody could  have expected, and if they didn't exactly cover themselves with postseason  glory, at least they got there. That's more than 22 of baseball's 26 teams can  say.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Washington blocks increase in capital for IFC THE US has blocked agreement over an increase in the Dollars 1.3bn capital of the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, Stephen Fidler and Peter Norman write. The setback came in the Development Committee of finance ministers from industrialised and third world countries, which gives guidance on development issues to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The US was alone on the 24-strong panel in refusing to agree the increase, but it has a blocking vote. The US blocked the capital rise because it wants more done to increase the involvement of the World Bank itself in the private sector. It has suggested that 50 per cent of the lending of the World Bank group, including the IFC, should be directed towards the private sector by 1995. If enough is done by the World Bank to this end, the US has suggested an increase of Dollars 750m should be discussed. The US is clearly looking for a greater response to its requests for more private-sector involvement than the measures so far outlined by the bank. Mr Barber Conable, World Bank president, expressed disappointment over the delay. 'We'd like to move ahead as fast as possible,' he said. The committee achieved more progress on other issues. In dealing with the problems of the poorest and most heavily indebted developing nations, it set a deadline of mid-1991 for the Paris Club of creditor nations to review existing options for debt relief and produce proposals for additional debt relief measures. Britain has been pressing for acceptance of proposals known as the Trinidad terms, which would result in a two-thirds write-off of the stock of official debt owed by such countries and more generous repayment conditions, in the hope of achieving agreement on this issue at the London economic summit in July. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the committee chairman and finance minister of Chile, said after the meeting that developing country members felt concern because of the slower economic growth in the industrial countries and the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The presidential office  on Monday fiercely denied Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong's  remarks a day earlier that the government may withdraw its  demand for inter-Korean dialogue before Pyongyang can talk with  Washington. "There is no change in the government's stance that  an exchange of inter-Korean special envoys is a condition for  the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks," said  presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. "What Vice Foreign Minister  Hong said is his own private opinion," he noted.    Chu tried to smooth the waters, claiming that Hong had  spoken  on condition that what he said was his personal viewpoint. But  the rumblings about Hong were not pretty, especially since the  controversy over Amb. Hwang Pyong-tae's bungling last week has  yet to die out. Hwang, the ambassador to Beijing, irked the  presidential team when he made it sound as if South  Korean-Chinese cooperation would replace the traditional South  Korean-Japanese-U.S. channel in handling the North Korean  nuclear crisis.    A presidential aide lashed out at Hong, saying he was  concerned that the vice foreign minister's remarks might be  erroneously taken as the government's new North Korea strategy.  He also slammed recent leaks by responsible policy-makers of the  government's negotiating tactics. "It appeared as if diplomacy  and the national security policies were in confusion, more so  because they made public the negotiating cards," this aide said.  Taking a jab at the Foreign Ministry, he said it should be  excluded in formulating the government's North Korea policy.</p>

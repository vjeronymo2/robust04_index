			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: America's blurred borders - Brazil is sharply divided between rich and poor and has surprising similarities to society in the US Flying from the US to Brazil last week, I expected a complete contrast: from north to south, First World to Third World, wealth to poverty, Anglo-Saxon protestantism to Latin catholicism. But one should always beware such simple categories. In Brazil, what did I find? First, I arrived in a city, Sao Paulo, which has 2m more inhabitants than Los Angeles and is at least comparable in the area it covers and the size of its buildings. Whenever you think you are getting near the edge of it, another clutch of skyscrapers appears on the horizon. Much of Sao Paulo seems pure First World to the casual visitor. The streets and flyovers are thronged, or often choked, with Fiats, Volkswagens and other 'European' cars (all made in Brazil, one soon learns). There are bank headquarters in clusters of blue glass towers. There are areas for pedestrians spaghetti junctions, leafy residential quarters. The metro (underground) is clean, modern and fast - suffering only from a lack of maps inside the carriages. For two and a half days, I listened to bankers, management consultants, bond brokers, academics and the state governor, all discoursing on inflation accounting, the difficulties of the recession, the chances of the government's economic strategy succeeding, and the origins and nature of the foreign capital now flowing into the country. They discussed the signs of a change in Brazilian mentality as privatisation even of sacred cows like Petrobras (the state oil company) is widely debated, imports of goods and capital are welcomed, and the successes of other Latin American countries - Mexico, Chile, Argentina - are increasingly publicised and envied. Of course, I knew that this was not the whole story. Although beggars in the street are not much more numerous in downtown Sao Paulo than in London, the favelas or cardboard cities of Sao Paulo are far more extensive. About 1m people live in these shanty towns which are dotted all over the city, though often crammed inconspicuously into narrow strips, underneath a flyover or beside a railway track, constantly invaded by noise, fumes and other forms of pollution. Another 3.5m live in corticos (crowded, multiple occupancy buildings). On the third afternoon, I got Father Patrick Clarke, an Irish Catholic priest who has worked for 15 years in the city, to take me to the favela of Vila Prudente. It is a surprisingly cheerful place, probably because it is one of the older favelas (dating from 1978). The 8,000-10,000 inhabitants have at least had time to convert their shacks into rudimentary houses, and to develop some institutions of their own, such as a creche and a handicraft centre. It reminded me of Palestinian refugee camps where, with a minimum of help and leadership from outside, the inhabitants have usually constructed some sort of township, with its own economy and society. And, of course, these Brazilians are also refugees, in a sense: refugees from the abject poverty of the rural north-east which makes even their present way of life seem privileged. At least here they are not starving. The alleyways and schoolrooms are full of children, who infect you with their cheerfulness until you remember that for many of them the future holds little prospect other than drugs and crime. Families are large, but have decreased over the last few years. It is now common for women to have their fallopian tubes tied after the third or fourth child, whereas in the past families of 15 were not unusual. Although this operation is still officially illegal, it is sometimes performed by doctors without the knowledge or consent of the woman herself. More often, though, it is the fruit of a conscious decision on the woman's part, as the old rural logic of having more children as an insurance for your old age is replaced by the new, urban one of not having more than you can cram into your tiny home, or feed from your pitifully low income. This explains why the latest census reveals Brazil's population to be 'only' 145m (still more than 10 times what it was in 1900) instead of the expected 150m, and why the annual rate of increase has fallen to 2 per cent. That is still a very daunting figure, but should make it easier for President Fernando Collor de Mellor to confront the issue at next month's UN summit on environment and development ('Eco92'), which he is to chair. Unprecedentedly for a Brazilian politician, he wrote in a newspaper article last week that he intended to give the population issue priority, and would himself take the initiative in raising it at the summit. The Catholic church, much blamed by First World social theorists for its hostility to birth control, does not seem to be actively opposing this change of attitude among the urban poor. And in any case, it is not the only or perhaps even the main conduit for their religious feelings. Father Patrick sees his role as more political than religious in the traditional sense. He quotes Dom Helder Camara, the much revered (and reviled) archbishop of Recife in the north-east - 'if I give bread to the poor they call me a saint; if I ask why they have no bread they call me a communist' - and says that his role is to help people ask and find answers to that second question. He is also full of praise for Sao Paulo's socialist mayor, Mrs Luiza Erundina, who has helped favela dwellers to set up housing co-operatives and move into proper homes - 'an achievement any municipality should be proud of yet scarcely mentioned in the mainstream Brazilian media.' 'That spire,' says Father Patrick sadly, pointing at a church some half mile from the favela, 'is very far from these people, culturally and economically'. By contrast, the new pentecostalist protestant churches proselytise actively in the favelas, preaching a fundamentalist gospel without political overtones, and winning a substantial following. Perhaps Brazil is not so different from the US after all. Per capita gross national product is not everything. Both countries are settler-colonial states which expanded to occupy the lion's share of their respective continents. Both have federal presidential constitutions which give great prestige to the head of state but rather little power, whether to push legislation through congress or to control the expenditure of states and municipalities. Both are wrestling, partly for that reason, with intractable public sector deficits - although the inflationary consequences in Brazil are much more drastic, and the recession much deeper. Both have very high income disparities between rich and poor, and an urban underclass increasingly given to violence, mainly against itself, but enough to make the rich flee into their own fortified suburban ghettos. Both feel ambivalent about celebrating the fifth centenary of 1492, because they contain remnants of indigenous peoples for whom that date marks the beginning of centuries of expropriation and genocide. One important difference seems to be that Brazil, after 50 years of sheltering behind protective barriers, is now opening to the outside world, whereas the US, after 50 years of confident world leadership, shows increasing signs of insecurity and xenophobia. But then the US is plagued by a trade deficit, while Brazil is running a handsome trade surplus.</p>

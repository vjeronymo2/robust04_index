			<p>BFN     [Text] Koenigswinter (DPA) -- The Dalai Lama has  encouraged the FRG to take over responsibility in international  politics. He hopes that, as a result of its special historical  development, Germany will play an important role in establishing  world peace, the secular and spiritual head of Tibet said in  Koenigswinter near Bonn on Saturday [30 April].    The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India for 35  years,  pointed to the "particularly friendly relations" between Germany  and China. However, this should not lead to a strong tolerance  toward the Chinese Government. Germany has the opportunity to  influence Chinese policy. The 58-year-old man stressed that  awareness of the special situation in his homeland is widespread  among the German public.    The Nobel Peace Prize laureate affirmed his path of  nonviolence. "I am, on principle, against the use of weapons."  This is also the basis of the support granted to the Tibetan  people by the world public. The Dalai Lama is paying a  three-day visit to Germany on the invitation of the  Friedrich-Naumann Foundation, which is affiliated with the Free  Democratic Party of Germany.</p>

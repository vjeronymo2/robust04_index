			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Senior ministers combine fire on competition: Tories in Plymouth launch blunt attacks - Alternative leaders discussed Leading government figures launched blunt attacks on Labour and the Liberal Democrats yesterday as the Conservative party kicked off its campaign for the local and European elections. In a series of speeches at the Conservative Central Council in Plymouth, cabinet ministers gave detailed appraisals of the policies being carried out by their departments. However, most of their effort was concentrated on attacking the opposition parties, with as much time spent deriding the Liberal Democrats as the main opposition. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, promised delegates that the party was fully committed to fighting both election campaigns, and had organised 'the biggest series of ministerial tours outside a general election'. But, amid several swipes at the Labour leadership, Sir Norman underlined the impression given in recent days that Tory party managers see the Liberal Democrats as the biggest threat. 'In May and June, we must take the attack to the Liberals,' he said. 'They have had a free ride for too long.' Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, made a detailed attack on Labour's economic policies, arguing that its commitment to a statutory minimum wage and full employment was 'socialist nonsense'. He added: 'If the trade unions want to end their years of decline, they must sever their links with this sort of dogma. They must get back to the workplace, selling their services to their members.' Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, emphasised that his tough stance on punishing and preventing crime would not be undermined by recent reverses in the House of Lords. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, hinted that reductions in his department's Pounds 80bn expenditure on welfare benefits were still essential if the government was to get a firm grip on public expenditure. However, he underlined that there was no question of ministers making any changes to the universal state pension. 'We Conservatives won't means-test your pension,' Mr Lilley said. 'We have no intention of punishing the prudent, and the basic pension is a platform people can build on.' Speaking in Bath, the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, said Liberal Democrat proposals for a carbon tax along with value added tax on domestic fuel at 5 per cent would cost the average household Pounds 160 a year. He said the effect on the less well-off would be proportionately greater. Mr Clarke added that Liberal Democrat proposals to raise income tax, to limit the personal allowance and to increase National Insurance contributions for the self-employed added up to a 'devastating tax demand'. Accusing the Liberal Democrats of saying one thing and doing another, Mr Clarke said the party was 'as usual . . . trying to have it both ways'. The chancellor added that while claiming to be 'green' with Friends of the Earth, the Liberal Democrats simultaneously condemned VAT on fuel as a 'death tax' even though they had once advocated it.</p>

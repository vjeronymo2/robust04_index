			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Worldwide interest in rail leases Eighty organisations in the fields of banking, leasing and railway equipment manufacture have shown an interest in the three rolling stock leasing companies set up under rail privatisation, Hambros Bank said. Hambros, the government's adviser on the sale of the rolling stock companies, said that it had approached more than 300 companies in Europe, north America and the Far East to see if they wanted to acquire a stake in the rolling stock companies. Eighty had attended or had asked to attend a detailed presentation. Under the government's plans for the privatisation of British Rail ownership of BR's 11,000 locomotives and carriages has been transferred to three companies which will lease them to the train operators. The leasing companies will be responsible for maintaining rolling stock and they are also expected to order new equipment on behalf of the train operators. Prospective bidders will be expected to pre-qualify in February and March. The first round of bids will be invited in the summer. Hambros expects to ask for final bids in late summer or early autumn, with the sales to be completed by the end of next year. Hambros believes it has devised a method of calculating the value of existing rolling stock which will allow it to be leased at acceptable rates. South West Trains, however, has calculated that leasing new rolling stock would cost Pounds 250,000 more a year than using existing stock - a sum which it could not recover by charging higher fares.</p>

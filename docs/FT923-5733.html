			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Letter: Over-shadowed Sir, Observer (August 24) errs in stating that, in 1991, the Daily Mirror regained the number one circulation spot among national newspapers. The Sun overtook the Mirror in 1978 and has remained ahead ever since. The Sun has a circulation of 3,567,863, some 700,000 more than the Mirror, according to Audit Bureau of Circulation figures for February to July this year. If Observer was referring to the combined sales figure of the Daily Mirror and the Daily Record in Scotland, this should have been pointed out to your readers. John East, circulation director, News International Newspapers, PO Box 481, Virginia Street, London E1 9BD</p>

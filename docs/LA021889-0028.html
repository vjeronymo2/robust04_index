			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAIN OLD OSCAR  </P> <P> In his Feb. 16 article on the Academy Award nominations, Michael Cieply writes  that "no film has ever won the best-picture Oscar without its director  receiving a nomination."  </P> <P> In fact, it has happened twice. In 1928, the first year of the award's  existence, "Wings" won best picture without an accompanying best-director  nomination, and four years later "Grand Hotel" won best picture without getting  a single nomination in any other category.  </P> <P> JOHN BRECKENRIDGE  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

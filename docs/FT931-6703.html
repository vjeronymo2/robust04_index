			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Fashion: Breaking the secret dress code - The foibles and follies of fashion etiquette THE STORY is claimed by most of London's great hotels but the maitre'd of the Dorchester's grill room swears he was there. It was a busy evening late in the 1960s and a glamorous couple approached the restaurant to claim their table. He was dressed impeccably in a dark suit with well-pressed trousers. So was she. Unfortunately, the prevailing dress code stipulated that trousers were not acceptable attire for women. Politely, the maitre'd pointed this out. She argued. After all, her Yves Saint Laurent tunic-topped trouser suit was then the hottest thing in fashion. He insisted. Her escort began to look anxious, so the lady turned her back, unzipped her pants, stepped out of them and turned back, now apparently wearing a mini dress. The maitre'd gulped, then grinned and showed them to their table. He even checked her trousers into the cloakroom. A skirt, it seems, is a skirt even if it merely skims the welt of your tights. Or is it? At around the same time, model Jean Shrimpton discovered that the stewards at Flemington racecourse in Melbourne did not think so. Even today, very short skirts are barred at the Henley rowing regatta. And there are still some places where women cannot wear trousers, including the royal enclosure during even the chilliest, windiest Ascot week. Dress codes often appear irrational, the tool of an old guard fighting a rearguard action against the forces of progress, modernity, good sense and egalitarianism. The new, American-owned Regent Hotel on Marylebone Road has launched itself with a wordy, full-page advertisement which makes just that assumption. 'Several hotels in London,' it declares, under a photograph of a tail-coated concierge, 'are about a hundred years old. Trouble is, their staff behave roughly the same age.' It announces that, at the Regent, you can wear what you like. The London Evening Standard took up the challenge with a semi-luminous turquoise, black and orange shell suit. It was met with faultless charm and total acceptance. The reporter felt like an eyesore, though. And that, according to Lucinda Buxton, press officer for London's famous Savoy hotel - an establishment in the forefront of the 'proud to be stuffy' movement - is partly what dress codes are all about. 'If you know you are dressed right, it gives you confidence,' she says. 'It enables you to respond to the glamour of your surroundings - surroundings which a large number of people have worked very hard to make perfect.' There are, of course, two sides to that coin. Those who know the rules and adhere to them feel secure. Those who do not are excluded, sometimes quite peremptorily. All rules about clothing are designed to be exclusive. Once, when the social pecking order was of greater importance than it is now, they were enshrined in the law of the land. The sumptuary laws made certain that no ambitious member of the merchant or professional classes could deck themselves out in the fabrics, furs and coronets reserved for the aristocracy, so deceiving the unwary as to their station in life. Formal academic dress still contains remnants of this status system but most dress codes are informal, implicit and subtle - and enforced just as rigorously. Watch any group of teenagers milling around on the pavement outside a popular club and you will see the pariah space isolating the ones who do not look right. Behold the doorkeeper's eyes as they slide over the non-conforming outsiders as if the space they occupy was empty. The decision on what is appropriate wear tends to be a consensus one formed by the particular group. Those who flout that consensus are, quite rightly, perceived as subversive and escorted to the exit (or, in the commonest case, to the gentlemen's cloakroom where they will be offered a choice of polyester ties and old-fashioned dacron jackets). 'Women nowadays,' says Buxton, 'can get away with almost anything. Except maybe jeans or a shell suit. The strictest rules apply to men.' In most of London's 'stuffy' hotels - the Savoy, Claridges, the Dorchester or the Ritz  -a tie is required only in the evening and in the restaurant, but a jacket is a must at all times except in the upper corridors. And yet, it can often be a matter of discretion, as all the arbiters of dress codes concede eventually. If one of those utterly chic Milanese men approached the restaurant wearing an Armani jacket, well-pressed jeans, Gucci shoes and a tie-less soft white silk shirt buttoned to the neck, no one would dream of thrusting a soup-stained polyester tie at him. Dress codes do give way before stylishness, fashion, wit and confidence. In 1965, the Savoy turned trouser-clad pop guru Cathy McGowan away hungry. But, in 1967, it reversed its policy and allowed Lady Whitmore, the Swedish-born wife of racing driver Sir John Whitmore, to eat her dinner unharassed and betrousered. After her, the deluge. Wit and style does not always work, though. One of the Savoy grill's dearest memories is of the time the mime artist, Marcel Marceau, arrived on the threshold without a tie. On being told he could go no further, he mimed tying a Windsor knot in front of an imaginary mirror. The seated diners applauded rapturously. Marceau was, nevertheless, escorted to the gentlemen's cloakroom to choose his tie.</p>

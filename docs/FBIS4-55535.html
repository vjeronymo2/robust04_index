			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 16 (TANJUG) -- NATO planes are  ignoring earlier warnings and continue provoking and violating  the Yugoslav air space, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic said in a letter to the U.N. secretary general. A  NATO reconaissance plane and a bomber violated the Yugoslav air  space on April 24 in the region of the Perucanlake, western part  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while similar incidents  have become an increasing practice, Jovanovic said in the letter  which was published as an official U.N. document on Monday.  Jovanovic also warned that NATO aircraft frequently break the  sound barrier over the rural regions of the Bosnian Serb  republic (RS) in order to frighten the local population.    According to the Yugoslav foreign minister, these incidents  are the more concerning because the United Nations failed to  react to earlier Yugoslav warnings and take corresponding steps  with the NATO command. The continuing provocations and  violations of the Yugoslav air space pose a serious threat to  peace and security in the entire region the flagrant violation  [words indistinct] territorial integrity and sovereignty and a  direct threat to the peace process which aims to halt the war in  the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina, Jovanovic said.    I call on you once again to take the corresponding steps  within the U.N. and in the NATO command to end the dangerous  provocations, he said.    In October 1992 the U.N. Security Council adopted a  resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Bosnia. Its  implementation is monitored by the NATO air force.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Different incident Sir, The US may remember the Mayaguez incident, but Jurek Martin ('Few tricks left', August 8) clearly does not; the ship was seized not by North Korea, but by Kampuchea (as it was then). I presume he has conflated it with the Pueblo incident? John M Kleeberg, assistant curator of modern coins, The American Numismatic Society, Broadway at 155th Street, New York, NY 10032, US</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Bank Negara chief defends forex loss BANK NEGARA, Malaysia's central bank, has defended itself against criticism that it has gambled on foreign exchange markets with resulting massive losses in its special reserves, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. In its annual report for last year, the bank said it had suffered a MDollars 2.7bn (Pounds 686m) contingent liability on forward foreign exchange transactions. A special reserve and contingency funds had plunged from more than MDollars 10bn at the end of 1991 to MDollars 753m a year later. Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, said a stronger Malaysian dollar, containing inflation and sharp value changes in reserve currencies had been mainly responsible for the fall in the special reserves. He added that most of the losses were book losses only. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, had called on Bank Negara to provide some answers about the state of its accounts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Attila Gy. Fekete: "Fidesz Does Not Want To Be </F> Part of the Government -- Less Than a Fifth of the Leadership  Would Say Yes to the MSZP"]    [Text] According to NEPSZABADSAG's information, the  majority of the National Committee of the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz] would be against a coalition cooperation with  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] if the party that was  victorious at the elections sent an official request to the  Young Democrats. According to the party's leadership, the  Fidesz's moral standing would be lost if, giving up its values  advocated in the campaign, it joined the emerging social-liberal  coalition.    The Fidesz's official view has not changed: The party is  only  willing to react to an official coalition offer received  directly from the MSZP. At the same time, influential people in  the Fidesz firmly stated that the mood in the party's leading  bodies is against the coalition; a proposal to work together  with the MSZP would not even receive the support of one-fifth of  those in decisionmaking positions. The members who stated this  used the decision of the Fidesz's April 1993 congress held in  Debrecen as an argument which stipulated two conditions for  cooperating with the MSZP: The MSZP should not be a subservient  party to the trade unions, and that a change of generations  should take place in the Socialist leadership. According to  Fidesz politicians, neither of these conditions have been met;  therefore, acceptance of a possible coalition offer would go  against the party congress decision.    Fidesz members also emphasized that the party would lose its  moral standing if it entered the coalition because, in its  election campaign, it had contrary goals to this, including  "preventing the former leaders from returning to power."  According to politicians, with their 20 parliamentary deputies,  the Young Democrats would be just as unimportant partners in a  coalition as the Christian Democratic People's Party was in the  past four years alongside the Hungarian Democratic Forum.  However, in opposition, the Fidesz could win over those liberals  who are disappointed with the social-liberal government.    According to our information, the coalition agreement of the  Socialists and Free Democrats might in spite of all this leave  the possibility open for the Fidesz perhaps to join later.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 22 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China  (CBC) may have to tighten up its credit policy to cope with the  changing international economic situation, an economic planner  said Wednesday [22 June].    "Sharp rises in international oil and commodity prices in  recent weeks have inflicted increasing inflationary pressure on  Taiwan," said K.C. Li, a department director at the Council for  Economic Planning and Development.    Chinese Petroleum Corp., a state monopoly, is considering  raising prices for its products by an average of 3 percent in  July because its crude oil import cost has risen to US$16 per  barrel, exceeding its original estimate of US$14.50.    Li said the proposed oil price hike may trigger a wave of  adjustments of prices for many other products and services.    In addition, the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new  Taiwan dollar against the U.S. greenback over the past few  months has added up to domestic inflationary pressure, Li noted.    The consumer price index grew at an annual rate of 4.33  percent in May, far exceeding the government-set 3.5 percent  ceiling, and the import price index grew 5.07 percent -- a  three-year high.    If the trend continues, Li said, the domestic inflation rate  will far surpass the 3.5 percent ceiling for the year.    The oil and commodity price surges, coupled with the  weakening of the U.S. dollar, have triggered panic selling in  major world stock markets in recent days as stock dealers react  to the fear that mounting inflation may hinder the global  economic recovery.    In reaction to the bearish mood of international bourses,  the  Taiwan stock exchange's weighted price index, the market's key  barometer, has fallen below the psychologically important 6.000-  point barrier. Panic selling has also been seen in the local  bond market, pushing up government bond yields drastically in  the past few days.    Against this background, Li said, the central bank must  decide whether to continue its current easy credit policy to  maintain moderate economic growth or to tighten its monetary  policy to maintain domestic price stability.    The central bank adopted an easy credit policy last July  with  a view to stimulating private investment and boosting economic  growth.    CBC officials said they are keeping close watch on recent  trends in major world financial markets. "We won't lightly  adjust our credit policy before making a careful, comprehensive  review of economic situations at home and abroad," said a CBC  official, who requested anonymity.    CBC Governor Liang Kuo-shu said recently that the bank's top  consideration in formulating monetary policy is to maintain  price stability.</p>

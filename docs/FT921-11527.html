			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: Real marginal costs of cars need taxing solution (2) Sir, Richard Tomkins rightly highlighted the low marginal cost of using cars. In the current political climate it would perhaps be more useful for our leaders to indulge in serious discussions about ways of correcting the imbalance. We continually hear comments that no action is really possible until road-pricing schemes are available, yet it seems that two specific actions could be taken immediately to start the process. abolish the road fund licence; abolish special car tax. In place of these, petrol taxes should be increased to recoup the lost tax revenue. This would encourage people to use more fuel efficient cars and reduce the fixed costs of motoring and it would of course reduce the marginal cost gap between roads and railways to which Richard Tomkins referred. Additionally it would ensure that overseas tourists/travellers who use British roads contributed more towards the costs than they currently do.

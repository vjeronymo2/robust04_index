			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ettore Tamos: "Without Any Taboos"] </F>   [Text] The bonus paid for a 13th month? After their  elimination from the budget and from the social services, they  could disappear. Severance pay? It could all go into the pension  funds. The unemployment compensation fund? Its days are  numbered. Everything is now on the table, including even the  integrated labor contracts and the contracts that cover an  entire category of workers.    You are no longer electrocuted when you touch the live wires  of the labor unions' gains. RAI [Italian Radio and Television  Broadcasting Corporation] President Claudio Dematte did not get  a shock when he let it be known that the company plans to delay  implementation of the extremely expensive integrated labor  contract, and not even when he announced the delay of payment of  the 13th month's wages. And the government did not get a shock  when it decreed that a government employee will be penalized for  his first day of absence. Today, it is no longer impossible to  bring up the issue of severance pay or lifetime job security in  the public sector without causing an uproar.    The contractual totems are crumbling. The certitudes that  were won are evaporating, just as many cathedrals of labor no  longer appear to be inviolable. What is happening? Is it the  logical result of the economic crisis? Or is it the result of an  unstoppable trend toward deregulation?    Both of these hypotheses appear to be valid. "In fact," says  the economist Mario Deaglio, "the one is actually linked to the  other" and adds that if this reaction had not occurred, the  damage would be substantially greater within a few months. "It  is an epochal change," he says. There is no social perception of  the phenomenon, however. Although the initial countercurrent  experiments have been visible and concrete, no heated debates or  widespread confrontations are taking place. Jobs are the Maginot  Line, while an ill-concealed abstentionism prevails on the other  fronts. The fear of seeming to be excessively free-market  oriented is apparently predominant, and the most cherished  secret hope is that this difficult moment--which entails doubts  and dilemmas--will pass. For the moment, therefore, the problem  is not being dealt with nor even discussed, and yet it exists.  <H5>  Farewell to Severance Pay </H5>   The proposal with respect to severance pay could help to  involve employees in the salvage and revival of their companies.  It was discussed during the negotiations concening Olivetti's  surplus workers. Should severance pay be converted into shares  of stock? Why not? These are only the initial references to the  problem, which is no longer taboo. "Basically, the practice of  setting aside this pay--referred to in the jargon as TFR  [remuneration paid upon termination of the employer-employee  relationship]--is already being used as a means of financing  companies," notes Bruno Manghi, for many years the very active  head of the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], who is  today an advocate of a free market economy.    The proposal to channel these sums into the pension funds  has  received the support of the labor unions and the business  community and could soon become reality. "It will depend on the  extent of the tax reductions," Manghi predicts. This prospect  could also displease those who have always counted on receiving  their severance pay. Actually, no one has called into question  the rights that have been won. To be sure, the sterilization of  these set-aside sums--which have not been completely  indexed--has now been accepted following so much controversy,  and it is motivating many employees to request advance payment  of these sums so that they can buy a home or merely safeguard  their capital, hopefully after supplementing it with capital  gains. This is the objective of hundreds of employees and  managers of the Italian Credit Bank, who have acquired the stock  of the bank--which is being privatized--at a 10 percent  discount, paying for it with an advance on their severance pay.  A different approach is taken by those managers [preceding word  in English] who are profiting from the crisis of corporate  groups--and the transfer of the ownership of companies--by using  their credit to take over their respective companies in MBO  (management buyout) [preceding two words in English]  transactions.  <H5>  No More Pay for a Thirteenth Month </H5>   A general experiment was carried out in connection with the  payment of wages for a 14th month and the other supplementary  monthly payments. In many labor contracts--for example, that of  the journalists--these supplementary payments have been frozen  and diminished by inflation. Now the pay for the 13th month is  coming under fire. There is nothing concrete in this connection,  merely some warning signals (RAI is refusing to make the  payment)--which in other times would have been the prelude to  the bankruptcy of the companies--and some warnings by  economists. "Today," the economist Mario Deaglio explains,  "production can migrate quickly to countries that are more  competitive, and there are many countries that do not pay wages  for a 13th month." The problem is obviously not so much the  tradition of a one month's Christmas bonus--which is, moreover,  already reduced by tax adjustments and by year-end household  expenses--as it is the complicated Italian wage structure. And  the 13th month wage payments will probably also be included in  the reform.  <H5>  Overalls Are Not Mobile </H5>   "Even in Japan they are coming to realize that a company--or  a job--is not a lifetime thing," Stefano Micossi, director of  research at Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian  Industry], points out. "We should accustom ourselves to changing  companies and cities," he warns. Millions of immigrant workers  are competing--with modest pretensions--for the marginal and  less desirable jobs in the developed countries. And although  white collars and blue overalls do not migrate, the production  does. "There is also mobility with respect to hours and  contractual conditions," Micossi emphasizes. "Today," he  explains, "there is only one type of contract. You work from  0900 to 1700 hours. And if there is an attempt to introduce  variants--such as part-time [preceding word in English] or  temporary employment--in order to adapt to a company's operating  conditions, there are regulations and controls that tend to  discourage initiatives and to restore the typical situation." In  the view of Confindustria, the next challenge will be posed by  the concept of contract labor, as envisioned in a new  legislative measure. The goal: contract freedom.  <H5>  Custom-Made Pact </H5>   The next step would be individual bargaining, which is  opposed by the labor unions but is now--in  practice--increasingly widespread in the higher professional  categories, in the specializations, and in the services.  Individual hiring is the rule, and individual superminimum wages  are a productivity incentive. "A greater differentiation in  wages is imperative," explains Sergio Ricossa, one of the  principal exponents of Italian economic liberalism, who is  convinced that individual bargaining would fuel the recovery of  Italy, Inc. "We must provide incentives for productivity rather  than penalize it, as is occurring under the system of graduated  taxes," Ricossa believes. "Two tax brackets would be enough."  <H5>  A Single Fund </H5>   It is the old battle against wage leveling, which is more  accentuated when a company is in crisis and the unemployment  compensation fund is involved. The benefit paid is the same  (slightly more than 1 million lire) for blue-collar workers,  white collar workers, and managerial levels. "It is an unfair  penalty imposed on those who are accustomed to a larger income,"  Manghi acknowledges, "and for this very reason the creation of  an initial graduated scale of benefits is now under discussion."  Another previously untouchable taboo has therefore come under  close scrutiny.    Moreover, the unemployment compensation fund is no longer by  definition extendable ad infinitum, without limits. Some  companies that have been closed for years have employees who are  still receiving the benefit. Now, however, after two years the  benefits expire and mobility status begins. Another two years,  and the guarantees expire. This system motivates people to  accept jobs that were originally rejected. "Mobility status  works in areas that have an industrial tradition," Manghi  discloses. In Turin, one out of three jobseekers has found other  employment. "The unemployment compensation fund is not a product  of welfarism," Deaglio insists, in commenting on the exhaustion  of the fund's liquid assets. If one must choose, he adds, "it is  better to abolish the fictitious jobs and preserve the fund."  The reference was obviously to public employment. If job  security is endangered in the private sector, the days of  welfarism in the public sector would appear to be numbered.</p>

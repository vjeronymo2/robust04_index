			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Berlin walled in with problems:  The city's struggle to live up to its new status AT THE height of the Cold War, Berlin was as much a symbol as a city, with its division clearly marked by the Wall and the sectoral boundaries between the allied and Soviet zones. After almost two years of unification Berlin is still a symbol  - but of the painful economic and social struggle to unite the disparate halves of Germany. Berlin's infrastructure, housing and officials appear unable to cope not only with the challenge of unification, but also with the city's transformation into a capital which befits Europe's most powerful economy. A good many Berliners are using words such as 'crisis', 'chaos' and even 'dangerous' to describe the city's economic and political malaise. Part of the problem stems from Berlin's recent history as an economic backwater of west Germany and the hub of east Germany's centrally planned economy. The western half attracted those keen to flee Frankfurt and other West German cities for a more sedate life in a highly subsidised city. But it lost many of its more ambitious young people to careers in West Germany. Communist East Berlin, in contrast, was a haven for those seeking a career in state bureaucracy. 'We are paying the price of having been drained for decades of our political and economic elite,' said Mr Kurt Kasch of Deutsche Bank in Berlin. He said investors were avoiding Berlin in favour of east Germany, where greenfield sites are available and labour more easily motivated. He blamed the city administration for failing to tackle festering problems: a critical housing shortage, traffic-clogged streets, an urgently needed administrative reform and delays in choosing the site of a new international airport. The government and parliament are not expected to complete their move to Berlin until the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the city's demands for fresh subsidies to cope with its changing role suspiciously echo its previous reliance on federal support for 60 per cent of the city's budget. Critics such as Herr Kasch believe that Berliners will eventually generate enough dynamism to overcome the present inertia. But this will mean wrenching changes for its pampered inhabitants. Residents worry that growing social tensions in both east and west Berlin may explode in the interim. They condemn the city's anaemic and faceless coalition government of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats for having paralysed decision-making. City officials reply that Berlin is forced to accomplish in a relatively short time what other cities had decades to achieve. Much of the gloom stems from the realisation that rising unemployment in east and west Berlin is not likely to be short-lived. Ms Angelika Heinrich, like most of the 117,357 newly unemployed east Berliners - 17.2 per cent of the working population - said she was bitterly disappointed in what the social market economy had brought her. With other unmarried working mothers cosseted by the former communist regime, she now saw 'no future' after being sacked from her job last December in the Narva lightbulb factory. In 1989, 30,000 east Berliners worked in the grimy cable and electricals factories of Oberschoneweide where the streets are named after Edison and Volta. There will soon be fewer than 5,000 jobs. 'The whole industrial base here is being rolled flat,' said Mr Lutz Epperlein, chairman of the works council at the TRO transformer plant. Unemployment would be even higher in east Berlin and Brandenburg if it were not for the estimated 130,000 easterners who commute to work in west Berlin. But even in west Berlin industrial jobs are being lost more quickly than service jobs can be created. Nearly 105,000 west Berliners are without jobs  -10.6 per cent - and the trend is rising. Yet the city had 6.5 per cent economic growth in 1990 and 4 per cent last year, largely because of a boom in spending by east Berliners - often using state unemployment benefits from Bonn. Manufacturers in formerly walled-in west Berlin flourished with the help of investment incentives and up to 10 per cent VAT rebates from Bonn. These and the income tax benefits enjoyed by Berliners are being phased out by 1994 and several large companies such as Standard Elektrik Lorenz plan to move out to the Brandenburg surroundings or, like Bosch and Siemens, will slim down production in Berlin. 'We face a dramatic structural problem,' Mr Uwe Petersen of the Berlin Economic Promotion office warned. The expected boom in the service sector to replace subsidised manufacturing has not taken place and much of the blame is being placed on the serious shortage of both affordable office space and housing in Berlin. Although many newly arrived German government officials are to be housed in the more than 6,000 flats and hundreds of villas occupied by the western allies - who depart in 1994 - the pent-up demand among Berliners for lower-income flats is expected to far outstrip the ability of the city to provide them. Building activity in east Berlin, both commercial and housing, is virtually non-existent because of conflicting property claims by previous owners dispossessed under the Nazis and the communists. Mr Falk Jesch, head of the city-owned housing company in east Berlin's Mitte district, forecast that the lack of private investment meant even repairs to the facades and roofs of long-neglected apartment buildings, 50 per cent of them with conflicting title claims, will halt when public funds are exhausted this year. Legal conflicts are especially prevalent in Mitte where nearly 1,000 properties are estimated to have had Jewish owners who often sold under duress in the 1930s. Both Mr Jesch and Mr Hans Peter Plettner, a leading Berlin property auctioneer, held out little hope that legal measures by Bonn to speed up the processing of property claims and facilitate investments would bring a solution as long as the government clung stubbornly to the principle that restoring property to former owners takes precedence over indemnifying them.</p>

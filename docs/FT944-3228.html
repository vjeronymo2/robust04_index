			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Greenalls 10% ahead to Pounds 74.8m - First full-year contribution from Devenish helps advance The first full-year contribution from the Devenish pub chain helped Greenalls Group report a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 68m to Pounds 74.8m for the year to September 30. The smooth integration of Devenish should continue to bring benefits this year, which was off to a good start for the whole group, Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman, said. The group should also benefit from new supply agreements with brewers, improving hotel returns, new concepts in its off-licence chain and expansion of Tavern, its drinks wholesaling business. The Devenish pubs, acquired for Pounds 214m in July 1993, contributed operating profits of Pounds 24.5m and were earnings enhancing. Pre-tax profits were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 13.4m (profits of Pounds 165,000), incurred mostly in closing Greenalls' soft drink maker. Before exceptionals, profits rose 30 per cent and benefited from an extra week of trading in the latest year. The group's pubs operating profits were up 39 per cent at Pounds 75.9m, or up 8 per cent without Devenish. Food sales per outlet rose 9 per cent and drink sales 5 per cent. Premier House restaurants and lodges raised profits by 57 per cent to Pounds 16.4m, or by 35 per cent without Devenish. De Vere Hotels benefited from rising room and occupancy rates which helped it to an 18 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 19.8m. Revenue per available room was up 7 per cent to Pounds 32. The group's six US hotels, which are for sale, turned in Pounds 768,000 (Pounds 145,000). Off-licence profits slipped 4.7 per cent to Pounds 4.3m, but new management and trading concepts brought a second half recovery after an 11 per cent drop in first half profits. Drinks manufacture and distribution and leisure contributed Pounds 8.4m, up 33 per cent. A net cash outflow of Pounds 25.8m in the latest year should fall to an outflow of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m this year as hotel building ended, the company said. Borrowing rose to Pounds 395m (Pounds 368.5m) for gearing of 55 per cent (46 per cent). A proposed final dividend of 7.77p makes 13.1p for the year, up 6 per cent. Earnings per share were 26.09p (28.37p) fully diluted after exceptionals and 30.78p (28.28p) before. Turnover from continuing operations rose 23 per cent to Pounds 716.2m. COMMENT Highly advantageous long-term supply agreements with brewers show the value to Greenalls of quitting brewing to concentrate on retailing. Only Boddington Group offers a similar play in a fair-sized company. But Greenalls has a better geographic spread and is more innovative. Steady growth in pubs and a rising contribution from new hotels should help pre-tax profits hit Pounds 97.5m this year for earnings of 34.5p. This puts the shares on a realistic multiple of 12.3 on yesterday close of 425p, up 9p.</p>

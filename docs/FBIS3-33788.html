[Salman] Israel has no right to hold a referendum on the  Golan because it is Syrian territory. A referendum in such a  case contravenes international law and the UN Charter regarding  other countries' territories. There can be no referendum on the  territories of other countries. The Golan was occupied by force  and the Security Council passed Resolution 242 rejecting the  occupation of others' land by force. There is an explicit  provision to this effect. In addition, when Israel made a  decision to annex the Golan and apply Israeli laws there, the  United Nations swiftly rejected this and emphasized that the  Golan was Syrian territory, that it must be returned to Syria,  and that Israel must withdraw from it. Therefore, proposing the  idea of holding a referendum on returning or refusing to return  the Golan is like holding a referendum on whether the  international law itself is correct or incorrect. Thus, holding  a referendum totally contradicts international law and  legitimacy. A referendum is invalid and absolutely  inadmissible; otherwise, it would set a precedent that would  prevent the existence of the United Nations. It might set an  example for other countries of the world to reject Security  Council resolutions and international law, making a referendum  the judge on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any resolution.    [Al-Sa'id] In the wake of the Geneva summit, Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin said that President Clinton and not President  al-Asad spoke about normalization of relations. Rabin stressed  that President al-Asad did not explain what his concept of peace  was.    [Salman] Israel, as we know, wants to blackmail any stance  and wants to take before giving. Israel has not yet given  anything. When Israel withdraws from the Golan, it is  withdrawing from Syrian territory that will be returned to  Syria. Israel is not giving anything, but the establishment of  relations between countries is voluntary and subject to the will  of this or that country and, consequently, to mutual confidence  between countries. If there is no mutual confidence between  individuals there can be no friendship. This definitely applies  in international relations. President al-Asad on the Geneva  forum and within the hearing of the whole world left no room for  doubt that Syria and its leader declare that he is ready to sign  a document of a comprehensive and fair peace in the region.  This was so decisive a response to all those who attended this  conference that President Clinton applauded it. Israel,  however, has grown used to skirting issues and wants to foil and  subvert the positive results of any meeting that binds it to  withdraw from Arab territory.    [Al Sa'id] What are your views regarding security  arrangements, which primarily concern Israel since fears about  govern its motives and moves in the region?    [Salman] It is impossible for anyone to discuss conclusions  before preludes nor to debate details before setting forth  general principles. The basic issue in the peace process is  Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories, but the security  issue is one of the main clauses outlined in the Syrian document  that was submitted in the sixth round of peace talks. President  al-Asad reiterated this issue at the Geneva summit when he  stressed the right of all countries of the region to live in  peace. Regarding Israel's apprehensions about security, I  maintain that Syria's and every Arab country's security is  threatened by Israel. The outstanding threat to the Arab  countries is by far more real than the threat to Israel's  security.    [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva summit was successful, but Israel's  reaction to it was lukewarm. It even voiced reservations about  Syria's intentions. My question is: What is your opinion about  the talks that are about to take place now?    [Salman] Quick reactions are always the loudest. By reacting  to the results with such coldness, Israel gave the impression  that it does not intend to work to make peace in this region,  because it believes that peace does not serve its expansionist  designs in the region. Thus, it believes that peace may put an  end to the expansionist designs it had been dreaming of.  Everybody knows that the founders of Israel always reiterated  that Israel's borders extended from the Nile to the Euphrates.  By accepting a just and comprehensive peace in the region,  everyone will know the geographical boundaries he can live in.  That is why Israel viewed these resolutions as halting its  aggressive designs toward its neighbors. All these matters boil  down to one thing; that is, that Israel must withdraw first.  Before withdrawal, there can be no talk about any future idea  or step. Thus, the details and moving to discuss these details  entirely depends on the beginnings, which constitute the main  principle; that is, the withdrawal. So it is absolutely  inconceivable for us to talk about the nature of security or  talks or how we will have to coexist in the future.    [Al-Sa'id] But did President al-Asad obtain guarantees from  the United States at the Geneva summit confirming that Israel  will withdraw from all the Golan?    [Salman] The initiative that United States has offered  within  the framework of the Madrid Conference and the rounds of talks  that followed it is based on international legality, as  represented by Resolutions 242 and 338, meaning full withdrawal.  So when the negotiations are guaranteed by and based on  international legality, as represented by Resolutions 242 and  338, this means that the United States is offering a guarantee  that it will work according to these resolutions to achieve  peace in this region. The United States is a permanent member  of the Security Council and it has recognized these two  resolutions. So by honoring the Security Council resolutions,  it respects its participation in making these resolutions.    [Al-Sa'id] But Syria has no objection to security  arrangements under which multinational forces, including U.S.  troops, could be deployed, and through which some parts of the  Golan could be disarmed?    [Salman] Syria will agree to any formula endorsed by the  international institutions. The Security Council may authorize  the United States to send U.S. troops as a guarantee to the  region. If this happens, Syria will certainly respect this  international will. Thus, all we want is to establish real peace  and security in the region and not imagined security that could  be violated at any time by Israel when it has the chance to do  so.    [Al-Sa'id] It is said that Syria's support for the 10  Damascus-based Palestinian groups is one of the reasons behind  accusing Syria of backing terrorism.    [Salman] We differentiate between national struggle and  terrorism. These groups constitute a resistance force to  liberate the territory occupied by Israel. Similarly, Hizballah  is a Lebanese party fighting to liberate its territory. How can  these groups be called terrorists? It is Israel that is killing  people daily. A proof of this is the number of Palestinian dead  and detained in the occupied territories despite the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. As a matter of fact, the number of dead  Palestinians and detainees has doubled since the agreement was  signed. Israel has filled its jails with Palestinians who are  struggling to liberate their land occupied by Israel.    [Al-Sa'id] Can the United States fulfill its promise of  establishing a comprehensive peace, particularly since Israel is  trying to put forward numerous pretexts to avoid withdrawal?    [Salman] This is what the United States has affirmed and is  affirming every day and at every meeting between us and the  United States. Through the Geneva summit and the U.S.  delegations' visits to Syria and Syrian delegations's visits to  the United States, we have considerable confidence because the  U.S. Administration is serious about resolving this issue and  establishing a fair and comprehensive peace in the region.  Peace will serve the interests of all countries of the region  and it represents a real interest for the United States in the  region. Instead of having soldiers stationed in the region as  foreign forces, the United States can do without this presence  when the region is stable and secure. It can thus deal with the  region as a friend instead of being viewed as a force  interfering in the domestic affairs of the region.    [Al-Sa'id] Do you fear the possibility of Israel's resorting  to holding early elections and of the Likud, which is more  extremist than the Labor Party, taking power?    [Salman] We are confident that the Israeli rulers dream  about  peace in their own special way, a peace of hegemony and  domination. If this does not materialize, they will not accept  the establishment of peace in this region. Circumventing issues  is a major characteristic of Israel's behavior. Thus we do not  think that the Israeli side will agree to establish peace in  this region. We expect that they will circumvent the Geneva  summit resolutions in one way or another. Perhaps they will  create a problem by dissolving the government or calling for new  elections or a referendum. All signs indicate that they want to  circumvent the outcome of the Geneva summit. The propaganda  campaign against Syria, President al-Asad, and President Clinton  in particular was one of Israel's attempts, backed by its  massive media organs and the Zionist lobby, to prevent the  convening of the Geneva summit and to pressure and intimidate  Clinton about it.    [Al-Sa'id] What is your current view of the situation  regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Salman] I praised this agreement from the outset, but what  President al-Asad said about this agreement proved to be true:  Every paragraph in this agreement needs an agreement and every  agreement in it requires negotiations. The issue is in a  vicious circle. Israel evades and will continue to evade.  Israel will not give because it has grown used to taking. We  know the destiny of this agreement. It was born feeble and it  is now in the intensive care unit.    [Al-Sa'id] Was there a sort of bargain over Lebanon in the  Geneva summit--something like pulling the Syrian forces out of  that country or disarming Hizballah in return for Israel's  withdrawal from the Golan? Israel claims that organizations  such as Hizballah threaten its security.    [Salman] There is a Security Council resolution relevant to  Lebanon, namely, Resolution 425. It calls for an immediate  Israeli withdrawal. Before the Israeli occupation of Lebanon,  no organizations like Hizballah had borne arms. Thus, these  organizations are struggling and offering sacrifices to liberate  the south. If their raison d'etre is removed, there will  certainly be no need for any fedayeen operations. Those  organizations will find no need to carry weapons if the land is  liberated. Now they are fighting to liberate their lands. When  an Israeli is killed, he is killed in occupied Lebanese  territory. Hizballah does not infiltrate deep into Israeli  territory; it is fighting Israel on Lebanese territory. But  through the terms it uses--terms like the security belt, which  all of us are now repeating--Israel has managed to delude the  world into thinking that it is living in fear, and that it is  the victim that needed the belt to protect itself. But this  belt is in occupied Lebanese territory and an integral part of  Lebanon--south Lebanon. It is not a security belt, as Israel  claims; it is Lebanese territory, and its inhabitants are  carrying arms and struggling to liberate the land occupied by  Israel.    [Al-Sa'id] Although President Clinton spoke about the need  for qualitative relations with Syria, the world was surprised at  the U.S. State Department announcement after the summit that  Syria will not be struck off the list of states sponsoring  terrorism.    [Salman] We are not totally taken aback by this; this is not  surprising. Had the United States--and I mean the U.S.  Administration in particular--been convinced that Syria was a  terrorist country, the Geneva summit would not have taken place,  and the exchange of visits by Syrian and U.S. delegations world  not have continued. Many U.S. Congress and Administration  officials come to meet the president. Syria was unfairly  accused of terrorism thanks to the influence of the Zionist  lobby in the United States. Had it not been for the influence  of the Israeli and Zionist lobby in the United States, which put  pressure on the U.S. Congress and Administration, the  [terrorism] decision would not have been made. As regards daily  interaction, the United States and Syria do not deal with each  other on the basis that Syria is a terrorist country. It is  enough to say that to date, neither Israel, nor the Zionist  lobby in the world, nor anyone in the U.S. Administration itself  could provide a single piece of evidence that Syria carried out  or was involved in any terrorist act, either at a state or at an  individual level.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jakarta, 8 January--The Functional Development  Faction (FKP) in Parliament will continue to be consistent in  respecting President Suharto's instructions that waste and graft  should be avoided in implementing the budget. At the same time  tax collections need to be raised steadily to increase total  state tax receipts, while ensuring that the activities of tax  collectors are more professional.    This statement was made by Dr. Usman Hasan, chairman of the  FKP, in answer to questions from a SUARA PEMBARUAN  representative at the Parliament building in the Senayan section  of Jakarta. He was talking about the speech by the president to  a plenary session of Parliament on 6 January.    A similar view was expressed by Dr. A.A. Oka Mahendra, also  a  member of the FKP, who emphasized the president's call on all  members of the community to pay their taxes. He said that this  call must also be followed up by increasing the level of  motivation among the people. In this way state receipts from  taxes will continue to increase in the coming years. He said:  "Furthermore, tax revenues must truly be used for clear,  developmental objectives."    According to Usman Hasan, who spoke of the need to prevent  budgetary waste and corruption, we all hope that this will be  done. There is a question as to whether graft in the development  field takes place because of technical or organizational  management factors. He added that the FKP, in its meetings with  government officials, will continue to raise the question of  waste.    He said later that since the First Five-Year Plan was begun  the government has continued to emphasize increasing income from  taxes. During this period of time tax collections have always  met their goals. He stated: "That is, tax income has continued  to increase almost every year. As a result, I am optimistic that  the tax collection goal in the next RAPBN [state budget] will be  achieved and may even be exceeded."    According to Usman, although it is generally known that the  tax collection target has been achieved, it is still necessary  to make preparations now to achieve the target for state tax  receipts, that is, by steadily collecting taxes. He added: "This  is particularly the case if we recall that the percentage of  persons actually paying their taxes is low, compared to the  other countries of ASEAN."    Regarding the steady collection of taxes, the FKP will  always  remind the government to apply the tax regulations firmly. It is  only right that those able to pay more taxes have a greater  obligation than those who are not in this position. Steady tax  collections are also in the interests of justice, apart from the  consideration of the principles of conflicting subsidies.  <H5>  Broadening the Tax Base </H5>   Meanwhile, Dr. Oka Mahendra, a member of the FKP, said that  the government needs to collect taxes on a more extensive basis.  Expanding the number of persons who are obliged to pay taxes  will help the process of tax collection. However, the key to  success in all of this is the tax collector.    Oka admitted that there is an impression among some people  that a rather large number of potential taxpayers who avoid  paying taxes come from the ranks of the tax collectors. He  added: "Therefore, by continuing to stress motivation it is  hoped that the people's awareness that they have an obligation  to pay taxes will continue to increase. This includes reporting  those who have an obligation to pay taxes but who avoid it  because they are tax collectors."    Regarding the need for criminal penalties for those who have  an obligation to pay taxes but avoid doing so, Oka Mahendra, a  member of Committee II of Parliament, thought this is not yet  needed. He said: "However, if there really are people who have  been involved in avoiding their tax obligations, they should  face criminal penalties under the laws already in effect."  <H5>  Question of Salaries </H5>   Meanwhile, T.B. Silalahi, minister of state for  administrative reform, stated, in answer to questions from  reporters, that if the salaries of state employees are not  increased and the matter of service to the public is left to the  personal integrity of the individual, who will feel an  obligation to serve the people? However, although there have  really been people who have engaged in avoiding payment of their  taxes, we should not generalize too much in this regard, because  many employees can also observed in the areas where they work  who really serve the people.    After attending a plenary session of Parliament to hear the  speech made by the president on 6 January on "Economic Notes"  and the state budget for fiscal year 1994/1995, Silalahi said:  "We should not look only at the questions of the service of  state employees and their salaries, because this matter must be  considered from a national point of view. At present, whatever  we think of it, development is now going on at an extraordinary  pace. Per capita income has been increasing for the past 25  years."    He stated that in a national sense our country is not yet  able to pay adequate salaries to state employees. If this is the  situation at the national level, we must think about it. If we  compare the situation in 1965, when we began the First Five-Year  Plan, with today, present conditions are far better. He said:  "We hope that later, by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan,  annual income will increase to $1,000 per capita. However,  although the salaries of state employees have not increased, the  government has continued to raise their level of welfare. For  example, he said, in the most remote provinces the total incomes  of state employees such as teachers are now twice their  salaries. As a result, they can serve the people more  effectively."</p>

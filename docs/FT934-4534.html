			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / High Court setback to fishing curbs plan Controversial plans by the government to keep the British fishing fleet tied up in port for part of the year could be shelved after the High Court yesterday referred the matter to the European Court in Luxembourg. Planned legislation restricting the number of days spent by fishing vessels at sea to 1991 levels was challenged in court by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Richard Banks, the federation's chief executive, hailed the High Court decision as a triumph. 'It's given the government a severe bloody nose,' he said. 'We didn't want to win because that would have involved a very expensive appeals process, so it's the best outcome for us.' The agriculture ministry has said it may appeal against the decision. The government has until Wednesday to decide whether to lodge an appeal. The fishermen will go to the High Court again on January 11 to argue that implementation of the 'tie-up rules', which were due to come into effect on January 1, should be put off until after a European Court judgment, which could take at least two years. Mr Gavin Strang, Labour agriculture spokesman, said: 'The government has a moral obligation to accept that the tie-up rules are now finished.' Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, planned to introduce the limits as part of the government's commitment to conserve fish stocks. Under European Union fisheries policy the UK fleet must be cut by 19 per cent by 1996. Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said yesterday's decision 'prolongs the period of uncertainty in the industry and is not in the best interests of conserving fish stocks or the fishermen who depend upon them'. Fishermen agree that over-fishing has to be stopped, but they want conservation measures to be targeted at species which are most depleted such as cod. They also believe it could be done by introducing other measures - such as increasing the mesh size of nets so that younger fish slip through - rather than restricting fishing time. The government has started a programme of decommissioning, paying fishermen to leave the industry. It has earmarked Pounds 25m for compensation, of which Pounds 8m has already been spent. Officials suggested that yesterday's judgment could mean the remaining Pounds 17m would be withdrawn. Mr Banks said the government could not withdraw the funding available for decommissioning as it would be in breach of EU guidelines. He said he was encouraged by the recognition given by the High Court judges that the tie-up ruling could cause severe financial hardship for the fishing industry. Lawyers acting for the fishermen said they were fairly confident from the wording of the judgment that a stay of execution on the new rules would be granted.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Franco curbs Brazilian electricity price rises PRESIDENT Itamar Franco of Brazil yesterday announced a 30 per cent limit on electricity price increases for April and imposed a limit of 5 per cent above inflation per month for the next five months. The president's action appears to threaten the radical change in Brazil's energy policy implemented in January to allow state distribution companies to decide their own electricity tariffs. The new limits were prompted by a decision by the state of Mato Grosso do Sul on Wednesday to raise electricity prices by 56 per cent. The policy change giving the states a free hand on prices was approved by Congress in January with the aim of recuperating the financial health of Eletrobras, the state holding company, which is owed an estimated Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) by its distributors. They in turn are owed large amounts by state companies. Energy tariffs have always been set at one price by the federal government, regardless of the efficiency of the local concessionary, and kept deliberately low by governments to contain inflation. The president of Eletrobras says prices are now at a historic low in real terms. In the last two months, for example, there has been no increase despite inflation of around 27 per cent a month. Under the new legislation the local distribution companies of Brazil's 27 states were told they were free to set their own tariffs from the beginning of April after presenting cost plans to the federal government. The heads of state companies say price rises allowed under the president's new restrictions are insufficient. They point out that since October, electricity prices have risen only 133 per cent, whereas the cost of telephone calls has gone up 372 per cent. An official from the Mines and Energy Ministry warned: 'If they don't like this then we'll just have to go back to the old system where we set the tariffs.'</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Stable period ends Total returns in the commercial property sector fell in June, following several months of apparent stabilisation, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group. Yields continued outwards, placing pressure on capital values, which fell by 0.8 per cent, their largest monthly fall this year. Rental values dropped by the same amount. IPD said the fall in returns by about half a point to -0.1 per cent, points, in part, 'to a lack of confidence in the market'. In spite of the dip in returns, performance for the second quarter showed some improvement over the previous quarter. Rental value rose from -2.3 per cent to -2.0 per cent, capital growth remained static at -1.7 per cent, while total return improved slightly to 0.4 per cent. Taken year-on-year, all three measures turned for the worst. Capital values and total returns, which had been steadily improving, recorded -6.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively for the year, compared with -5.7 per cent and 2.0 per cent for the year to May. The biggest change of fortune was suffered by industrial property. The greatest rental value decline yet recorded by the IPD Index combined with the highest yield to produce the largest fall in capital values for 18 months. The retail sector was the only part of the market to show a positive return in June.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IPD MONTHLY INDEX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly change (Index based at Dec 1986 = 100)                  Jun 1992    May 1992    Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IPD                167.68      167.85     -0.17 Retail             154.81      153.90      0.91 Office             160.17      161.42     -1.25 Industrial         233.01      233.82     -0.81  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROHRABACHER IS OWN WORST ENEMY  </P> <P> I am writing to express my appreciation for Joseph Bell's excellent editorial  on Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ("Rohrabacher's Sin: Self-Righteousness," Oct. 26).  The congressman's hypocrisy really stands out when he demands drug tests for  his employees but maintains his own right to privacy about his history of drug  use.  </P> <P> The best feature of Bell's article was his surprising tact. He did not wish to  talk about Rohrabacher's morally bankrupt past, or his LSD use, or his drug  parties, or his . . . you get the picture.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher has become his own worst enemy. Through his own preaching and  holier-than-thou attitude, he has established an atmosphere of intolerance that  will work against him. His shining armor is only a thin shell that hides his  hypocrisy and less-than-perfect past. Rohrabacher must stop his "no comment"  strategy and come clean with his own supporters. But be careful, Congressman.  Police chief Daryl Gates' desired law for the execution of casual drug users  has no statute of limitation, and he has been asking questions. . . .  </P> <P> Nick Popoff, Seal Beach  </P></p>

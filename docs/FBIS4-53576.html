			<p>BFN     [Text] The Australian Government has denied a United  Nations statement that Australia has agreed to commit troops to  a UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. A UN spokesman had named  nine countries, including Australia, what he said would send  infantry troops to join the UN force. But an Australian  spokesman said that while the government has committed in  principle to a peacekeeping mission to Rwanda, it had not  decided what form its involvement would take. He said Australia  is awaiting an assessment of the Rwandan situation by a UN  observer team. The UN plans to send 5,500 troops to Rwanda  where hundreds of thousands of people are reported to have died  in ethic violence.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Hilary Term cases TICEHURST AND ANOTHER v BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLC (FT, April 1) About 30,000 of the 40,000 executives employed by BT in certain grades were represented by the Society of Telecom Executives (STE), a trade union. From about June 1989, in order to seek a pay increase, its members took part in industrial action short of striking, described as 'withdrawal of goodwill'. Two managers were awarded wages after the judge at first instance found that their refusal to sign an undertaking not to take any further industrial action was not a breach of contract. The Court of Appeal accepted BT's contention that if an employee was willing to perform only part of his or her duties, or declined to carry them out properly with the object of damaging the employer's business, the employer was not obliged to accept performance short of full performance and was entitled to refuse to permit the employee to work and to refuse to pay wages. PRESIDENT OF INDIA v JADRANSKA SLOBODNA PLOVIDBA (FT, April 3) Disputes arising between charterers and shipowners under a charterparty were referred to arbitration in London. By an interim award, the charterers were ordered to pay to the owners Dollars 3,142 and the arbitrators then made a subsequent 'final award as to costs'. That award was substantially adverse to the charterers who issued a notice of motion for an order that it be remitted to the arbitrators on the ground of misconduct under section 22 of the Arbitration Act 1950. The arbitrators had separately furnished the parties with 'confidential' reasons for their decision. Refusing the charterers' application, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated that where, as here, there had been a separate award on costs, the parties had to follow the procedures and requirements of section 1 of 1979 Arbitration Act and that required satisfying stringent criteria for grant of leave (see The Nema (1982) AC 724). The section 22 procedure might only be invoked where there had been some actual misconduct, such as excess of jurisdiction, procedural mishap, breach of natural justice, or failure to complete, and not simply some alleged unjudicial exercise of the discretion. ASHMORE AND OTHERS v CORPORATION OF LLOYD'S (FT, April 7) The plaintiffs, who became Lloyd's Names at various times between January 1971 and December 1981, were members of syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan (Underwriting) Ltd. They claimed damages from Lloyd's for losses on insurance contracts entered into by OVU as managing agent in 1980-83. The plaintiffs appealed against the judge's order that the preliminary points of law be argued as to whether Lloyd's owed them the alleged duties and the Court of Appeal set aside that order. Allowing Lloyd's appeal that the order be restored, the House of Lords stated that there had been a tendency in some cases for legal advisers, pressed by clients, to make every point conceivable and inconceivable without judgment or discrimination. Where a judge for reasons which were not plainly wrong made an interlocutory decision in the trial courts, it should be respected by the parties and, if challenged by them, it should be upheld by an appellate court unless the judge was plainly wrong. OWENS BANK LTD v BRACCO AND ANOTHER (FT, April 8) The bank had applied to register a judgment of the St Vincent High Court against Mr Bracco and Bracco Industria for more than SFr10m. After initial registration, Bracco applied for an issue to be tried under section 9(2)(d) of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 as to whether the St Vincent judgment had been obtained by fraud. At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that the issue should be tried. Dismissing the bank's appeal, the House of Lords stated that an English judgment was final and conclusive as to the issues decided and it was to preserve that finality that any attempt to reopen litigation, even on the grounds of fraud, had to be confined within very restrictive limits. However, under section 9(2)(d) of the Administration of Justice Act 1920, construed as it must be, as an adoption of the common law approach to foreign judgments, finality to a judgment was specifically denied if it could be shown to have been obtained by fraud. GRAZIELLA FERRAZ (FT, April 10) Pursuant to an arbitration clause in a charterparty, the charterers and shipowners each appointed an arbitrator and the two arbitrators then appointed a third one. However, since the interim final award was issued the arbitrator appointed by the charterers died and they then nominated another person in his stead and asked a declaration from the court that it was a valid appointment under section 7 (a) of the Arbitration Act 1950. Refusing the application but making an order under section 10(1)(b) of the Act appointing the replacement, Hirst J stated that the charterers could not invoke section 7 as that provision applied to two and not to three arbitrators. There was a lacuna in arbitration procedure and the drawbacks were exemplified by the present case where, in addition to the costs incurred in relation to the originating summons itself, the charterers had to undertake two expensive service processes out of the jurisdiction in order to invoke section 10, rather than the very simple and inexpensive procedure under section 7. REGINA v PANEL ON TAKE- OVERS AND MERGERS, EX PARTE FAYED AND OTHERS (FT, April 14) In 1987, Lonrho issued a writ against the Fayed brothers alleging that they had induced the secretary of state to refrain from referring the proposed acquisition to the MMC by means of false representations about themselves, their background and their source of finance. The writ claimed for the lost opportunity to acquire House of Fraser and sought damages for interference with business by unlawful means. A DTI report, of inspectors appointed to investigate the circumstances surrounding acquisition of the shares, was severely critical of the Fayeds. In 1991, in response to the Takeover Panel's allegations of possible breaches of the City Code, lawyers for the Fayeds sought an adjournment on the ground that the Panel's finding might prejudice their clients' position in the 1987 litigation but the application was refused. On the Fayeds' unsuccessful application to the Court of Appeal, it was held that a court could intervene to prevent injustice where continuation of one set of proceedings might prejudice the fair trial of another. But it was a power which had to be exercised with great care, and only where there was a real risk of serious prejudice which might lead to injustice. THE LEFTHERO (FT, April 15) Clause 28 of a charterparty provided that neither the vessel, the owners, master nor charterers should be responsible for any delay resulting from 'Act of God, act of war, perils of the seas . . . restraint of princes . . . .' In the instant case, at the height of the Iran-Iraq war, the vessel was bound for Bandar Khomeini from Bandar Abbas but had to discharge at Bushire after two attempts to make the port. The arbitrators held that the action in requiring the vessel to return to Bushire fell within 'restraint of princes' clause with reference to the charterers' claim for damages for the owners' failure to discharge at Bandar Khomeini. However, they held that the clause did not protect the charterers on the owners' counterclaim for demurrage. Their decision was reversed at first in stance. While on the face of it the words of clause 28 were wide enough to cover charterers' delay in discharging where it arose from restraint of princes, it had long been the law that to protect a charterer against liability for demurrage, the language of the exceptions clause had to be clearly worded to that effect. Moreover, the Court of Appeal stated in allowing the owners' appeal and holding that the charterers were liable to them for demurrage, the general rule was applicable even though the vessel was not already on demurrage when the peril operated.</p>

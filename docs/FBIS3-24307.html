Kornev, head of the newspaper EKONOMIKA I </F> ZHIZN's information center in Ukraine: "Ukraine: The Real Estate  Market as a Barometer of Government Reforms"]    [Text] The situation on the real estate market is one  of the most sensitive barometers of the progress of countries of  the former USSR along the path of economic reforms. Here it is  clear to see how the real mechanisms of property are formed.    To facilitate analysis of this problem, we will divide  all real estate into two parts: that which belongs to  enterprises (state as well as private), which we will call  production real estate, and that which is owned by citizens as  private property, which we will call citizens' property.  <H5>  Unfinished Projects and Others (Production Real Estate) </H5>   The processes of destatization of property in Ukraine are  determined by the laws on large and small privatization that  were adopted by parliament a year and a half ago. But for all  practical purposes, they have not begun to function: The 1992  and 1993 state privatization plans have come to naught, although  official figures also cite such a statistic as the fact that  1,570 enterprises have been privatized. The main form of  privatization today is leasing to buy. In 1993, 1,306  enterprises were privatized, and 978 enterprises were in the  process. Why is property taking such a long time to find real  owners? What is going on here? Who is at fault? Some see a  population that does not wish to become owners; others, a state  that is in no hurry when it comes to a real transition to the  market. In fact, preparations are being made for wide-scale  privatization. In a very distinctive way.    Here is the point of view of an expert--the influential  Ukrainian people's deputy V. Filenko: "The corporatization and  breaking up of large enterprises, readjustment,  commercialization, and other unavoidable preliminary measures  are proceeding too slowly, and to some extent are only being  mimicked. But then, the fussy changing around of signboards and  the formation in the state sector of pseudo-market structures  and small enterprises parasitizing state property is forging  ahead at full speed. On the one hand, these are means for  pumping public funds, or property, too, into private pockets; on  the other hand, it is the seizure of convenient starting  positions, which after the proclamation of mass privatization  should automatically lead to the preferential transition of the  best enterprises into the hands of privileged claimants.    According to a scenario that may be carried out, mass  privatization will formally be begun at such time as the actual  privatization of highly profitable enterprises is concluded.  There are not a few tasty morsels, and one cannot put one's  hands on them all simultaneously. So they are dallying with the  privatization in order to gain time: "The lion is getting ready  to spring."    But what is happening at the surface of this process? All of  the laws and decrees on privatization remain only a declaration.  At auctions where municipally owned enterprises are sold, which  have taken place in Lvov, Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev, Zaporozhye,  Odessa, and other cities, and were held, as also in the  beginning in Russia (Nizhniy Novgorod, St. Petersburg) under the  patronage of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), in  fact what was sold was not the objects of immovable property,  but the right to their lease.    The auctions themselves, especially in Kiev, proceeded in  not  very organized fashion--there were protests of the participants  and of the procurators about the fact that a number of  enterprises under dual authority were incorrectly presented for  bidding. For example, a store on the first story of a  departmental building has two owners--the organization that  constructed the building and the municipal authorities. A whole  range of enterprises was withdrawn from the trading for this  reason.    The edict of the president of Ukraine on corporatization  placed the beginning of privatization of medium-sized and large  state enterprises on the basis of the creation of joint-stock  companies. The process has really been in progress since October  and November of last year. Only 78 such companies have been  created.    In the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, great hopes were  placed on the privatization of unfinished construction projects.  In October of last year, the president of Ukraine signed the  relevant edict. It seemed that the matter would quickly be  "wound up." After all, in the republic, as we were informed by  R. Kuzmin, a leading specialist of the Property Fund's  administration of state enterprise privatization, there are  53,000 unfinished projects of state or municipal ownership,  including 22,000 at which no construction was conducted in 1993,  and 9,200 that are 50 percent ready and whose construction was  taking twice as long as the norm.    In the middle of January throughout Ukraine, about 100  privatization projects were "put to work." And every month  during the course of this year the same number should be added  to those. Here it is determined that clients who have financed  the construction through centralized capital investments will at  sale receive 30 percent of the cost of the unfinished project,  and those who built using their own funds will receive all 100  percent. The privatization of plots of land is resolved  simultaneously with the unfinished project itself.    It appeared that the process would "move ahead." However, by  February throughout Ukraine, only 50 sellers of dragged-out  construction projects had been scraped together. The role of  "dog in the manger" turned out to be played by the local organs  of executive authority. In oblasts like Donetsk, Lugansk, and  Sumy there turned out to be only 10 overdue construction  projects apiece, and in Khmelnitskiy, not a single one. One can  understand the managers' desire to hold back "their"  construction until better times, to justify as state motives the  necessity of its continuation. But they, as was stressed at a  recent meeting at the Cabinet of Ministers, will be heard  sympathetically by the privatization commission under one set of  circumstances: when there are on hand or planned for the near  term real funds for the completion of construction. Otherwise,  the auction will judge who has the greatest opportunity and  desire to bring the overdue construction project "to reason" and  become its owner.    For the time being, even out of 9,200 50-percent completed  projects, only three overdue construction projects have been  completed. Although the number of their bypassed "brothers"  promises to increase. According to data of the Cabinet of  Ministers economics administration, of 343 projects planned to  be put into operation by state contract, only 16 have been put  into operation.    Ukraine is living through difficult times. This is the third  year that the fall in production has continued, which has  reached catastrophic bounds. The control levers over the money  supply have been lost. The average monthly inflation rate  reached 80 percent in December, that is, the stage of  hyperinflation began. The population's standard of living was  reduced to such an extent that one segment of the citizenry is  forced to worry about physical survival. This is an  unprecedented situation for a country not in a state of war. It  would probably not be an exaggeration to say that Ukraine's path  to a new democratic society and a market economy has turned out  to be more difficult than that of other European countries that  have escaped from totalitarianism. It is difficult to expect  that the private sector will begin to invest its capital on a  massive scale in industrial immovable property in conditions of  economic instability and a lack of clear legal guarantees.  <H3>  Apartments, Dachas, and Garages (Citizens' Immovable  Property) </H3>   The housing market, essentially, has always existed. It is  just that in different times, its affiliation with such of its  forms as legal, semilegal, and "black" has changed. After all,  10 years ago everyone also knew perfectly well that an exchange  of apartments was a veiled form of trade in them, and that the  office dealing with apartment exchanges and the placement of  advertisements simply screened a ramified network of apartment  brokers, who clearly knew the price of a square meter of living  space.    The housing market began to take on clearer outlines in the  past four years. This is connected most of all with the  appearance of more liberal legislative acts and with buyers and  sellers having more precise information on prices for real  estate, thanks to numerous advertisements and announcements in  the press and the emergence of exchanges and real estate  agencies, specialized brokers' offices, and a ramified network  of middlemen.    "Three years ago," says L. Gruskene, president of the  Kristina Ukrainian real estate exchange, "we were selling  apartments for R30,000, R50,000, R70,000, whereas now the tally  is kept in the hundreds of millions of karbovantsy. At the end  of 1990, one could buy a good two-room apartment in downtown  Kiev for $2,000-$3,000. And when we cited such prices to buyers,  they perceived them as absolutely improbably high. Whereas now  such an apartment is evaluated at seven or eight times higher."    In 1991-1992, the high cost of housing in Kiev was  determined  by the projected interest in Ukraine on the part of foreign  investors, who were attracted by the new markets, the highly  optimistic statements by the Ukrainian leadership on the  building of a market economy, and the liberal law on foreign  investments. They actively acquired apartments for offices and  agencies. This also applied to Ukrainian commercial structures,  the entrepreneurial elite, who purchased prestigious housing in  the central part of the city.    Now purchasing power is falling. The interest of foreigners  in Ukraine, as a result of economic instability and the absence  of legal guarantees, has declined sharply. Our own nouveaux  riches have basically satisfied their own requirements.    There is now on the market a large quantity of mid-level  apartments, which are not finding buyers. Their potential takers  are people of fairly decent means, but they do not have the  necessary funds at their disposal. Therefore, demand for real  estate is falling. Over the year, prices for an apartment in  Kiev have fallen by 15-25 percent.    Here is the analysis presented by the analytical service of  the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, which is a leader in the  sale of apartments, dachas, and garages. The volume of deals  involving real estate in 1993 comprised 178.5 billion  karbovantsy. The number of contracts concluded was 3,470. At the  end of December 1993, the proportional share of apartments  according to location in the total volume of those available  constituted: apartments located on the outskirts of town--29  percent; downtown--27 percent; near metro stations--26 percent;  in regions adjoining downtown districts--19 percent. The  greatest proportional share in the total volume of those  available was made up of three-room apartments--38 percent--and  two-room apartments--37 percent. One-room apartments make up 14  percent of the total. The average price of a single square meter  of housing space amounted to: for apartments located in the  center of town--$940; in regions adjoining the center--$795;  near metro stations--$572; and on the outskirts of town--$502.  The offered cost of one square meter of living space at the end  of December 1993, as compared with the beginning of the month,  decreased by 3 percent, on average. Prices for apartments of  various classes in the city of Kiev are given in the table.    It is necessary to keep in mind here that an analysis of  concluded deals pertaining to real estate in Ukraine is made  more complicated. The government decree adopted at the beginning  of the year on currency regulation prohibits settlements on the  exchanges from being conducted in foreign currency. And  hyperinflation renders senseless the calculation of real estate  values in Ukrainian karbovantsy. Therefore, the reality is such:  The contract, for the record, is concluded in karbovantsy, but  is in practice settled in dollars or marks. Here their own  collisions could arise, but the brokers have learned to get  around them.    In the opinion of S. Babich, general director of the  Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, 30 percent of those who now  sell apartments effect their resale at a profit to themselves.    "In order sharply to decrease the price of apartments  offered  for sale and to find an additional source of replenishment for  the city budget," he notes, "We proposed to the Kiev  administration to sell at auction 100-200 newly constructed  apartments quarterly. But they did not do this. But really, at  that time there was the possibility of creating a full-blooded  real estate market and to regulate it in the interests of  various strata of the population."    Aside from Kiev, the sale and purchase of citizens' real  estate is fairly well developed in Kharkov, Lvov, Odessa, and  Crimea. In these cities, the cost of housing amounts to on the  order of 60 percent of that in the capital. In contrast to the  Baltic countries, Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and Moldova, in  Ukraine the migration of the Russian-speaking population to  Russia has practically not been felt in the housing market. A  portion of the well-off citizens of Ukraine has displayed a  desire to acquire real estate in Moscow and in other cities of  Russia. But the share of buyers from the CIS among those wishing  to become owners of real estate in Ukraine is negligible.    Among the most famous firms involved in the purchase and  sale  of apartments, dachas, and garages, in Ukraine the most famous  are the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, the Ukrainian real  estate exchange Kristina (which is a component of the Praveks  concern), the Kiev Universal Exchange, the Yanus real estate  agency, and Kommersant-D in Odessa. These and other firms at the  end of 1993 signed a founding agreement on the creation of the  Association of Realtors of Ukraine, whose president is to be N.  Detochka, head of the Kiev Universal Exchange. The task of the  association is to create consultative information services and  to facilitate collaboration with its colleagues in different  countries.    The law adopted in Ukraine last year on mortgages gives an  opportunity to develop mortgage lending. And the unquestioned  leader here is the Praveks concern. Two of its component  members, the Ukrainian real estate exchange Kristina and the  Praveks-bank, are engaged in the apportionment of currency  credit to physical persons under security of immovable property,  especially apartments. Here, you will not get a loan greater  than half the value of your apartment in dollars, and if you  fail to return the amount, the apartment will be sold at a  profit. Besides the Praveks-bank, the banks IKAB (Kiev) and Land  Union (the city of Chernovtsy) are getting involved in mortgages.    Since the Ukrainian International Currency Exchange was  closed, the real estate market has remained just about the only  barometer allowing for a determination of real benefit from the  government reforms. Therefore, when asked for a prognosis of  real estate prices in 1994, Ukraine's realtors give roughly the  following answer: "Let us wait until 27 March." That is the date  of the elections to the republican parliament.    So then--the market really is eternal and has existed  always.  Only in three guises: legal, semilegal, and "black." The  Ukrainian market will be kept from "blackening" further simply  by social pressure of the population, which has reached its  limit. There is only one way out: to become legal. And this will  probably be the main task of the party in power.

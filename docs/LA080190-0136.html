			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV, FOE CONFRONT ECONOMY;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: A COMMITTEE FORMED WITH YELTSIN SIGNALS THE LEADER'S WILLINGNESS  TO MOVE FASTER TOWARD MARKET REFORMS.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his main political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin,  have formed a joint committee to revamp the Soviet economy, a sign that  Gorbachev is willing to move faster toward market reforms.  </P> <P> The 12-member committee, which held its first meeting today, brought together  moderate reformers loyal to Gorbachev and more radical reformers supporting  Yeltsin, the president of the huge Russian republic who recently quit  Gorbachev's Communist Party.  </P> <P> A Western diplomat termed the move "rather important" because the national  government was in danger of falling far behind economic changes introduced in  Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.  </P> <P> "If they don't do something like this, they are going to be left behind," the  diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Russia is going to move  ahead fast."  </P> <P> More rapid reform of the Soviet economy could also increase the chances for  obtaining Western aid, which Gorbachev says is necessary to reform the economy.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's top economic adviser, Nikolai Y. Petrakov, said in an interview  that the decision to form the committee was "the most important information of  1990" in Soviet domestic politics. He said Gorbachev and Yeltsin signed the  agreement Saturday after several days of talks.  </P> <P> The economists appointed to it will develop a common economic policy for the  nation. Petrakov said it is too early to say what they might recommend, but  their work should be done by Sept. 1 when the national and Russian parliaments  reconvene. Economic reforms will be of top priority at the sessions.  </P> <P> The committee includes such proponents of reform as Petrakov, Deputy Premier  Leonid A. Abalkin, Presidential Council member Stanislav Shatalin, economist  and writer Nikolai Shmelev, Yeltsin deputy Grigory Yavlinsky and Russian  Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov.  </P> <P> The Interfax news service identified Yavlinsky as the author of Yeltsin's "500  Days" economic program to move Russia to a market economy.  </P> <P> Over Gorbachev's objections, Yeltsin was elected in May to head Russia, which  contains three-fourths of the Soviet Union's land and more than half its  people. Since then, he has slowly outlined plans to overhaul the republic's  economy.  </P> <P> He has shown tolerance toward private property and in recent weeks indicated he  intends to radically reform land ownership and seize control of banking. That  brought a sharp response from Gorbachev, who on Sunday urged Soviet republics  not to try to break away from the central money and banking system.  </P> <P> Gorbachev and his premier, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, have moved more slowly on the  economy and are facing sharp criticism for its failures. Yeltsin and other  reformers have urged Ryzhkov to resign. Yeltsin also quit the Communist Party  last month, starting an exodus of leading reformers.  </P></p>

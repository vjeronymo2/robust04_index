			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Plainclothes Israeli troops firing from unmarked cars shot and killed a  Palestinian activist in Gaza City as he was confiscating Israeli-issued  identity cards, witnesses said. At least two cars raced onto a bridge in the  city's Sheik Radwan district where masked Arab youths were seizing the cards,  and their occupants fired from the windows, hitting Iyad Ibrahim Abu Kamal, 18,  in the head, the witnesses said. The magnetic plastic cards, without which Gaza  men cannot travel to work in Israel, have become the center of a vicious  struggle between Israeli occupation officials and Palestinian activists.  </P></p>

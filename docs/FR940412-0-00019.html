			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Restraining Elements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Nine commenters objected to the proposed requirement to add restraining devices to all fittings providing branch line connections. Restraining elements are added when the outlet to the branch line could impede the passage of the smart pig. Many commenters argued that the addition of restraining elements to these fittings may inhibit cleaning of the branch lines by spheres or cleaning pigs. Other commenters pointed out that the use of restraining elements in the main line is unnecessary whenever the branch line has a significantly smaller diameter than the main line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA agrees that the rule should not require restraining elements where they are unnecessary or make impracticable other functions that are an essential and routine part of pipeline operations and maintenance. So, the rule does not include a requirement for installing restraining elements, but leaves their installation to the discretion of the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Offshore Pipelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Eleven commenters recommended that the rule except offshore pipelines. Several commenters based their recommendations on the fact that offshore pipeline networks are tied-in by ``hot-tapped'' or tee connections and these tie-ins are without restraining elements. This type of construction permits cleaning pigs or spheres, required for removal of materials (such as liquids from gas lines and wax from oil lines) that impede normal flow, to pass into laterals of ever increasing diameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The system design is contingent on the passage of these cleaning devices through the various laterals for final tie-in to the liquid trunk (main) lines and to the gas transmission lines. Then, these larger diameter lines transport the cleaning pigs to onshore facilities, for eventual retrieval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator of offshore gas systems said that because of the many subsea tie-ins to pipelines of larger diameter, smart pigs will require some type of elaborate receiving device or physically disconnecting/lifting the pipeline; either of which would be very expensive. Other commenters advised that smart pigs cannot be launched or received subsea. An offshore operator said that new offshore platforms typically connect new platforms to an existing subsea network. Connections to an existing subsea pipeline are ``hot-tapped'' or are extensions to existing laterals. This operator summed up his recommendations by saying that it is impractical to design for the passage of smart pigs through these connections and it is certainly impractical to install subsea traps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also stated that because of space limitations on the offshore platforms, the pipelines (risers) which have been routed up onto the platforms have been designed and constructed with short radius bends and other fittings that are only adequate for the launching of cleaning pigs or spheres. These commenters argue that the construction of the risers with long-sweeping bends on the sea floor and on the platform, and the installation of the longer launchers and receivers required to accommodate smart pigs, would be impracticable. For many of the same reasons, both the TPSSC and the THLPSSC recommended that offshore pipelines be excepted from the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA acknowledges that many subsea pipelines have been designed and constructed without restraining bars on branch line connections, because they would prohibit the passage of cleaning pigs and spheres. This design allows cleaning pigs and spheres to pass through the network of subsea laterals and ultimately into larger transmission or trunk (main) lines that transport gas or liquids to shore facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also apparent to RSPA, that designers of offshore platforms seldom anticipated the space required to accommodate facilities necessary for the operation of smart pigs. Moreover, RSPA accepts that smart pigs cannot be launched or received subsea. However, RSPA does not agree with the commenters or the two advisory committees that all gas and liquid offshore pipelines should be fully excepted from this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For pipelines subject to part 195, the current &sect;195.120 requires that each component of a main line system, other than manifolds, that change direction within the pipeline system must have a radius of turn that readily allows the passage of pipeline scrapers, spheres, and internal inspection equipment. This requirement for main line components to readily allow the passage of smart pigs through changes of direction has been in effect since 1970, when offshore liquid lines became subject to part 195.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 192 has applied to offshore gas lines since 1971. In accordance with the requirements of section 108(b) of the Reauthorization Act, RSPA sees the need for certain new and replacement offshore gas transmission lines and risers from these lines to be designed and constructed to allow passage of smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

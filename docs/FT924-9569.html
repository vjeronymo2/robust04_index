			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: J Sainsbury Another sparkling half-year performance from Sainsbury shows why Tesco has cause to fret about the comparison between the two chains. With profits up 19 per cent, at the same time as its market share rose from 10.2 to 11 per cent, Sainsbury can afford to stand aloof. Even its heavy capital expenditure programme was more than covered by cash flow in the current half, and the outflow for the year is likely to be less than Pounds 150m. This year the company has built on its rock-solid franchise with powerful marketing and promotion to outpace its rivals once more. Yet there are caveats. Sainsbury benefited from its special price promotions, the introduction of credit cards and Sunday opening this year - factors which will make it all the harder to shine in 1993. While the company insists devaluation will not add much to shop prices, it is not clear who will have to absorb the cost. There is also a nagging doubt about overcapacity. The current aggressive pricing between the chains might be symptomatic of recession, or it might herald longer-term problems. Industry returns on new openings are falling, though they are still acceptable. As new superstores cost Pounds 25m, the costs of exit would be high, with the battle for survival bitter. It will be others who feel the majority of that pain. But Sainsbury could perhaps turn up the heat on its weaker brethren by depreciating the value of its freehold stores.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London estate agency fails FOLKARD &amp; HAYWARD Services, one of London's largest independent estate agents, and its sister company Phillip Charles, yesterday went into administrative receivership with debts of Pounds 1.3m. The failure reflects the continued pressure on estate agents' incomes resulting from the collapse in the housing market over the past three years. In spite of expectations that lower interest rates would feed through into an improvement in the housing market, an increased level of interest from buyers had not been translated into sales. 'The hit rate was not as high as anticipated,' said Mr Jason Elles of Ernst &amp; Young, who was appointed administrative receiver. Folkard &amp; Hayward has 11 offices in London that sell properties valued up to Pounds 500,000. Phillip Charles, which caters for first-time buyers, has nine offices in the home counties. Its turnover was about Pounds 2m a year. Mr Elles said the businesses would continue to trade while they sought other buyers. There were Pounds 500,000 of deals in the pipeline which he hoped would go ahead. Mr Elles said he expected to find a buyer for most shops in the next week. A number of potential buyers, including some building societies and individuals, had expressed interest. 'I have already held discussions with a number of interested parties and am optimistic that any early sale of the businesses will be achieved,' Mr Elles added. Folkard &amp; Hayward, founded in 1899, has been through several changes of ownership. The latest owners, Mr Roger Stanley and his wife, bought the business five months ago. The previous owner was Birmingham Midshires, the building society, which was the main lender, together with Provident Life. London estate agents have reported a surge in interest from potential buyers in recent weeks, although the activity over the bank holiday weekend was widely found to be disappointing.</p>

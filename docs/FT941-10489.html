			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / US phone company to launch City business network Competition among tele-communications operators for UK business traffic is set to intensify sharply with the launch of a network in the City of London by US operator MFS Communications. The news came as BT and Mercury announced the abolition of their peak-rate calling bands, cutting between 20 and 25 per cent off prices for weekday calls made between 9am and 1pm. MFS is the largest competitor to the local Bell companies in the US in the provision of telecommunications networks. The company, which had a turnover of Dollars 108.7m (Pounds 72.4m) in 1992 and operates in 14 US cities, will be a powerful competitor in the UK. It has a record of making swift inroads against former monopoly telephone companies with aggressive pricing and marketing. MFS's City of London network, due to start in April, will be its first outside the US. It plans extensions to other UK cities, and expects to provide access to Paris and Frankfurt later this year. BT's price cuts announced yesterday fulfil most of its obligation to reduce prices before July by 7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation, under a price cap agreement with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Residential customers, who will gain little from the abolition of the peak rate, were the main beneficiaries of a new weekend rate cutting long-distance call prices before Christmas. Mercury has matched BT's price cuts, and claims to be cheaper for most long-distance calls, although discount schemes confuse the picture. BT and Mercury will both abolish peak rates on March 9, from when a three-minute BT local call on a weekday morning will cost 15p instead of 20p. A three-minute national call will be 10p cheaper. Mr Michael Hepher, BT group managing director, said: 'This latest price change not only cuts the price of calls for all our customers, but also makes our price structure much simpler and easier to understand.' Mercury competes with BT for long-distance and international traffic. By contrast, MFS has built its business by competing with former local monopoly carriers, offering access to long-distance networks. BT is already under pressure in its local market from cable companies, mostly US owned, building combined cable television and telephone networks. Cable operators have more than 300,000 telephone customers and are growing rapidly. They plan to invest more than Pounds 5bn in UK cable over the next five years.

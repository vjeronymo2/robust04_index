			<p>BFN     [Text] Our great Palestinian people inside the homeland and  abroad celebrate the glorious Land Day, as they continue  relentless struggle to protect their national rights and to  materialize them over the soil of the homeland to establish  their independent state, with the capital Jerusalem, to ensure  the return of every Palestinian to his homeland and to achieve a  durable and just peace for the coming Palestinian generations  over the land of Palestine, the land of peace, justice, and  freedom.    On this occasion, Palestinian people confirm their  indivisible unity, be it on the soil of the homeland or in the  diaspora and continue the confrontation in all its forms,  defending every grain of their homeland's soil, giving martyr  after martyr, proving that any solution that undermines part of  its rights will never pass nor will it be constant or durable.    Our people have affirmed that peace will be achieved  effectively when these hotbeds are removed from the territory of  their homeland in Hebron, Gaza, Nablus, Jericho, and Holy  Jerusalem, the capital of the independent State of Palestine,  the heart of the Palestinian homeland, and the epitome of its  independence as well as the conscience of every Palestinian  wherever his place is in the homeland or outside it.    [Passage omitted] Despite all the forms of suffering,  oppression, and pain, the dawn of freedom is approaching. The  day of the revival of Palestine with its land, people, and  entity has become a reality confirmed by the world, which is  waiting for the moment when it will be undoubtedly achieved on  the political and geographic map in the Middle East. Our land,  which has been irrigated by generous and pure blood, is living  the dawn of the forthcoming independence.    The PLO reiterates its determination to continue the path  consecrated by the sacrifices of Palestinian generations; this  is the path of struggle and steadfastness as well as work for  the just peace, which is based on international legality and its  resolutions, the latest of which is resolution 904 of the UN  Security Council. This provides for international protection for  our people and puts a decisive end to the crimes of the Israeli  army units, their settlers, and enmity and massacres against our  steadfast people on the land of their homeland.    [Passage omitted] We express our salutation to our devoted  martyrs on the glorious Land Day and we promise our people who  are prisoners that the certain day of freedom is approaching.  The great people with its whole population promises that every  day is a holiday of the sacred land, that freedom and  independence will be achieved, and that there will be a return  to the sacred land of Palestine and holy Jerusalem to all our  devoted sons who made sacrifices for it.    In the name of God the merciful and compassionate; that even  the apostle and those of faith who were with him cried: When  will come the help of God? Ah verily, the help of God is always  near. God Almighty has said the truth. [previous paragraph  Koranic verse]</p>

The chairman of  the tribunal, Mrs. Justice Olufunmilayo Oni-Okpaku, gave the  order yesterday when 11 officials of the agency appeared before  her in connection with the missing caches of heroin. She also  ordered another official of the agency, [words indistinct], to  appear before the tribunal on the 15th of this month. Those who  appeared yesterday included the acting director general, Dr.  Yusuf Dibal; the director of personnel, Alhaji Y. Saleh; and  the legal adviser, Mr. Hyeladzie Nganjiwa. Four of the 11 were  discharged on the ground that they were not involved in the  seizure and security of the said drug but only accompanied it to  get destroyed.</p>

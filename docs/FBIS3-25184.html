The peace  talks are expected to resume and focus on issues relating to  national reconciliation.    During a brief stopover in Luanda yesterday, on his way back  from Cote d'Ivoire, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye  expressed, as ever, hope in the future of the Lusaka peace  talks. After condemning the resumption by the Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, of the  fighting in the Central Plateau region, Blondin Beye urged the  international community not to allow the Angolan peace process  to derail.    Speaking to the MPLA-PT media, Blondin Beye said he had met  a  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team  led by UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola during his  stay in Cote d'Ivoire. That UN official added he and the UNITA  team had discussed the Angolan peace process. He also had talks  with other international figures concerning the Angolan problem.</p>

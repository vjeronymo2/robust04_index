			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Euro-court says trial of Saunders was 'oppressive' Alleged fraudsters should be treated in the same way as other suspected criminals and not be deprived of their right to silence, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled yesterday. Its judgment said that the trial of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former chairman of the Guinness drinks company, was unfair and 'oppressive'. As expected, the commission ruled that the trial breached article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights because the jury heard evidence Mr Saunders had given to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors when his right to silence had been removed. The judgment appears to support the interpretation of many UK lawyers that the unique powers given to the Serious Fraud Office under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which also allow the removal of the right to silence, might breach the convention too. The commission did not mention section 2 specifically but ruled: 'It cannot be compatible with the spirit of the convention that varying degrees of fairness apply to different categories of accused in criminal trials. 'The right to silence, to the extent that it may be contained in the guarantees of article 6, must apply as equally to alleged company fraudsters as to those accused of other types of fraud, rape, murder or terrorist offences. There can be no legitimate aim in depriving someone of the guarantees necessary in securing a fair trial.' The commission restricts its criticisms of Mr Saunders' trial to the use of the DTI evidence in a criminal court. It accepted that the 'right to silence' was not guaranteed by article 6 and that this right might not be unqualified. However, the judgment says: 'The very basis of a fair trial presupposes that the accused is afforded the opportunity of defending himself against the charges brought against him. The position of the defence is undermined if the accused is under compulsion, or has been compelled, to incriminate himself.' Legal process on trial, Page 21 Lex, Page 22</p>

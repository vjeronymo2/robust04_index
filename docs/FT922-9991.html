			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / People: Touching base back in London Peter Stafford is returning to London from his native Manchester to become the elected chairman of Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, for the next 12 months. He replaces Michael Blackburn, who is retiring after 38 years with the firm. Stafford will co-ordinate the work of the firm's 16-strong policy-making board. He will also be involved in raising Touche's public profile, and has already stirred the pot by echoing the firm's views that regulation of auditing should be wrested from the professional accountancy bodies and given to an independent organisation. As managing partner at Spicer &amp; Oppenheim in the late 1980s, he negotiated the firm's merger with Touche in 1990, before heading back to Manchester as a senior partner in the local Touche office, to specialise in audit and investigations work. 'I have lived a double life between Manchester and London for many years,' he says. He is likely to continue commuting between the capital and his home in Cheshire, but while in office he will probably have to put on ice working on one of his more consuming hobbies: restoring an antique launch he bought some years ago, and is hoping to convert from petrol to steam engine.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE SCRAPS THEATER BECAUSE OF RISING COSTS  </P> <P> Troubled by rising project costs and an expected slump in the economy, Palmdale  officials have scrapped plans to build a 700-seat theater and now hope to  refurbish a 40-year-old school auditorium for half the price.  </P> <P> The City Council voted 3 to 2 to back away from the theater project Thursday  night after learning that the estimated cost of the proposed 25,000-square-foot  theater center had increased from $4.7 million to $8 million in the past eight  months.  </P> <P> That news, combined with projections of a slowdown in the city's economic  growth, led the council to instead budget $4 million to transform the  boarded-up Maryott Auditorium into a modest, 400-seat, 12,000-square-foot  venue.  </P> <P> Council members acknowledged that they were no longer aiming for a lofty, city  gateway-type project that might attract big-time theater groups headed for Los  Angeles. Instead, they said, they will settle for a small arena to serve the  city's own theater groups.  </P> <P> The immediate effect of the council's change in direction, the latest chapter  in the city's turbulent six-year quest for a theater, is more delays. City  officials had spent years working on plans for a more elaborate renovation of  the old building. But last December, a previous City Council halted that in  favor of building the new theater.  </P> <P> Thursday's council decision infuriated city theater activists. The city budget  already included extra money for the new theater center. Yet many residents  applauded the council's change of heart, saying the extra money could be better  spent on a new library or more parks.  </P> <P> "The Maryott isn't my idea of what we want to have. But I think it will suffice  in the short run," said Councilwoman Janis Hamm, a past supporter of the new  theater center. She and newly elected council members James Ledford and James  Root provided the key votes for the council's reversal.  </P> <P> City officials blamed the rapid escalation in the theater center's cost on  several factors, including nearly a year of inflation from the prior estimate  and changes in the project. They said the earlier estimate failed to account  for the cost of items other than the building itself, such as a parking lot.  </P> <P> The three council members questioned the city's ability to afford such a costly  project and warned that it could drain other city programs. Ledford and Root  questioned Palmdale's need for a new 700-seat theater when the neighboring city  of Lancaster is building a similar project.  </P> <P> "I can't reconcile in my mind the need for two 700-seat theaters," Root said.  The cost of the 725-seat theater in Lancaster, about 10 miles away, has  generated debate. Palmdale officials argue that it will cost up to $13 million,  although Lancaster officials are saying it will cost from $10 million to $12  million.  </P> <P> Palmdale's now-abandoned theater center project stood to cost less because Los  Angeles developer Ron Ordin had agreed to donate the land, a 5.7-acre parcel  along the Antelope Valley Freeway, if the city built a theater there. In  contrast, the old auditorium is located in an older area near downtown.  </P> <P> "This has been sabotaged at the city level. I am demanding answers as to why,"  said an angry David Milligan, executive director of the Antelope Valley  Cultural Foundation, after the council's vote. Since 1984, the foundation has  been the prime supporter of the theater plan.  </P> <P> Milligan said the city's scaled-down plan to renovate the Maryott Auditorium  will not be adequate for Palmdale's two theater groups. And by the time the  city complies with fire, seismic, handicapped access and other codes, he  predicted that the project will cost almost as much as a new theater.  </P> <P> Other residents, though, backed the council's decision. Some argued that the  plan to build a new theater would have saddled the city with hundreds of  thousands of dollars a year in operating costs. Others said the costly project  would only have benefited a few theater devotees.  </P></p>

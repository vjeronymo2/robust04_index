			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / N&amp;P makes Pounds 2m provision for personal pension claims National &amp; Provincial building society, the UK's eighth largest, has made provisions of about Pounds 2m to meet its potential liabilities in respect of the 850 personal pensions it sold to people transferring out of employers' schemes. If that level of provisioning were reflected across the whole financial-services sector, the total set aside for an estimated 500,000 pension transfers sold since 1988 would be more than Pounds 1bn. N&amp;P's Pounds 2m provision comes within a total provision of Pounds 4.8m, it emerged yesterday in the society's 1993 results. Mr Alistair Lyons, the society's finance director, yesterday said the provision had been set before the end of last year and before the full picture from the pensions transfer study carried out by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick had filtered through to the society. The KPMG Peat Marwick study found that nine out of 10 transferred pensions did not comply with regulatory requirements, and that in a smaller number of cases, sales agents appeared to have given suspect advice. Mr Lyons emphasised that there was no particular factor in N&amp;P's pension transfer business that made the society feel it was especially vulnerable in terms of facing potential compensation claims from people who had suffered as a result of poor advice. 'We took quite a generous view about the level of potential cases that may need to be revisited,' he said. 'It may turn out to be a bit over-prudent.' The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is due to publish guidance in July about how companies should compensate customers who have been wrongly advised.

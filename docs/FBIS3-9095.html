[passage omitted]    In Sarajevo a spokesman for the UN High Commission for  Refugees (UNHCR) said the convoy should arrive by Tuesday in the  town, where things looked somewhat better than expected. "The  food situation in Maglaj is not as bad as originally reported,  but the destruction is very considerable. There is not a single  house without serious damage," spokesman Kris Janowski said at a  Sarajevo press briefing. The region's war-weary population had  been described in a recent UN report as walking skeletons. But  Major Simon Macdowell, UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo, told  journalists early indications showed that while the situation  was "far from good" it was "not as desperate as perhaps some  Bosnian radio reports were making out." "There are no signs of  ethnic cleansing in the Maglaj region (which) has suffered worst  from shelling and fighting," he said Monday.    Janowski said the second run would provide a real test of  Serb will to allow humanitarian aid for the 100,000 people  living in the Moslem-dominated enclave, but the UNHCR was not  expecting any trouble. Trapped civilians have been forced to  rely on air drops for aid since ground deliveries were stopped  five months ago. Larry Hollingworth, head of UNHCR operations  in Bosnia, reported that the airdrops had been successful "and  basically kept them alive," said Janowski.    Serb forces withdrew Saturday from positions around Maglaj  after the UN Security Council ordered them to lift their  nine-month siege on March 14. A group of UN peacekeeping  soldiers was allowed in on a reconnaissance mission to set up  the arrival of Sunday's nine-truck convoy from Zenica, which  carried 80 tonnes of food and medical supplies to Maglaj and the  nearby besieged town of Tesanj. Several doctors accompanying the  convoy evacuated nine people "in serious condition (...) injured  during the recent shelling," said Janowski.    Macdowell said it was "still too early" to confirm whether  rumours of a Bosnian Serb army withdrawal from the region were  true. "It is still going to take some time until we have more  freedom of movement, to really be able to assess positions  around the area," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

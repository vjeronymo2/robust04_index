[Endara] Good morning to you Famania and to all your  viewers.  I would like to begin by thanking Professor Ruben Dario Carles  for his remarks about me. I must reiterate that I have a very  high opinion of him. At no time during this political campaign  will I be able to speak ill of him because we have been and will  continue to be friends for the rest of our lives. Moreover, I  must say that as comptroller he always supported my presidency  and I as president supported him as comptroller.    I would like to begin by saying something that all of the  news media have repeated and which you just announced on  television. It has been said that on Saturday I said the  members of Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement]  are traitors. I challenge your television station and the other  news media which reported it, because everything I say in public  is recorded. Bring me the recording in which I characterized  the members of Molirena as traitors. I did not do that and I  would like you to prove that I did without playing any tricks  with the tapes.    I said the members of Molirena had spurned the Arnulfists  [PA]. I wanted to be a witness as to why an agreement could not  be reached by the parties and that is why I called a meeting on  Friday -- I believe it was Friday -- to find out what was  happening with my administration. I did not want to meddle in  politics, I only wanted to know what was happening with my  administration. I reached the conclusion that the PA-Molirena  conflict was solely that Molirena had taken it into their heads  that they wanted a certain electoral circuit when the PA already  had a candidate in that circuit. They felt that their candidate  was deserving of some privilege or other. The PA then proposed  that each party put forward its candidate and allow the people  to make the decision. Molirena did not like this and in my  opinion they spurned and humiliated us. It hurts me very much  when the PA is humiliated or spurned. I know that for certain  political parties we are scum [lumpen], the lowest sector of the  people and they have always despised us. I had never seen  Molirena behave this way and when I saw this it hurt me to the  core; it hurt me very much. I had experienced this situation  with the Christian Democratic Party but never with Molirena and  it truly hurt me. However, I never characterized them as  traitors because they have never been traitors. I challenge you  to bring me the evidence that I characterized them as traitors.    [Famania] Mr. President, we have asked our coordinator to  play the recording of the incident on Saturday. We will be  broadcasting it later so this situation will be clarified. This  incident is also commented on in LA PRENSA's "As of Today"  column but I will leave it at that....    [Endara, interrupting] Yes, but LA PRENSA's "As of Today"  column is not infallible. That column has missed the target  many times, so to speak. I would also like to explain something  else.    [Famania] Go ahead, Mr. President.    [Endara] You have said, and it was announced a while ago on  your television station, that I as president of the Republic  supported Mireya [Mireya Gruber, PA's presidential candidate].  Yesterday I had distributed to all the newspapers the reasons  why I did not attend the PA convention; it was precisely to  avoid supporting any candidate, because I am president of the  Republic. However, during a crisis within my party I must be  with the party, not supporting it as president of the Republic  but as a member. On Saturday night I was so hurt as an  Arnulfist by the mistreatment, contempt, and humiliation we  received from Molirena, that I had to be with the party; not to  support it as president of the Republic or to give it the  state's support, but because I wanted to be present. I have been  and always will be an Arnulfist. However, as president,  although I am an Arnulfist, I will remain neutral. I want  everyone to know: I am and will remain an Arnulfist all of my  life, but I will be neutral as president of the Republic.  Therefore, you must not say that I made statements in support  of Mireya Moscoso de Gruber or that the presidency is behind her.    Furthermore, it is very likely -- I have not made up my mind  yet -- that I will appoint new ministers from the PA. It is  possible. This does not mean that I am supporting the PA  politically because I am going to demand that those ministers  behave the same way I behave. They must not offer to any  political party or candidate their political support, state  support, state property, or their influence.    [Famania] Mr. President, the criticisms that are being  leveled against this weekend's events as they pertain to you and  to the presidency's role in all of this, is that a political  meeting was held at the presidency of the Republic. Second,  that you participated in the meeting, which was attended by the  Arnulfist presidential ticket, and third, that certain  presidential public relations officials even provided reporters  with credentials to participate in the PA's 23 January  convention. This is where doubts about your neutrality emerge,  Mr. President.    [Endara] Let us deal with each accusation separately.  Friday's meeting. [coughs] I held Friday's meeting after  office hours and for the sole purpose of finding out what was  happening with my administration. I saw that the political  parties that had supported my government were engaged in a fight  and this was affecting my government's stability. You had been  reporting this for weeks; for at least 15 days. The problem was  affecting my government's stability and I wanted to meet with  them to find out what was happening. This was the purpose of  Friday night's meeting. I was concerned over my administration  because I am president of the Republic and it is my duty to be  concerned over my administration.    [Famania] A brief question, Mr. President. If this was the  case, why were Mision [National Unity Mission] and Solidaridad  [Solidarity Party] invited?    [Endara] They were invited because they were participants in  the negotiations and I wanted to know who was causing the  problem. I wanted to know what my government's situation was.  How could I exclude them from the meeting when they were  participating in the talks?    On Saturday I visited [the PA headquarters] not to support  the party but to be present at a time of crisis. My party had  suffered a huge slight, it had been humiliated, and I wanted to  share that difficult moment of humiliation; I wanted the party  to have my support, not my political support but the support of  a fellow party member who felt as spurned and humiliated as they  did.    Third, I think you were undoubtedly speaking about  Presidential Press Secretary Rene Hernandez. Hernandez has been  on vacation for approximately two months and I believe he still  has another month to go. During his vacation he can do whatever  he wants to; he could be at the beach but he prefers to do this.  I have no proof that he distributed press [credentials] but  while he is on vacation he can do as he pleases, just as you do.  However, he was not working with the presidency because he is  on vacation.    [Famania] Mr. President can you confirm that changes will be  made? Are you aware that by making these changes the same thing  that happened when the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] was  separated could happen again? Many Panamanians appointed by  Molirena ministers may lose their jobs.    [Endara] Molirena has spoken of resignations. Several  Molirena employees have spoken of resigning and I must remind  you that in the PDC's case, I would estimate that 99 percent of  the separations resulted from resignations, not dismissals. I  believe the same thing will happen with Molirena but they have  not announced that.    [Famania] When will you decide on cabinet changes?    [Endara] I am thinking it over now and I will make the  announcement in due time.    [Famania] Will you appoint Arnulfists or independents?    [Endara] I will make the announcement in due time.    [Famania] These changes could affect your administration.    [Endara] Affect it as a result of the changes? Well, of  course, all changes affect an administration, but the effects  can be favorable or unfavorable. I hope it will be favorable.    [Famania] Mr. President, thank you very much for speaking  with us this morning.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Arts: Of elegance and mild subversion / Review of plays at the never-timid Glasgow Citizens The Glasgow Citizens Theatre has a feel like no other theatre in Britain, but a feel that is a lot like the rest of Glasgow: lively, fashionable, unaristocratic, outgoing, and mildly subversive. The foyer alone has a unique blend of vitality and elegance. But the real excitement derives from the stage. Stages, rather; for the Citz, since 1992, has housed not one theatre but three. Repertory is adventurous, productions imaginative. I have had bad evenings there (few), but not timid ones. Recently, Philip Prowse brought together Rupert Everett and four other actors to perform both Noel Coward's Private Lives and (joined by three more actors) Tennessee Williams's The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore. Prowse is a style merchant; you could never watch a Prowse production and forget that someone had staged it. For these two, his stage was black and white, with a few other very strong colours (like shocking pink); the maid in either play is acted by a man; both plays are set in the present day; and the already stylised parlance of the leading characters is stylised more intensely. But the actors are stimulated by swapping between two such dissimilar vehicles, and the plays are alive. Both were far more brisk, funny, and fresh, than Prowse's current West End Lady Windermere's Fan. No one went further in swapping roles than Everett. Remarkably, in neither role did he fully reveal his most bankable asset - his film-star looks. In both, he seemed to be in disguise, and each disguise was riveting, entertaining, surprising. In The Milk Train, he was the dying ex-beauty Flora Goforth; in Private Lives, he played Victor, Amanda's humourless new husband, created in 1930 by Laurence Olivier. His Victor was a deliberately two-dimensional romp, played with a crusty Prince Charles accent and thick specs. I prefer Coward played 3-D, but Everett's cartoon creation was a load of fun. His Flora, however, was one of those rare travesty performances where a man uses his physical and vocal force not to distort a female character but to intensify it. Everett has large-scale authority onstage. He can command both superficial languor and underlying hysteria, and he uses the full long-limbed physique to great effect. I know that everyone is playing Hamlet these days, but might not Everett reveal more in the role than most? Flora Goforth, in The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore, is one of Tennessee Williams's monstrous regiment. She is trying to finish the memoirs of her racy life while only half admitting that her death is nigh; she is mysteriously visited by Chris, a younger if not young man, a dark angel who prepares her, as he has apparently prepared sundry other women of her international circle, to meet death with a good grace; and meanwhile her time is wasted by another chatty virago, 'the Witch of Capri' (splendidly performed by Georgina Hale). All Flora thinks about is life; she even keeps contemplating Chris as a potential lover. Williams believed 'the play will come off better the further it is removed from conventional theatre', and Prowse surrounded it with various kinds of artifice. Whenever Flora uttered 'a good line', it was followed by instant (taped) applause, in which he briefly revelled - before suddenly cutting it dead with a gesture. Prowse also upped the homo element in the supporting roles. You can imagine the new connotations this gave a play that was already a meditation on the loves and life that are past, and the death that approaches all too fast. And yet the effect made the play not morbid but bracing. Private Lives, though in modern dress, was presented by Prowse as the brittle retreat into escapism that it indeed is. 'Jagged with sophistication' was the style. Greg Hicks was the harshest Elyot I have ever seen, with his cut-the-crap angry drawl; and his characterisation was three-dimensional enough to set the tone for the whole production. The rest were slightly more cartoon-like, but no less vivid. Sophie Ward, with her Grace Kelly looks, was a robust, blasee, vituperative Amanda, and Victoria Scarborough an amusingly doll-like Sibyl. It was astonishing how often the cast charged past surefire laugh-lines but revealed the comedy elsewhere. This Private Lives was all the more refreshing because it made no attempt to be definitive. Meanwhile, in the Stalls Studio, Antony McDonald's staging of Gertrude Stein turns out to be nine plays and a recipe by the great American avant-garde writer. Caesar kisses every night. Lucrezia Borgia had no cousins. Three sisters who are not sisters. To hear Gertrude Stein is, at first, to plunge into nonsense, and she sounds like Lewis Carroll's daughter and heir. Yet the words never lose their sense. The opposite, rather. Stein sounds wonderful, but she never employs words for sound alone. Listening, we are unusually aware of the meanings of each word - often she recycles sentences, with slight variations, to extract maximum ambiguity from them - and it is the fact that we understand that makes us so deliciously baffled. McDonald, one of the most original designer-directors on the British scene, fills the stage with a little cartoon house and its solid, tilted, wooden shadow on the floor. Four microphones hang from the ceiling, into which the five actors sometimes speak. But, wherever we hear the voices coming from, we are never in doubt that this is live theatre. Two of the cast are outstanding: Paola Dionisotti and Siobhan Stanley. Dionisotti's wonted vigour and economy pay great dividends here. Stanley has wit, elegance, mordancy, pathos, stillness, and perpetual ambiguity. I would like to see her now in a single large role. In Stein, she perfectly leads us into the mesmerising rings and enigmas of the language. Gertrude Stein is in repertory at the Citizens Stalls Studio, Glasgow, until December 3.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bowater buys window company for Pounds 35m Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, yesterday announced its first sizeable acquisition this year with the purchase of a windows manufacturer for Pounds 34.75m in cash and a further performance-related deferred payment of up to Pounds 5m. The Midlands-based WH Smith &amp; Sons (Extrusions) fabricates plastic window units as well as manufacturing the PVC-u surrounds. The company is believed to have about 10 per cent of the UK public sector market. Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, said the acquisition would bring two benefits to the group's Bowater Windows subsidiary. 'First we will get window profiles from the UK and second, it is a way for us to get into the commercial market,' he said. Bowater Windows, which is estimated to make profits of about Pounds 15m on sales of Pounds 160m, claims about 10 per cent of the UK market for sales to residential customers. It sells direct to consumers, as well as supplying systems to local retailers. The purchase had been prompted by the strong increase in the value of the D-Mark, Mr Hartnall said. Bowater Windows had been importing plastic profiles from Germany, but exchange rate changes had made prices prohibitive. The acquisition is expected to enhance earnings in the first year. Smith returned operating profits of Pounds 4m for the year to April 30, on sales of Pounds 20m. Its net assets at the end of the financial year were Pounds 9.3m. Certain assets were sold to the vendors after April 30 for their net book value of Pounds 1.7m.</p>

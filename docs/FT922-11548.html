			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / 'Modest' inflation forecast by bank BRITAIN is on course for its best inflation performance in three decades, according to Lloyds Bank's monthly economic bulletin, published today. It said the next four years would be characterised by 'modest' inflation as pay settlements continued to fall and the pound steered clear of devaluation. Pay settlements were expected to fall to nearly 3 per cent by the middle of next year, if the recovery followed the trend of the last recovery in the early 1980s.</p>

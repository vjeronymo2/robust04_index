Final  </P> <P> 'PACIFIC HEIGHTS' TOPS BOX OFFICE; 'GOODFELLAS' 2ND;  </P> <P> MOVIES: 'GHOST,' THIRD PLACE IN TICKET SALES, SHOWS NO SIGNS OF DYING.  </P> <P> The Yuppie thriller "Pacific Heights" claimed the No. 1 spot during its opening  weekend at the box office, with ticket sales of approximately $7.1 million.  </P> <P> Starring Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine as landlords who wind up wishing  they hadn't rented their San Francisco apartment to a cunningly deranged  Michael Keaton, the 20th Century Fox film -- directed by John Schlesinger --  opened at 1,284 theaters for a per-screen average of approximately $5,529.  </P> <P> With ticket sales of about $6 million, the gangster epic "GoodFellas" slid to  second place -- but it dropped just 6% from the film's previous opening  weekend. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and  Ray Liotta, the film had a per-screen average of about $4,647 on 1,291 screens.  </P> <P> In third place, with no sign of dying, was Paramount Pictures' "Ghost."

At 1,253 screen, it averaged just $1,675 per-screen.  </P> <P> Among the weekend openers, Epic/Triumph's science-fiction thriller "I Come in  Peace," starring Dolph Lundgren as a detective on the trail of a murderous  alien, had ticket sales of about $1.9 million on 1,073 screens, for an average  of $1,770 and seventh place. And Peter Bogdanovich's heavily promoted  "Texasville" had ticket sales of about $900,000 on 354 screens -- for a poor  average of $2,542 -- and 11th place. From Columbia, it is the sequel to his  1971 landmark, "The Last Picture Show."  </P> <P> Rounding out the weekend's top 10, in approximate figures, were: MGM/UA's  "Death Warrant," sixth place, with ticket sales of $1.9 million; Paramount's  "Funny About Love," eighth, $1.6 million; Columbia's "Flatliners," ninth, $1.6  million; Warner Bros.'

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: SocGen debt under review SOCIETE Generale has become the latest big French bank to be put under surveillance by Moody's, the international credit rating agency, with a view to downgrading the ratings of its long-term deposits and debt. The French banks have had a difficult time in the past year because of the slowdown in France's economy and their exposure to bad loans. The rating of Paribas, the prestigious investment bank, was recently downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, although it emerged unscathed from a review by Moody's. Societe Generale, which currently has an Aaa rating, recently reported a return to profits growth when its net profits rose from FFr2.68bn in 1990 to FFr3.37bn (Dollars 630m) in 1991, although it has not yet returned to its 1989 level. Moody's said it had put Societe Generale under surveillance because of the fall in its net margins and the high level of its loan loss provisions. Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino had its senior debt downgraded from AA1 to AA3 by Moody's.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir Tangle"] </F>   [Text] The information that Pakistan's military  intelligence department, the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI],  is helping Kashmiri militants carry out terrorist and subversive  activities in the state has not been provided by an Indian  official in New Delhi but by the United States itself. This was  stated in a report submitted recently before the U.S. House of  Representatives. The report said Pakistani spies put on the  uniform of Indian soldiers and indulged in subversive activities  in Kashmir. After seeing this report, it will not be proper for  U.S. officials to say that sufficient evidence does not exist to  prove Indian allegations of Pakistani interference in Kashmir.  Instead of expressing concern over the false allegations of  human rights violations by Indian forces in Kashmir, Washington  should ask Pakistan to stop meddling in the valley. If this is  done then the peace-loving people of the state will give a sigh  of relief.    Pakistani agents are not only active in Kashmir but also in  other parts of India. There is hardly a place in the country  where the ISI agents are not operating. According to the Home  Ministry's intelligence reports, Pakistani spies were behind the  explosions in Bombay and other places. They operate everywhere  particularly in busy places such as streets, offices, markets,  and crowded train compartments. These agents have already  caused great losses to life and property. It may be true that  the intelligence agency of the Indian Government, to hide their  own inefficiency and failures, are shifting the blame for all  mishaps onto Pakistan. But from the incidents occurring in  Kashmir and other states it appears that Pakistan has a role in  fomenting trouble and tension in this country. It seems very  keen to encourage secessionist movements in Kashmir and in the  northeastern region of the country by aiding militancy.    There is no doubt that tension along the border of Kashmir  has increased manifold. Both the activities of the militants  and the provocations created by Pakistani soldiers have  simultaneously increased. The situation along the border has  deteriorated to such an extent that the government has been  compelled to ask the armed forces to remain on alert to render  any assistance needed by the Border Security Force. An  improvement in the situation cannot be expected as Islamabad is  repeatedly threatening war and making statements that are not  conducive to peace. It is unfortunate that in Pakistan  anti-India statements are made for winning elections. This is  understandable. But, till now the statements of Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto have not been encouraging. Benazir's position  has become shaky due to stiff opposition from Nawaz Sharif on  one hand and the severe family conflict on the other. But  nothing serious has happened for which Benazir Bhutto should  become upset or reckless. It will be good for Bhutto if she  realizes this at the earliest.    It is difficult for New Delhi to give concessions to  Islamabad. It has also not been possible for the Indian  Government to take the necessary initiatives needed to normalize  ties between the two countries. India should take steps to  remove fear and mistrust from the mind of Pakistan. Surely both  sides do not want another war. Not all problems can be resolved  militarily. Steps are needed for a peaceful settlement of all  disputes. It appears now that a political solution should be  found to the Kashmir issue. The government is making efforts to  bring about administrative changes in Kashmir in order to  consolidate its position. But why are efforts being made to  give so much importance to Dr. Farooq Abdullah [former chief  minister of state] now? Is he very important politically? At  present, neither him nor his party, called the National  Conference, have the support of a majority of the population.  No one will forget how he left the country and deserted his  close associates in the time of danger. Why can't the  government find a person in the state who enjoys the confidence  of the people and who can help it find a political solution to  the Kashmir tangle?</p>

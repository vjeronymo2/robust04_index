			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Frustration grows on brink of Gatt deal Top international trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday voiced concern over delays by the US and European Union in settling long-standing disagreements on opening their markets to farm and manufactured goods. There was also frustration among developing country negotiators over poor offers to open markets to their exports. Negotiators from the 116 countries in the Uruguay Round welcomed signals from the US and the EU that talks in Brussels this week have brought the two to the brink of agreement on a bilateral market access deal. But several warned that a failure to finalise the deal by Monday 'would be very serious for the round'. Next week is the last full week of negotiation if the deadline of December 15 is to be met. Leaders elsewhere were encouraged by the week's developments. President Francois Mitterrand of France said during a visit to Switzerland that indications for the US-EU talks were 'optimistic'. In Germany, which has worked hard to broker disagreements between the US and France, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, said he was 'cautiously optimistic for the first time' over prospects for a successful Uruguay Round outcome. In Copenhagen, Mr Henning Christophersen, EU finance commissioner, said the Commission expected to meet on Monday evening to study a draft US-EU deal. Meanwhile, most Gatt negotiators remained in the dark on details of the prospective US-EU deal, which is expected to be unveiled after further meetings in Brussels on Monday between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart. Both trade negotiators adjourned on Thursday after 30 hours of almost continuous negotiation, Mr Kantor for consultations in Washington with President Bill Clinton, and Sir Leon to meet EU ministers. After a four-hour Gatt discussion on the impact of the round on developing countries, Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's veteran Gatt ambassador, reflected concerns of many developing countries when he complained of 'a deep imbalance in the exchange of concessions in areas of interest to developing countries.' He was particularly concerned about improved market-opening offers for textiles and clothing, and farm products - key disputed sectors in the US-EU negotiations. He hoped the coming days would bring 'some rectification'.</p>

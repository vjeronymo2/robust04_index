			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Government has adopted a decision to  join the agreement on patent cooperation signed on 19 June 1970  in Washington. As of 11 March this year, there were 67 states  that are members of this agreement.    By joining this agreement, Lithuania will have to upgrade  its  rules of patent preparation and its system of classification and  appraisal. From now on, information about patents issued by the  Lithuanian State Patent Bureau will be provided to the  headquarters of the patent cooperation agreement in Geneva. The  State Patent Bureau will work mostly with foreigners who seek  protection for their technological innovations on Lithuania's  territory.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Experts attack insolvency laws Urgent reform of the insolvency laws to correct serious injustices was called for yesterday by Justice, the civil liberties pressure group. A committee chaired by Mr David Graham QC and including Mrs Justice Arden and Mr Philip Pink, former deputy inspector-general of the government's insolvency service, concluded there was 'a serious imbalance' in the system which operated overwhelmingly to the prejudice of small businesses and individuals. The system introduced by the 1986 Insolvency Act produced 'minimal financial benefits' for unsecured creditors, and a lack of alternative procedures forced far too many small consumer debtors into bankruptcy. Bankruptcies have risen from about 4,000 a year at the time of the Cork committee's review of insolvency law at the end of the 1970s to 40,000 in 1993. The committee says that if the injustice to ordinary creditors is not remedied soon it will result in the 'bankruptcy of bankruptcy'. By contrast the government has done extremely well out of the present regime. In 1992-93 it earned more than Pounds 50m from holding funds of insolvent estates, Pounds 9m more than it costs to run the insolvency service. Insolvency practitioners and large secured creditors such as banks have also benefited. The committee recommends: The appointment of an insolvency ombudsman. More advice for small debtors provided by the government and insolvency practitioners on a 'pro bono' basis. The creation of a two-tier bankruptcy system to separate serious or fraudulent cases from ordinary small debtors. A creditors' charter to ensure creditors' concerns are adequately met by insolvency practitioners. Insolvency Law: An Agenda for Reform. Justice, 59 Carter Lane, London EC4. Pounds 4.</p>

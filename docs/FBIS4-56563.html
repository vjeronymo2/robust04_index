			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] Responding to a question asked by a Cuban reporter,  President Clinton reiterated variations of an aged anti-Cuban  policy of the Cold War. On the Global Forum program, which  according to reports was viewed by more than 200 million people  in different parts of the world, including the United States of  course, Clinton backed the Torricelli Law and said that Cuba  should assume the model of democracy that is pleasing to  Washington, so that the United States can modify its policy  toward our country. Up to a certain point his desire to secure  the electoral votes of the State of Florida for his aspirations  to be reelected as president weighs on White House decisions  regarding Cuba.    Despite the previous points, which are a variation of the  same issue, certain tones were observed in Clinton's answer to  reporter Taladrid, of Cuban television. I believe that, despite  all the boring anti-Cuba rhetoric that in fact violates  principles of international rights, the UN Charter, and the  reformed agreements of the General Accord on Tariffs and Trade,  the anti-Cuba policy of the current U.S. Administration is not  identical to that of the Republican decade.    Maybe, during his second and last term, Clinton will listen  to the demands of important sectors from political, industrial,  trade, and intellectual circles within the United States and  decide to modify the conservative and outdated aspects of his  predecessors' anti-Cuba policy. But the fact remains that today,  taking into account the aforementioned tones, that the policy of  imperial hegemony remains in force.</p>

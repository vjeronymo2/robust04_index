"I have never experienced any yearning to betray my  people in the Orange Free State or my party," Dr Gous, who  represents the Parys constituency, said in a statement.    Dr Gous said African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson  Mandela and ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had repeatedly  stated that plans were being made for South Africa to become a  unitary state and that there would be no Afrikaner volkstaat  [homeland]. "Measured against these utterances, it is clear  that if a volkstaat does not come into being before the April 27  elections, the legal implication that it could possibly come  into being after that date, is meaningless." Any reasonable  person could see that the so-called constitutional concessions  would not realise the ideal of the Afrikaner people, he said.  "Therefore, it is impossible to convince us to participate in  such an election."    Dr Gous called for something concrete, not vague promises,  to  create the basis for positive negotiations.    Dr Gous was one of eight CP MPs named by the SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] as having been absent during  parliamentary voting on amendments to the interim constitution  and the electoral act. The SABC claimed this could indicate a  possible split in the party over participation in the elections.</p>

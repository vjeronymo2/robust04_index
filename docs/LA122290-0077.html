			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV FAILS TO TALK SHEVARDNADZE OUT OF RESIGNING;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: BUT A TOP KREMLIN ADVISER SAYS THE DEPARTING FOREIGN MINISTER MAY  MOVE TO ANOTHER LEADERSHIP POST ON THE PRESIDENT'S 'TEAM.'  </P> <P> With world leaders worried about the future of Soviet foreign policy and  domestic politics abuzz with confused speculation, President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev met on Friday with Eduard A. Shevardnadze for a two-hour talk that  failed to persuade the foreign minister to withdraw his bombshell resignation.  </P> <P> But a close Gorbachev adviser said he believed that Shevardnadze, who announced  his resignation Thursday as a protest against what he termed the country's  encroaching "dictatorship," could still move to another leadership post.  </P> <P> "I am sure Shevardnadze will stay on Gorbachev's team," Georgy K. Shakhnazarov,  a political scientist who advises Gorbachev on domestic reforms, told the  official news agency Tass.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze's future and the real motives behind his resignation dominated  gossip in the marble halls of the Congress of People's Deputies, the national  Parliament, on Friday, with theories of Byzantine political machinations  abounding and few people willing to accept the foreign minister's word that he  resigned in outrage at criticism from reactionaries.  </P> <P> "Either Gorbachev pushed him into it, or Gorbachev let him know he was prepared  to sacrifice him, or this is all just some maneuver," Leningrad Deputy Yuri  Boldyrev speculated. "I'm still trying to understand it."  </P> <P> Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Gorbachev's spokesman, appeared in the Congress' lobby on  a mission of reassurance in the late afternoon to tell reporters that the  Soviet president and Shevardnadze had just met for a long talk, mainly on  day-to-day foreign affairs, including the crisis in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Asked if Shevardnadze had changed his mind about leaving, Ignatenko said,  "Everything remains as it was in his speech, but he is continuing to fulfill  his functions."  </P> <P> As for the concern expressed by Western leaders and political scientists that  Shevardnadze's resignation heralds a turn for the worse, at home and in foreign  policy, Ignatenko said: "Gorbachev will study the reaction from abroad with the  calmness characteristic of him."  </P> <P> And in a move calculated to signal that the Soviet Union's foreign policy  remained unchanged, despite Shevardnadze's resignation, Gorbachev sent a  message to the Gulf Cooperation Council reaffirming Moscow's support for the  U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "I would like to confirm the determination of the Soviet Union to stand by  international law and achieve restoration of the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of Kuwait," said the message, carried by Tass.  </P> <P> Beyond a printed appeal signed by 22 reformist deputies for a broad coalition  of democratic forces, Shevardnadze's stunning gesture did not immediately have  the effect that he said he wanted -- persuading liberals who had "run away into  the bushes" to stand and fight the government's shift toward the reactionary  right.  </P> <P> But his warnings of dictatorship brought a powerful response, with several  speakers at the Congress carrying them even further.  </P> <P> Anatoly A. Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, predicted that, if the economy  continued to disintegrate, then within months, "All of us, democrats, radicals  and conservatives, will come scraping and bowing to the military and say 'Come  and rule us.' "  </P> <P> Vladimir K. Chernyak, a deputy from the Ukraine, said: "Gorbachev himself  stands at the center of the coup, even if he doesn't realize it. By demanding  more and more powers for himself, he's creating the legal foundations for a  dictatorship -- possibly not for himself."  </P> <P> The warnings came as the Congress began to address key constitutional  amendments that Gorbachev has proposed to increase his presidential powers,  replacing the overgrown Council of Ministers with a Cabinet directly  subordinate to him and adding the post of vice president.  </P> <P> Several Congress deputies and observers from Georgia, Shevardnadze's home  republic, said they believe it was the issue of the vice presidency that  prompted the foreign minister's decision.  </P> <P> Gorbachev disclosed Thursday that he had planned to nominate Shevardnadze as  his No. 2 in command.  </P> <P> In fact, said Klara Abramiya, correspondent for the state-run Georgian Republic  newspaper, "Gorbachev betrayed him" by planning to make Shevardnadze take on,  with the vice presidency, the dirtiest of the country's work -- suppressing  separatist movements in the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics in a  last-ditch attempt to keep the country together.  </P> <P> "They wanted to do everything through his hands. And he'd never agree to  sending the army into Tbilisi," she said, referring to the Georgian capital.  </P> <P> Abramiya predicted Shevardnadze "will never return" to the post that won him  worldwide acclaim over five years of revolutionizing Soviet foreign policy.  </P> <P> Tass quoted a similar analysis from "a formerly prominent Soviet diplomat" it  did not identify.  </P> <P> "Shevardnadze was definitely aware that the post of vice president was being  reserved for him, and not wishing to assume unpopular domestic  responsibilities, which he could not avoid in such a post during this critical  period of the country's history, he decided to take a step that would make his  election impossible," the diplomat said.  </P> <P> Other unsubstantiated theories circulating at the Congress held that  Shevardnadze wanted to go back to Georgia and help in its nationalist revival;  that he simply got carried away with his emotions and would eventually consent  to be vice president; that he planned to transfer his loyalties to Russian  Federation leader Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's political nemesis.  </P> <P> But Shevardnadze offered no further public explanations on Friday. His  spokesman, Vitaly I. Churkin, would not discuss the resignation further.  </P> <P> The popular foreign minister's resignation mystified, but it also reawakened  interest in politics among Soviet citizens, who have largely lost faith in  Gorbachev's reforms and become far more interested in finding food.  </P> <P> A newspaper editor from the Black Sea port of Sevastopol said that for the  first time in months, he heard passengers on the bus talking about national  politics.  </P> <P> "Shevardnadze has shaken everyone," he said. "This has had a really big  resonance. People are even forgetting about the shortage of food."  </P> <P> Most of the traditional Soviet press tended to bury Shevardnadze's dramatic  speech in the middle of long reports on the Congress.  </P> <P> But the army newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda bannered its front page with the  headline "Is Shevardnadze Leaving?"  </P> <P> And the new Nezavisimaya Gazeta, or Independent Newspaper, featured a grid of  photographs of top government officials with a box over the title "foreign  minister" filled only by a big, black question mark.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Elizabeth Shogren in Moscow contributed to this report.  </P></p>

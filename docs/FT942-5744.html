			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Kravchuk defied over election The Ukrainian parliament yesterday voted to proceed with presidential elections, over-riding proposals for a postponement from the incumbent, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Mr Kravchuk, one of seven candidates registered for the June 26 poll, had asked parliament to delay elections pending a clear definition of the consitutional powers of the president, prime minister and government. But in the past few days he seems to have resigned himself to his fate. He virtually abandoned his attempt to cancel the election less than a month away and has reluctantly relaunched his campaign. Before the vote, he softened his plea to deputies, saying: 'I believe the election must take place. But it must take place only when supported by a legal basis. If parliament wants Ukraine to remain independent and democratic, it must take reponsibility to prepare these documents by June 26.' Deputies voted 201-69 in favour of a resolution which said postponing the election was impractical as the campaign was already well under way. The resolution called for parliamentary committees to set down the powers of state institutions within 10 days. The vote against Mr Kravchuk's proposal represents a rare consensus in the Kiev assembly. The recently elected parliament, deeply divided between Russia-oriented leftists and Europe-leaning nationalists, is barely able to sit in the same room together while it waits for a third of its ranks to be elected. Kiev is threatened by separatism in its Russian-dominated Crimea region and an unresolved dispute with Russia on dividing the Black Sea fleet. Mr Kravchuk's antics over the presidential election have added to the confusion. First he made 'a final decision not to run' and floated a plan to cancel the election and rule by decree. Badly received, the plan was ditched for an alternative strategy: registering as a candidate, but launching a campaign of persuasion to postpone the elections. Mr Kravchuk's repeated appeals arguing further elections would bring about a 'vacuum of power' fell on deaf ears. While his control over the nation's media failed to earn him support, he took his postponement message to Ukraine's regions, cutting deals with local bosses. But his competitors, seeing Mr Kravchuk trails in polls in most of Ukraine, set up a momentum toward proceeding with the presidential elections.</p>

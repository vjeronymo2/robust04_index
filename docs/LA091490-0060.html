			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNDREDS FLEE MORE CARNAGE IN SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> Hundreds of black families abandoned hope for peace here Thursday after another  night of carnage and quietly lugged their possessions out of the dusty squatter  camp they call Phola Park, or "place of rest."  </P> <P> Shopping carts and wheelbarrows piled high with belongings were guided down the  bumpy paths past corpses left from the night before. Sooty sheets of corrugated  metal from nearly 800 burned shacks groaned in the wind.  </P> <P> "The attackers are coming back," said Lena Khumalo, 81, who balanced a large  basket of dishes on her head. "We must leave now."  </P> <P> On Thursday, as the death toll from a month of factional fighting in  Johannesburg townships soared to more than 750, many South Africans worried  that the country was on the brink of uncontrollable urban war.  </P> <P> In the latest violence, the police said, at least 26 blacks were killed and  more than 100 injured Thursday evening when six black youths shot and stabbed  passengers on a crowded Johannesburg commuter train.  </P> <P> Passengers leaped from windows of the moving train as the attackers opened  fire, and victims were found along a stretch of three railway stations east of  Johannesburg. The train was headed toward southeastern townships, including  Tokoza and neighboring Katlehong.  </P> <P> A motive for the attack was not known, but a police spokesman said it was  thought to be related to the internecine war. Similar gang shootings of black  commuters and pedestrians in Johannesburg earlier this week took three lives.  </P> <P> The seams of black society appeared frayed almost beyond repair in Tokoza and  other townships Thursday after another week of the fighting, which has pitted  migrant Zulu workers in the Inkatha Freedom Party against non-Zulu residents  supporting the African National Congress.  </P> <P> Authorities cut power to Tokoza and Katlehong on Thursday in a dispute over a  4-year-old rent boycott, and community activists said the move could exacerbate  the already volatile situation. A freshly painted slogan on a Tokoza wall  characterized the atmosphere. It said: "Viva Beirut."  </P> <P> The peace process recently undertaken with such promise by the government and  the ANC seemed particularly endangered by the bloodshed. And among Tokoza  residents, confidence in the ability of the police or even black ANC leaders to  stop the violence appears to have been eroded.  </P> <P> Witnesses to attacks Tuesday and Wednesday nights in Phola Park spoke of  heavily armed Zulu invaders in red headbands being assisted by a dozen or more  white men the residents believe to have been police.  </P> <P> Young ANC supporters said they needed weapons, not words of reconciliation,  from leaders such as Nelson Mandela.  </P> <P> "They should arm the people and suspend the negotiation process," said Prince  Mhlambi, 22. "How are we to protect ourselves?"  </P> <P> Mhlambi spoke proudly of Phola Park's "strong defense committee," which he  predicted "might also kill some police tonight."  </P> <P> Mandela, the ANC deputy president, told President Frederik W. de Klerk this  week that his supporters' demand for weapons to defend themselves "will be  difficult to resist" if the violence continues to escalate. The ANC announced  Thursday that it has called an emergency meeting of the organization's national  executive committee for next Tuesday to discuss the violence.  </P> <P> ANC supporters have not been the only victims of the violence, however, and  Inkatha leaders say their supporters are only defending themselves.  </P> <P> Twenty-five Zulu migrant workers were hacked to death this week in Tembisa, and  dozens of worker hostels, home to thousands of Zulus, have been attacked and  gutted by fire in recent weeks.  </P> <P> In the hours before the Zulus advanced on Phola Park on Wednesday, ANC  supporters stopped a black taxi driver on a nearby road and posed questions in  Zulu. The driver, not knowing whether the mob was Inkatha or ANC, answered in  Zulu and was beaten to death as reporters watched.  </P> <P> The ANC and Inkatha blame each other for the trouble. But the ANC also has  blamed right-wing elements of the police, who the ANC says are trying to sow  discord among blacks and undermine the peace process.  </P> <P> Whatever the cause, hospital wards and refugee centers are overflowing. And the  living quarters of black South Africans, already in desperately short supply,  are steadily being destroyed.  </P> <P> The current wave of township violence began Aug. 13 in Phola Park, a 5-year-old  squatter settlement on the edge of Tokoza. Its 35,000 residents have neither  running water nor electricity.  </P> <P> Although the residents come from various ethnic backgrounds, many are Xhosas,  like Mandela, and that link with the ANC has made them a target of  Inkatha-supporting Zulus. In the past month there have been six attacks on the  squatter camp. About 350 shacks were burned down Tuesday night and 400  Wednesday night. All but a few hundred of the inhabitants have fled.  </P></p>

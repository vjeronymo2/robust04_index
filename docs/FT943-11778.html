			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Verson plans US float to reduce borrowings Verson International, the capital equipment manufacturer, plans to float its US operations on Nasdaq in order to reduce its gearing of 440 per cent. The company made the announcement as it disclosed its fourth successive annual pre-tax loss and promised markedly higher sales in the year to end-January 1996. The deficit for the year to January 31 1994 was Pounds 8.19m, down from Pounds 10.1m last time, on turnover ahead to Pounds 99.3m (Pounds 82.4m). There was a Pounds 3.26m operating loss against a profit of Pounds 1.19m. Losses per share were 5.5p (7.12p). Borrowing, in spite of a formal debt reduction programme started in 1992, has been constant for the last two years at about Pounds 54m. Shareholders' funds at the end of the last financial year were Pounds 12.2m. 'We were enjoying the support of our bankers before we started talking to them about this approach (the flotation),' said Mr Tim Kelleher, chairman. 'They didn't pressure us but they were pleased when we came forward with the plan,' he added. Verson expects to place 50 per cent of the enlarged equity of its US holding company sometime in the next 12 to 24 months, depending on the state of the market and its own order book. Mr Philip Shepheard, an analyst at James Capel, Verson's broker, calculated the value of the US operations at Dollars 90m (Pounds 58.8m). Looking at likely future movements in shareholders' funds, he estimated that gearing could come down to about 70 per cent after the flotation. Financial difficulties hit Verson when demand dropped sharply after the Gulf war in 1990. However, it said that, at Pounds 58.8m, the size of its order book now is 95 per cent larger than this time last year, all group subsidiaries would improve profitability this year and there should be a marked increase in shipments during the 1995-96 year. The shares responded with a rise of 2 1/2p to 20p.</p>

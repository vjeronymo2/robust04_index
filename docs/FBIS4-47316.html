M. Malkov, Novosibirsk; </F> UDC 533.697+532.517.4]    [Abstract] In chemical and gas dynamic lasers, phase  aberrations form in the resonator cavity on density  inhomogeneities in the medium. These inhomogeneities occur in  the stream beyond a specific nozzle. The degree of curvature of  the two-dimensional edge as radiation passes through the medium  determines optical quality. This paper studies the optical  quality of the stream beyond flat nozzles typically used in gas  dynamic lasers and cellular nozzles used in chemical and gas  dynamic lasers. Phase distortions occur in both regular and  turbulent structures. The stream in the resonator cavity was  sampled with a small diameter beam. The focal point method was  used to study the effect of stream features beyond flat and  cellular nozzles on the optical quality of the medium. Light  scattering occurs in turbulent wakes. Phase changes in the light  beam are due to the structure and size of the wakes. Flat  nozzles provide no advantage over cellular nozzles for  resonators with a stream of around 80 m or greater.

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Rover ownership contentious to the end - BAe Liberated British Aerospace's ownership of Rover is proving contentious to the last. When the merger was first announced, six years ago today, the air was thick with accusations about state assets being sold for a song. Now, it seems, comes the proof. BAe paid Pounds 150m and is getting Pounds 800m. It will book a profit of some Pounds 400m on the deal. Its shares rose 12 per cent yesterday. The UK car industry is being sold down the river, and the UK taxpayer loses again, charge critics of the deal . Not at all, says BAe. 'It's totally unrealistic to draw a direct comparison between the Pounds 150m and the Pounds 800m,' Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive said. 'Our total investment is many, many times Pounds 150m.' The point is reiterated by Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director. 'I'm not sure we're ahead on the deal at all,' he said. 'It's quite difficult to get a handle on it. We invested the original money, then we had to pay back the sweeteners (Pounds 57m BAe had to repay the UK government) and then we invested between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m of capital expenditure a year. During that time, we got almost nothing out.' There is room for scepticism here. First, the Pounds 1bn-plus of capital expenditure was largely financed by Rover itself. Second, BAe extracted a large but unspecified amount of land and property from Rover over the years, and will hold on to it after the BMW deal goes through. The cynic might say that Rover was merely parked with BAe by the UK government for six years, until its sale to a foreign owner became politically acceptable. If so, Mr Lapthorne insists, BAe did no more than break even on the parking fee. However, he adds, 'we enjoyed living in a house with a posh car outside it. It made us look wealthier than we were.' In other words, he says, Rover's assets inflated BAe's balance sheet. 'With that assistance, we were able to carry through some quite difficult decisions.' The Pounds 400m profit due in the 1994 accounts, says Mr Lapthorne, is a pure book-keeping item. For the technically minded, it goes as follows. When Rover was acquired, BAe wrote its assets up by Pounds 850m. Under new accounting rules on disposals, this must be written back as negative goodwill, giving rise to an Pounds 850m profit. But Rover is being sold for Pounds 450m below book value, so the resulting profit is only Pounds 400m. But the benefits of the deal are by no means illusory, says Mr Lapthorne. 'You have to get clear the distinction between book-keeping and banking.' At present, BAe has a daily average of Pounds 200m debt on its balance sheet attributable to Rover, and another Pounds 700m off balance sheet tied up in working capital. Add to that the Pounds 800m proceeds of the deal and BAe will save or receive interest on a total of Pounds 1.7bn. Thus, says Mr Lapthorne, his interest bill drops by Pounds 120m a year. So what will BAe do with the difference? Mr Evans was coy about this yesterday, beyond saying BAe would use it to strengthen its defence and aerospace businesses. However, the general thinking is clear enough. 'Having cars and aerospace together is financially daft,' Mr Lapthorne says. 'Both of them are financially intensive, and both need a strong balance sheet. That can be seen as a source of weakness if people know you can't afford to go both ways. Now, we can sit round any table in the world in the aerospace industry, and we're strong.' The inference is plain. In the defence business particularly, the up-front costs of development can be formidable, and not all customers can afford them. Now, BAe is in a position to offer more financial help to customers as a means of clinching the contract. This also offers a clue to why BAe was so adamant that it wanted an assured exit route from Rover, and indeed why it was prepared to sell at a low point in the cycle. Financing stocks in the car industry is hugely expensive, even in a downturn. In an upturn it could become prohibitive. 'The problem would always be', says Mr Lapthorne, 'that if the thing went marvellously well, would we have the clout to back it fully? And what if it coincided with something big in the rest of the business?' But if BAe is now clear from its adventures in the car trade, it still has plenty of problems on its plate: for instance, in its regional aircraft and turboprop businesses. In both, Mr Evans said yesterday, the aim is still to reduce BAe's involvement. For many months, it has been struggling to clinch a deal with Taiwan on setting up a joint venture in regional aircraft production. 'The ball is firmly in Taiwan's court,' Mr Evans says. 'It they want to do a deal, it will have to be on the basis of the existing agreement. Progressively, we'll have to talk to other parties, and I guess that eventually we'll have to talk to Fokker' (the Dutch manufacturer, now controlled by Deutsche Aerospace). In both regional jets and turboprops, Mr Evans says, the aim is for BAe to end up with 20-25 per cent of world class businesses. Given that BAe is also a minority stakeholder in the Airbus project, that leaves defence as its only wholly-owned activity. In that respect, it bears a curious resemblance to Britain's other big defence contractor, GEC. There have been rumours of talks between the two, with Lord Weinstock of GEC reportedly keen to merge the two businesses and BAe reluctant. Where do matters stand now? 'There is nothing going on at the moment,' Mr Evans says, 'except that they're keen to buy our space business. But there are a lot of other areas where there are opportunities and connections between us, both horizontal and vertical. The question is whether we should concentrate on horizontal links, which are much more manageable, rather than bringing two bloody great businesses together in a nuclear explosion.' That apart, BAe insists on the vital importance of yesterday's announcement. 'It's pivotal,' Mr Lapthorne says. 'It gives us positive options,' adds Mr Evans. 'Before, everything was a fire fight.' Before this is accepted uncritically, one nagging question remains. BAe has worked hard to return to its core in defence and aerospace, shedding businesses as diverse as cars, property development and civil engineering on the way. But those core businesses were what it started with a decade ago. Both markets have become progressively less attractive in the interim. If leaving them made sense then, what makes returning so wonderful now?</p>

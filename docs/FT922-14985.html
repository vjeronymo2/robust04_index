			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT insurance futures gain CFTC approval THE first two of a series of novel insurance futures contracts developed by Chicago Board of Trade have received regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC has agreed to futures on homeowners' (property/casualty) insurance and health insurance. CBOT will launch its homeowners' insurance futures on September 25 following the start of a homeowners' insurance pool index on June 15. The futures will be based on a pool index reflecting gross profitability claims versus premiums of a pool of at least 100,000 homeowners' insurance policies. The exchange plans to begin publishing a health insurance pool index later this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan authorities'  intention of creating "two Chinas" and their attempt for  accepting "dual recognition" go against the overall interests of  the Chinese nation and will end in failure, said a Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman here today.    The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remarks at the weekly  press conference here this afternoon.    On may 17, Fredrick F. Chien claimed in Taiwan's  "Legislative  Yuan" that Taiwan was prepared to accept South Africa's dual  recognition of the two sides across the Taiwan straits.    Wu said, this is yet another ploy of the Taiwan authorities  aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in  disregard of the overall interests of the Chinese nation.    He noted that it is a fact recognized by the United Nations  and the international community at large that there is only one  China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of  China is the sole legal government representing the whole of  China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.    "It is on this basis that China has established diplomatic  relations with 158 countries in the world," said Wu.    "It is futile for the Taiwan authorities to try to end  Taiwan's isolation in the world by way of 'dual recognition'",  he said. "the only right choice is for them to go along with the  historical tide by helping bring about national reunification at  an early date."    The Chinese Government appreciates the position of South  African President Mandela and the African National Congress to  pursue a one- China policy and their pledge to address their  relations with China in accordance with the practice of the  United Nations and other international organizations, Wu said.    "We believe that the relations between China and the new  South Africa will develop in an all-round way on the basis of  the five principles of peaceful coexistence," said the spokesman.</p>

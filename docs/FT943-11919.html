			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Brussels treads water on labour policy The European Commission drew back from recommending any new EU-wide labour laws in a white paper on social policy it published yesterday. The paper, introduced by social affairs commissioner Mr Padraig Flynn, contained no specific legislative proposals, but it will shape the EU social and employment policy debate until the year 2000. In attempting to negotiate a path between the enthusiasts for European-level social policy and the sceptics, led by the UK government, the white paper will disappoint many on both left and right. Ms Pauline Green, leader of the dominant Socialist group in the European parliament, said she welcomed the 'firm commitment to ongoing social policy at European level but we are disappointed that there will be no new initiatives to safeguard and support working people'. The UK government said the white paper did not place sufficient emphasis upon labour market flexibility. Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's new employment secretary, also stressed that the UK would block any attempt to remove its 'opt-out' from some aspects of social legislation, as enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. The white paper noted the strong desire of all member states to proceed as 12 wherever possible and it hopes that Union social policy action will once again 'be founded on a single legal framework'. Mr Flynn added yesterday that the European Union's inter-governmental conference planned for 1996 should consider ending the UK 'opt-out'. There is, however, much that will appeal to the UK and other governments with reservations about social regulations. There is a stress on leaving more decisions in this field to national governments, on switching from passive to active labour market assistance, and about balancing decent working conditions with sufficient labour market flexibility to create jobs. The paper says that greater emphasis must be placed on improving job mobility within the EU and on implementing social directives. Italy has implemented only 57 per cent of the relevant legislation, compared with 92 per cent in Britain and Portugal (see table). Above all, the paper stresses that 'given the solid base of European social legislation that has already been achieved, the Commission considers that there is not a need for a wide ranging programme of new legislative proposals in the coming period'. But the paper is not without hope for the many strong supporters of expanding social legislation within the EU. 'The pursuit of high social standards should not be seen only as a cost but also as a key element in the competitive formula', says the paper. It emphasises the importance of passing directives that are currently under discussion on workers posted to other EU countries and on rights for part-timers. The paper also proposes a high level committee on the future of the social charter and on job mobility; a new action programme on equality between men and women and on health and safety; a new EU law against racism; and the establishment of social rights in the constitution of the EU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PROGRESS IN TRANSPOSING DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL                               POLICY.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Member States     Directives applicable   Directives for which      %                        on 31.12.93         measures have been                                          notified as at 31.12.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                    37                      28              76 Denmark                    37                      32              86 Germany                    38                      27              71 Greece                     36                      24              67 Spain                      37                      25              68 France                     37                      29              78 Ireland                    37                      32              86 Italy                      37                      21              57 Luxembourg                 37                      22              59 Netherlands                37                      26              70 Portugal                   36                      33              92 United Kingdom             37                      34              92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

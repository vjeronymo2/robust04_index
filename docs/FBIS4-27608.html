			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korean businesses  introduced 707 technologies from foreign countries last year, a  32.6-percent increase over 1992, and paid 946.41 million U.S.  dollars in return, a report said recently.    The turnaround in technology transfers, which had declined  since 1989, reflects the business recovery in Korea, according  to the "Annual Report on Technology Introduction" issued  recently by the Korea Industrial Technology Association.    The annual report analyzed last year's technology  introduction, finding that the electric and electronic sector  led the way with 238 cases (33.6 percent), followed by 206 cases  for the machinery area (29.1) and 91 cases for the chemical  field (12.8).    In terms of royalties paid for technology transfers, the  electric and electronic sector came first with 54.2 percent,  trailed by the mechanical and chemical fields with 22.8 percent  and 12.55 percent, respectively. The most conspicuous rise  occurred in the construction sector with 28 cases worth 14.46  million dollars compared with three cases totaling 7.35 million  dollars in the previous year.    By country, Japan ranked first with 285 cases (40.3  percent),  followed by the United States (31.6 percent), Britain (5.15  percent) and Germany (4.3 percent).    The report said Korea's reliance on American and Japanese  technology declined as Japan, in particular, is avoiding  transfer of its advanced technology.    However, technology imports from former communist countries  such as Russia rose to 17 cases from five in the previous year,  indicating that technical cooperation with these states is  becoming more active.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Party Federal Council on </F> 14 April on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text]  <H5>  President F W de Klerk, clear winner of TV debate </H5>   President F W de Klerk was the undoubted winner of tonights  debate, particularly on all questions about the future of South  Africa. He had the clearest view of where the country is going  and demonstrated he has the experience to get us there.    He gave a performance which was decisive, showed his mastery  of the facts, and was compelling in setting out the  transformation that has taken place in the new national party.    By contrast Mr Mandela, was generalised and sometimes vague.  He dwelt too much on the past, and had very little to offer when  it came to the hard questions about the economy. He was also  more intent on scoring cheap debating points than addressing the  real issues. It was alarming to see his finger-wagging style  when he ran out of arguments.    This election is about the future not the past. Clearly  President de Klerk and the new National Party are the ones to  lead us there.</p>

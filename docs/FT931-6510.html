			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Improved sales push Saga profits to NKr802m SAGA Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, posted an increase in 1992 pre-tax profits to NKr802m (Dollars 114.5m) from NKr777m a year earlier, helped by a rise in oil and gas sales and an increase in income from pipeline tariffs. Saga proposed lifting its dividend to NKr1.75 a share from 1991's NKr1.25. Group revenue increased last year to NKr5.36bn, from NKr4.58bn, in 1991 as operating expenses rose to NK4.11bn from NKr3.22bn. Group net profit rose to NKr277m from NKr173m. Saga recorded a charge of NKr119m for an unrealised currency loss on a long-term dollar loan and also wrote down the value of its 11.7 per cent stake in Elkem, the Norwegian light metals group, by NKr92m. Saga initially bought a 12.4 per cent stake in Elkem two years ago for NKr460m. Total financial charges fell last year to NKr449m from NKr588m in 1991, while group operating profit dipped to NKr1.25bn from NKr1.37bn. Gas sales rose to 424m cu metres from 350m a year earlier, while revenue from pipeline tariffs reached NKr450m. Taxes for 1992 were estimated at NKr525m, down from NKr604m in 1991.</p>

CROIX RESIDENTS WANT TROOPS TO STAY  </P> <P> Business owners and residents of St. Croix protested President Bush's plan to  withdraw 1,100 federal troops that were sent to the island to quell looting  following Hurricane Hugo. The United Concerned Citizens of St. Croix said it  joined the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Realtors to lobby the White  House and Pentagon urging Bush to rescind the order. The Defense Department has  announced that troops would be withdrawn within 20 days. "We have no  electricity and telephones and we want to be safe on the island," a full-page  ad in the St. Croix Avis newspaper proclaimed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STRANGE NEW WORLD FOR APACHES;  </P> <P> DISNEYLAND: A GROUP OF INDIANS DISCOVERED THAT A TYPICAL DAY AT THE MAGIC  KINGDOM IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM LIFE ON THE ARIZONA RESERVATION.  </P> <P> Beneath the Disneyland Monorail they stood Tuesday, listening respectfully to  the same Apache blessing that their warrior ancestors, Geronimo and Cochise,  had heard before going into battle against the U.S. cavalry a century ago.  </P> <P> Facing heavenward with closed eyes, medicine man Reppert Cassadore --  great-great grandson of "the Apache Kid," a 19th-Century warrior -- beseeched  the good will of Indian spirits for the 60 Apaches who gathered around him.  </P> <P> When the prayer was over, the Indians, many of them elderly people off their  San Carlos Reservation in Arizona for the first time, blinked in wonder at the  strange new sights. They were with 78 other Apaches from the White Mountain  Reservation in Arizona for a long-anticipated day at Disneyland.  </P> <P> "To them, it's a thing they will always remember -- that they can tell their  grandchildren that Disneyland is real," said Reno Johnson, chairman of the  White Mountain Apache Nation.  </P> <P> The Apaches arrived in Anaheim on Monday night, journeying 13 hours in a bus  across the Southwestern deserts that their forefathers used to travel bareback.  The itinerary for their four-day stay in Orange County also included a  first-ever visit to the beach and a day at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park.  </P> <P> Although there were many children on the two reservations who wanted to go  along, Elizabeth Classay, a San Carlos reservation Apache who organized the  trip, said this was intended only for the elderly Indians because most had  never ventured beyond the reservations.  </P> <P> "I never thought I would be here," 95-year-old Mae Dewey marveled as Mickey  Mouse sidled up and planted a kiss on her weathered cheek.  </P> <P> Classay added: "They are getting too old. This is the first -- and maybe their  last -- trip (to the outside world)."  </P> <P> The two reservations, which sprawl over more than 2 million acres of alpine  forests and high desert plateau, were established by the U.S. government during  the Apache Wars of the 1870s and 1880s. Many of the older residents said they  are descendants of Geronimo, whose band of warriors staged raids on  stagecoaches and wagon trains out of the San Carlos Reservation.  </P> <P> The Apache Wars ended Sept. 4, 1886, when Geronimo surrendered himself and 16  warriors to Brig. Gen. Nelson A. Miles in Skeleton Canyon, near the Mexican  border. Geronimo and 394 of his tribesmen were subsequently sent into exile in  Florida and, for more than 20 years, were kept in captivity.  </P> <P> The modern-day Apaches make a living off the land, raising cattle and hunting  the deer, elk and bear that inhabit the higher mountain ranges of the  reservations, Cassadore said. But he added that the reservations, like many  others in the United States, are also plagued by high unemployment and  alcoholism.  </P> <P> Tuesday, the visiting Apaches left all of those worries at home. Each had paid  $290 to go on this week's trip. The money was raised by the San Carlos and  White Mountain Apache tribes selling native-made cradle boards, jewelry and  burden baskets, Classay said.  </P> <P> The Apaches stepped off two charter buses from their nearby high-rise hotel and  into a land of fantasy. Disneyland characters, including Mickey Mouse, Minnie  Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, greeted them.  </P> <P> Wearing colorful native dress that drew stares from camera-toting tourists,  they were then loaded aboard a convoy of antique model trucks so they could  participate in the Main Street Parade.  </P> <P> After enduring a seemingly endless photo session in front of the Sleeping  Beauty Castle, they got around to the really important business: going on the  rides.  </P> <P> Ranging in age from early 50s to 95, the Indians mostly steered clear of  high-adventure rides such as Splash Mountain. However, 74-year-old Alice Wesley  didn't realize until after she had already been fastened in that the Matterhorn  Bobsled ride was not exactly suited for seniors.  </P> <P> "Ohhh, it almost gave me a heart attack," she wailed afterward.  </P> <P> The attraction called It's A Small World was a little less intimidating. Old,  lined faces lit up as the ride carried them past colorful, dancing Disney  puppets all singing "It's a Small World."  </P> <P> "Ohhhh. Look!" Arlene Holmes, a recreation director for the San Carlos  Reservation, said with laughter as a puppet Indian chief in full headdress came  into view.  </P> <P> Many of the older Indians could not speak much English. But their enthusiasm  was marked by their repeated use of the word kayah, which Classay said is  Apache for golly.  </P> <P> Mae Dewey, who is the oldest person on either reservation, felt quite  comfortable easing out of her wheelchair and getting on an artificial steed on  the Disneyland merry-go-round.  </P> <P> "It brings back the memories of when I was a little girl and I used to gather  acorns in the mountains," Dewey said later.  </P> <P> Seeing Dewey and her companions in their red, pink, blue and yellow native  dress, a vacationing couple from England introduced themselves and then  attempted to present their little daughter. Dewey, eyes twinkling in delight,  reached out to shake the shy girl's hand -- and then suddenly pulled her close.  </P> <P> "Don't be afraid," Dewey said with a laugh as the girl stared in fright. "I'm  tame now."  </P></p>

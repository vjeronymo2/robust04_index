			<p>BFN     [Text] In what is being described as a breakthrough for  Afrikaner self-determination, a special statutory volkstaat  [homeland] council of 20 members will start sitting in Cape Town  soon after the election to discuss a possible fully fledged  volkstaat. The details of the confidential breakthrough were  disclosed exclusively to the CAPE TIMES. The accord, which is  still in draft form, was agreed to in principle by the ANC,  government, General Constand Viljoen, and the Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front]. It could be signed by  all parties at any minute.</p>

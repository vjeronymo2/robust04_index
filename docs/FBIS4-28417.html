			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Undisguised Nuclear Ambition" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government  recently decided to submit to the International Court of Justice  a statement saying that "the use of nuclear weapons is not  necessarily a violation of international law", according to a  report from Tokyo.    This decision of the Japanese Government is a crude breach  of  the international law that prohibits the use of nuclear weapons.  It is the biggest challenge to world peace and security and an  unpardonable archcriminal act of bringing a nuclear holocaust to  the globe.    This is an open manifestation of the Japanese reactionaries'  criminal schemes to turn Japan into a nuclear power and thereby  establish domination over Asia.    Now, the plausible mask of "three non-nuclear principles"  much advertised by Japan hitherto has been thrown off, and it  has become clear that its clamor about the DPRK's "suspected  nuclear arms development" was to find an excuse for justifying  its moves to become a nuclear power.    From the open talk of the Japanese Government that "the use  of nuclear weapons is not necessarily a violation of  international law", one can see clearly once again that the  recently disclosed Japan's large plutonium concealment case was  by no means accidental.    It is only too natural that the unbiased public opinion is  now lifting up voices opposing and denouncing Japan's moves to  become a nuclear power.    Japan must look squarely at the trend of the times and  promptly give up the design for its conversion into a nuclear  power, a move that would spell catastrophic consequences upon it.</p>

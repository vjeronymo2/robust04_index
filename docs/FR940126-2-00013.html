In response to comments received from State and local officials and other stakeholders, the Department has decided to store no more than 12,000 pits at Pantex until it completes a site-wide environmental impact statement covering all current and proposed facilities and activities at Pantex. A Record of Decision for this environmental impact statement will be issued by November 15, 1996. The Department's interim storage decision will enable approximately three more years of nuclear weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. The Department now envisions that the Pantex Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement will address all storage requirements, including alternative locations, for all plutonium, highly enriched uranium, tritium, and classified weapons components that result from Pantex dismantlement activities. Scoping meetings for this Environmental Impact Statement will be held in Amarillo, Texas, and at other sites that might be affected by the activities at Pantex by June 30, 1994. In addition, the Reconfiguration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement is scheduled to be completed in 1995. It will analyze all reasonable long-term pit storage alternatives and discuss the disposition options the Department is considering, and the Record of Decision will include decisions on pit storage locations. The Pantex Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement will take into account any decisions resulting from the Reconfiguration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Energy provided a pre-approval review copy of the Environmental Assessment to the State of Texas in December 1992. Subsequently, the State provided the pre-approval Environmental Assessment to interested and affected members of the public. State and public comments were submitted to the Department for consideration during February and March, 1993. In response to these comments, the Department reviewed and revised the Environmental Assessment and added a Comment Response Document. This revised pre-approval Environmental Assessment was issued on November 11, 1993, for public review and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department then held a public meeting on December 6, 1993, in Amarillo, Texas, to discuss the revised Environmental Assessment and Comment Response Document and to respond to comments from State and local officials and the public. Subsequent to the public meeting, the Department accepted written comments on the revised pre-approval Environmental Assessment until December 20, 1993. The Environmental Assessment was expanded to include the Department's response to the comments received on the revised Environmental Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the analyses in the Environmental Assessment and after careful consideration of all comments from State and local officials and members of the public, the Department of Energy has determined that storage of no more than 12,000 pits at Pantex does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required and the Department issues this Finding of No Significant Impact.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES AND FURTHER INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Persons requesting additional information regarding this action or desiring a copy of the Environmental Assessment should contact:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Thomas Walton, Public Affairs Officer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amarillo Area Office,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P.O.

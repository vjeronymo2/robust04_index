The French Government has maintained silence about the  matter  but French and Iranian sources claim that the sudden step was a  result of negotiations held in Tehran by French Foreign Ministry  Secretary General Serge Boidevaix last fall.    The sources said that France requested and got the following  three concessions from Iran:    1. That Tehran will not encourage acts of violence on French  territory nor against French interests abroad for a period  extending at least until the French presidential election date  in May 1995.    2. That Tehran will undertake to considerably reduce its  aid, particularly financial and military aid, to the Algerian  "Afghans."    3. That Tehran will agree to bring to trial four Iranians  accused of killing Shahpur Bakhtiar, the last Iranian prime  minister under the Shah, in 1991. Saud Hindi Zadeh, Khomeyni's  nephew, is one of those who will stand trial later this month.    The two released Iranians are Mohsen Sharif Esfahani and  Ahmad Taheri Khormabadi. They are believed to be senior  officers in the Iranian security organ Savama. They were  accused of planning to kill Kazem Rajavi, the Iranian leader  opposed to the mullas who lived abroad, in 1991 in Geneva.  [passage omitted]</p>

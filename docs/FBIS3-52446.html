Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said this rank is  not just another insignia on the shoulder, but calls for  additional work and responsibility and for the use of all  possible qualifications in order to see the present and envision  the future so as to supply answers to fast-changing problems.  Maj. Gen. Mofaz is in charge of a most sensitive region, the  prime minister stressed, and his job calls for a variety of  qualifications, not just military ones.    Our military affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe points  out  that Maj. Gen. Mofaz will soon also be assigned to a senior job  in the IDF's field command.</p>

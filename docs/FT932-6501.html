			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Mulroney successor race opens up: Campbell's lead in Canada PM stakes is narrowing Most of the patrons at Kelsey's, a non-descript bar near Toronto airport, were glued to the television, cheering their beloved Maple Leafs ice hockey team on to the Stanley Cup finals. In another corner, a more subdued - and smaller - gathering was struggling to hear Mr Jim Edwards explain why he wants to be prime minister of Canada. Mr Edwards, a member of parliament and government whip from Edmonton, Alberta, is one of five candidates campaigning to succeed Mr Brian Mulroney as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. The winner will automatically also take over as prime minister. A more democratic process for picking a party leader would be hard to devise. About 3,800 delegates will cast their ballots on June 13 at a national leadership convention in Ottawa. Most of the delegates have themselves been elected by local constituency associations. For the past two months, the five candidates have criss-crossed the country trying to extract pledges of loyalty from as many delegates as possible. Mr Edwards started the day in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he appeared on a televised debate with his rivals. By lunchtime he was in Toronto, addressing members of the dowdy Empire Club at a downtown hotel. The morning after his cocktail-hour visit to Kelsey's, he was due to meet local high school students, some of whom will be youth delegates to the convention. Mr Edwards appears to be running third in the leadership race. His prospects of winning are virtually zero, but a good showing on June 13 could put him in line for a senior cabinet post. The odds on him making a creditable showing have improved in recent weeks. When the leadership race started, all signs pointed to a first-ballot landslide for Ms Kim Campbell, the 46-year old defence minister. Thanks to her gender, age, and nimble mind (not to mention a much talked-about photograph showing her posing bare-shouldered behind her legal robes), 'Campbellmania' seemed likely to sweep the defence minister not only through the convention, but also the general election due to take place later this year. Several of Mr Mulroney's senior ministers with leadership ambitions of their own decided to stand aside, sensing that they had little chance of beating Ms Campbell. But the aura of glamour and invincibility around her has slipped noticeably. According to one opinion poll conducted last week, the odds on the Tories winning the general election are now longer with Ms Campbell at the helm, than under her closest rival for the leadership, Mr Jean Charest, the environment minister. Mr Charest is only 34 years old, but his easy-going style and tireless grassroots campaigning have won him many admirers. Ms Campbell has yet to overcome the impression in some Tory circles that she is an outsider who has not yet 'paid her dues'. She entered parliament only five years ago. Before that, she was a member of British Columbia's Social Credit party, which is far removed from the centre of power in Ottawa. Ms Campbell presents herself as a new generation of politician unafraid of telling things as they are. For instance, she has readily admitted smoking marijuana in her youth (and inhaling). But some of her remarks have suggested a too-clever-by-half combativeness more suited to a university debating society than a national political campaign. As one political analyst said on a radio chat show the other evening, 'people don't like smart-asses.' The contrast between twice-divorced Ms Campbell and the contented, family-man image projected by Mr Charest has also not been lost on the defence minister's rivals. Despite the recent setbacks, Ms Campbell remains favoured to win the party leadership, though by a narrower margin than seemed likely a few weeks ago. Her real test will be the general election, which must be held by November. The Tories and opposition Liberals are now running neck-and-neck in the opinion polls. In their appetite to regain power after nine years on the opposition benches, the Liberals have acquired a greater cohesion than has been visible for some time, having overcome internal dissension. Their campaign effort received a boost last month with the appointment of Mr John Rae, a vice-president at Power Corporation in Montreal with respected organisation skills, as campaign leader. They are confident that with a clear lead in Ontario and the Tory vote split with regional parties in Quebec and the western provinces, they have an excellent chance of returning to power. The Tories on the other hand, will be banking on their youthful prime minister and a fresh set of faces in the cabinet. A flurry of tough anti-crime bills recently tabled in parliament provides one clue to the Tories' campaign platform. They will also be helped by an accelerating economic recovery with the lowest interest and inflation rates in 20 years.</p>

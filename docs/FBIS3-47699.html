			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 14 January editorial: "Let Us Vigorously </F> Advance, Upholding the Banner of Self-reliance"]    [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his New  Year's address, set forth a militant slogan, "Let us vigorously  accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle," and  called on the entire party and all the people to continue on for  the great victory.    The revolutionary slogan reflects the intent of the party  and  the leader [suryong] who wish to make 1994 a year of historic  upturn in our country's revolution and construction by lifting a  strong wind of self-reliance in the entire country. Today, the  revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and hard struggle grabs  the hearts of our people and encourages them to march toward a  new feat.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: The  prevailing situation demands us more than ever before to highly  display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard  struggle. Our people's history of socialist construction is the  history of self-reliance. Because our people have a strong  revolutionary spirit of rising from the ruins with their own  strength, believing in only the party and the leader [suryong],  they were able to effect the great Chollima upsurge in the  difficult postwar days and firmly adhere to the socialist cause  by smashing all sorts of the imperialists' obstructionist  maneuvers. Self-reliance is the only road to existence and to  displaying the dignity of the nation; this is the truth that our  people have learned by paying a dear price.    All party members and working people should now advance by  upholding the militant slogan of self-reliance. This is an  important requirement for thoroughly implementing the party's  revolutionary economic strategy and brilliantly carrying out the  tasks of the adjustment period for socialist economic  construction.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the wisest  formula of economic construction aimed at satisfactorily  guaranteeing the people's living condition in conformity with  socialist requirements and dislodging a new position of attack  to occupy a higher land of socialism. This economic strategy  calls for displaying limitless economic potentials. It is our  party's strategic plan, out of the principle of self-reliance,  to rapidly develop light industry, agriculture, and foreign  trade with our own strength, technology, and resources so as to  highly enhance the people's living condition in the near future.    This year is a first year of the adjustment period. The  success of this year's struggle depends on how all the people  will display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard  struggle. When everyone fights with the same strong spirit of  self-reliance that once filled the thick forest of Mt. Paektu  and the same spirit of hard struggle with which we shoveled for  the first time after the war, the flame of great revolutionary  upsurge will be kindled again in every domain of the socialist  construction.    Everyone displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard  struggle comes as a decisive factor in consolidating the might  of self-dependent economy and smashing the imperialists'  maneuvers of isolation and obliteration.    The might of the people who fight with a firm conviction in  their own strength is infinite and no enemy can match the power  of such masses. The achievements of last year's struggle that  brilliantly adorned the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan  in a sharp political, military confrontation with the  imperialists prove this eloquently.    Today's prevailing situation in which the imperialists beef  up suppression and blockade as never before and a great change  takes place in the country's external economic relations demands  that we further strengthen a self-dependent economy in any  condition. In order to do so, the principle of self-reliance  should be firmly adhered to. No one can touch us when the  foundation of a self- dependent economy is firm. The slogan of  self-reliance is the most reasonable slogan that totally  corresponds to the basic interest of our revolution and  construction and is a revolutionary slogan that turns misfortune  into fortune.    All party members and working people should bring about a  constant innovation and continue to advance, upholding the  party's slogan, "Let us accelerate the general onward march of  socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  hard struggle."    Above all, we, with a firm conviction in our strength,  should  keep in our hearts the chuche-oriented point of view and  position that we will only live in our own way. The  chuche-oriented point of view and conviction are ideological and  spiritual foundations of self-reliance. A strong mettle that  anything can be accomplished with one's own strength in whatever  circumstances and an inexhaustible creative power that creates  something out of nothing all stem from the chuche-oriented  conviction.    All party members and working people should vigorously  advance with the firm confidence in the great leadership of our  party which leads our socialist cause into the single road of  invincibility; the might of our revolutionary ranks which is  being single-heartedly united by the masses, the party, and the  leader [suryong]; and the might of our self-independent economy  which does not vacillate in whatever storm.    When the party members and working people keep in their  hearts the strong conviction in victory that we will surely win  as long as the dear comrade leader leads our socialist cause,  the revolutionary ethos of self-reliance and hard struggle will  be even more displayed in any place.    For those who have the firm chuche-oriented point of view  and  position, there will be no incident of looking at others and  relying on others' strength. We believe in our own strength and  should vigorously press ahead with production and construction  with our own technology, materials, and natural resources.    Our party members and working people, when manufacturing a  single part of a machine or a single necessary item of life,  should make them of good quality and strive to develop science  technology that matches the current situation of our country.  In order to demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and hard struggle, it is important for our party  members and working people to have a strong will and mettle to  implement revolutionary tasks presented by the party without  fail.    At a time when a grand march to adorn this year as a year of  revolutionary upturn is being waged, what we need is the spirit  of absoluteness and unconditionality of patriotic forefathers of  the anti-Japanese revolution who strived with the conviction  that they have no right to die unless there is an order from the  comrade supreme commander and the indefatigable revolutionary  spirit of heroic fighters of the Fatherland Liberation War who  defended a height of the nation, sacrificing their lives.    All party members and working people should surely carry out  their revolutionary tasks presented by the party with their  strength, wisdom, and devoted struggle, upholding the party's  slogan, "When the party decides, we will act."    In all domains of the national economy, this year's national  economic plan should be unconditionally fulfilled by the day, by  the month, by the quarter, and by the indicators by mobilizing  all possible efforts, resources, and equipment. In particular,  major domains of the national economy, such as the light  industry, agriculture, foreign trade, the coal industry, the  power industry, transport by railway, and the metal industry,  should boldly carry out a struggle to fulfill the party's  revolutionary economic strategy by highly displaying the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle.    In all sectors and units, the production and conservation  struggle should be waged to mobilize internal reserves to the  maximum. This is an important requirement for thoroughly  embodying the principle of self-reliance in the economic  construction.    Our country's socialist self-independent economy has a great  production potential. The question lies in searching all sorts  of internal reserves by buckling down with firm resolve. Just  as work to mobilize internal reserves were vigorously waged in  every place to create the speedy advance of Chollima by  upholding the decision made at the plenary session in December,  1956, the entire party and all the people should turn out in the  effort to strengthen the production and conservation struggle.    All domains and units should satisfactorily carry out  maintenance and supplementary work for production facilities,  management of facilities and manpower, and the work of supplying  materials so that all facilities are fully operated and  production is normalized at a high level.    Today's circumstances demand that all domains carry out the  nation's housekeeping in a frugal manner and more highly raise  the beacon of struggle for conservation.    All party members and working people should unanimously rise  in the work for conservation of fuel, energy, raw materials and  other materials, including electricity and coal.    Those who save even a watt of electricity, a handful of  coal,  and a piece of grain can be called genuine patriots who live and  struggle with the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.    For the guiding functionaries to thoroughly embody the  revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and arduous struggle in  all fields of socialist construction, they should properly carry  out the combat organizational work with staunch revolutionary  spirit.    The position on which the commanding members should stand in  this year's tense struggle is in the vanguard of the ranks. All  guiding functionaries should boldly break through all  difficulties they face with their own strength with ardent  passion and revolutionary determination to carry to  accomplishment without fail the party's revolutionary economic  strategy. They should inspire production masses to the struggle  to actively mobilize internal reserves and to increase  production.    The functionaries with a strong revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance are the people who, without exception, make  tenacious efforts to constantly revolutionize and classicize  themselves.    Rejecting stagnation and stalemate, the guiding  functionaries  should always live with the spirit of crossing the blazing river  and bog. They should deeply mingle with the masses, sharing the  same food with them, and should learn from them our people's  excellent trait of struggling for self-reliance.    It is important in making the whole nation overflow with the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and the arduous struggle  to enhance the political functions and role of party  organizations at each level.    Party organizations should strengthen organizational and  political work so that all party members and working people  unanimously rise in the struggle to strengthen the  self-supporting nature and might of our economy by upholding the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address and  decisions of the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central  Committee.    Party organizations should make all working people keenly  realize that self-reliance is the only way for survival and is  the road to victory, through brilliant realities in our country  and the situation in the countries where socialism was  frustrated.    The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance displayed during  the postwar period of the great Chollima upsurge is a driving  force which will vigorously push ahead with our revolution and  construction today and in the future.    Party organizations should actively lead all party members  and working people so that they live and struggle with the  spirit cherished during the difficult postwar period when they  produced more steel material and even manufactured trucks and  tractors.    Assuming our party's revolutionary slogan of self-reliance  and arduous struggle as the guideline and principle in their  struggle and life, all people should more vigorously fight to  glorify history of socialist construction in our country forever  as the proud history of self-reliance.</p>

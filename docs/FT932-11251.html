			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / US, France agree Bosnia tactics: Possible Serb rejection of peace plan discussed by Major and Balladur THE US and France yesterday agreed that a large United Nations peacekeeping force must be sent to Bosnia rapidly if the Bosnian Serb assembly approves an international peace plan at its meeting today, but made no final decision on what action to take if the plan was rejected. After talks in Paris with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, claimed there was 'a broad convergence of views' between Paris and Washington on tactics, even if the assembly rejected the plan. In that event, 'new measures will have to be taken, and nothing is excluded', Mr Juppe said in an apparent reference to US ideas on air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines and other military targets. He seemed to concede that military threats constituted useful pressure on the Bosnian Serb parliament's meeting, even though France would clearly be reluctant to see its 5,500 peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia put at risk by air attacks. After talks in Downing Street last night with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, his French counterpart, said the two governments' views on what could be done should the Bosnian Serb assembly reject the peace agreement were close. But, apart from stressing they had reviewed all options, neither he nor Mr Major would disclose their preferences. Although Mr Major said 'we have never ruled out air strikes', a French official said later that the two premiers had shown a 'common reticence' about US proposals to bomb Bosnian Serb supply lines. Reports from Pale, the seat of the Bosnian Serb assembly, suggest its members are split over whether to endorse the peace plan signed by their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, on Sunday, in spite of thinly veiled warnings by western powers that they risk bombing raids if they reject it. There are no signs on the ground that the Bosnian Serbs are prepared to implement a ceasefire ahead of their assembly's decision. Bosnia's Moslems yesterday accused Serb forces of launching a fierce artillery attack on the eastern enclave of Zepa and of burning villages on the town's outskirts. They called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss measures to save the besieged town. Serb forces later denied they had started the fighting. In a letter to Mr Yuli Vorontsov of Russia, the UN Security Council president, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia urged the council to declare Zepa a UN protected area and to send a company of UN troops to 'defend' it and the civilian population. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN peace mediator, said he would ask Mr Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to investigate and stop the fighting in the town. Meanwhile, plans for a large multinational peacekeeping force of up to 75,000 men to implement a peace agreement once it has been endorsed are due to be discussed by Nato's military committee in Brussels today.

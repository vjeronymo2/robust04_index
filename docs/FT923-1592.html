			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Three-month NICKEL fell to a 2 1/2 -year low of Dollars 6,905 a tonne in early trading on the LME following Chinese hedge liquidation. Traders said that the Chinese had been the market's main source of support. If they were no longer there as buyers, the market would be likely see lower prices in the near future unless producers took some action. Meanwhile, the dollar's firmness continued to hang over the LME as buyers faced dearer prices in local currency terms. The most marked example continued to be COPPER; three-month metal closed at Dollars 2,435 a tonne, up just Dollars 8. A further rise in Comex stocks on Friday and reports that the Polish copper miners had lifted their strike threat were both ignored. GOLD retreated below Dollars 350 a troy ounce on the London bullion market, and the Comex active December futures contract was off more than Dollars 4 at Dollars 348.60 in late trading in New York. US fund liquidation emerged in New York after the French referendum at the weekend. London's second postion robusta COFFEE contract broke through resistance at Dollars 800 a tonne, boosted by French trade house buying. Dealers said charts now seemed to point to further gains.

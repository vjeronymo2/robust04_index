			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING KFAC  </P> <P> Matthew B. Topper's Aug. 20 letter is right in saying the conversion of KFAC to  a rock station would be cultural vandalism.  </P> <P> What can be done? As an ex-New Yorker, I see two options: (1) The City of Los  Angeles could condemn KFAC under the eminent domain laws and operate the  station itself; this sounds far-fetched, but the City of New York has been  successfully operating WNYC for decades. (2) The Los Angeles Times could buy  and operate a classical station itself. This is precisely the relation that the  New York Times has with WQXR, which is primarily a classical station but also  serves as a worthwhile extension of journalistic function.  </P> <P> DANA F.

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: CP Forest hit by poor prices for newsprint CANADIAN PACIFIC Forest Products has reported a loss of CDollars 71.1m (USDollars 59.70), or Dollars 1.47 a share, in the first quarter of this year, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. It blamed lower newsprint shipments, poor prices for all products except timber and higher interest costs. A year earlier, the pulp and paper arm of Canadian Pacific incured a loss of CDollars 50.1m, or Dollars 1.14 a share. Sales in the quarter were CDollars 430m against CDollars 488m. Lower operating costs and a lower Canadian dollar continued to help, and proceeds of a CDollars 218m equity issue had been used to reduce debt. Pulp prices are firming and timber is up 25 per cent in the US since January 1. Newsprint prices, however, remain depressed, while paperboard and packaging and white papers are improving.</p>

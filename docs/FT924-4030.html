			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Land Rover set to win Pounds 150m order A Pounds 150M MINISTRY of Defence order for 6,500 light military vehicles looks almost certain to go to Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace-owned Rover Group. Land Rover, based in Solihull, West Midlands, is the only company to have been asked to build trial vehicles for the order out of 20 European and North American manufacturers invited to tender in June. The MoD normally selects three or four rival candidates to build evaluation models for trials, typically lasting about 18 months. Land Rover will build 13 trial vehicles, based on its Defender 90 and 110 models. If they are satisfactory, the company would expect to be given the volume order, which is mainly for the Army. The MoD is Land Rover's biggest single customer and the order is potentially the company's biggest single contract for a decade. Delivery is scheduled over five years, starting in 1994. Land Rover will also build some larger Defender trial vehicles for another MoD contract for 200 four-wheel-drive utility trucks, in competition with Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria. This year Land Rover expects to produce about 55,000 vehicles, 5,000 down on 1991. About two fifths of the total will be its Discovery leisure vehicles, with the balance shared equally between the Defender and up-market Range Rover models. The Solihull plant is working overtime and on Saturdays to maintain its output level and to cater for higher demand. Like Jaguar, Land Rover has found robust demand starting to reappear in North America. Land Rover's October sales in the US, at 521, were more than double levels of a year ago and are the second-highest in its history. The company said yesterday it expected last month's sales to set a new record at more than 600. Demand for Jaguars in North America has picked up only during the past month and has yet to be quantified by the company. In October, its US sales were down on the same month of 1991 - at 614 compared with 926 - but the company is sufficiently encouraged to have resumed five-day working.</p>

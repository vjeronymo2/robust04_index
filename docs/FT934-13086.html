			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Good news on German inflation PRODUCER prices in west Germany fell sharply last month, reinforcing signs of a continuing decline in inflation, reports Christopher Parkes in Bonn. Down 0.2 per cent on August, the September producer price index was 0.5 per cent lower than a year earlier, the federal statistics office announced yesterday. The office pointed to a continuing trend: the August index was down 0.3 per cent year-on-year, and the July figure was 0.2 per cent lower, it said. There were no price increases worth mentioning, it added, while some products were markedly cheaper than a year ago. The price of electrolytic copper was down 8.3 per cent, while reinforcing steel matting for the building industry was almost 5 per cent cheaper.</p>

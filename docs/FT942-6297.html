			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bad debts continue to plague banks Bad debts continued to undermine the performance of Japan's long-term credit banks and trust banks in the year to the end of March. Profits fell sharply and despite large write-offs, outstanding bad debts remain worryingly high. The results suggest banks are still accumulating bad debts almost as fast as they are writing them off. The long-term credit banks reported an aggregate 36 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings, to Y106bn (Dollars 1.02bn). Between them, the three banks wrote off Y677bn in non-performing loans, partly offset by realised gains on shareholdings. Despite the record write-offs, problem loans remains at historically high levels. Though the banks all claimed bad debt levels had peaked, total outstanding non-performing loans and principal on loans more than six months in arrears stood at Y1,888bn, or 3.5 per cent of the total loan book. The Industrial Bank of Japan, the largest long-term credit bank, wrote off Y154.3bn, up 63 per cent from 1992-93. But the balance of outstanding bad loans declined by just 0.8 per cent to Y538.8bn. Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan wrote off Y316.8bn in problem loans, leaving Y745bn outstanding, a 4.1 per cent increase. At Nippon Credit Bank the figure was Y205.6bn, with Y603.9bn outstanding, up by 2 per cent. Combined pre-tax profits at the seven trust banks declined by 30 per cent to Y127.9bn as bad loan write-offs totalling Y577.7bn continued to weaken performance. Despite the write-offs, total problem loans rose in the year to Y2,700bn an increase of 4.8 per cent. The bad loan adjustment more than offset an improvement in core banking business. Net operating profits grew by 32.7 per cent to Y405.72bn as a result of lower interest rates and cost-cutting measures. The larger trust banks all reported sharply lower pre-tax profits as the effects of the bad loan adjustments were felt. Only Nippon Trust Bank, the smallest, reported an increase in profits as a result of large capital gains on bonds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                       Pre-tax profit           Post tax profit                   (Ybn)       (% change)     (Ybn)    (% change)  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Long-term credit banks  ---------------------------------------------------------------- LTCB               42.1         -30.9        26.0        -0.3 IBJ                43.3         -44.3        28.8        -7.2 Nippon Credit      20.8         -25.6        13.3        -0.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Trust banks  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Sumitomo Trust     34.8         -30.7        14.3       -24.7 Yasuda Trust       13.9         -21.0         9.7        +9.9 Mitsui Trust       17.6         -36.2        10.9        -5.1 Mitsubishi Trust   43.5         -21.9        14.8        -7.6 Chuo Trust          5.0         -35.2         3.0       -17.1 Toyo Trust          9.2         -52.9         7.0        -5.2 Nippon Trust        4.0         +14.2         1.7        -0.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

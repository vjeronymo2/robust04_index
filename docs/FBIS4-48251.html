			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief of staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia  [AFL], Lieutenant General J. Hezekiah Bowen, has expressed  serious concern over the movement of armed NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] troops in large numbers into the  East Harbel area. Gen. Bowen said the infiltration of these  troops into Harbel and its surrounding areas poses a serious  security risk to the city of Monrovia.    In another development, a pickup belonging to the Firestone  Plantation Company was reportedly seized by fighters of the NPFL  in Harbel after putting the AFL driver at a gunpoint. Gen.  Bowen told reporters that all efforts to retrieve the pickup and  the arm seized from the AFL driver proved futile. He is  therefore calling on ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and UNOMIL [UN Observer  Mission in Liberia] to intervene. Meanwhile, ECOMOG authorities  say a peacekeeping force has already been deployed in Harbel.  They are advising residents not to panic as ECOMOG troops are  fully in control of the situation.</p>

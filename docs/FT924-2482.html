			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Nato ready to back UN on Bosnia MR Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, said yesterday he believed the alliance would agree to provide the necessary military means if the United Nations decided to intervene with force in the Bosnian conflict. After a meeting of Nato defence ministers, he stressed that the UN should continue to take the lead and that Nato would support, but not replace it. A Nato role in intervention would require consensus among all 16 allies, he said, adding: 'My personal opinion is, if the UN did appeal to Nato, that we would not say No. I cannot envisage such an answer.' Nato military authorities were considering options for action in the former Yugoslavia but did not have concrete plans, Mr Worner said. He warned that limited military action such as the use of force against Serb helicopters and aircraft defying the ban on military flights would pose a 'dilemma' for UN forces already in Bosnia. 'You would have to consider how to protect your troops, and maybe that would be the end of humanitarian action,' he said. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, expressed concern about 'continued aggressive military operations' by Serb forces and interference with humanitarian relief missions, but gave no hint of any US plan to take part in direct military action. It remained his view that the US should not commit large numbers of ground troops in former Yugoslavia, he said. However, he said the US would be willing to consider proposals for deploying UN forces in Macedonia as a preventive measure. 'The notion of trying to head off conflicts might well make sense under certain circumstances,' he said. The meeting underscored the growing importance of Nato's new peacekeeping role in alliance planning. Ministers ordered work to be done on specific measures to improve peacekeeping capabilities. At the same time, several allies - notably Belgium and the Netherlands  - came under strong criticism for undermining Nato force plans by making larger-than-expected defence cuts. Embattled Sarajevo, weakened by the latest Serb onslaught, was hit hard by the first serious blast of winter yesterday, with temperatures hovering just above zero and without power or water, Reuter adds. Two flights by the UN Protection Force, intended as a test of airport security ahead of the resumption of the UN airlift, were delayed by fog. In Zagreb, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said aid flights, halted for the past 11 days by the fighting and attacks on two relief planes, would restart on Tuesday at the earliest.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aram Sarkisyan, chairman of the Democratic </F> Party of Armenia, by Shamiram Agabekyan; place and date not  given: "'Armenia Needs Not a Leader With a Team but a Team With  a Leader'"]    [Text] Elections to the republic's parliament are  impending. Whatever the predictions of Vano Syradegyan on  Armenian Television concerning the possible outcome of the  elections, the opposition intends having its say. Shamiram  Agabekyan's interview with Aram Sarkisyan, chairman of the  Democratic Party of Armenia, will help readers of GOLOS  determine what specifically this party brings to the elections  and the position that it holds.    [Agabekyan] Mr. Sarkisyan, it may be said that GOLOS has  just  once comprehensively addressed the activity of the Democratic  Party. This was two years ago. Much water has since then  flown....    [Sarkisyan] Yes, and it is to be regretted merely that four  years ago, when the party was founded, it came to be called  democratic, being essentially a social democratic program also.  We were reluctant to "steal a march" on the people of  Gnchak--the traditional national party. The gesture of propriety  was, I believe, inappropriate. Aside from all else, time has  shown that this party is far removed from social democratic  ideas. I can only go by the newspaper GNCHAK AYASTAINI, for that  matter, for there is simply no other evidence of this party's  presence and political behavior in the republic.    The political platform of the Democratic Party is freedom of  the individual, justice, and solidarity. The aim is defense of  the interests of the man working for wages, that is, the working  person. So this is the quintessential popular party, a party of  social justice.    [Agabekyan] Should it be assumed that the "economic slogan"  of your party rules out private ownership and market relations?    [Sarkisyan] On the contrary. We support the development of  market relations. But without a flouting of the principles of  social justice, without the abrupt polarization of society into  poor and rich. A vulgar market is unacceptable not only because  a polarized society is the most dangerous society. We need to  take account of the fact that for 70 years the people of Armenia  lived according to different political, economic, and social  criteria and that they totally reject the transformation  proposed by the present administration.    Our formula is the market to the extent that it is possible  and government regulation to the extent that it is necessary  (Willy Brandt). In order that the first part of the formula  operate efficiently it is essential to put both parts on an  equal footing in functional significance. Priorities should be  conditioned merely by economic necessity. We would recall that  when she assumed office, Margaret Thatcher nationalized some  companies, compensating them for loss, of course. Then, having  increased the profitability of the works and sectors even by  government measures, she denationalized them.    We also reject identification with foreign models,  proceeding  from the fact that Armenia's economy, like the evolved national  mentality, bears the imprint of 70 years of the building of  socialism. The model that we have devised fits into the general  social democratic concept of democratic socialism, but is based  on the realities that have taken shape in Armenia.    [Agabekyan] The political behavior of the Democratic Party  today is more "oppositional" than that of other parties of a  socialist persuasion. Why is this?    [Sarkisyan] One reason, perhaps--rejection of the style and  methods of government of the present administration. The path  that it is proposing and pursuing has brought our people  suffering and irreparable losses both economically and socially.  The authorities maintain that they are being true to the  principles of democracy: freedom of speech, some other things  besides. In actual fact, the very concept of power, the civil  society, and so forth have been discredited.    But the problem is that there is with us a certain internal  dissension. On the one hand our program principle dictates  Armenia's conversion into a democratic state with stable,  developed democratic institutions, which in itself precludes a  revolutionary, forcible change of power. On the other, seeing  the situation in which the people and the state as a whole have  found themselves, we understand that each day that the present  administration continues in office brings the republic closer to  catastrophe.    It is this dissension that forces us to seek radical changes  democratically. The Democratic Party proposed the creation of a  national-state council, the formation of a government of  national accord.... And recently, availing ourselves of the  right of legislative initiative, we proposed that parliament  discuss the question of the government's resignation.    [Agabekyan] And are the authorities paying any attention to  your proposals?    [Sarkisyan] In February of last year we met with the  president, for it had been contemplated that the state council  would be headed by the president himself, but without the right  of veto.    Ignoring all that had been proposed, the president responded  merely to this fact: He would not be such a president, he said.  On the other hand, he reprimanded us for bias--we were  unobjective in our analysis of the situation that had taken  shape in the republic, had not mentioned the good works of the  president himself....    Levon Ter-Petrosyan expressed his position, for that matter,  in a memorable speech at a sitting of the Supreme Soviet. The  idea of national accord was for him a fraudulent category. Was  this not an attempt to "justify" by hook or by crook his  reluctance to be a president of all the people, not its AOD  [Armenian National Movement] part? And since the AOD retains the  least significant part of society, he is president of this small  stratum.    [Agabekyan] Your party no longer, we are to infer, cleaves  to  the idea of a state council. What are its tasks today?    [Sarkisyan] Yes and no. It is essential now to seek the  adoption of a constitution (the draft of the six parties) and  new elections. If the constitutional process reaches impasse, it  is essential to seek early parliamentary elections.    With the people's support for our demands for early  elections, a new political situation, with which both the  authorities and the opposition would be forced to reckon, would  be created.    [Agabekyan] But will you have this support? It is no secret  that a large part of the populace is skeptical toward both the  authorities and the opposition, considering the first greedy and  aggressive, and the second, amorphous and inactive.    [Sarkisyan] The head-butting of antagonistic political  forces  is unacceptable to us. There would be no way of crawling out of  such a situation--the republic would be doomed.    I would advise some ardent champions of militant  confrontation inciting from their own quiet corner the  opposition to drive the people to the barricades to try this  themselves. It would then be quickly seen that the people do not  support these methods.    Account must be taken also of the situation in the region.  Serious policy rejects a disregard for national interests. But  the key to a solution of the Karabakh conflict is in the hands  of a third force also.    The opposition itself has a problem. The problem of  consolidation. In a normal society parties with different  ideologies are at different sides of the political arena. But we  have achieved cooperation on specific issues of constitutional  arrangement.    The Democratic Party has considered and now considers a  principal area of work the unification of constructive political  forces for the solution of specific questions of constitutional  arrangement. Take if only the constitutional council for civil  accord. What is this if not an example proving to the president  that consolidation in the name of the national interest is not  only possible but also essential?    [Agabekyan] Is it possible to speak of the mass character of  the Democratic Party?    [Sarkisyan] Were there a party of 50,000 persons in Armenia,  I assure you that this party would have been in power long ago.  There are no mass parties in our republic nor, perhaps, will  there be until the legal status of the state has been  determined, a true multiparty system has become firmly  established, and on this basis a president of the republic has  been elected.    We understand those who are demanding more assertiveness of  the opposition. People are bitter, and not everyone cares to  accept the motives for the "quiet behavior" of political forces,  believing that such rules of the game are appropriate in a  democratic society, but not here. They are largely right. When a  person who is accustomed to average sufficiency is forced to  sell his chattels that it has taken him years to acquire, you do  not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that the people  have been reduced to poverty and that the state has ceased to  perform its elementary functions.    We have become a self-governed society subjected, in  addition, to unique repressive measures in the form of the  absence of minimal protection and of corruption, impunity,  bribery, and a whole bouquet of other vices forcing Armenians to  leave their homeland.    The mass outflow is a consequence of the policy of the  present regime. At the same time, on the other hand, availing  itself of the current legal turmoil, 10-15 percent of society is  making colossal fortunes, which also are being exported from the  republic, incidentally.    But we would emphasize the following reality as well. While  subjected to the above repressive measures, the people are  strangely yielding to implanted cliches of the type: Who if not  Levon, or what would change with the advent of new people, or  everywhere else is just as bad as here! And the blockade, the  energy crisis, and so forth that set the teeth on edge.    But is the problem of the leader urgent? In proposing a  parliamentary form of rule our party is sure that in the present  transitional period it is essential to have an authority that is  subject to control. Armenia needs today not a leader with a team  but a team with a leader.    The advent of new forces is a natural process. And to impede  this is to make the situation in the republic worse, especially  since the present administration has exhausted itself in all  parameters.    As far as the "everywhere is just as bad" cliche is  concerned.... I can bear witness to the fact that the situation  in republics similar to Armenia is many times better, for the  state structures are performing their functions.    And the blockade.... This is a good screen for covering  one's  own inability to govern. It is a screen, rather, that is needed  for the burgeoning of mafia structures. If a private trader can  under the same conditions bring into the republic X quantity of  a commodity, why is the government--the principal  banker--incapable of competing with him?    Yes, the present administration is fully played out. It is  no  accident that we are witnessing periodic showdowns between  former associates. In a normal state, given such exposures, the  president does not remain in the role of detached observer of  the scandals shaking his noble family. For let us consider. Even  the initiative for the creation of an interim parliamentary  commission does not belong to him, the president. Comment here  is superfluous.    [Agabekyan] What do you propose?    [Sarkisyan] There is one way out of the present situation.  Specifically, our party is embarking on an election campaign and  is calling on all political organizations to begin without delay  to present their political program to the people. It is  essential to once again revive the people's faith in honest,  competent politicians and honest, competent policy.</p>

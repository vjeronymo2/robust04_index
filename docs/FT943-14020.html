			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon may sell two businesses Huntingdon International, the life sciences group, is investigating the sale of its UK-based consultancy, Travers Morgan, and its engineering and environmental services business in the US. In May the group announced that it proposed to focus on its life science business having concluded that the other divisions did not have the earnings prospects originally envisaged. They were built up by acquisition in the late 1980s by Mr Bennie Wooley, the chief executive, who resigned two months ago. The group called in Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, to help it identify strategies for the businesses and is now considering the options proposed. Yesterday the company said that it was 'investigating with Kleinwort Benson the possible sale of one or both businesses. In the meantime, the management of those businesses together with Huntingdon will take all necessary actions to optimise performance and ensure clients continue to be serviced at the highest standards.' Travers Morgan is an international consulting firm specialising in engineering, management, transport and environment. Its profits fell from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 343,000 in the six months to March. The US businesses recorded an operating loss of Pounds 388,000 in the first half.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Changing times for foreign coins Frustrated by francs or dismayed by dimes weighing you down after a holiday or business trip? Travelex, the bureau de change group, believes the answer lies with its new multi-currency coin exchange machines which have just gone into operation at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, Alison Smith writes. Travelex hopes to recycle the coins through its bureaux de change, but expects that some will have to be 'physically repatriated'. The cost of handling coins is reflected in the exchange rates offered at the machines. Yesterday, for example, putting Dollars 10 in coins into the machine would have produced Pounds 5, compared with the Pounds 6.25 Travelex would have paid for a Dollars 10 bill. Two DM5 coins would have realised Pounds 2.96, against Pounds 3.70 for a DM10 banknote. The machine in Terminal 4 at Heathrow changes US and Australian dollars, Dutch guilders and French francs, while the one at Gatwick South covers a different mix of currencies, including pesetas and D-Marks.</p>

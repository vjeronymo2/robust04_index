			<p>Concentration   <F P=102>   94FE0326B Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Nov 93  p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Assistant Professor Shigeru Tanaka's group at the  Faculty of Science and Engineering, Keio University, has  developed a device capable of continuously measuring the  concentrations of atmosphere-polluting aldehydes in auto  emissions. The device uses a solvent that dissolves only  aldehydes, which are separated from exhaust gas in the form of  liquid. With this device, it is possible to determine the  concentrations of aldehydes to 0.01 ppm in real time. Assistant  Professor Tanaka is looking for an avenue for commercializing  the device as an analyzer for auto engine development.    Previously, aldehydes in auto exhaust were determined by  attaching a liquid-holding container to the end of the exhaust  pipe and removing it for aldehyde analysis after some driving.  The method was tedious and time-consuming.    The newly developed device consists of a separator -- for  absorbing only aldehydes from exhaust into a liquid -- and a  high-speed liquid chromatographic instrument -- for analyzing  the minute components in the liquid. The separator is a glass  tube that is 9mm long and 25 cm in diameter and that holds a  4mm-thick, hollow fluorine-resin pipe inside.    The pipe is full of pores that are several microns in  diameter. For aldehyde analysis, an aldehyde-dissolving liquid  flows between the glass tubing and the resin pipe, and exhaust  gas flows inside the resin pipe. The gas diffuses through the  pores, and only aldehydes are dissolved in the liquid.    In experiments, a methanol-burning car was driven on a  dynamometer for aldehyde analysis. After six minutes of driving,  the device was reportedly able to determine concentrations of  formaldehyde and acetaldehyde as low as 0.01 ppm. By passing the  solvent at a constant flow rate, the concentrations could be  determined in real time. Assistant Professor Tanaka asserts that  ``other harmful gases, including hydrogen chloride and nitrogen  oxides, can be analyzed by using an appropriate solvent.''</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDORA GROUP SHAPES LAND TO SAVE WILDLIFE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: LANDOWNERS, WITH AID OF OPERATION STRONGHOLD PROGRAM, JOIN IN  EFFORT TO PRESERVE FOOTHILLS OF SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS.  </P> <P> Tim Ferguson remembers the thrill of discovering a baby heron in the pond at  his ranch in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.  </P> <P> The mother heron was feeding her chick on an island Ferguson had carved out and  protected with a moat in the pond he created to attract wildlife.  </P> <P> "You just feel wonderful," he said. "Ducks and herons need a place to lay their  eggs so coyotes can't get to them."  </P> <P> The pond is just one way Ferguson gives wildlife a hand on the 440-acre  Bluebird Ranch. But other examples abound: There are the bees he keeps on the  property to pollinate wildflowers. And the underground water he pipes to the  surface to provide animals with another spot for a drink.  </P> <P> Ferguson is part of a growing network of landowners who are developing their  property to attract wildlife with the help of a nonprofit organization called  Operation Stronghold. The group, started by Oregon cattle rancher and author  Dayton Hyde in 1979, helps owners of more than 6 million acres in a similar  way.  </P> <P> For the last five years, Ferguson, a Glendora doctor who manages the land he  co-owns with six families, has been getting preservation advice from Operation  Stronghold through the mail. Ferguson, 44, feels his involvement in the project  offers a sensible option in the conservation debate Glendorans have faced in  recent months.  </P> <P> Concern for hillside preservation has sparked enough interest in the foothill  community that the City Council last week placed a special property tax on the  April 10 ballot that, if approved, would fund land acquisition for  conservation.  </P> <P> Ferguson, president of the Chamber of Commerce, doesn't think the idea will fly  with voters. The chamber last week presented City Hall with more than 1,500  signatures opposing such a tax.  </P> <P> "There's no way we can afford to buy the land," he said. The city has estimated  the cost of purchasing Glendora's 2,112 acres of privately-held hillside land  at $112 million.  </P> <P> Jack Mason, a member of the mayor's advisory committee that proposed the tax  and the creation of a hillside conservancy, said that although acquiring all  the land at once would be impossible, even piecemeal purchases would be  important.  </P> <P> While parcels that landowners donate to the conservancy could be closed off at  their request, the hillside committee would prefer opening most areas to the  public because "it's the kind of beautiful countryside that people would  enjoy," he said. "There will always be people who would abuse the privilege,  but you hope for the best."  </P> <P> Ferguson said he thinks a more effective avenue would be to encourage  landowners to nurture what wildlife they have.  </P> <P> He has urged the city to take an active role in linking local landowners with  Stronghold and advising them of tax benefits that come with membership.  </P> <P> Stronghold, which includes members in England, Canada and South Africa, doesn't  hurt the image of landholders either, said 61-year-old Hyde, the organization's  driving force.  </P> <P> "It's not just the rich guy up the hill who wants to keep (the land) to himself  but (someone who) is doing something positive for the environment," he said.  </P> <P> A New England couple built an entire trout stream on their property, one  Canadian member maintains 1,000 miles of bluebird houses along the birds'  migratory trail and many members are creating wetlands on their land.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of good people doing quiet unsung jobs like that. It adds up  nationwide to a pretty big contribution," Hyde said, adding he believes private  landowners have an advantage over the federal forest service because they can  protect their property from the recreational demands of the public.  </P> <P> Stronghold advised Ferguson to plant fig trees around an abandoned reservoir he  was converting into a fish pond. The ripened fruit drops into the water and  feeds the bluegill and catfish he bought from a pet shop.  </P> <P> When Ferguson asked how he could fend off the gophers and squirrels gnawing at  his avocado trees, Stronghold suggested he erect posts in the fields as perches  for preying hawks to control the rodent population.  </P> <P> "Here's a deer track," Ferguson said, waving at a V-shaped imprint in the mud  downstream from a shallow drinking pool. He created the puddle by damming up a  trickle of spring water so animals could have an easier drink. Nearby, a metal  water heater lay on the ground, a hole welded in its side to form a trough fed  by another spring.  </P> <P> "These are not things that are new and shiny," Ferguson said. For a reason.  </P> <P> Once he put out a relatively clean bathtub for animals to drink from, and no  one showed. "Only after I painted it with camouflage paint and it got mossy did  we start seeing tracks around it."  </P> <P> The deer that thrive on the ranch -- Ferguson has observed as many as 14 in a  single cluster -- also draw hunters. He has had to run scores of hunters off  his property within the last year.  </P> <P> "We've had deer shot on our front lawn and carried off, and bullets in our  home," he said, adding that stray shots killed a family pet as well.  </P> <P> "I feel immensely wealthy with the land, the beauty and joy it brings, and I  want to protect it," he said. "I feel guilty because a lot of people look up  there and want to zone it open space."  </P> <P> Ferguson hopes the hillside conservancy the city is helping to establish will  keep public use of the land limited. Animals should be able to live without  interference from humans, he said.  </P> <P> "You go to places like Griffith Park, and (people) have driven all the game  away."  </P></p>

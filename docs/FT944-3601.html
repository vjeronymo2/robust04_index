			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China pinches Brazilian shoe exporters - Lucrative US market is being undercut by eastern suppliers Calcados Tropicalia , a medium-sized shoe manufacturer in the small town of Franca, 400km from Sao Paulo, has laid off more than a fifth of its workforce since July. For the area's shoe exporters it is likely to get worse. 'As exports continue to fall there are going to be more job losses in Franca,' warns Tropicalia director Mr Paulo Henrique Cintra. The job cuts stem from a dramatic turnaround in the prospects for Brazil's shoe export industry. After years of growth, climaxing last year with exports of nearly Dollars 2bn, overseas sales are being squeezed by growing Chinese competition and local currency appreciation. While Brazil's exports face growing pressure at the cheap end, its middle range niche, where it specialises in women's shoes, appears to be safe in the short term because of competitive advantages of relatively cheap labour, good quality and established distribution networks in the key US market. However, to protect its position in this middle market analysts warn that Brazilian manufacturers must continue to cut costs and improve productivity, which will probably mean more job losses and contracting out of services. Last year Brazil produced 562m pairs of shoes, behind only China and Taiwan, and exported 183m, 80 per cent to the US where it was the third largest exporter. Exports were Dollars 1.95bn compared to Dollars 1.47bn in 1992. This year, however, companies expect sales to fall 12-15 per cent. Next year business could be even worse as the effects of a 15 per cent appreciation in the new Real currency, launched in July, feed into higher export prices. In response, many exporters are switching attention to the local market, where demand has increased with a fall in the inflation rate. But manufacturers believe the current high demand will slip back by early next year, putting more pressure on exporters. These companies, who began to sell abroad in large numbers in the 1970s following export incentives from Brazil's military governments, have benefited from cheap labour and a large local supply of leather. But today they are looking over their backs at even lower-cost rivals such as China which are targeting the bottom end of the market, often sandals and cheap shoes with an export price of Dollars 5-Dollars 8 supplied to US chains like K-Mart. This market represents a quarter of Brazil's shoe exports. Because of the appreciation of the Real, many Brazilian exporters have recently raised prices by 10-15 per cent. However, higher prices are losing Brazil export orders. Mr Peter Mangione, president of the New York-based Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, warns: 'The bottom end of the market is extremely price sensitive and these price increases mean buyers are switching to China or India.' The problems have led to dozens of factory closures and the loss of about 10,000 jobs this year in Vale dos Sinos, a shoemaking centre in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where about 75,000 workers are employed. In the middle range market, in which export prices are about Dollars 10 and US retail prices Dollars 40-Dollars 50, Brazil still occupies a competitive position. In this market, which represents half its shoe exports, Brazil is ahead of the Chinese on quality and the Europeans on price. Although these competitive advantages have allowed Brazilian companies to pass on some of their higher costs, the longer term outlook is less secure. 'Unless there is a severe adjustment by Brazilian industry in the next few years, the Chinese will catch up with them or the Italians and Spanish will target that middle range niche,' says Mr Mangione. Industry appeals for more government help have not been answered, partly because a strong currency is part of the government's anti-inflation strategy. Also, the opening of the economy since 1990 has meant a reduction in government protection of industry. Companies believe the only way forward is to continue the process of improving quality and productivity by, for example, increasing the contracting out of jobs like sewing. In Franca the number of unofficial family-run workshops serving factories has jumped more than threefold to about 1,000 in the last three years. Exporters are also attempting to improve quality and the variety of models. 'Our advantage is that because of our long experience in dealing with the overseas market we have become very versatile in design and we can respond quickly to requests for different models,' says Mr Miguel Heitor Betarello, a director of Franca's biggest shoe exporter Calcados HB. The company sees itself competing more with Europeans at the upper end of the market in the future. This, Mr Mangione believes, would be a mistake. 'The industry should stick to the Dollars 50 retail market where it is competitive. As you move up the price spectrum the volumes are much smaller and the competition from the Europeans is extremely tough,' he says.</p>

Of the 12 new ICs, seven had been  designated as Eighth FYP Key State S&amp;T Projects and five were  developed based on domestic market demand.    The seven Key State Project ICs are: the BI/AT89C51  high-performance 8-bit monolithic microcontroller, the BIJ1101CP  inductosyn interface circuit, the BID0101CP/BID0102CP  tuning-frequency digital display ASIC, the BIJ9121 phonetics  teaching-machine ASIC, the BIC0001GP programmable counter and  statistical controller ASIC, the BISS0001 infrared-sensor signal  processor ASIC, and the BIJ81C55 I/O port expander for an 81C55  RAM. Among these ICs, the BI/AT89C51 is the world's first  8-bit monolithic computer with an all-FLASH 4K memory; this chip  has numerous applications in control systems, intelligent  instruments and meters, and special electrical equipment, and is  fully compatible with the domestically popular MCS-51 product  series.    The five new IC products developed out of domestic demand  are: the BIJ7211AM 4-bit 7-segment LCD driver, the BID9148CP  audible [signal] remote-controlled sender, the  BID9149CP/BID9150CP audible remote-controlled receivers, and the  LSP-9205 laser locator ASIC.</p>

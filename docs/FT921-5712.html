			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Observer: Indigestion The wave of austerity sweeping through the French economy has hit even that bastion of sybaritism and self-indulgence, the Michelin guide to France. Usually, the Michelin judges bring themselves to bestow their coveted three stars on at least one new restaurant each year. In 1990 two restaurants were selected, but last year it was down to one. Now, in the 1992 gastronomy bible, not only are there no new nominations, but 56 establishments have been demoted. The inspectors have, however, not been entirely parsimonious; six restaurants have been deemed worthy of two stars. These include La Pyramide at Vienne in Isere, where Patrick Henriroux is following in the footsteps of Fernard Point, one of the great French chefs, and L'Oasis at La Napoule in the Alpes-Maritime, which made its name under one of Point's proteges, and has now won its two stars thanks to Stephane Raimbault. Visiting gourmets may, however, rest assured that the 19 three-star restaurants have clung on to their stars. They may also be fairly confident that a meal partaken at any of them will cost an arm and a leg.</p>

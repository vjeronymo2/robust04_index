			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: EC reluctant to 'refer back' Hongkong Bank bid THE EUROPEAN Commission is reluctant to refer any big takeovers such as Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's bid for Midland back to national competition authorities to vet, for fear of undermining its 1990 merger powers for which it fought so long. Yesterday's announcement by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Competition Commissioner, that the Hongkong bid for Midland falls within his jurisdiction is the result of an arithmetic formula in the EC regulation. This is far more complicated to calculate for banks than manufacturing companies. Essentially, a bank merger must answer three criteria to be vetted by Brussels: Ten per cent of joint global assets must total Ecus 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) or more. The above figure has to be multiplied by the share of each bank's EC loans and advances as a proportion of global loans and advances. The resulting figure must amount to Ecus 250m for each bank. This is to show that the banks do substantial business in the Community. The 10 per cent of joint global assets has to multiplied by the share of each bank's home country loans and advances as a proportion of its EC loans and advances. The resulting figure must show that banks do no more than two-thirds of their business within one EC state; if they do, the merger is not considered to be of EC interest. It is small wonder, therefore, that while the Hongkong bid for Midland was notified to Brussels on April 23, Sir Leon's officials took until yesterday to calculate that the bid fell within their jurisdiction. They have, though, had some practice with banks - having already ruled on, and cleared, three bank mergers involving two US, two Japanese and two EC banks in a joint venture in eastern Europe. At the insistence of Germany, the EC state with the most highly developed anti-trust law, the 1990 merger regulation allows for a national competition authority to have a case referred back from Brussels, provided that it would clearly create or reinforce a dominant position,and that the dominant position would be entirely within that one state. Germany has asked for two cases - the links between Varta Bosch, and between Alcatel and AEG-Kabel - to be returned to it. Brussels has refused both times. However, in February Sir Leon did refer back to the UK the Steetley-Tarmac merger. The rival bid of Redland for Steetley did not come within the EC remit, and Sir Leon said at the time that in general 'it is much better for related cases to be dealt with by one regulatory authority if at all possible.' The key to the Steetley-Tarmac referral was the Commission's judgment that the bid would have created a high concentration, but that the market for the product in question - bricks - was essentially local, even inside the UK. It seems most unlikely, to EC officials, that such a line of argument can be made for referring back the Hongkong bid for Midland.</p>

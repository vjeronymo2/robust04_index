			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Matsushita plunges 62% in quarter MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, Japan's largest consumer electronics company, yesterday reported a 62 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y36.3bn (Dollars 290.4m) in the first quarter which ended in June. Sales fell 3 per cent to Y1,712.9bn reflecting the weak consumer electronics market. Matsushita also lowered its parent company pre-tax profits forecast for the year from Y80bn to Y50bn. This was 53 per cent below the figure for last year. Matsushita is one of Japan's largest and most important industrial companies, and the lower profits forecast, announced after the close of trading, is likely to be received badly on the stock exchange. Other large companies could announce similar revisions in the coming weeks. Last week, better-than-expected quarterly results from Sony and Pioneer Electronic buoyed market sentiment. 'Matsushita is bigger and they seem to be a little slower in adjusting the cost structure,' said Mr Mike Jeremy, analyst at Baring Securities. Matsushita's results were dragged down in part by a poor performance at Victor Company of Japan (JVC), in which Matsushita holds a 52.4 per cent stake. JVC yesterday said it expected to lose Y21bn at the pre-tax level for the year as a whole, compared with an earlier forecast of Y1bn, and a loss last year of Y2.3bn. JVC said it was planning to cut 700 jobs this year through attrition and reduced hiring. Both companies have been hit by the slowdown in the saturated market for video equipment. Matsushita's sales of video equipment were off 11 per cent to Y350.4bn. Audio equipment sales fell 5 per cent to Y132.5bn. Sales were also poor throughout Matsushita's product range. Sales of home appliances, mainly white goods, rose 3 per cent. However, sales in all other product areas - including components, communication and industrial equipment, batteries and kitchen products - were down between 1 per cent and 3 per cent. Unlike Sony, Matsushita was not boosted by its US entertainment business, MCI. Entertainment revenues were off 1 per cent to Y133.8bn, reflecting a lack of hit films. Domestic sales declined 6 per cent to Y864.0bn. Overseas sales, hit by the higher value of the yen, were down 1 per cent to Y848.9bn. Income per share fell from Y17.40 to Y4.32.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Bochin, Chairman of the Russian </F> Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support  of New Economic Structures, by an unnamed IZVESTIYA  correspondent; date and place not given: "The State is Obliged  to Protect the Consumer from the Arbitrariness Which has Begun  to Reign on the Russian Market"]    [Text] The Chairman of the Russian Federation State  Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic  Structures, Leonid Bochin, answers IZVESTIYA's questions.    [Correspondent] They told us about such a case recently in  the State Trade Inspectorate: a store obtained ham from a local  meat combine at 4,500 per kilogram each and, passing it off as  imported, sold it quite openly and quite uninhibitedly at 18,000  rubles each. Consumers are now being robbed everywhere and on a  mass basis. In protecting their interests, they are compelled to  unite in associations and parties. But what is the state  undertaking for the protection of the rights of consumers?    [Bochin] Public organizations of consumers have begun to  work  really actively in some regions, but for the most part their  organization is still only going on. The territorial  administrations of the Antimonopoly Committee support this  process in every way possible. However, the principal role in  protecting the rights of consumers still belongs to state  organs. Basing itself on the Law "On Protection of the Rights of  Consumers," the Antimonopoly Committee alone has investigated  16,000 citizen's appeals during the past year. As a result goods  have been replaced, operations have been corrected and penalties  paid, and moral and material losses to consumers amounting to  hundreds of millions of rubles reimbursed. More than 600  administrative actions have been brought. Representatives of the  Antimonopoly Committee are active in the legal defense of  consumers or assist them in the preparation of suits in court.  We do this free of charge.    I can cite a lot of cases when people who have found  themselves in a desparate plight have obtained justice with our  help. For example, a person's Zhiguli was stolen from the paid  parking lot of the oblast car-owners' council in Kursk last  summer. No one wants to be answerable for this; the parking lot  owner is not accepting claims. There was a vehicle--and it was  gone. Then the victim appealed for help to the territorial  administration of the Antimonopoly Committee. A trial took  place. As a result a VAZ-21063 motor vehicle and a further  R3,200,000 in compensation were recovered from the Kursk oblast  council of the car owners' society to pay off the losses.    There are many such examples. However, I want to say that  much depends on the consumers themselves. They should know that  the law has given them significant rights which are protected by  the state.    [Correspondent] Russia has been turned into a dump where  they  cart low-quality goods from all over the world. What is the  Antimonopoly Committee doing to stop this flow?    [Bochin] Indeed, state monitoring of the implementation of  the contracts of Russian firms with foreign suppliers is rather  weak. Our merchants buy up a low-grade good at dumping prices,  they carry it to Russia and don't encounter any particular  obstacles. Deserving of censure, for example, is just one  incident with Argentinian chickens which were brought into  Russia through the Maritime Kray customs house. The chickens  were slaughtered as far back as 1986-87 and had lain around a  long time, since they hadn't sold because of low quality. And  then the Russian merchants, who don't care a rap about their own  people, turned up. They bought this trash and delivered it to  the Far East without certificates of fitness. And no one has  been able to stop this outrage. But such a fine should have been  exacted from the firm that it would have forever lost the desire  to import refuse quality products into Russia.    It is time to take measures on the state level about  liability for trading in low quality goods. The Antimonopoly  Committee has prepared its own proposals to the government about  bringing the system for monitoring the safety of imported  products into conformity with the legislation of Russia and  international agreements.    [Correspondent] We had expected that the denationalization  of  trade would lead to the development of competition and this, in  turn, would improve trade service and eliminate standing in  line. But in the matter of trade, the producers of goods and  services have remained monopolists who literally rob us. Dirt,  lines, and rudeness everywhere. When will there be an end to  this?    [Bochin] There is no longer monopolism in trade. During the  last two years of the implementation of the program of  small-scale privatization and of the demonopolization program  one has succeeded in creating a competitive environment in  retail trade. Some 32,000 stores and about 9,000 public catering  enterprises have now been privatized in Russia. This constitutes  65 and 61 percent of the total number respectively.    That the level of trade service, the number of stores, and  even the number of those employed in trade as before does not  correspond to the norms of developed countries is another  matter. And I think that one should not expect fundamental  changes too quickly. It needs to be taken into account that the  same personnel and leadership have remained in the majority of  stores. The majority of these people never will become civilized  merchants. They trade as they are able to. However, even they  will have to take the competition which has arisen into account.  In particular, the emergence of unorganized street trade has  forced the stores to expand assortment, to stick to acceptable  prices, and even to improve somewhat in the organization of  trade.    Matters are worse in wholesale trade, since here the  creation  of parallel structures is connected with the development of  warehouses and transport support, and all this requires time and  lots of money.    [Correspondent] What is the Antimonopoly Committee doing to  develop competition on the consumer market?    [Bochin] Within the framework of the powers granted us we  are  bringing about the break up of the former trade organizations,  trusts, and supply and sales structures into smaller units. We  are providing support to small and medium-sized business through  the creation of the approriate funds. In order for new  monopolists not to arise in place of the former ones, we are  keeping an eye on the creation, mergings, additions, and  liquidations of economic subjects. Sometimes the activity of  local organs of power and administration directed to the  restriction of competition has to be stopped. We are monitoring  enterprises and firms which occupy a dominating position in the  market. If they begin to dictate conditions to consumers we have  to intervene.    [Correspondent] Has the Antimonopoly Committee itself been  endowed with sufficient rights so as to effectively protect the  rights of the consumers?    [Bochin] Our rights and powers are defined by the Law "On  Protection of the Rights of Consumers." However, I am convinced  that effective practical work in resolving this problem is  possible only with the interaction of all the interested organs  of state power and surveillance. For this purpose we have  developed an agreement which nine interested departments have  signed. It is called "On Concerted Action for Ensuring State  Protection of the Rights of Consumers of Goods, Work, and  Services." Joint measures are outlined in this document, the  results of which, I think, the citizens of Russia will soon be  able to perceive.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rapeseed futures to be launched in Paris Matif, the French futures exchange, said it plans to launch rapeseed futures in October, 1994. The contract will allow pricing in Europe's dominant oilseed and will be denominated in D-Marks, with provisions for currency conversions into US dollars or French francs. The futures contract will apply to rapeseed of any origin with 40 per cent oil content and will have barge delivery points on the Rhine, Moselle, and Main rivers in France and Germany. One contract will represent 50 tonnes of rapeseed. The exchange developed the contract in conjuction the French oilseeds trade group Onidol, which will conduct a major training programme for market users during 1994. 'The launching of the rapeseed futures contract reflects Matif's determination to diversify its product range in the commodities sector,' said Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif's Chairman. Matif, best known for its financial futures contracts, currently has sugar, coffee, and potato futures in its agricultural repertoire. 'The rapeseed futures market will offer both French and European producers a system of reference prices on the one hand and arbitrage opportunities on the other. It is an up-to-date response to the uncertainties resulting from the new common agricultural policy,' said Mr Jean-Claude Sabin, Onidol's chairman. Matif was still considering a European wheat futures contract but its creation was not yet justified as there was no volatility in grain prices, said Mr Pfauwadel, reports Reuter from Paris. The project was linked to the results of the common agricultural policy reform and the effects of the Gatt deal.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIJUANA RITE COMMEMORATES CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION;  </P> <P> PACE OF LIFE SLOWS IN BUSTLING BORDER CITY AS RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES TAKE TIME  OUT TO OBSERVE HOLY FRIDAY  </P> <P> procession made its way methodically through the streets of the modest  neighborhood known as the Colonia Postal, passing in front of the Manriquez  garage and Montana market, past the signs for El Jalisciense goat-meat taco  shop and the La Michoacana ice cream joint.  </P> <P> "Perdona tu pueblo, Senor," was the chant repeated over and over again by those  in front, mostly women, many donning long robes of a different era. "Forgive  your people, Lord." "Forgive me, Lord."  </P> <P> In the midst of the crowd, three youths dressed as Roman guards, their  gold-tinged outfits crafted largely from cardboard, brandished their leather  whips at a barefoot teen-ager carrying a cross and wearing a purple sash and  crown of thorny vines. He was followed by two other "prisoners," shirtless and  barefoot, representing two thieves. At one point, a robed man, Simon, burst  through the crowd and carried the cross for its bearer.  </P> <P> It was Viernes Santo (Holy Friday) in Mexico, where the Roman Catholic faith  remains strong, despite an adamantly secular government that has severely  circumscribed the church's role.  </P> <P> In Tijuana, the church of San Felipe de Jesus organized the traditional "Via  Crucis" (Stations of the Cross) pageant, commemorating the passion and  crucifixion of Christ, one of history's great dramas.  </P> <P> It is a form of religious theater repeated many times throughout the world on  this day, one of the holiest on the church calendar. From South America to  Asia, worshipers like those in the Colonia Postal annually reenact Christ's  humiliation before authorities and his subsequent crucifixion. Some celebrants  rehearse the spectacle for months, offering elaborate costumed tableaux. Others  still practice flagellation during the ceremony, though church authorities  frown on such practices. In the Philippines, venerators volunteer to have their  hands nailed to the crosses.  </P> <P> The ceremony in Colonia Postal was comparatively modest. The Roman guards  applied their whips gently, shouts and screams generally substituted adequately  to illustrate their ire at the Christ figure. Painted-on blood served to make  the point of a story familiar to all. The crucifixion was accomplished without  nails; Christ was tied to the cross with ropes. The thieves were also tied to  their crosses with ropes, as they were in Christ's day.  </P> <P> On this day, the streets of this bustling border city moved at a different  pace, a testament to the power of the religious holiday. Few businesses were  open. Families donned their Sunday best and headed for churches and to the  city's few parks, imparting an air of Mexico's interior to the fast-paced  metropolis.  </P> <P> The hundreds of supplicants participating in the procession marched slowly  through the quiet streets of the Colonia Postal, chanting and stopping for  readings at stations representing specific stages of Jesus' suffering.  Residents came out of their houses to watch, respectfully; many made the sign  of the cross.  </P> <P> At the end of the route, shortly after 3 p.m., the people gathered in a barren  lot alongside the Church of San Felipe de Jesus, on a mesa overlooking much of  downtown Tijuana. The crosses for Christ and the two thieves were placed  between two junked cars, near the shade of some pepper trees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Greater Love'  </P> <P> "There is no greater love," Father Roberto Simionato, an Italian-born  missionary, told the assembled crowd, "than to give your life for those you  love."  </P> <P> After the ritual crucifixion, the mourners, including women dressed as Mary and  Mary Magdalene, helped remove the body from the cross. Onlookers drifted away;  many headed for church services.  </P> <P> Hector Santana, the 14-year-old who played the Christ role, walking barefoot  and bearing the cross through the city streets, was clearly moved by the  experience. Said Santana, "I felt as He felt."  </P></p>

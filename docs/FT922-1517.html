			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / National organisation for enterprise agencies planned BRITAIN'S 300-plus enterprise agencies, which provide support for small businesses, intend to launch their own national organisation in September after a decision by Business in the Community (BITC) to end its sponsorship role. BITC has been the umbrella organisation for the agencies for the past 10 years, but said this month it wanted to broaden its activities. Plans for the national organisation are being headed by the Association of Local Enterprise Agencies, which groups 18 such bodies in the east Midlands and East Anglia. Representatives of regional groups of agencies from the north of England, the Midlands and Wales approved the proposal at a meeting last week. The proposed September launch cuts across BITC's own plan for a conference in October to establish a national organisation to be run by the agencies themselves. Mr Mike Horner, chairman of the Association of Local Enterprise Agencies, said: 'This is not a case of the agencies declaring UDI. We are simply accepting the reality that if the enterprise agencies want representation they have to do it themselves.' Mr Horner was confident that the agencies that did not take part in last week's meeting - mainly those in the south and south-west of England - would attend the September gathering. The agencies' national organisation would take on many of the tasks now carried out by BITC: lobbying on behalf of the agencies with the government, co-ordinating relations with business sponsors and helping with issues such as training. The new organisation is expected to have an office in London, possibly making use of BITC's offices. BITC, however, would not be involved. The Association of Local Enterprise Agencies has discussed its plans with BITC and with Baroness Denton, small business minister at the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

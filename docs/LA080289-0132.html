			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BONN PUBLISHER LIFTS QUOTES ON DDR  </P> <P> West Germany's largest publishing chain today ended a practice that has irked  authorities in East Germany for 40 years -- placing quotation marks around  every reference to West Germany's socialist sibling state.  </P> <P> The quotation marks have cost Axel Springer newspapers and magazines  journalistic accreditation in East Germany and readership among much of West  Germany's left-leaning populace.  </P> <P> Referring to East Germany as "DDR," the German abbreviation for Deutsche  Demokratische Republik (German Democratic Republic), was the protest of the  publishing chain's founder, Axel Springer, who died nearly four years ago.  </P> <P> Germany's division after World War II weighed heavily on Springer, who moved  his prospering business from his native Hamburg to West Berlin in 1967.  </P> <P> After construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he put up a lighted reader board  to flash news from the West across the barrier.  </P> <P> "The hope for reunification is unshaken," Manfred Schell, editor in chief of  the conservative daily Die Welt, wrote today.  </P> <P> But, in the light of changes in East-West relations, the barriers to improving  the flow of information between the political blocs must fall, Schell added.  </P> <P> The giant Springer publishing network includes Europe's largest-circulation  daily, Hamburg-based Bild Zeitung, which sells nearly 5 million copies daily.  It also includes the influential Berliner Morgenpost and Bonn's Die Welt.  </P> <P> Circulation of Springer's main dailies has fallen as much as 10% in the last  few years, and many attribute the drop to shifts within the West German  populace toward detente with nations of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fan Haijian (5400 3189 1017) and Geng Jianyun </F> (5105 1696 0061): "What Does 15.4 Billion Yuan Tell Us -- A Look  Into the Nationwide Inspection of Tax Revenue, Financial  Affairs, and Commodity Prices"]    [Text] The 1993 inspection of tax revenue, financial  affairs and commodity prices in China revealed numerous  violations of laws and regulations totaling 15.4 billion yuan,  of which 10 billion yuan were recovered for the nation's  treasury, a result which pleased us all.    But while we may rejoice over the success, we cannot help  but  be somewhat concerned, what does the 15.4 billion yuan really  tell us?  <H5>  A Series of Shocking Figures </H5>   According to a report furnished by an authoritative source,  analysis of the total monetary amount of tax and financial  revenue violations uncovered in the 1993 inspection indicates  that:    -- By method of inspection, 6.57 billion yuan or 42.8  percent  came from internal inspection by the enterprises and work units,  and 8.79 billion yuan or 57.2 percent from outside inspection.  The amounts of violations in the two categories are 2.39 billion  yuan and 4.35 billion yuan respectively more than the amounts  from the inspection the year before.    -- By type of tax evasion, 8 billion yuan or 52 percent were  violations of tax collection regulations; 4.15 billion yuan or  27 percent were violations of financial regulations; and 3.2  billion yuan or 21 percent were violations of commodity pricing  and other regulations.    -- By number of organizational units, 10,359 units had  amounts of violations ranging between 50-100,000 yuan; 6,305  units between 100-500,000 yuan; 986 units between 500,000 and 1  million yuan; and 472 units in the range of 1 million yuan and  over.    -- By province or city, Liaoning had amounts of violations  totaling over 800 million yuan; Sichuan and Shanghai  municipality over 700 million yuan; Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong  and Jiangsu over 600 million yuan; Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang  and Henan over 500 million yuan; Guangxi over 400 million yuan;  and other provinces and cities such as Anhui, Beijing, Jilin,  Jiangxi, Shanxi and Heilongjiang over 300 million yuan.  <H5>  Key Objective of Violators of Law and Regulation: Tax Evasion </H5>   In the series of nine annual inspections of tax and  financial  revenues and commodity prices, the monetary amount of violations  uncovered each year reflects most clearly that the most serious  violations are in tax collection area. Evasion and diversion of  industrial, commercial and other taxes by enterprise units and  the "two currencies" situation are particularly serious.    If the total monetary amount of tax violations from the 1993  inspection were broken down by type, 6.183 billion yuan were  industrial, commercial and other taxes; 1.85 billion yuan were  income, regulatory and profits taxes; 1.187 billion yuan were  diversion from active capital or reserves accounts of energy,  transportation and key construction projects; the combined total  of the above amounts to 9.22 billion yuan, 63.4 percent of the  total monetary amount of violations.    Taxes have become the target of attack by those who violate  the laws and regulations. As shown by relevant statistics and  investigation into special areas, among the enterprise units  that have been inspected, problems of tax evasion still exist in  over 50 percent of the cases; whenever inspections are carried  out in many local enterprises, particularly individually owned  and operated industrial and commercial enterprises, cases of  violation and tax evasion would invariably be uncovered. There  was the case of a subsidiary firm of a certain agricultural  production material company which, from beginning 1992 to  September 1993, arbitrarily treated 8.04 million yuan of unspent  dock service fees returned by an import company as an account  payable amount, did not calculate its profits in a timely way as  required by regulations, and evaded 4,422,000 million yuan in  income taxes and diverted 904,500 yuan in "two currencies" for a  total of 5,326,500 yuan. In south China, there was the case of a  certain provincial postal and telecommunications bureau's trade  service company which, from 1992 through the first half of 1993,  using various methods such as repeatedly depreciating its  equipment, hiding income receipts and under-reporting profits,  was able to evade enterprise, income, city construction taxes,  as well as "two currencies" and education fees totaling  2,025,800 yuan.    Looking at the situation revealed by the inspections,  enterprises that evade or divert over 1 million yuan in taxes  are no longer uncommon.    The 1993 inspection revealed that the use of bogus invoices  and real estate development and operations were the major  sources of tax violations.    A certain city in Fujian Province undertook a special audit  of 349 real estate development companies in the city, and found  that by resorting to various tactics of not recording offshore  receipts, treating real estate down payments as income-expense  transactions, under-reporting for tax purposes the full amounts  of real estate sold, treating land-for-property exchanges as  noncash exchanges and not recorded in their books, these  companies were able to evade large amounts of taxes totaling  70.95 million yuan, averaging 203,000 yuan per company. One of  these companies, by not recording offshore incomes of some 100  million yuan, evaded as much as 3.03 million yuan in taxes.    In Guangxi, some real estate companies exploited the  tax-free  loophole by early closing of their accounts of capital and  profits, exchanging property for land and building commercial  property on it for another party without calculating the price,  and recklessly organizing nominal subsidiary units; these  companies, using such tactics and operating off the books, also  evaded taxes by making long-term use of the monies they set  aside to pay taxes as well as the monies collected from property  purchasers as payment of taxes.    A certain development company collected in advance 51.20  million yuan in down payments for property purchasers with the  estimate that the project will be completed by 1994. But in  order to qualify for the 1992 (income) tax exemption deadline,  the company arbitrarily transferred 50.78 million yuan of down  payments as receipts from sales, paid 2,507,000 yuan in advance  for the enterprise tax, construction tax and education fees, and  entered 23.8 million yuan of recovered capital and profits as  "other accounts payable"; as a result, the company was able to  evade 17,135,700 yuan in income taxes due in 1993-1994.    The inspection discovered the rather serious problem of some  real estate companies delaying tax payments for long periods of  time. One company, since 1988, had collected 19,126,000 yuan of  advance down payments from its customers, and although the  properties had long since been turned over to the buyers, the  company only recorded 5,36,3400 million as sales in 1990, paid a  business tax of 168,700 yuan and put off paying the rest of the  business tax, construction tax and "two currencies" totaling  almost 3 million yuan.    The phenomenon of using bogus invoices to evade taxes is  also  shocking. A certain city in Zhejiang Province, in the process of  inspection, discovered that 799 companies had invoice violations  amounting to a total of as much as 320 million yuan. In one  district, nine labor service companies, which specialized in  recruiting peasants to work as "clerks," peddled to various  government departments and other enterprise employers a total of  1,918 invoices in January-September 1992, and out of a total of  130 million yuan of invoices they evaded 4.14 million yuan of  taxes. Those who used the invoices could enter whatever monetary  figures, including large sums, as desired.  <H5>  Shocking Diversions </H5>   If evading and under-reporting taxes is the main objective  of  those who violate laws and regulations, then diverting national  income to private use is undoubtedly their second objective.    In Sichuan Province, from 1922 to September 1933, a  supervisory department without authorization diverted various  taxes it had collected for transmission to the Central  Government to its own use as administrative expenses, fees for  labor association and meal subsidies for staff employees, and as  much as 4,508,000 million was so spent. A certain social welfare  bureau in Hebei violated regulations by arbitrarily diverting  3.37 million yuan from the workers pension fund using it in  other business investment activities. The agricultural committee  in one district in the Guangxi autonomous region, from January  1990 to May 1993, violated government financial regulations by  taking as much as 388,200 yuan of income received from  sponsorship, labor services, operating its own enterprises and  compensation for contract violations, and using the money off  the books for business; the money created a "small treasury"  which earned 162,300 yuan by May 1993, and the rest of the money  was used for installing telephones, wining and dining and other  social activities. A fuel supply company in a certain province  privately set up a "small treasury" with 1,033,600 yuan. Since  1991, that company without authorization collected a total of  315,400 yuan in fees by issuing permits for shipping charcoal  and coal not allocated for in the provincial plan; by using  various tactics, the company went into joint operation with  out-of-province enterprises and divided among them 302,600 yuan  of profits; they acquired properties and fixed assets at  negotiated prices and transferred a total of 1,033,600 yuan into  the company's "small treasury." Up to the time of the  inspection, transactions in the "small treasury" totaled 545,700  yuan, most of which are in the form of IOU's and are issued and  used at random.    And even worst, the general operations department of a  certain railroad bureau diverted and hid profits from various  operations totaling 10,326,000 yuan, a serious diversion of  funds belong to the government.    The 1993 inspection also revealed other phenomena and  activities of violations of law and regulations that are  shocking.    The situation of government administrative units blindly  collecting all kinds of fees is very serious. A municipal  planning committee in Guangxi charged investors engineering  consulting fees at the rate of 1 percent of the investment  amounts, and collected a total of 2,524,400 yuan between 1992  and August 1993, which added additional burden on the  enterprises and caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some  people compared this to the saying of "building a nest to  attract wind" before any investors show up and, when the "wind"  comes, "climbing in the nest and plucking feathers," a bitter  pill indeed for investors to swallow.    The unauthorized issuance of various commodity certificates  in lieu of cash is still going on. There was the case of nine  large markets in a certain locality in Yunnan which, after the  State Council issued the directive to stop issuance of such  certificates in 1993, nevertheless and without authorization  issued over 16.5 million yuan of such cash-substitute  certificates. When a large quantity of such certificates were  put in use, they became a kind of "cash substitutes" which wreck  havoc in the normal financial order; at the same time, when  goods are sold, it gave purchasing units the opportunity to use  fake receipts for the "electronic products," "labor welfare  service" and "office use equipment."  <H5>  Establishing and Perfecting a System of Strict Financial </H5> Supervision    The fact that a total of 15.4 billion yuan in tax evasion  was  uncovered in the 1933 inspection of tax revenues, financial  affairs and commodity prices leaves people with this thought:  there is no time to lose to establish and perfect a system of  strict financial supervision.    We should recognize that China's current system of financial  supervision is not well suited for economic reform and  development of a market economy. On the one hand, violations in  the financial area are quite serious, and constitute a sickness  which in the long term will affect the economy; in the nine  annual inspections, almost every one uncovered violations  amounting to more than 10 billion yuan; on the other hand,  because supervision and inspection of financial activities are  inadequate and uncoordinated, the various relevant supervisory  bodies are not enforcing policies and regulations in comparable  degrees; in inspection, existing regulations have not strictly  enforced and cases not forcefully executed, all of which are not  conducive to maintaining strict financial supervision.    Finally, it is clear that we urgently need to establish as  soon as possible a system of properly coordinated financial  supervision with a clear division of labor that will be highly  effective in its execution.</p>

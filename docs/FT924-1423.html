			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Rules add to US bank costs US BANKS face costs of up to Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.1bn) from the burden of regulations imposed on them by Congress and their supervisors, a study by the main federal regulatory agencies concludes. In a report delivered to Congress yesterday, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council - grouping representatives of the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency - estimated regulatory costs in 1991 at between Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 17bn. This would amount to 6-14 per cent of total non-interest expenses of the banking industry, the study concluded, even without the additional burden of statutory reserve requirements and provisions of the new banking law passed at the end of 1991. Mr John LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said that excessive regulations weighed particularly heavily on the smaller banks; although many of the regulations were necessary, their cost was ultimately borne by the consumer.</p>

As members of the FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia] and troops the ANKI [National Army of Independent  Cambodia], we have complied with the rules and political program  of the FUNCINPEC Party by writing a clear letter to inform the  FUNCINPEC leaders of the massacre at Stoeng Meanchey and Choam  Chau [Phnom Penh suburbs].    II. Many days have elapsed, but we have not received even  a word of reply from them. They look down upon us as if we were  cats or dogs.    III. We wrote that we were then waiting for an answer  before making a final decision.    IV. It has been quite a long time now, but they have not  given us any reply. This means that you regard us only as dogs.  In fact, many of us died on the battlefield in serving them.    V. For this reason, we would like to declare here that:    A. We absolutely oppose Hun Sen and Chea Sim, lackeys  of the Vietnamese communists.    B. We absolutely oppose the Vietnamese communists  and the alliance.    C. We have now stopped serving as FUNCINPEC members  and ANKI troops. We want to confirm that this is a permanent  decision.    VI. As of today, do not seek our service again. Beware of  your head! If the FUNCINPEC and ANKI leaders want to wage war  like the Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese communist puppets,  and the alliance, go out to fight by yourself. As lackeys, you  should go out to fight, fight, and fight for your masters. King  Ranariddh, King Sereivut, and all those who are so good in  waging war on the paper should go out to fight by themselves.    VII. We can find a plot of land for ourselves in the  countryside. But all of you kings who have colluded with the  Vietnamese communist puppets in plundering the nation will  certainly be burried together with the dollars that you have  stolen. You will never know how angry the ANKI troops and people  are. You are just the ignorants. Go to hell! Go to hell!    [Signed] The victimized ANKI generals, colonels,  colonel-ranking officers, and soldiers at Stoeng Meanchey and  Choam Chau    [Dated] 27 February 1994</p>

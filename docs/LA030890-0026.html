			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  </P> <P> The U.S. Senate rejected the resolution which would have commemorated the 75th  anniversary of the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks (Part A,  Feb. 28). While Armenians are used to adversity, this latest rejection in our  American home really hurt.  </P> <P> The dagger was given a little extra twist. How?  </P> <P> 1. Presidential candidate George Bush in the fall of 1988 promised to  acknowledge and support the resolution. As President, however, Bush changed his  mind.  </P> <P> 2. Americans of Armenian ancestry and their friends asked Bush and the Senate  for a commemorative resolution, but Turkey shouted down this request. U.S.  taxpayer dollars and U.S. corporations doing business in Turkey provided the  financial support for the lobbying.  </P> <P> 3. When you have corporate America, the U.S. State Department and the Turkish  government sharing the same rumpled bed, well, under those conditions how would  anyone find time to read the morality and ethics handbook?  </P> <P> JACK BOURNAZIAN  </P> <P> Chula Vista  </P></p>

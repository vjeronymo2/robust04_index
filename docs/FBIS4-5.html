			<p>Serbs      Agree to Ceasefire But Still Press Claim to Statehood                               SUMMARY      While tensions may be lessened in the near term by the ceasefire  agreement between the Croatian Government and the leaders of the  self-proclaimed "Republic of Serbian Krajina" (RSK), neither the  Krajina Serbs nor the regime of Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic have shown any sign of compromising on the fundamental  dispute between the Serbs and Croats in Croatia.  The Serbs claim  that the RSK is not part of Croatia and has the right to join  other Serbs to create a Greater Serbia.  At the same time,  Milosevic and the RSK leadership appear to be willing to delay  the establishment of a Greater Serbia, perhaps hoping that this  would be viewed as enough of a contribution toward a peaceful  settlement to justify the lifting of the UN's economic sanctions  against Belgrade.                              END SUMMARY      Although willing to accept a ceasefire with the Croatian  government and hinting at a willingness to open communication and  transportation lines closed since the 1991 war, the Krajina Serb  leadership continues to press its demand for recognition of the  RSK as an independent state.  Following the signing of the 30  March ceasefire agreement in Zagreb, RSK "President" Milan Martic  claimed that the participation of the United States and Russia  constituted, "in a certain way, recognition" of the RSK and its  "acceptance" as a "state with its own territory, authorities, and  population."  He predicted that formal international recognition  would follow "in the next phase" of the negotiating process  (Belgrade TV, 30 March).  However, Martic suggested in an earlier  interview that the Krajina Serbs were willing to delay the  fulfillment of their longstanding goal of union with the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY--Serbia and Montenegro).  While he  predicted that a "solution" to the "question of unification"  would be found "this year," he suggested that its actual  implementation might be a protracted process.  He warned that the  Serbs would need to display much "patience" before their "great  aim" was realized (Vecernje Novosti, 27 March).      Support From Belgrade      Recent statements by leaders of the FRY indicate that Belgrade  continues to support the Krajina Serbs' separatist claims:     -- FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told an interviewer  that, Croatia's recognition as an independent state by much of  the world community did not apply to Krajina because recognition  had been granted at a time "when Croatia had not established  sovereignty" over the RSK (Le Monde, 29 March).  This comports  with recent statements by the RSK leadership that the territories  they now hold were never controlled by the Croatian Government  and are thus legally still a part of the former Yugoslavia.      -- On the day the ceasefire was signed in Zagreb, Milosevic-  controlled Belgrade television highlighted Martic's claim that  the negotiating process implied the recognition of the RSK's  claim to the status of an independent state (Belgrade TV, 30  March).      -- A member of the FRY Government, speaking in Serb-held Tenja (a  town in eastern Croatia) at a meeting of a local branch of  Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia, reassured the Krajina  Serbs that the party "shall continue" to do "everything" to  support the RSK's "right to self-determination" (Novi Sad TV, 3  April).      No authoritative voice from the FRY political leadership or media  has been observed to suggest that the Krajina should submit to  Croatian sovereignty over the RSK.      At the same time, Milosevic may seek to gain a lifting of the  sanctions against the FRY by portraying his willingness to delay  the Serbs' eventual unification as a compromise contributing to a  peaceful resolution of the armed conflict.  In an interview with  an Amsterdam newspaper, Mihailo Markovic, vice president of  Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia and an adviser to the  Serbian president, suggested that "Serbia should not regard"  uniting the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with the  "Serbian 'motherland'" as its "highest priority."  He proposed  that the "first goal" for the RSK and the neighboring "Republic  of Srpska" in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be to "develop a very  good independent existence" with economic ties to Serbia and  other neighboring countries.  After a consolidation stage that  "could last a very long time," he said, a decision "must be made"  about their permanent status, including "possible unification"  with the FRY.  He said he was "certain" that the Krajina Serbs  did not want to be part of the Croatian state, but insisted that  "Serbia would not oppose" the outcome "in any way" if the Krajina  Serbs voted in a referendum to join Croatia (De Volkskrant, 1  April).

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS AND MEASURE A  </P> <P> Well, at long last we finally know what the Citizens for Sensible Traffic  Solutions thinks was the alternative, the "better way," to Measure A (last  year's growth initiative): more taxes. Gee, I never would have guessed.  </P> <P> Let me see if I have this straight: The courts threw out Measure A because they  concluded that you cannot require developers to pay for traffic improvements  when they didn't create the problem.  </P> <P> Now they want me to pay for traffic improvements when I've paid gas tax for 20  years; I'll have to pay to drive on the new toll corridors; and in purchasing a  new home, I, not the builder, am paying for every single improvement to the  roadway system through higher home prices. If I build a new home, I will have  to pay numerous fees for road-building improvement, and they intend to attempt  to raise the gas tax next year.  </P> <P> I didn't cause the problem, but I'm asked to pay. Wow, what an unexpected and  farsighted solution!  </P> <P> Boy, it's a good thing the people who opposed Measure A took the burden off the  responsible parties and put it back on the taxpayer. They admitted they lied to  the public before, but I'm sure I can trust them now because  "environmentalists" support it.  </P> <P> Sure, I'll play the sap: I'll fill out their phony Orange County Poll, then  I'll run right down and vote to pay more taxes.  </P> <P> Golly, I wouldn't want the wealthy responsible parties to pay!  </P> <P> SHERRY Le MEDDICK  </P> <P> Silverado  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Continual presentation of speculation as news regarding the disposition of  Mikhail Gorbachev's political future in Moscow is disheartening. We hear this  speculation, reprinted in our newspapers, from the lips of Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney and not from any other reputable source.  </P> <P> Must we not also consider that Cheney has a vested interest in a Gorbachev  failure? Why must the proponents of our military-industrial complex continually  bombard us with dark propaganda? Can we not applaud political change in Eastern  Europe and Soviet Asia, however violent, and consider that change a sign of a  good future?  </P> <P> RHYS THOMAS  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

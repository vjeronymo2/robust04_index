			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first phase of an assessment conducted under the regulations involves the activities that precede the actual assessment. For example, upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials perform a preassessment screen to ascertain whether further assessment actions are warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second phase involves the preparation of an Assessment Plan. The Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review and comment, assists the involvement of other interested trustee officials, potentially responsible parties (PRPs), and the general public. The Assessment Plan also ensures that assessments are performed at a reasonable cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the third phase, trustee officials conduct the work described in the Assessment Plan. The work involves three steps: Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials determine whether any natural resources have been injured. If trustee officials determine that resources have been injured, they proceed to Quantification, in which they quantify the resulting reduction in services provided by the resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought as damages for the natural resource injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a type A assessment, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination through the use of standardized procedures involving minimal field work. The Department has adopted a phased approach to developing type A procedures for different environments. Only one type A procedure has been developed to date. The existing type A procedure provides for the use of a computer model to assess damages from small releases or discharges in coastal or marine environments. For other releases or discharges, trustee officials conduct a type B assessment, in which Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination are performed through the use of a range of alternative scientific and economic valuation methodologies. This notice addresses the use of a particular valuation methodology during the Assessment Phase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth phase of every natural resource damage assessment, whether the type A or type B rule is followed, consists of post-assessment activities such as: Preparation of a Report of Assessment; establishment of an account for damage assessment awards; and development of a Restoration Plan for use of the awards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Judicial Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A party may petition the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any regulation issued under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 113(a). A number of parties filed such petitions for review of the natural resource damage assessment regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The type B rule was challenged in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States Department of the Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 880 F.2d 432 (DC Cir. 1989) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  upheld various challenged aspects of the type B rule but did remand three issues. The court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource damages. The court used the term ``restoration costs'' to encompass the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources. 880 F.2d at 441.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The court also ordered the Department to allow for the assessment of all reliably calculated lost values of injured natural resources, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent on use of the resource. Nonuse values include existence value, which is the value of knowing that a resource exists, and bequest value, which is the value of knowing that a resource will be available for future generations. Finally, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural resource damage assessment regulations apply to natural resources that are not actually owned by the government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The type A rule was challenged in State of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colorado  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States Department of the Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 880 F.2d 481 (DC Cir. 1989) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colorado v. Interior). The court held that, based on the reasoning in the Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> decision, the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments should be revised to allow for the calculation of restoration costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Implementation of the Court Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on September 22, 1989, to announce its intent to revise the type B rule to comply with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  54 FR 39016. The Department issued a proposed rule on April 29, 1991, with comments requested by June 28, 1991. 56 FR 19752. On July 2, 1991, the Department extended the comment period to July 16, 1991. 56 FR 30367. On July 22, 1993, the Department reopened the comment period to allow consideration of additional comments, including newly developed information on the contingent valuation methodology (CV), the only method currently available for the express purpose of estimating nonuse values. 58 FR 39328. The comment period was originally reopened until September 7, 1993, and then extended until September 22, 1993. 58 FR 45877 (Aug. 31, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

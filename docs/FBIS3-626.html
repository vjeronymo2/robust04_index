The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] and the government continue to discuss national  reconciliation. A plenary meeting was held today and there is  even talk of progress, but the information blackout imposed by  mediator Alioune Blondin Beye continues to be respected. It is  known, however, that the parties discussed aspects of specific  principles of national reconciliation.</p>

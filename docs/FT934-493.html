			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Alitalia warns unions over cuts as losses grow Alitalia, Italy's state airline, has warned labour unions that urgent measures are necessary to cut costs and improve productivity to staunch what may be one of its biggest losses on record. Details of Alitalia's 1993 results will not be available until well into next year. However, some stock market forecasts suggest this year's loss could reach L300bn (Dollars 182.5m). Alitalia lost L214bn in the first half of this year, well above the L14.7bn deficit incurred for the whole of 1992 and on a par with the group's record loss of L217bn in 1989. The group said it would be taking a variety of steps to improve its earnings, including job losses, asset disposals and the transfer of some operations to outside companies. Efficiency improvements and tough negotiations on productivity have allowed the company to better its financial performance in the past three years, in spite of the impact of the 1991 Gulf war. Alitalia's costs remain relatively high compared with Europe's most efficient airlines and service standards, in spite of improvements, can still be lamentable. In a statement to union leaders, the company said it planned to accelerate its fleet replacement programme, with the disposal of some of its big four-engined Boeing 747 jets in favour of lower capacity twin-engined long range aircraft. The company may try to make further savings by postponing or stretching out its big contract for new Airbus 321 aircraft, for which it is a launch customer, although no official comment has been made. The job losses, estimated at about 1,400 people, will fall mainly on white collar staff. Among other measures to improve its financial performance, the group may also sell, and then lease back, more of its fleet, which stood at 162 aircraft at the end of June.</p>

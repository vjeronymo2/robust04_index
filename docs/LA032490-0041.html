			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT BACKS SHRINKING BORDERS OF PORT DISTRICT;  </P> <P> BOUNDARIES: THE OXNARD PORT DISTRICT, WHICH IS SEEKING TO EXPAND COUNTYWIDE,  SHOULD INCLUDE ONLY OXNARD AND PORT HEUNEME, LAFCO SAYS.  </P> <P> The boundaries of the Oxnard Port District should be shrunk to include only the  cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme and their unincorporated areas, according to  a staff report released Friday by the Local Agency Formation Commission.  </P> <P> The district now includes Camarillo and parts of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> The report supports proposals made by the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme,  but directly contradicts a proposal by the Oxnard Port District, which wants to  expand its borders countywide.  </P> <P> LAFCO commissioners, who decide matters of annexations for cities and special  districts, are scheduled to rule on the recommendation after a public hearing  Friday.  </P> <P> Shrinking the district, for which the boundaries were set in 1937, could allow  the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme to raid district funds, diverting them  into city coffers, Edward Millan, district board president, said Friday.  </P> <P> "It's phase one of a plan," Millan said. "Phase two would be to dissolve the  district and make the port a department of the cities" of Oxnard and Port  Hueneme.  </P> <P> "The cities would then gain access to the district funds," he said.  </P> <P> But Robert Braitman, executive director of LAFCO, disagreed. Laws are in place  to prevent cities from spending port district funds on anything other than  port-related business, he said.  </P> <P> "I do not believe this is an effort to balance the cities' budgets on the back  of the port district," Braitman said.  </P> <P> At stake, port officials say, is their effort to expand the activities at the  Port of Hueneme, which the district operates. Without the increased prestige of  a countywide district, their efforts to make the waterway a U.S. port of entry  would be jeopardized, they say.  </P> <P> The upgraded status would bring increased business and revenue to the port and  the county, port officials contend.  </P> <P> Braitman, however, argued that the residents of Oxnard and Port Hueneme -- who  bear most of the brunt of truck traffic to and from the deep-sea port -- would  be better served by a smaller district. According to the staff report, trucks  make trips to or from the port an average of 286 times per day.  </P> <P> If the two cities were the only ones included in district boundaries, their  voters would decide issues such as port expansion, he said. If the district  were countywide, voters who live 30 miles away from the port would decide on  issues that affect Oxnard and Port Hueneme, Braitman said.  </P> <P> Friday's report was the most recent in a series of maneuvers by the district,  the cities and LAFCO. In August, Oxnard and Port Hueneme proposed that other  cities be excluded from the district. To counter that proposal, port district  directors proposed that the boundaries be enlarged to include the entire  county.  </P> <P> In 1973, LAFCO supported a proposal for countywide boundaries. But information  provided by Oxnard and Port Hueneme -- as well as Fillmore, Ojai and Santa  Paula, which opposed the expansion -- changed Braitman's mind, he said.  </P> <P> The Port of Hueneme's two main shipments are bananas and cars, and it serves as  a main terminal for most offshore oil activities.  </P> <P> Expanding the boundaries would bring no additional revenue to the district  because it does not collect property taxes, although that is within its  jurisdiction, Braitman said. It derives fees paid by ships that unload cargo at  the port.  </P> <P> The port has a $26-million payroll and generates $143 million for the county's  economy, according to the staff report. Eighty percent of the money generated  by the port directly benefits the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, according  to a 1989 study commissioned by the two cities.  </P></p>

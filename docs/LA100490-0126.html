			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: TARKANIAN OFFERS TO SIT OUT TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas said he would step down from coaching  during the postseason tournament next spring and give up any personal revenue  derived from the playoffs if the NCAA reverses itself and allows the Rebels to  defend their national title.  </P> <P> Tarkanian said he made the decision July 23, three days after the NCAA handed  down its penalty barring the defending national champions from postseason play  in 1991.  </P> <P> Tarkanian said school officials wanted to wait to announce the concession until  it was presented to the NCAA Infractions Committee but that he decided to  disclose the decision because of speculation after an announcement by UNLV  Tuesday that the Infractions Committee would reconsider the university's appeal  Oct. 28.  </P> <P> Tarkanian said one issue was non-negotiable: "I'll never step down from  coaching."  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Thames Water The City's immediate response to Thames Water's higher than expected interim dividend was to mark up the whole sector. This was based on the assumption that, unless Thames' 11 per cent increase attracted too much political flak, the rest of the herd would follow its lead. One snag with this argument is that Thames is partly catching up after last year's unusually low rise to reflect the poor performance of its non-core businesses. The increase over two years was only 18 per cent. More importantly, the Thames increase is entirely backward-looking. The company stressed that it should be seen in the context of the very profitable final year of the old regulatory regime and not as a pointer to prospects in the much tougher five years to come. The new price caps will mean very modest revenue growth after inflation. Though Thames can cut operating costs further, a steadily rising tax rate means it will be hard to raise earnings much faster than inflation. Significant real dividend increases will therefore have to come from reducing earnings cover. Thames could increase its pay-out by nearly half and still cover it twice. But the company is unlikely to go that far. Annual real growth of 4 per cent over the next five years is about as much as can be expected. Given the better dividend prospects elsewhere and the political risks to water companies if Labour wins the next election, a 30 per cent yield premium to the market is not over-generous.</p>

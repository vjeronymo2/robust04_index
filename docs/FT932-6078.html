			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: When names can mislead - Doing the Splits / Philip Coggan examines the record of the General Consolidated trust GENERAL Consolidated investment trust is a classic example of how trusts' names can give little clue to their functions. In fact, the trust has a UK smaller company-oriented portfolio and a split capital structure. But its name makes it sound like the faceless bureaucrat of the trust sector. When founded in 1896, it was known as the New General Traction company and aimed to invest in railway stocks. It stayed as a conventional investment trust until 1988 when it decided to move to a split capital structure, with the aim of eliminating the discount to net assets. That aim succeeded and it has traded in a range of 2 per cent premium to 2 per cent discount ever since. The trust has been run for 25 years by Anthony Simonian and is now part of the Moorgate stable, which includes Moorgate investment trust and Moorgate Smaller Companies income trust. There is a small amount (Pounds 400,000) of cumulative preference shares but the main three share classes are stepped preference, income and capital. The stepped preference shares are entitled to an annual increase of 7.5 per cent in their income and asset backing, and to be repaid at 203p when the trust is wound-up at the end of 1997. Their repayment value at May 26 was 145.3p and SG Warburg Securities says the shares, at 160p, are on a gross redemption yield of 8.9 per cent. The income shares receive all the revenue of the trust after the preference and stepped preference shareholders have been paid. The asset value, originally 50p in 1988, increases at 7.3 per cent a year to reach 100p at wind-up date. As of May 26, the asset value per income share was 72.6p. As the graph shows, however, General Consolidated has cut the dividend on the income shares. Simonian explains: 'The problem with GCIT is that when we split the trust, we didn't have to dramatically re-organise the portfolio. We already had a high yield.' 'Where we went wrong is that we should have built in a fixed-interest and convertible preference element to boost our income. Instead, we relied on our liquidity, which was reasonably high at 7 to 10 per cent. That was fine when we could earn 15 per cent on cash but, when interest rates fell, we were faced with having to reduce the dividend.' General Consolidated already had reduced the dividend on the income shares by 10 per cent and plans another 10 per cent cut to 8.45p per income share this year. 'It would be quite easy to paper over the cracks,' says Simonian, 'but it would have left the underlying problem. 'To maintain the dividend would have required a portfolio yield of 7 per cent, which would have left little prospect for growth for the capital shareholders. Instead, the portfolio yield has been cut to 5.5 per cent, with around 10-12 per cent of the fund now in convertible preference shares.' Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, welcomes the move by General Consolidated. 'They are one of the few managers to have taken into account that they're running a trust for more than one class of shareholder. The decision to cut the portfolio yield was a bold and fair statement.' He puts the income shares, at 108p, on a gross redemption yield of 10.23 per cent, assuming 2.5 per cent growth in dividends. The capital shares receive no income but all the assets of the trust after the other classes of share have been repaid. As with other capital shares, there are two asset values which can be quoted, and investors should be aware that there is an important difference. If one takes the other classes of share at their present repayment values, the assets per capital share are 222p; accordingly, the capital shares (127.5p on May 26) were at an apparent discount of 43 per cent (this figure appears in the investment trust section of the FT). But investors should not assume the capital shares are a bargain. The asset values of the stepped preference and the income shares are increasing steadily year-by-year; the capital shares have to run fast just to keep up. If you allow for the final repayment values of the other shares, the nav of the capital shares on May 26 was just 79.8p. On that measure, the capital shares are on a 60 per cent premium to asset value. According to Moorgate, the capital shares require asset growth of 2.4 per cent a year to repay the capital shares at the present price, and growth of 5.5 per cent a year to repay them at the higher nav of 222p. But Aaron says the capital shares are attractive, given that a 7.5 per cent rise in the trust's assets would offer investors a 21.5 per cent return. Around 50 per cent of General Consolidated's portfolio is in smaller companies, an 'overweight' position in the sector. This has not helped in the past few years, but it could be a benefit now that the UK economy finally appears to be recovering. Simonian says yield is one of the most important criteria in stock selection. 'We are looking for stocks with above average yields and above average growth prospects,' he adds. The 10 largest investments in the portfolio include a mixture of smaller and larger stocks. They are: Moorgate Investment Trust, GEC, Thorn EMI, Whessoe, Hanson, Shell, Commercial Union, Prudential, Marks &amp; Spencer and API Group. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, says General Consolidated is at the 'quality end of the split capital sector. We don't think it's particularly badly structured and we quite like the management.' Key facts The trust had gross assets of Pounds 106.3m as of May 26, when the overall package of shares stood at a slight discount to asset value. The manager's fee is 0.44 per cent of gross assets less current liabilities per annum, with a minimum of Pounds 375,000. The trust is due to be wound up at the end of 1997. Board Sir Mark Thomson, the chairman of General Consolidated, is chairman of Moorgate Investment Management as well. Other directors are: David Brazier, a partner of stockbroker Cazenove; Nicolas McAndrew, chairman and managing director of Murray Johnstone; Donald McFarlane, non-executive chairman of Senior Engineering; Simonian; and Richard Westmacott, former chairman of Hoare Govett Securities. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum monthly scheme is Pounds 25, or a lump sum of Pounds 250. There are no charges apart from government stamp duty. The minimum investment into the personal equity plan is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 100 a month. There is an initial charge on the Pep of 2 per cent plus VAT, and an annual charge of 1 per cent plus VAT. Investors are allowed two free withdrawals a year, provided they keep the minimum balance of Pounds 1,000. If they want to sell their holding completely, they must pay the appropriate proportion of that year's annual fee.</p>

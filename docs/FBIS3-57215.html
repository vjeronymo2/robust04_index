His interview is published  in today's issue of the daily.    "The Ukrainian leader," the newspaper says, quoting his  pronouncements, "has stressed that his republic should rely  primarily on relations with the states of the former Soviet  Union and the East European nations in order to improve the  economic situation in the country.    "To make the CIS economic union function effectively,"  Landyk  believes, "it is necessary, first and foremost, to create a  system for mutual settlements, based on a specialised  inter-state bank."</p>

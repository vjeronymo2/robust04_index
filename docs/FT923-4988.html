			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Sterling's stability boosts UK bond prices UK government bond prices gained up to a point yesterday helped by the relative stability of sterling in the foreign exchange markets. In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 100 19/32 at the opening to 101 7/16 to yield 9.51 per cent. Dealers said volumes in the futures market were back to normal levels after the Bank Holiday weekend, with around 25,000 contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 94.27 and climbed to 95.17 by late afternoon. 'The pound's steadiness against the D-Mark has helped the market,' said one dealer. The pound ended at DM2.7875, up half a pfennig on the day. RUMOURS that the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty might be postponed helped to boost the French government bond market. The rumours followed a newspaper report that the constitutional court might rule that Parliament's revision to the constitution in June, as part of the Maastricht ratification process, was illegal. However, by late afternoon it emerged that France's constitutional council had rejected an appeal by conservative opponents of the Maastricht treaty, clearing the way for the planned September 20 referendum to go ahead. French government bonds had rallied earlier in the day on the grounds that a postponement of the referendum would allow more time for the government to whip up support for ratification of the treaty. Two polls released yesterday showed a slight increase in support for the treaty with yes votes slightly outnumbering no votes. An IPSOS poll showed 53 per cent in favour of Maastricht, the clearest swing in favour of European union in recent opinion polls, while a BVA survey showed 51 per cent inclined to vote yes at the referendum. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 opened at 9.20 per cent and fell to 9.12 per cent by late afternoon. Elsewhere in Europe, the German government bond market ended slightly weaker or unchanged. Traders noted quite heavy selling of bunds but said the market held up well, with shorter-dated issues boosted by comments from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank Council member, who said the German economy was showing signs of diminished economic activity. The Liffe bund futures contract reached a high of 88.00 but ended at 87.97, against its opening of 87.96. US TREASURY prices firmed slightly in thin trading yesterday as many investors and dealers chose to stay on the sidelines while awaiting tomorrow's important jobs data. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/32 at 98 19/32 , yielding 7.361 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.085 per cent. The day's main economic news was a 1.1 per cent decline in July factory orders. The market did not react to the numbers, which were heavily distorted by a fall in transportation orders. Excluding transportation, factory orders actually rose by 0.9 per cent in July. Attention remained focused on the August employment report, which will be released tomorrow. The consensus among analysts is that the figures will show that the labour market remains in a poor state, and there was some renewed speculation yesterday that the Fed could cut interest rates again if the jobs numbers are very bad - even with a weak dollar. JAPANESE government bonds ended the day mixed with long-dated issues closing firmer while medium-dated bonds slipped. The rise in rates on three-month certificates of deposit - from 3.82 per cent to as high as 3.91 per cent - in the Tokyo trading session pulled bond prices down, dealers said. However, traders reported good demand for 10-year bonds later in the day, and the new benchmark - the No 145 - closed higher, with the yield moving from 5.04 per cent at the opening to 4.975 per cent at the end of trading. The constituents of the Government Secs. Index quoted in the Financial Times changed with effect from September 1. Now included are the Treasury 9 3/4 per cent due 2002, the Treasury 9 per cent due 2008, and the Treasury 8 3/4 per cent due 1997. No longer included are: Exchequer 13 1/2 per cent due 1992, Treasury 10 per cent due 1993, and Funding 6 per cent due 1993.</p>

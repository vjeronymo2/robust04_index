			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: France On one score, at least, the French government must be feeling rather smug. Over recent months, the Bank of France has gradually eased interest rates without unduly damaging the franc. Indeed, such has been the currency's strength that the vast hole in France's foreign currency reserves has now been plugged. The franc has returned to within a centime of its old ERM floor. The franc's vigour will comfort those who regard European monetary union as an overriding political goal. Yet the government seems unlikely to use the opportunity to accelerate interest rate cuts, despite the precarious economy. Consumption has been on an erratic upward path suggesting recession is slackening. But unemployment has now surpassed 12 per cent, threatening to undermine recovery next year. Those economic worries have unsettled the French bourse: the CAC-40 is now 2 per cent off its October peak. But other factors, too, have sapped the market's strength. The bourse has been flooded with new equity issues this autumn. Quite apart from the big privatisations, several companies have tapped the market for fresh funds. In all, some FFr100bn of new equity has been raised this year. The bourse will remain volatile until rates do come down and recovery asserts itself. But the liquidity argument underpinning the market still holds good longer term. French savings ratios remain high and some of the FFr1,200bn held in money market funds must seep into equities. The proposed creation of private pension funds can only help.</p>

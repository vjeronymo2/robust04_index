			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> SelecTV Off the Air: SelecTV subscribers who switched on Channel 22 in Los  Angeles looked at a snowy television screen instead of a scheduled movie Monday  evening because of the financial woes of SelecTV of California Inc., which last  week filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and failed to pay KWHY for Monday's  air time. KWHY President Burt I. Harris Jr. said he would consider putting the  service back on the air if a payment is made today. SelecTV President Thomas C.  Hunt said: "I'm quite sure we'll get it resolved . . . . It's our intention to  get service resumed."  </P></p>

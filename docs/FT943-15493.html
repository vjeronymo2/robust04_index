			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close firmly but volume still subdued - Market Report The UK stock market closed very firmly yesterday in spite of the general uncertainty ahead of the meeting of the G7 countries which opens this morning in Naples. Although encouraged by both the US Federal Open Market Committee and the Bundesbank making no move on their respective key interest rates, markets were worried that the G7 meeting might not bring sufficiently decisive action on the dollar. The FT-SE 100 Index gained 17.7 on the day to close at 2,964.4. Shares opened easier but quickly rose to the day's peak of 2,968 on the Footsie after bond markets jumped on reports that a leading German banker had suggested that the Bundesbank might cut rates. The market cooled off when the German central bank said, following its regular policy meeting, that it was not moving its key rates. While some traders warned that the Federal Reserve could still act on the payroll and unemployment numbers due today, most believed that markets will now be on hold until next week, when a statement from the G7 meeting is likely. The underlying concern in the stock market is that, should the US dollar come under renewed pressure, the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates sharply and unilaterally. This would be likely to react sharply on thre UK market where fears of higher rates before the end of the year continue to hover in the background. Early trading was enlivened by the sale of a 2.5 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland as, in a deal worth around Pounds 80m, one fund unloaded its shares. This transaction helped boost the day's Seaq volume total to 567.2m from the 506.2m the previous session. But retail business on Wednesday was worth only Pounds 989.7m, confirming the fallin equity business ahead of the G7 talks. Retail business has this week dropped below the Pounds 1bn daily figure which had been established as an average total. Non Footsie business made up 53 per cent of yesterday's total, well below the usual proportion. At 3,454.7, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 16.5 points. Hopes that interest rates will continue to fall slowly in Germany benefited shares in those building and construction shares with activities in continental Europe. UK retail stocks also showed optimism towards interest rate prospects, moving higher in fairly moderate turnover. The international blue chips edged higher, brushing off the continued weakness in the US dollar in which their profits are earned. Equity strategists remained fairly optimistic towards market prospects for the third quarter but agreed that, with the bond market still clearly dominating sentiment, there can be little real progress until the G7 meeting has been completed and some solution found to the weakness of the US dollar. BZW, which has cut its year-end target for the FT-SE 100 Share Index to 3,400 from its previous 3,600 target, warns against being 'too dependent on the gilt-edged market.' The investment bank stands by its forecast of dividend growth of 10 per cent in the stock market this year, with similar growth likely in 1995. Kleinwort Benson Securities, which aims for a Footsie at 3,500 at the end of the year, and believes that yield strength will be a significant driving force behind the London market. Inflation and interest rate gloom, it comments, 'appears overstated.'</p>

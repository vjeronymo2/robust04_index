			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sasol lifts earnings by 14% to R533.4m SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals producer, overcame depressed market conditions to lift earnings 14.7 per cent to R533.4m (Dollars 186.4m) in the six months to the end of December. Turnover dropped slightly, to R3.96bn from R4bn, as a result of generally lower prices. Operating income was 11 per cent down, at R868.8m, reflecting depressed margins, but this was more than compensated for by lower interest and a lower effective tax rate. Attributable earnings rose by 14.7 per cent to R533.4m. Mr Paul Kruger, managing director, said the synthetic fuel division had managed to offset cost increases, lower product prices and lower refining margins by substantially increasing production volumes. The division will account for about 40 per cent of operating profit in the current year. Mr Kruger said the production increase resulted from better operating efficiencies. The impact of the lower international petroleum product prices was softened by a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate. The dividend was lifted to 36.5 cents a share from 32.5 cents.</p>

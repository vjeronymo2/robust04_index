"Reactivating the atomic electric power station in Armenia  is  dangerous for Azerbaijan especially since a war is being waged  between the two countries. There is no doubt that Armenia will  use the nuclear materials for military purposes which violates  international norms. It is also dangerous for ecology", says  the document.    The statement further reads that in this context, the Azeri  government calls upon the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) to consider the power plant's reactivation; ecological,  military and political consequences of this step should be  thoroughly examined and Armenia must observe its obligations of  the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

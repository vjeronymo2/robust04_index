			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Letter: New light on Warsaw's confused property market Sir, As a senior property partner in a firm of English solicitors with a large office in Warsaw, I write in reply to Andrew Taylor's article about the property market in Warsaw ('Paris prices, Albanian standards', March 6). His statement that 'families have the right to reclaim land and buildings acquired by the former Communist regime' is misleading. There is, under Polish law, no legal right to restitution yet. A draft bill was submitted to the Sejm last July, but was one victim of the change of government. The scheme in the draft bill was a pragmatic one, allotting all claimants compensation on a 'points' basis, to be funded by part of the proceeds of privatisation so that a claim would acquire a notional monetary value, which would have been determined by the state itself. The claim would be satisfied in bonds, which could be used to buy shares in privatised companies being brought to the stock market or individual properties or businesses being sold by the state. Claimants would only in limited circumstances be able to insist on buying back their own family property; there would have been many exceptions, for example on the grounds that it was not possible to do so 'without deterioration to the continued activity of the owning enterprise'. It remains to be seen what legislation is passed, but the draft is the best indication we have had so far. Only in a limited number of cases has there been restitution, either on a purely voluntary, often gratuitous basis, and sometimes (as in the case of Wisnicz castle, regained by the Lubomirski family) where there were serious procedural irregularities in the original nationalisation.

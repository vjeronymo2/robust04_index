			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Wal-Mart rises against trend WAL-MART, the fast-growing Arkansas-based discount chain, yesterday posted a 22.7 per cent increase in earnings per share in the first quarter of 1991. The result was in contrast to the continuing gloom in much of the US retail sector. The company said sales in the three months to the end of April jumped from Dollars 6.77m to Dollars 9.28m, a rise of 37 per cent. This, however, partly reflected acquisitions - in particular, the recent purchase of McLane, a Texas-based concern, which accounted for Dollars 543.7m-worth of sales in the period. Without McLane, Wal-Mart said the sales advance would have stood at 29 per cent. It described the underlying like-for-like sales growth as 'good'. In profit terms, Wal-Mart reported an improvement from Dollars 253m in the first quarter of 1990, to Dollars 307m this time. This came despite an increase in interest charges from Dollars 36.9m to Dollars 54.8m. Earnings per share rose from 22 to 27 cents. Mr David Glass, chief executive, said integration of the McLane business and the Wholesale Club chain, both recent purchases, were going well. Wal-Mart, which started as one general store in Arkansas 30 years ago, has grown to be one of the largest retailers in the US. It comprises 1,591 Wal-Mart stores, 178 Sam's Clubs - which target the bottom end of the discount market - and four Hypermart units. Many of the US retail chains reported April sales figures yesterday, showing year-on-year revenues increasing by significantly less than inflation. The poor results, however, were partly due to the change in Easter dates. In 1990, Easter fell in April, whereas this relatively active shopping period came in March this year. Woolworth, for example, reported an 8 per cent sales decline for the four weeks to May 4 this year, compared with the same period a year earlier. However, the retailer said that for March and April overall, sales were modestly higher - 0.5 per cent - than in 1991. At Sears, April sales were up by 0.5 per cent on the previous year, but like-for-like sales slipped by around 0.5 per cent. J. C. Penney reported a 3.9 per cent gain, or 2.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis. At K-mart, the figure rose by 4.6 per cent.</p>

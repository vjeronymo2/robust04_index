			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Compensation for members The compensation that the Gooda Walker Action Group eventually succeeds in obtaining will be pooled and divided according to the losses incurred by individual members. Some Gooda Walker Names have lost up to Pounds 1m, so they could, in theory, receive as much as Pounds 800,000 - although that assumes that the group defies expectations and secures at least the Pounds 500m it reckons it is owed, about 80 per cent of its initial claim of Pounds 629m. Mr Michael Deeny, action group chairman, said the group rejected the idea that payments to individual members should vary according to which syndicates their money was invested in - some of which have better errors and omissions insurance cover out of which damages will be paid. The losers are likely to be the estimated 900 Gooda Walker Names who did not join the action group's legal challenge and will not be entitled to the compensation awarded by the High Court.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STILL-SOGGY S.D. TO TAKE MORE COLD SHOWERS  </P> <P> With barely a break from the wet and wild weekend storm that dumped more than  an inch of rain and caused some minor power outages, a new storm expected to  arrive this afternoon could bring even more rain, cold and a host of  weather-related problems.  </P> <P> Lindbergh Field got 1.09 inches of rain over the weekend, raising the season  total to 3.32 inches. Sporadic showers are expected to continue through  Thursday and drop as much as three-quarters of an inch of rain, forecasters  said.  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric reported a handful of rain-related power outages  affecting a few thousand customers over the weekend, a spokesman said. On  Monday, repair crews worked to restore power to about 200 people in Lakeside.  </P> <P> The incoming storm from the Gulf of Alaska is "very, very cold," said Wilbur  Shigehara, a National Weather Service forecaster. Snow is expected as low as  the 1,500-foot level, and icy conditions may prompt a traveler's advisory for  the mountains and a frost advisory for the agricultural areas.  </P> <P> "The cold from this storm is concerning me the most," Shigehara said. "As early  as Thursday night, some temperatures will drop into the mid- and upper 20s, and  that will require growers to provide some type of frost protection for their  crops."  </P> <P> The cold also may prompt the county to open its shelters for the homeless, he  added.  </P> <P> Shigehara said that, although the county needs more rain, the weekend moisture  has already saturated the ground, and a deluge could cause street flooding and  mudslides.  </P> <P> At the beaches, daytime highs will be in the mid-60s. Surf is at 3 to 6 feet,  and the ocean temperature is 58 degrees.  </P> <P> Coastal and inland daytime temperatures will struggle to hit 60 degrees this  week, Shigehara said. Overnight lows along the coast will be in the mid-40s,  and inland lows will dip into the low 30s.  </P> <P> Mountain highs today through Thursday will hover in the mid-30s, Shigehara  said. Overnight lows will be in the low 20s and may drop into the high teens by  Friday night, he said.  </P> <P> Highs in the desert will range in the mid-60s, and lows will be in the 40s,  Shigehara said.  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Janet Reger Janet Reger, the woman who made lingerie and luxury synonymous, is well-prepared for working from a desert island. Having once taken a three-week trip to Venezuela, she ended up staying three months, steering her company via a fax. So, with that same fax and a telephone, what else would be vital for the Reger island office? 'I'd need a subscription to Women's Wear Daily. It's a trade paper printed in the US but which covers the world. I didn't have it in Venezeula but would need it for an extended period away from London.' And for recreational reading? 'The Bible and I'd actually read it from beginning to end which is something I've always wanted to do. There are so many stories it would keep me interested, give me food for thought and maybe even some spiritual comfort if I really got lonely.' A companion would combat loneliness. Who would it be? 'I'd like him to be good looking and a good conversationalist. It would have to be a him really. It would be difficult for two women to be on an island together. I'd also want someone who was useful, someone who could do all the jobs on the island.' One item to preserve sanity is allowed. 'A Sonic the Hedgehog game. It would keep me amused during those long tropical rainstorms when I was hut-bound. I find it absolutely compulsive to play.' What would you eat? 'Haagan Dazs ice cream - chocolate or coffee flavour, or preferably both.' And drink? 'Coffee. I really love coffee. It wouldn't bother me if I didn't have alcohol at all but I would miss coffee dreadfully.' What film would you take? 'I'm a regular cinema-goer but I can't think of a film that I could see over and over again. Maybe the film of my daughter's wedding would be good because it would remind me of all my family and friends back home.' In the office you can have one object to remind you of your early days in business. 'A coffee pot I bought in a market in Nazareth when I was there very early in my marriage. It was the only thing we quarrelled about in our various comings and goings. I left him several times and kept going back only to leave him again.' What would you most like about desert island life? 'Seeing everything from one step away. When I was in Venezuela I was better at making decisions. I was clearer and calmer. Here I get into a flap when people come to me with a problem because they come to me in a state of agitation.' You can impose one condition to compensate for your exile. 'I would need an increase in my business so I could stay away and we could have someone to replace me in the London office.' Desert island attire is pretty basic but you can take one luxury item to wear. 'Make-up, especially a bit of mascara. Once you have a suntan, you don't need much else.'</p>

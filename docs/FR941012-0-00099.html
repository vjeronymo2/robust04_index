			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule also requires that the employer, in determining the appropriate number and contents of first-aid kits, to consider the degree of isolation of the work site, the number of employees at the work site and the hazards reasonably anticipated at that work site. The further a crew is from a central landing, the more crucial a first-aid kit is for that remote crew. For example, large and well-supplied first-aid kits are needed where crews are so remotely located that rescue units (either vehicles or helicopters) cannot get to the injured person or not get there quickly. When crews are very small and located close to central landings smaller kits may be adequate, when supplemented by kits at central landing areas that contain a more comprehensive supply of first-aid materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii) and (iv) all deal with the adequacy of the contents of first-aid kits. At paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA has specified that each first-aid kit must meet certain minimum content requirements. Those minimum content requirements are delineated in mandatory Appendix A. OSHA received comments urging OSHA to specify the contents needed for an ``adequately supplied'' first-aid kit (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;50, 30). These commenters also pointed out that several State logging standards specify minimum first-aid content requirements (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). In addition, one commenter also provided a list of minimum contents needed for logging first-aid kits. Based on these comments and OSHA's expert judgment, the items listed in Appendix A are the type necessary for dealing with injured persons in remote areas of varying climatic conditions. OSHA points out that the specified contents are minimally adequate for a small logging crew of two to three employees. Where crews are larger, additional kits or kits with more supplies may be needed. In formulating this final rule, OSHA included Appendix A (First-aid supplies) and Appendix B (First-aid training) to provide the employer with a definitive means of determining the adequacy of the first-aid kits and the training that employees must receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has deleted from the final paragraph the proposed requirement that first-aid kits include snake bite kits. OSHA received several comments about this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;67). One commenter said this requirement should be deleted since there were no poisonous snakes in his area (Ex. 5&hyph;7). Other commenters said that some snake bite kits were not effective in treating bites or that they are outmoded and can do more damage than good (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;67). For example, NIOSH said that it is possible more serious injury will occur to a person by improper use of a snake bite kit (Ex. 5&hyph;42). According to the Regional Snake Bite Control Center at the University Medical Center in Cincinnati, OH, snake bite kits should not be used when medical treatment is available within one hour of the bite (Ex. 5&hyph;42). OSHA has determined that, given the regional differences in the logging industry, employers should be allowed to work with their health care provider to determine whether a snake bite kit is necessary and what kind of kit would be of most assistance for loggers working in that area. One of the factors the health care provider should consider is how far particular loggers are from medical facilities and trained medical personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

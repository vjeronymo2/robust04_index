In all, 3,700 workers will be laid off, the  company said. Chrysler will move assembly of the Dodge Daytona and Chrysler  LeBaron coupe and convertible to plants in Sterling Heights, Mich., and Newark,  Del., from St. Louis, boosting the employment at those two plants by a few  hundred workers each, a spokesman said.  </P></p>

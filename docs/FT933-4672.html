			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Growers attack forestry sell-off THE GOVERNMENT has been urged not to privatise the Forestry Commission's woodlands by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain, whose members are mainly private-sector timber growers and processors. The committee says it is the wrong time to privatise Forest Enterprise, the Forestry Commission division which owns and manages 2m acres of woodland. The committee says market conditions for a sale are poor, Forest Enterprise has only recently been created and privatisation would divert investment from planting. An inter-ministerial committee is reviewing the system of incentives for tree planting and the ownership of the Forestry Commission's woodlands, with privatisation an option. Environmental organisations and the Ramblers Association are against privatisation, and opposition has also come from Timber Growers UK, whose members are private forestry owners. and who might be expected to buy some of the woodlands if they came on the market. The committee adds that Forest Enterprise should be separated from the Forestry Commission and be given agency status, which would allow it to adopt a 'conventional commercial approach, free of the distortions followed by a government department.'</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: David Smith makes Pounds 15.5m acquisition David S Smith, the packaging, paper and office products group, is buying Ashton Corrugated from Otor, the private French packaging group, for Pounds 15.5m cash. At completion Ashton's book assets were valued at some Pounds 21m including about Pounds 4m of working capital. In the year to December 31 the company incurred an unspecified loss on turnover of Pounds 31.7m. Mr Peter Williams, Smith's chief executive, said the deal would initially be marginally earnings dilutive but 'we expect a useful future profit contribution.' Ashton specialises in die cutting and pre-printed corrugated board, mainly for the food processing industry, from locations in Bristol, Strathclyde and Derbyshire. The shares rose 2p to 475p.</p>

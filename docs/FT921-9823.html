			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Justinian: Press intrusions and freedoms THE POTHER over the public revelations of the sexual peccadillo of Mr Paddy Ashdown, MP, and his former secretary should help to create a better balance between press freedom and editorial responsibility. The incident brings the day nearer when parliament will legislate to give the individual citizen a right of action for unwarranted invasion of privacy, fitting appropriately alongside a reformed law of libel to protect the individual's reputation and self-esteem. The second impact of the Ashdown affair should be to alert not just parliamentarians but, more importantly, the legal profession to the dangers to press freedom if lawyers indulge indiscriminately in the use of the injunction prior to publication. Support for a law to protect private lives can and should involve no interference with the editor's right to determine what goes in, and what does not appear, in his or her newspaper or periodical. No one suggests that freedom of expression is absolute. Nor does anyone suggest that the publication may wilfully, or even unwittingly, damage a person's reputation. Every editor has to assess a story with the risk of libel in mind. The libel law provides a remedy by way of pecuniary compensation - sometimes, no doubt, juries over-compensate - to those who establish a falsehood that lowers them in the esteem of their friends and neighbours. If the libel law currently bears down too heavily on newspapers, it is often the application of the law in the particular case that errs. Yet if the law itself is defective - and there is a case for so thinking - then it should be put on the reformer's shopping list for early legislation. There is a strong case for reviewing the law of libel, together with the ingredients of a proposed privacy law. A call for Calcutt Mark II would be a wise step for the government to take. After all, the Calcutt committee on privacy did not say (as some commentators think it did) that it was impossible to define a law of privacy. It merely rejected the idea for practical reasons, to do with providing a harvest for litigious-minded clients and their lawyers. Instead Calcutt proposed three new criminal offences on journalistic trespass - a most undesirable proposal that would bring the courts and the media into unenviable confrontation. So far the government has not declared itself in favour of such a proposal. A privacy law is a necessary component of organised society, to mark the right to respect for the citizen's private and family life, home and correspondence. For the public figure's lover, there can rarely be a public interest in publication, overriding his or her privacy. For the public figure, there may be cases where the private matter is relevant to his or her public life. The Press Council in its declaration of principle on privacy in 1976 said that entry into public life did not disqualify an individual from a right to protection of private affairs, 'save when the circumstances relating to the private life of an individual occupying a public position may be likely to affect his performance of his duties or public confidence in him or his office'. Such a situation could be judged only in the particular case, and is not susceptible to statutory definition. The courts have already pleaded for the ability to give a remedy to those whom the media have declined to leave alone. In the Gordon Kaye case two years ago, when journalists intruded into the actor's hospital room where he was recovering from serious head injuries, all three judges of the Court of Appeal urged the reform which the Calcutt committee thought subsequently was inappropriate. What is forgotten in that case was the judges' affirmation of a long-established rule of practice in the law of defamation: that the court will rarely grant an anticipatory injunction. To stop a prospective libel would be to interfere with the freedom of speech. The same principle should apply to any new law of privacy. The fact that judges have departed in recent years from that almost invariable rule of practice emphasises how much they desired to extend some help to those threatened with breaches of confidentiality, which has become part of the judicial development that covers some cases of privacy, as in the case of Mr Ashdown. It was the solicitors' mistake of obtaining the all-pervasive injunction against the News of the World that gave the media its only retort to the charge that journalists had been engaging in unsavoury prurience in chasing a supposed sex scandal. By resorting to the courts, the lawyers immediately converted a private matter into a question of public interest. To gag the press by not allowing it even to mention that an injunction had been sought and obtained was calculated to arouse cries of prior restraint and interference with the public's right to know - that the legal system was being used to silence the press. The door-stepping that preceded the lawyers' unthinking rush to judgment reveals another aspect of the invasion of privacy: the pre-publicity harassment and intrusion on private property by journalists. If the press wishes to assure politicians that under the new Press Complaints Commission it is behaving better, it could repair its public image that nothing has changed. The newspaper industry should set up an independent inquiry to examine the media activity over the last fortnight in relation to Mr Ashdown and his secretary. We may then know how well or badly journalists and their editors behaved, and whether they are serious in supporting the Press Complaints Commission and the industry's code of practice, which states that intrusions and inquiries into private lives 'are not generally acceptable'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tatyana Pozhidayeva] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 5 Dec -- The number of Tuberculosis  [TB] cases in the central city of Maritime Kray is growing at a  threatening pace. Compared with last year, the number of  victims of this dangerous disease has increased by more than 40  percent.    If in the past TB was thought to be a disease of the poor,  now the TB lists have representatives of all sections of  society. The city's medical workers have been particularly  alarmed by a high number of cases at Vladivostok's higher  educational establishments. According to the medical workers at  the city TB clinic, alongside students' traditional untidiness  and their unwillingness to undergo regular checks, low living  standards and overcrowding in hostels are aggravating the  situation.    Foreigners who have literally flooded Vladivostok have  become  a special risk group. Thousands of citizens of Korea, Vietnam,  and especially China who arrive here for seasonal work do not  have preliminary medical checks. And the city's markets,  overcrowded by them, have turned into places of scandalous  anti-sanitation.</p>

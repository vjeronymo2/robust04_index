			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "To Stop the Mice Getting Out </F> of Hand a Cat Has Been Brought Into the House -- But It Is Tied  Up by the Tail"]    [Text] Until recently our bankers had been completely  protected from foreign competition. But the Russian Federation  presidential edict that is under preparation on the admission of  foreign financiers and the regulation of this process will bring  this protectionism to an end.    There have long been arguments over this. V. Gerashchenko,  head of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, has  particularly campaigned for foreigners to be admitted. His  arguments are that without strong competitors our commercial  banks have monopolized the financial services market and are  making no effort to lower their lending rates or commissions,  while not improving their quality or the skills of their staff.  Earning inflated monopoly profits, they are paying themselves  fantastic salaries, living it up, and spending crazy amounts of  money on politics and the mass media rather than on the economy.  This is why the Central Bank recently proposed admitting a  limited number of foreign banks with weighty reputations. But  their capital will be limited to one-tenth of the capital of our  banks. Figuratively speaking, we will be letting a cat into the  house to educate the mice, but we will be tying it up by the  tail as a precaution.    Naturally, this move has been opposed by Russian bankers  themselves, who are scared of losing their best clients. They  have been supported by former Finance Minister B. Fedorov. He  admitted that, of the 2,000 commercial banks in this country (as  of December 1993), only one-tenth have financially trained  staff. And he noted that foreigners can afford to work at cost  in order to gain market share and grab the market for deposits  -- since people will trust the foreign banks' reliability more  than our own financiers' persistent advertising. It is no  accident, they claim, that countries like Finland and Japan had  until recently not allowed foreign rival bankers access to their  market.    The question of "whether to let them in or not" has recently  become a political one. In late 1992/early 1993 the Supreme  Soviet came to the defense of the Russian banks' monopoly by  attempting to bring in a three-year moratorium on the admission  of foreigners. At the time Gerashchenko had protection from  Yeltsin, who blocked the law. But when the country had been  shaken by the October events and elections to a new parliament  were at issue, the executive required support from a reliable  lobby. The words of one banker were passed from person to  person -- if you don't protect us we will not support the  "Russia's Choice" campaign.    The Central Bank then had to act in the way that the  national  banks of Finland and Japan once acted -- replacing foreign  competitors with its own tough demands and forcing our  commercial banks to increase their incorporation capital (in  order to improve their reliability), to observe the norms for  deductions to reserve funds, to submit accounts on time, and so  forth. Particularly as of the start of this year.    But Russia is not Finland. Our business is far too  criminalized. Commercial bankers have either been forced to  undertake risky operations, getting rid of anyone who disagreed,  or staffers of Central Bank of the Russian Federation control  services have begun to be threatened with reprisals. One  department chief was attacked and had his dacha torched.  Weapons then had to be requested for banking inspectorate  officials. Then instances of their meeting with opposition and  having their investigations sabotaged came to light. And,  finally, one last example -- a bomb was thrown at the apartment  of Ye. Zhabotinskaya, chief of the Central Bank's Novosibirsk  Administration.    Under these circumstances the authorities have decided to  abandon banking protectionism. I believe this is the only  sensible step under current conditions.</p>

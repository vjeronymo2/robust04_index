Xu Dezhi, director of the Provincial Commission of Foreign  Economic Cooperation and Trade, said that the office, the  Guangdong Provincial Foreign Investment Bureau, is due to open  on New Year's Day.    The bureau will draw up Guangdong's annual and long-term  plans for the introduction of foreign funds and will propose  industries in which foreign companies will be encouraged to  invest, as well as relevant policies, Xu told a news conference.    It will also regularly announce projects for foreign  investors to choose from, he added.    "Our new bureau will help local companies hold trade fairs  and other economic activities in other parts of the world, and  will publicize Guangdong's investment environment and policies,"  he said.    Moreover, the bureau will work together with other  provincial  departments to decide on how to use foreign funds to retool  existing companies and develop new and high technology, he said.    Xu Dezhi said that Lu Ruihua, executive vice-provincial  governor, would be the chairman of the new bureau and be the  vice-chairman.    Provincial government statistics showed that during the  January-November period of 1993, Guangdong Province signed  17,115 cooperation contracts with foreign companies, involving  31.5 billion U.S. dollars in total overseas investment.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Retailers leading Europe in profits THE UK's biggest retailers continue to be the most profitable of their kind in Europe in spite of the recession. According to an analysis by Management Horizons consultants, the six most profitable retailers in Europe last year were UK companies. Their profitability, the report says, stemmed from big investments in own-brand development; superstore construction; information technology and distribution systems. J. Sainsbury topped the profit list, notching up Pounds 628m last year. It was followed by Marks and Spencer; Tesco; Great Universal Stores; Boots; and Argyll Group, owner of the Safeway chain. UK companies accounted for 24 of the 50 most profitable European retailers. Management Horizons cautioned that direct profit comparisons across Europe were fraught with difficulties because of differences in national accounting policies. Some of Europe's biggest retailers - such as the privately owned Tengelmann and Aldi groups of Germany - were also excluded because they do not publish their level of profitability. Nevertheless, Management Horizons said the study highlighted the efficiency of UK operators and the differences in retail markets across Europe. UK retailers had benefited from operating in a market in which shopping environment and product range counted for more than just low prices, it said. The concentration of retailing power was higher in the UK than in many other markets, affording the leading companies greater economies of scale, it added. 'The 1990s will be characterised by an increasing amount of cross-border activity, with the advent of 1993 and the opening up of eastern Europe set to accelerate the process of pan-European co-operation, expansion and integration.'

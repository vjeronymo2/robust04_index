			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SMALL ROLE PLAYS SIZABLE PART IN NOTRE DAME WIN  </P> <P> Just when it appeared that Notre Dame High's playoff game at San Marino would  be no Small affair, Knight tailback Errol Small made a cameo appearance and  helped lead his team to victory.  </P> <P> Small, who sprained his right ankle in last week's win over Righetti, showed up  just in time to help Notre Dame kill the clock and preserve a 17-7 victory over  San Marino on Friday night in a Southern Section Division VII second-round  playoff game.  </P> <P> Notre Dame will meet Serra, a 32-25 winner over Arroyo Grande, next Saturday in  a semifinal game.  </P> <P> "It was great to contribute," said Small, who didn't carry the ball until the  final period but finished with 35 yards in eight carries when the Knights  needed him the most. "If my ankle was broken, I still would've been in there.  It's money time."  </P> <P> And Small cashed in.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (11-1) was nursing its tenuous lead and had not made a first down  the entire second half when Small, who played at his usual defensive back  position, made his first appearance on offense.  </P> <P> He got the Knights their initial second-half first down on an eight-yard run,  then rambled five yards two plays later for another first down.  </P> <P> Small's carries helped eat up some valuable time, and Notre Dame needed all of  it.  </P> <P> A pair of fourth-quarter interceptions by John Sandoval didn't hurt either.  </P> <P> The Knights were sitting on a comfortable 17-0 lead at intermission but were  slapped awake on the opening kickoff of the third quarter when San Marino's  Craig Mohaghegh recovered an onside kick at the Notre Dame 36.  </P> <P> On the next play, Alfonso Montoya slipped Tim Elliott's tackle and bolted 36  yards to a touchdown. Craig Chamberlain added the kick, and, suddenly, the  Knights' lead was trimmed to 17-7.  </P> <P> Notre Dame's offense went stale, and didn't convert a first down until Small's  run midway through the final period.  </P> <P> The Knight defense, however, did the job, intercepting three passes in all and  holding defending division champion San Marino (8-3) to 48 yards rushing and  163 yards overall. The Titans made only eight first downs -- just two in the  first half.  </P> <P> The Knight defense, which had held eight previous opponents to a touchdown or  less, was at it again, limiting San Marino to 24 yards passing and 16 yards  rushing in the first two periods.  </P> <P> Although Small did not carry the ball in the first half, the Notre Dame offense  did not miss him.  </P> <P> The Knights broke through on their second possession, marching 54 yards in  seven plays for a touchdown. Quarterback Greg Andrachick sneaked over from the  one for the score, and Chris Afarian added the extra point to give Notre Dame a  7-0 lead with 26 seconds left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The Knights added another touchdown in the second quarter when Stefano  Malieitulua scored on a two-yard touchdown run to cap a short 41-yard drive.  Afarian added the kick for a 14-0 lead with 5:13 left in the first half.  </P> <P> Afarian booted a 22-yard field goal to give the Knights a 17-0 lead with 1:47  remaining before half.  </P></p>

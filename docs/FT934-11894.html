			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Chile prices rise sharply CHILE is unlikely to meet its 1993 inflation rate target of 12 per cent after indications of a sharp rise in prices in October. The central bank predicts a monthly rise of around 2.5 per cent, bringing the accumulated rate for the first 10 months of the year to 11 per cent. Mr Jose Pablo Arellano, budget director, attributed October's rise to the seasonal bias of the consumer price index, especially in its measurement of food prices. Control of inflation has been a key plank of Chile's macro-economic policy.</p>

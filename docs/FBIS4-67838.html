			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``rmc''-signed report: ``BDI For Relaxing Arms Exports''] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The Federation of German Industries (BDI)  has demanded a relaxation of the strict German arms export  regulations. The demand was precipitated by the government's new  white book on security policy and Bundeswehr matters that  declares the existence of a ``modern, competitive and efficient  arms industry to be a part of security precautions.'' The BDI  tells Bonn that this is ``not possible at zero cost and without  political compromise within the alliance in adjusting arms  regulations.'' The BDI refers to the uncompromising position of  some important European partner countries that have refused to  follow the strict German regulations. The German arms industry  will only regain its international competitiveness if the  Federal Government abolishes ``the marked disadvantage that  German companies are experiencing.''</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric from Knin] </F>   [Text] The third extension of the cease-fire agreement  reached by Krajina and Croatia is also marked by violations in  the border regions. The Croatian Army carried out attacks  toward the Gracac part of Mount Velebit and infiltrated a  subversive group in the Teslingrad front. According to the  general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina, the Croatian  subversive group that was infiltrated north of Teslingrad in  Lika was neutralized.    In the last 24 hours, the Croatian Army carried out attacks  with infantry weapons and tanks on Zitnik near Drnis, Otisic in  the Vrlika region, and the free part of the village of Kasic  near Benkovac.    It was somewhat quieter around Otocac, where the Krajina and  the Croatian commissions for exchange of war prisoners and other  humanitarian issues met under the auspices of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces]. They agreed on the next exchange, which will  take place in 15 days, and exhumation at several hitherto  unknown locations where soldiers and civilian victims of the war  are buried. They also agreed that exchange include the persons  who, as stated, committed classical types of crime. This  cooperation under the mediation of foreign observers is thus  assuming a new quality.</p>

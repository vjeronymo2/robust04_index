			<p>BFN     [Text] Hunan has scored initial results in operating the  new foreign exchange administrative system. For a quarter of  trial operations, the province basically realized the merger of  foreign exchange rates, and initially shaped an operational  mechanism characterized by a controlled floating rate based on  market demand and supply, which participants at yesterday's  provincial work conference on foreign exchange control fully  affirmed.    Since the implementation of the new foreign exchange  administrative system effective 1 January this year, great  changes have taken place in the content and work focus of  foreign exchange control. For this reason, the provincial  foreign exchange administration has propagated and implemented  the foreign exchange restructuring plan through various  channels. The convergence and stable transition of the new and  old foreign exchange administrative systems has effectively  promoted the development of the province's undertakings in  foreign economic relations and trade.    In the first two months of this year, the province's imports  were on par with the same period last year. The province  brought in $260 million worth of hard currency through exports,  up 33 percent on the same period last year, with exchange  settlements of $220 million, up 69 percent on the same period  last year.</p>

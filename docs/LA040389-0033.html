			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The Netherlands is trying to organize the largest exhibition ever of Vincent  van Gogh's paintings next year to mark the 100th anniversary of his death. The  Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, with approximately 200 Van Goghs in its own  storerooms, is planning to borrow at least 120 others from abroad worth an  estimated $3 billion. The Kroeller-Mueller Museum in Otterlo, 55 miles east of  Amsterdam, and from which two Van Goghs were stolen last December, will exhibit  at least 230 drawings flown in from all over the world. Organizer Frits Becht  said security would be massive during the four-month exhibition that is to end  July 30, 1990, the centenary anniversary of the Dutch painter's death.

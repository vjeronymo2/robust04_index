			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: First quarter recovery at GA - Estimate of net loss from the Bishopsgate bomb increased to Pounds 10m GENERAL ACCIDENT yesterday provided further evidence of the turnround in the general insurance market with better-than-expected first quarter figures. The Perth-based composite insurer reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 41.9m in the first three months of 1993, compared with a Pounds 29m loss in the same period of 1992. The shares rose 18p to 591p. A fall in worldwide underwriting losses of Pounds 54.5m to Pounds 80.5m, was underpinned by a strong performance in the UK where GA was boosted by the impact of higher premiums, milder weather and cuts in operating costs. UK underwriting losses fell to Pounds 4m (Pounds 65m), in spite of a pay - out of Pounds 3m after flooding in Scotland in January. GA has revised its estimate of net losses from the Bishopsgate bomb in April to Pounds 10m compared to earlier estimates of Pounds 7m. The loss will affect second quarter figures. Overall premium income rose to Pounds 1.02bn (Pounds 914.7m) for general business and to Pounds 207m (Pounds 165.1m) for life business. In the UK the book of household business was expanded with premium income rising to Pounds 71m (Pounds 47.3m), following the acquisition of a block of business from the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society last October. Investment income - after loan interest - increased to Pounds 115.6m (Pounds 102.7m). Losses from estate agency operations fell to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 4.5m). Life profits amounted to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 7.8m). The company did not intend to follow the example of Commercial Union and Royal Insurance by raising fresh capital through a rights issue in order to take advantage of rising rates, said Mr Nelson Robertson, chief general manager. Mr Robertson said his company's capital base was adequate, its solvency margin - the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - amounting to 46.1 per cent, compared to 41.5 per cent at the end of 1992. GA raised Pounds 250m in cumulative preference shares last year. See Lex</p>

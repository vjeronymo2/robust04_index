			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDERS MOBILIZE TO BLOCK A BORDER AIRPORT  </P> <P> A potentially powerful coalition of large developers is quietly organizing to  block the placement of an international airport on Otay Mesa, a project that  could wipe out builders' plans to put thousands of homes and hundreds of acres  of industrial and commercial structures on the mesa.  </P> <P> Led by Michael Murphy, president of California Structures, the group, which is  still in its formative stages, would represent the first substantial organized  opposition to efforts by Councilman Ron Roberts to locate a binational airport  on the border with Mexico.  </P> <P> Its activity could put business and real estate development interests at odds  with Roberts, an architect who during his two-year tenure on the council has  enjoyed generally good relations with business leaders and builders.  </P> <P> A consulting firm hired by the San Diego Assn. of Governments has narrowed the  list of potential replacements for overburdened Lindbergh Field to Miramar  Naval Air Station, a site east of the air station and a joint facility on the  Mexican border.  </P> <P> The Sandag consultant is scheduled to issue a final recommendation in  September, and the San Diego City Council is expected to discuss a choice this  fall, sometime before a moratorium on housing construction near Brown Field  expires Nov. 21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open to All 3 Sites  </P> <P> Roberts, who has said he is open to all three sites, has been negotiating with  Mexican officials to keep the binational option open. He is in Mexico this week  for negotiations on the airport, aides said.  </P> <P> Known currently as "Keep Lindbergh Field," the anti-Otay Mesa organization  includes the Pardee Construction Co. and has conducted discussions with the  Baldwin Co.  </P> <P> The two home builders could see their plans to build 6,000 homes west of Brown  Field wiped out because of noise and safety concerns if Roberts' negotiations  with the Mexican government come to fruition. An Otay Mesa airport with  north-south runways also could jeopardize Baldwin's plans to build homes and  offices on more than 20,000 unincorporated acres of Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> The group is negotiating a contract with Stoorza, Ziegaus Metzger, a prominent  public relations firm that frequently represents development interests, said  Gail Stoorza Gill, the firm's chairman.  </P> <P> "No contract has been signed," Gill said. "We're talking about it."  </P> <P> Officials with California Structures, which owns 240 acres of industrially  zoned land on the city portion of Otay Mesa, did not return numerous telephone  calls. Steve Doyle, a Pardee executive, said he believes his firm is  participating in the formation of the interest group.  </P> <P> Greg Smith, president of The Baldwin Co. and John Kern, a consultant for the  firm, said the company is not involved in formation of the interest group.  However, sources said the company has been approached and is engaging in  discussions about creation of the organization.  </P> <P> The sources said committee organizers are considering Great American Bank  Chairman Gordon Luce, former City Councilman Bill Cleator and others as  possible chairmen for the organization.  </P> <P> A key test of the business leaders' clout could come today, when the San Diego  Chamber of Commerce's board of directors hears a presentation from a  subcommittee on airport location alternatives. Though there are no specific  plans for the board to take a position on the site, "anything can happen," said  Gill, who also is chairman of the chamber's board.  </P> <P> (Gill said that because of her firm's possible involvement with the Keep  Lindbergh Field group, she will not participate in chamber votes on the airport  site selection.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pitch to Keep Lindbergh  </P> <P> Murphy and Roberts made presentations to the Chamber's executive committee July  13, but Stoorza declined to reveal whether that group, which makes  recommendations to the full board, took a position.  </P> <P> An outline distributed by Murphy claims that Lindbergh, now overcrowded with 11  million passengers annually, could handle a more than 30 million passengers  annually if 48 acres of the adjacent Marine Corps Recruit Depot were acquired.  However, Jack Koerper, project manager for Sandag, said there is no support for  that position in a consultant's report on the crowding prepared for the San  Diego Board of Port Commissioners.  </P> <P> South Bay politicians such as San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner and County  Supervisor Brian Bilbray publicly oppose placement of the airport in the South  Bay, but both said they are not working with the organization.  </P> <P> "It makes no fiscal sense," said Filner, who also believes that negotiations  with Mexico would be impossible to complete. "It destroys the whole industrial  economic policy we have for Otay Mesa, and it's fiscally irresponsible. There's  no way we can afford to buy all the land."  </P> <P> The two options outlined by the Sandag consultant for a binational airport  would consume 6,638 or 3,436 acres, depending on which one is chosen, according  to the consultant's report. The larger would require acquisition of 5,585 acres  of commercially and industrially zoned land. The smaller would require purchase  of 2,411 acres, the report shows.  </P> <P> Roberts, who supports the smaller option, believes that the city has little  choice in relocation because Lindbergh is not a viable long-term option and the  Navy has flatly refused to negotiate giving up Miramar, home of its famed Top  Gun flier school. Safety considerations also make it the best choice, an aide  said.  </P> <P> "The justification is that we don't appear to have another option for a site  physically in this county, and the consultant looked at the entire county," the  aide said.  </P></p>

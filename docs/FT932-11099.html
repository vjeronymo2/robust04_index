			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Chief of UN health agency re-elected DR Hiroshi Nakajima, controversial director-general of the World Health Organisation, was yesterday re-elected for a second five-year term as head of the 185-nation UN agency. But the vote, 93 to 58, displayed unexpectedly strong disapproval of his handling of WHO affairs, making it likely that his second term will be as turbulent as the first. The vote at WHO's annual meeting followed a heated debate on a report by external auditors which revealed 'shortcomings' in financial controls relating to contracts for executive board members. Dr Nakajima, a Japanese, was nominated for re-election by the 31-member executive board by 18 votes to 13, amid accusations by the US and other donor nations that Japan had used threats and inducements to win developing country votes. Western countries opposed to Dr Nakajima have made clear that they will insist on sweeping reforms in management and financial accountability at WHO, which has a two-year budget of Dollars 1.8bn. Mr Walter Broadnax, deputy secretary-designate at the US Health Department, warned in a speech that 'only managerial and leadership changes can prevent further erosion in programme effectiveness'.</p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, (PL 100&hyph;690) (CDTA) was passed by Congress to control the diversion of certain chemicals (hereinafter referred to as listed chemicals) that are necessary for the illicit manufacture of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD. The CDTA and its implementing regulations, as set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), parts 1310 and 1313, established a system of recordkeeping and reporting requirements through which DEA and the chemical industry could identify persons seeking to divert listed chemicals for the manufacture of illicit drugs. The CDTA allows for the tracking and, where necessary, control of domestic and international transactions involving listed chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDTA has had strong success. The greatest impact has been in the international arena, with a significant reduction in exports of listed chemicals from the United States to countries that are known sources of cocaine. Domestically, the volume of chemicals available to clandestine laboratories was reduced. However, these successes also highlighted several shortcomings in the CDTA, including: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The CDTA provided a mechanisms for DEA, with the cooperation of the chemical industry, to identify persons engaging in suspicious transactions and, as needed, take action against those persons. However, lacking evidence that an individual knowingly supplied chemicals for the illicit manufacture of drugs, DEA's options were limited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Persons engaged in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone were able to obtain supplies of the listed chemicals critical to the manufacture of such drugs through the purchase of drug products that were exempted from the provisions of the CDTA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Illicit drug manufacturers in foreign countries began to purchase their supplies of listed chemicals from countries other than the United States, on occasion utilizing the services of United States based brokers and traders to facilitate the transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address these and other concerns, Congress passed legislation in late 1993 to amend the CDTA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> II. The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;200) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA) was signed into law on December 17, 1993, and became effective on April 16, 1994. The DCDCA is intended to close avenues used by illicit drug manufacturers to circumvent the CDTA. The main provisions of the DCDCA are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Precursor and essential chemicals have been redesignated as List I and List II chemicals respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a List I chemical must obtain a registration from DEA. DEA is authorized to deny an application for registration or suspend or revoke a registration to manufacture, distribute, import or export a List I chemical, if it is established that such registration would not be in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Transactions involving drug products marketed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) which contain ephedrine, either as the sole active medicinal ingredient or in combination with therapeutically insignificant quantities of another active medicinal ingredient, are now included in the definition of regulated transaction. Subjecting these products to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements eliminates a virtually unrestricted source of ephedrine for illicit manufacturers of methamphetamine and methcathinone. The DCDCA also grants DEA the authority to remove the exemption for any other drug that contains a listed chemical if DEA determines that the drug is being diverted in order to obtain the listed chemical for use in the illicit manufacture of a controlled substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Brokers and traders based in the United States who arrange international transactions involving listed chemicals will be subject to the same reporting and recordkeeping requirements as exporters of listed chemicals, thus controlling a previously unmonitored source of chemicals for clandestine laboratories in foreign countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Manufacturers of listed chemicals are required to provide DEA with annual reports regarding the manufacture of such chemicals. The reports will provide DEA with information regarding the volume of listed chemicals available in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Implementation of the DCDCA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> To implement the DCDCA, DEA is proposing the following regulatory changes and additions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A new part 1309 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations is to be added, setting forth the specific requirements for registration, the application forms to be used, the application fees, exemptions from the registration requirement, security provisions, and administrative procedures regarding approval or denial of an application, revocation of registration, and administrative hearings. With respect to the requirement of registration in the proposed Section 1309.21, DEA has granted a temporary exemption from the registration requirement pending implementation of the registration program, as set forth in an Interim Rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 24, 1994 (59 FR 13881). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the CDTA, regulated persons consist of those firms engaged in the distribution, importation or exportation of chemicals. The DCDCA regulates drug products containing ephedrine which are distributed by retail distributors such as convenience stores, liquor stores, truck stops, gas stations, nutrition centers, etc. These retail outlets do not distribute any other listed chemicals and their activities consist solely of the sale of such products directly to walk-in customers. DEA has determined that retail distributors should be categorized separately in light of the limited scope and volume of their chemical activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 822(d), the Administrator may waive the requirement of registration. The Administrator is proposing in &sect;1309.25 of these regulations to exempt persons registered with DEA to manufacture, distribute, dispense, import, or export a controlled substance from the chemical registration requirement for equivalent activities involving drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals pursuant to &sect;1310.01(f)(1)(iv). This includes such traditional sources for these products as pharmacies, hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, etc. Further, the Administrator proposes in &sect;1309.27 to exempt from the registration requirement those persons who manufacture a List I chemical solely for internal use, with no subsequent distribution or exportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

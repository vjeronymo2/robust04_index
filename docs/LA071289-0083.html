			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRONKITE TO STAR IN AD PRAISING 'FREE' TELEVISION  </P> <P> Launching the first of two major campaigns to combat inroads made by cable  television in their viewership and advertising support, the three major  networks and commercial television stations on Monday will air an ad in which  Walter Cronkite praises "free TV," officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's the first time anything like this has ever happened," CBS spokesman  George Schweitzer said, referring to the massive exposure for the commercial  featuring the former CBS anchorman.  </P> <P> The 30-second ad will air one time only at the start of prime time on Monday  night. Schweitzer estimated that more than 1,000 stations will broadcast it as  part of a yearlong effort by the National Assn. of Broadcasters to remind  viewers of the virtues of over-the-air commercial television.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the broadcast industry's Television Bureau of Advertising said  Tuesday that it will be launching a campaign of its own in Jan. 22 -- a series  of "image commercials" for "free" TV that it estimated could be worth $100  million in air time.  </P> <P> That effort will feature eight commercials a week about what one official  called "the value and impact" of over-the-air commercial TV.JAY SHARBUTT  </P></p>

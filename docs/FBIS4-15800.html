			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Besik Urigashvili: "Bombers' Games in Tbilisi"] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi -- The terrorists continued their bloody  games 9 April when all Georgia was honoring the memory of the  people who died on that day five years ago when Soviet troops  broke up a peaceful rally.    Early in the morning three people died at Sadakhlo Station  on  the Armenian border when a bomb planted under a Tbilisi-Yerevan  passenger train exploded, and a few hours later an explosion  rang out at the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA editorial building, which  also houses the IZVESTIYA office. This time fortunately there  were no casualties, but I would like to go into this in a bit  more detail.    Toward around 1300 hours, when a procession of excited  supporters of ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was moving down  Rustaveli Boulevard, Besik Tskhoroguzli, a colleague of mine  from SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and I decided to watch the  demonstration from his office balcony, which directly overlooked  the boulevard.    About 10-15 minutes later when the crowd of demonstrators  had  almost passed our observation post we heard the creak of a door  opening and almost immediately a sound like the crack of a  starting pistol. We immediately dashed into the room but at  that moment we were deafened by a powerful explosion. We were  thrown back onto the balcony by the force of the blast and  covered with fragments of glass. When we came to our senses  some time later and went into the room thick smoke was pouring  from a sofa by the entrance to the balcony and plaster was  falling from the ceiling.    Police and security personnel appeared on the scene in a  matter of minutes. The surprise came later. On arrival the  officers feverishly inspected the room but, instead of taking  any action to seal off the exits from the building, began  hysterically cross-examining us while we were still in a state  of shock from the explosion. And each of them, moreover,  confidently came up with his own version of events without  taking any notice of our testimony. It was only at the end a  few hours later, when Georgiy Shalutashvili, an investigator  from the security service's investigation department, who  listened to us fairly attentively, took over the case, that he  said. "You were lucky, had the grenade not landed on the sofa  you would have been done for."</p>

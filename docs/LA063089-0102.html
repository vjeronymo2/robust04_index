			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: 3RD TIME AROUND FOR A KATSU RESTAURANT  </P> <P> What do you call your third restaurant when it happens to be on 3rd Street? If  you're Katsu, you call it Katsu Third, 8636 W. 3rd St., West Hollywood, (213)  273-3605. And if you're Katsu, you also make it look more like a gallery than a  restaurant, filling up the white space with interesting angles, recessed light  and very good art. If you're Katsu, you also make the menu totally different  than the one offered at the original Katsu (mainly sushi), or that served at  Cafe Katsu (French inspired). This time you put out chopsticks, balancing them  artfully atop green chiles, and you offer appetizers such as a terrine made of  scallops, halibut and eel (not, it should be noted, the easiest item to eat  with chopsticks), or a cream cheese terrine (even harder to eat with  chopsticks) or shrimp salad. You offer entrees that range from chicken tempura  to wiener schnitzel and beef tenderloin at prices that are mostly in the  mid-teens. You add a few desserts, a nice little wine list and very pleasant  service.  </P> <P> And then you might take the time to congratulate yourself for putting your  third restaurant on a stretch of 3rd Street that is turning into quite a little  restaurant row.

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The sharp advance in US bonds helped to enliven an otherwise dull derivatives sector in London, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,121. With no lead to follow due to the Ascension Day closure of other European markets, the contract languished over the next few hours, trading in a tight 13-point range. That situation changed over the lunchtime period with the release of US sales and prices data which traders interpreted as reducing the chances of an increase in US interest rates. The consequent rise in US treasuries and the firm opening on Wall Street also boosted sentiment, and June moved strongly ahead, pulling the underlying cash market higher. The day's peak of 3,151 was seen in the last half an hour preceding the official close and before a bout of profit-taking saw the contract come off the top to finish at 3,151, up 18 from its previous close and around 10 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume was 13,354 lots. Traded options were quiet, a mere 23,163 contracts having been dealt by the close. Among the index options, the FT-SE 100 option traded 9,089 lots and the Euro FT-SE 1,019. Bid target Lasmo stood out among the stock options with a day's total of 3,432 lots.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walailak Kiratiphiphatphong and Peter Mitri Ungphakon] </F>   [Excerpt] The Juridical Council has ruled that Universal  Insurance Co, a non-life insurance member of the American  International Group, is a foreign company and is thus prohibited  from maintaining branches under the 1992 insurance law.    The ruling amounts to only a legal opinion given to the  Government and can be challenged in court. It is a rejection of  the claim by the US Government that Universal Insurance (known  in Thai as Phaisan) is a Thai company that happens to be 99.84  percent owned by Americans.    US Ambassador David Lambertson has repeatedly argued in  meetings with Thai ministers that Universal Insurance should be  allowed to operate branches. More recently, he has also argued  that if Universal is indeed an American concern, then it should  be exempt from the restrictions of the 1992 law under special  rights granted to Americans through the 1966 Thai-US Amity  Treaty.    A US official said yesterday the embassy understood from  discussions with ministers during the period when the law was  being drafted that it would allow rights granted to Americans  before the law was enacted to be maintained.    The official said that since the embassy had yet to receive  the report, there was no official American response. He pointed  out, however, that the Government need not abide by the  council's interpretation of the law.    The council made the determination last month but only  notified the Commerce Ministry on Wednesday. It would appear to  terminate the company's plan in seeking approval from the  ministry to upgrade its 11 representative offices as branches  unless the Americans decide to test the ruling in court.    According to secretary-general Watthana Ratanawichit, about  70 legal experts of the council in a meeting last month decided  that Universal Insurance was an American company because 99.84  percent of its shares are owned by the American International  Group, which includes the largest life insurance company in  Thailand, American International Assurance (AIA).    The council's experts also ruled that Universal was not  protected by the 1966 treaty because the 1992 law supersedes the  special rights granted to Americans under that treaty. The law  requires insurance companies to have foreign shareholdings of no  more than 25 percent if they are to be considered Thai with the  full rights enjoyed by Thai companies.    They reasoned that the treaty's status was inferior to the  1992 law because Parliament's legislation should reign supreme.    The Americans have argued that Universal should be treated  as  a Thai concern because it was set up under full Thai ownership  and registered as Thai before it was later taken over by the  American International Group (AIG).    Local insurance companies, maintained Mr Watthana, are  regulated and controlled by the Life Insurance Law and the  Non-Life Insurance Law of 1967 -- amended in 1992 with the  ministerial regulations setting out the maximum foreign  shareholding permitted.    The report received by Sanit Worapanya, acting permanent  secretary for Commerce, said that if the Government allowed such  cases to be protected under one treaty which conflicts with  domestic law, it would infringe on the country's sovereignty.    Mr Watthana said the only way for the treaty to sustain  legality would be for the treaty to have been enacted by  Parliament at the same time as the law.    He said the decision made over the case was final and the  council would not review the case -- even if requested by the  ministry. He also predicted that the firm would have only a  slim chance of victory in court because 70 legal experts of the  country have reached a unanimous opinion. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: First-quarter loss at MIM Holdings THE continuing slump in base metals prices has pushed Brisbane-based MIM Holdings to a first-quarter after-tax loss of ADollars 30.4m (USDollars 20.3m) in the 12 weeks to September 19, compared with a profit of ADollars 29m a year ago, writes Nikki Tait. At the operating level, the international metals group saw an after-tax deficit of ADollars 6.9m, down from last time's profit of ADollars 34.5m. The final result was further depressed by ADollars 17.8m due to a write-off of cash contributed by MIM to its joint-venture smelting operations in Germany. The company said that sales volumes rose in some areas - 18 per cent higher for lead, 28 per cent for zinc, and 41 per cent for coal - although copper was down 10 per cent and gold by 24 per cent. But base metals prices fell in Australian dollar terms, with zinc - down 38 per cent - showing the largest year-on-year decline. Gold and silver prices were stronger, but total sales revenue for the quarter still slipped by 9 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 EJECT SAFELY BEFORE MARINE JET CRASHES IN OCEAN OFF SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Two crew members ejected safely from their Marine Corps photo reconnaissance  jet Wednesday before it crashed off the San Diego coast during a routine  training mission.  </P> <P> The crash, which took place about 3:20 p.m., is under investigation, Master  Sgt. Steven Merrill said.  </P> <P> The jet had taken off from El Toro earlier in the afternoon.  </P> <P> One crew member was identified as Capt. T.P. Hewitt, a reconnaissance systems  operator. The pilot's name was withheld pending notification of the next of  kin, he said.  </P> <P> The two men were picked up minutes after the crash by the tank landing ship  Peoria, a Navy vessel that had been operating in the area, Merrill said. The  men were flown by helicopter to the El Toro base for a precautionary medical  examination, he said.  </P> <P> The plane, an RF-4B Phantom jet, is part of the air station's Marine Tactical  Reconnaissance Squadron. It was purchased for $5 million, Merrill said. He  wasn't sure how old the jet was, but the model was introduced in 1965, and the  line is due to be replaced within a year.  </P></p>

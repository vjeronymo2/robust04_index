			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITIES OPPOSE LUCAS AS LACKING IN EXPERIENCE  </P> <P> The fight over the nomination of William Lucas to head the Justice Department's  civil rights division sounds like a debate over affirmative action -- but with  the roles reversed.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and conservative Republican senators, usually foes of  using race as a factor in employment decisions, say the fact that Lucas is  black makes him a particularly good choice for the post.  </P> <P> "The minorities ought to be thankful and grateful and appreciative that here,  you've got one of your own members appointed," Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.)  said in leading the defense of the nomination last week before the Senate  Judiciary Committee. In selecting Lucas to be the government's top civil rights  lawyer, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh conceded that "there are probably better  lawyers than Bill Lucas" but said Lucas' life stands as a "success story" of a  black American.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Qualifications Questioned  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Washington's leading civil rights activists, who usually support  race-based affirmative action, say that qualifications and legal experience,  not race, are what count in selecting someone for this post.  </P> <P> After seven recent civil rights setbacks in the Supreme Court, they say, it is  more important than ever that the Justice Department have an experienced,  aggressive advocate of civil rights. Instead, they contend, President Bush and  Thornburgh have selected a novice -- who happens to be black.  </P> <P> The clash illustrates the tough challenge the new civil rights battleground  poses for the Administration. Eager to promote opportunity for minorities in  its ranks -- a top priority of the Republican Party -- the White House finds  itself hard-pressed to recruit highly qualified minority job candidates who  both endorse its ideology and are acceptable to the civil rights establishment.  </P> <P> With the Lucas nomination, the uneasy peace that prevailed between the  Administration and key civil rights advocates has been shattered.  </P> <P> Today, the closely divided Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Lucas, a  former sheriff, county executive and unsuccessful Republican candidate for  governor of Michigan. If seven of the committee's eight Democrats vote "no" the  nomination may be dead.  </P> <P> Lucas did get a boost Wednesday when Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a  wavering Republican, announced he would support the nomination.  </P> <P> Since January, Bush and Thornburgh had sought to steer a comfortable middle  course on civil rights. Where former President Ronald Reagan and his civil  rights division chief, William Bradford Reynolds, were perceived as hostile to  civil rights, Bush and Thornburgh tried to maintain a "cordial relationship"  with civil rights leaders, as Justice Department spokesman David Runkel put it  last week.  </P> <P> But civil rights advocates say the record of the Bush Administration has not  matched its public pronouncements. They note that Thornburgh found top-notch  lawyers to head the divisions on antitrust, tax and environmental policy, but  say that was not the case with civil rights.  </P> <P> They also took note of Bush's reaction to the Supreme Court rulings. Where Bush  proposed a constitutional amendment to overturn the protection of flag-burning  as a form of political protest, the President and the attorney general had  little to say about the civil rights decisions, other than that they would  monitor their impact.  </P> <P> Lucas did little to ease doubts about his legal acumen as he stumbled through a  Judiciary Committee hearing last week. Asked to explain the difference between  de jure and de facto segregation, Lucas appeared to draw a blank.  </P> <P> A crucial distinction in school desegregation cases, de jure segregation is  that established by law or official policy, while de facto segregation in  schools may result from other causes such as housing patterns among blacks and  whites. De jure segregation is illegal; de facto segregation is not.  </P> <P> "I am new to the law," explained Lucas, a 1962 graduate of Fordham University  Law School who has spent his career in law enforcement and government.  </P> <P> An NAACP lawyer commented that for a civil rights lawyer not to know this  distinction is akin to a doctor being unable to distinguish between an aorta  and a vein.  </P> <P> This was not Lucas' only problem before the committee. He commented that  Congress was able to overturn the "Bob Jones decision" to grant tax exemptions  to racially segregated colleges. In fact, there was nothing to correct, since  the Supreme Court in an 8-to-1 vote rejected a Reagan Administration move to  give out those tax exemptions.  </P> <P> In announcing that he would support Lucas, Specter said it was unfair to give  undue weight to legal knowledge.  </P> <P> Specter said Lucas' "tough experience as a member of a minority" is a more  important qualification for the job of safeguarding minority rights than his  "ability to articulate the refined nuances of Supreme Court decisions."  </P> <P> Of further concern to skeptics at the hearings were episodes in Lucas' past  involving gambling junkets to Las Vegas, hidden jewelry found during a customs  search and misstatements on his bar application.  </P> <P> For example, during a 1977 FBI investigation, Lucas, then the sheriff of Wayne  County, Mich., admitted to having taken "three to five" trips to Las Vegas paid  for by a Detroit man with ties to organized crime. Last week, Lucas told the  senators he had taken only one such trip. Asked to explain why he gave the FBI  a different story, he replied: "It was very casual. I felt no compunction to be  precise."  </P> <P> Born in Harlem and orphaned at an early age, Lucas got his start as a New York  City policeman. He later became an FBI agent, a sheriff and Wayne County,  Mich., executive. In 1985, he became a rising star of the Republican Party when  he switched his allegiance from the Democrats.  </P> <P> His lengthy career in law enforcement and politics did not include actual legal  work, his critics noted. Lucas has not tried a case, handled an appeal or  written a legal brief.  </P> <P> Lucas "does not meet any reasonable standard for confirmation" to the  government's top legal post for civil rights enforcement, Ralph G. Neas,  director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, told the committee. The  NAACP, its Legal Defense Fund and People for the American Way have also come  out against the nomination.  </P></p>

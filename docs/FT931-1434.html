			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading MID-SESSION bargain hunting helped bring about a recovery in stock index futures after an initial decline in an otherwise featureless derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 2,869 and was driven lower on lack of demand and sporadic selling, mainly from independent traders. It had fallen to the day's low of 2,855 by mid-morning. That level appeared to provide some resistance and after a further bout of sideways trading, bargain hunters helped bring about a recovery in the June contract. The buying was encouraged by the firm performance in the fixed interest markets. The session's high of 2,879, was reached just before the official close. The June contract,however, came off the top to finish at 2,873, 3 ahead of Tuesday's close and at a slight discount to the underlying cash market. In contrast the volume in the June contract was light reaching only 7,510 lots by the close. In traded options, turnover improved to reach 33,366 contracts with a sizeable part of the total due to the March expiry in some of the stock options. The FT-SE 100 option traded 4,621 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100 option was also busy at 2,228. In the stock options Sears was the most active, with most of the day's business said to have been closing March positions.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Footwear workers accept pay freeze UNION LEADERS representing 20,000 footwear workers yesterday accepted a three-month pay freeze, as print employers said that they were also looking for a pay deferral in negotiations covering their industry. In a deal covering shoe manufacturing affiliates to the National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades, 20,000 employees will receive no pay rise for three months from the March 9 settlement. Rates will rise by 3.75 per cent from June, and talks on a successor settlement will begin in January. The union said last month that an increase from March was a minimum requirement for any deal. The employers had wanted a six-month freeze with a 3 per cent rise from September and cost-of-living-related rises in March and September next year. The British Printing Industries Federation told the GPMU print union that as well as seeking a pay deferral it wanted wider wage differentials between different groups of workers. It also wants an agreement on integrated press rooms 'which would allow for printing machines to be operated by a skilled and fully flexible workforce . . . we will also wish to address the question of multi-skilling across craft occupations'. Mr Tony Dubbins, GPMU general secretary, said a freeze was totally unacceptable.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROBINSON GUESSES RIGHT: TRABER DELIVERS;  </P> <P> ORIOLE'S PINCH-HIT HOME RUN RUINS FRASER'S OUTING AND SINKS ANGELS  </P> <P> Jim Traber, bat in hand, was sitting at the end of the Baltimore Orioles' bench  Thursday evening when Manager Frank Robinson motioned for him to pinch-hit. A  dramatic moment, it wasn't.  </P> <P> "I stared at Frank, he stared back; I got ready to hit," Traber said.  </P> <P> But as corny as it might sound, Robinson later said he had "a feeling" that  Traber would do something special as the Orioles tried to untie a 5-5 score in  the top of the eighth.  </P> <P> Cornier still is that Robinson was right.  </P> <P> Traber made his way to the plate, where he would face Angel reliever Willie  Fraser, the same guy he had beaten earlier this season with a bases-loaded  sacrifice fly. But this time Fraser was cruising, retiring 10 of the first 11  Orioles he faced.  </P> <P> The count grew to 3-2 when Fraser decided on a fastball inside. This much he  knew: He didn't want to walk Traber, thus, putting the winning run on base.  </P> <P> He didn't.  </P> <P> Instead, Traber jerked Fraser's pitch into the right-field seats, some 390 feet  away from home plate. It departed quickly.  </P> <P> "When I hit it, I knew it was out," Traber said.  </P> <P> So did Fraser, who could only watch a perfectly fine 3 2/3-inning relief  appearance ruined by a single swing. And all because Robinson had a  premonition.  </P> <P> "It was just a feeling putting Traber in," Robinson said. "I had an idea that  Traber would get one."  </P> <P> This is the sort of slump the Angels are in these days: Robinson guesses  correctly, Fraser guesses incorrectly. Robinson points to someone who had spent  the night on the bench and that someone delivers. Meanwhile, the Angels, now  losers of 11 of their last 14 games, can't seem to catch a break, to say  nothing of Traber's blast.  </P> <P> "Everything (Robinson) has done this year has been done right," Traber said.  </P> <P> The same can't be said of Fraser, who has struggled with inconsistency and the  idea of becoming a full-time bullpen resident this season. But Thursday night  was different. This time, Fraser threw as if he didn't have a worry in the  world. The Orioles? One, two, three in the fifth. One, two, three in the sixth.  One, two, a single, three in the seventh.  </P> <P> Then came the eighth inning and, of course, Traber.  </P> <P> "I knew what I wanted to do with him," Fraser said. "I was trying to get the  ball in on him, but I just didn't get it done."  </P> <P> Said Traber: "He's throwing a lot harder this year coming out of the pen than  as a starter. But he was in a tough situation. I know he didn't want to walk  me."  </P> <P> Fraser didn't quite know how to assess the 6-5 Angel loss. He had done well in  relief of starter Jim Abbott, but he had also made one glaring error in  judgment.  </P> <P> Also to be remembered is Traber's recent hitting streak. Until Monday, he had  hit safely in 13 consecutive games. In the last 16 games, Traber has driven in  16 runs and raised his average 76 points. No slouch is he.  </P> <P> "I felt I threw the ball good," Fraser said. "You take that one pitch away and  it's a great outing."  </P> <P> Keep that one pitch and it's still a performance to proud of, said fellow Angel  reliever Greg Minton, himself a victim of a game-winning homer not long ago.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for Fraser," he said. "That might have been his best outing of  the year. He's looking to get over a hump, too. Seems like a lot of guys are  looking to get over a hump right now. (We) didn't quite make it."  </P></p>

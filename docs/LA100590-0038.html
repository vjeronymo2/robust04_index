			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS SIGN 2ND-ROUND PICK BANKS, NGUYEN  </P> <P> David Banks, the Sockers' second-round draft pick from Philadelphia Textile,  signed with the team Thursday morning. The Sockers also announced the signing  of Thien Nguyen.  </P> <P> Both will carry a heavy burden into the season, now only two weeks away.  Despite having no indoor experience, Banks will be counted on as a main  contributor on a defense weakened by defections over the summer.  </P> <P> Nguyen was a developmental player last year and played in only 23 games,  scoring one goal and assisting on four others. He was a part-time player partly  by choice, often making graduate studies at UC San Diego his first priority.  </P> <P> But Coach Ron Newman expects a lot from him, saying Nguyen has the potential to  become one of the best midfielders in the league.  </P> <P> Banks is still uncertain what his role will be.  </P> <P> "I'm still fighting for a place as a rookie," he said. "But the boss (Newman)  told me I could probably come in and play right away. I'm ready. I'm  confident."  </P> <P> The Sockers will be counting on that kind of youthful exuberance. They now have  14 players under contract, seven of whom have two or fewer years of experience.  They need to sign four more, plus three developmental players, and all  remaining unsigned players in camp are rookies.  </P> <P> "This is an exciting young team, I can tell you that," Newman said. "It's not  like past Sockers teams that rely on experience, but I think we can put  everything together and start to win."  </P> <P> The biggest concern remains goalkeeping. The Sockers still have no backup to  Victor Nogueira, who was the only goalie left in camp Thursday. Assistant coach  Erich Geyer said Nenad Zigante, who played in Wichita in 1987-89, will be  brought in today.  </P></p>

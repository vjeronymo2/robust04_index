			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: Troubleshooting and childminding - Television There is more than meets the eye to BBC2's second series of Troubleshooter in which Sir John Harvey-Jones, former head of ICI, bustles around the country acting as a one-man think tank for British business. This is saying quite a lot since a good deal smacks you right in the eye. Last night in the opening programme of the new batch of six, Sir John went back to the companies he visited in his first series to see what had happened since. It seems that Morgan cars, which most viewers remember best, did not relish another meeting, so Sir John was reduced to a chat with one of the distributors. This suggested that little had changed: production has risen 10 per cent (now they are building 11 cars a week]) but the customer waiting list is still years. This item, like those involving the former boss of Tri-ang toys, the family which owns Copella apple juice (to Sir John's horror they have bought it back), and the Churchill pottery firm, suggested that British industrialists may lack the killer instinct when it comes to international business. Over and over again we heard about people being happy, enjoying themselves, trying to maintain contentment among the workforce. Plainly Sir John believes that in the modern world the British must compete and succeed internationally or die. Yet among many of those he visits the unspoken sub-text - and this is where there is more than meets the eye, or ear, since no one says this out loud - seems to be that if the price of international success is for the British to acquire the national characteristics of the Germans or the Japanese, perhaps we should forget it. What is so remarkable about the Troubleshooter programmes is that they are still out on their own. Given the significance attached to the recession, the Gatt talks, unemployment, the EC and so on, you might have expected television to be awash with programmes about the nuts and bolts of industry. Instead Troubleshooter is virtually unique. Its great strength is that although the subject matter is factual and serious the programmes, thanks largely to the attractive personality of Sir John, are not only informative but highly entertaining. Next week's, about the Double 2 shirt business, is an eye-opener: the company appears to have a fortune tied up in bolts of cloth, and to make countless designs. Why, then, are the British incapable of matching American outfitters by offering three sleeve lengths in every collar size, so that shirts actually fit? Annoyingly Sir John never asks. Yet another programme, this time C4's Dispatches, has been proselytising the 'causal connection' theory which assumes that because rapists and child sex abusers often look at magazines and videos depicting pornographic violence, the magazines and videos are causing the violence. It would not concern me greatly if they removed every example of violent pornography from the shelves tomorrow since I find such images chilling and unpleasant. But the notion that these things are 'causing' rapists to rape and abusers to abuse seems batty, given mankind's long history of violence before the invention of the glossy magazine and the videocassette. Cordon bleu cooks often have lots of cookery books on their shelves but you would not attribute their enthusiasm to the presence of the books; the presence of the books obviously results from the enthusiasm. Ban the books and the cooks would still cook. Engine drivers read magazines about trains but would you conclude that the magazines caused the choice of career, or that the job and the possession of the magazines stem from the same predisposition? Millions of people buy train magazines and never drive a train, just as millions buy violent pornography and never rape or abuse. Of course those predisposed to rape or abuse will probably enjoy looking at pictures of what they like, but that is not a causal connection. The misconception is important because it sends programmes such as Dispatches up blind alleys. So long as programmes and viewers are worrying about the outward symbol - the magazine or videocassette - they are overlooking the true cause inside men's heads, or within our social arrangements. And how do I explain the success of commercials if magazines and videos don't 'sell' pornographic violence? By the same argument: all successful commercials appeal to a predisposition, whether to have clean clothes or to get drunk. There is a decided tendency to apologise for liking The Borrowers, BBC1's new Sunday teatime serial. We are told that people do not watch television in family groups any more, that this classic children's story cannot possibly appeal to a generation raised on Nintendo and The Simpsons, that it is all terribly twee and middle class and old fashioned, that the sheer style of the thing cannot compete in a world of yoof graphics and house music, that children no longer like being told stories, but only playing computer games. Twaddle. Eat my shorts. The Borrowers is well wicked. Anybody of any age who has a modicum of imagination and a taste for narrative will adore it. Thanks to their quality of participation, computer games may be addictive, but they are also mindless. The Borrowers does what good fiction has always done: lifts you out of yourself and transports you to another world, this time under the floorboards of a country house where the seven-inch people live. As with any good fiction you have to do some of the work, and that makes it all the more enjoyable. Traditional entertainments such as pantomime, detective stories and opera are more popular than ever, not less: why should Sunday teatime serials be any different? Since this one has Ian Holm and Penelope Wilton as the Borrower parents you would have to be mad to miss it. News programmes get so set in their ways that the tiniest change looks, from the inside, like violent revolution. But what ITN considers 'the biggest revamp in the history of News At 10' may look like pretty small beer to the viewer. The camera angle on Big Ben at the beginning is different, there are lots of monitors behind the news reader's head, and Trevor McDonald presents the first half on his own. Gosh. The really significant change on Monday was the introduction of current affairs in the second half in place of news. Poor Julia Somerville, reduced to a 'Hand-you-over' role, announced a report on negative value mortgages and handed us over to Julian Manyon, late of This Week, who then presented a mini version of This Week on the hard hit of Huntingdon. With the threatened disappearance of current affairs in peak hours once the new ITV franchises come into effect in January, this slot may begin to look very valuable, but it is a questionable idea for those who prefer their news programmes full of news. And what is news? In any daily medium it should surely be the difference between the world yesterday and the world today.</p>

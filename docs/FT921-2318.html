			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hong Kong optimistic about deal - No comment from China about Hongkong taking over Midland WITH FOUR years of build-up to HSBC Holdings' announcement of proposals to take over Midland Bank, Hong Kong was prepared for the move if not for the timing. A 107 point shock reaction on the Hang Seng Index was almost entirely reversed on Wednesday and the bulk of the financial community was cautiously favourable towards the decision, which will create a truly international rather than Hong Kong bank. The fact that the Bank will reveal its inner reserves at least 18 months earlier than had been originally anticipated, was a main factor in the optimism clinging to banking analysts yesterday. Most brokers estimated the hidden reserves to amount to between Dollars HK20bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and Dollars HK30bn and this provided significant support for HSBC shares against a back-drop of knee-jerk selling following Tuesday's announcement. There was an absence of comment from Chinese officials, which was seen as a further positive. The only official statement came from Beijing, where Mr Zheng Hua, from Hong Kong's New China News Agency, said 'we hope that HSBC's activities will not affect Hong Kong's stability and prosperity'. However, there were whispers of discontent from mainland Chinese sources, expressing concern that the resources of the Hong Kong financial sector would be rechannelled into Europe. While Mr David Li, the banking community's representative in Legislative Council, expressed surprise that a Hong Kong bank should wish to focus on what he described as a 'sunset continent', at a time when so much attention was centred on the booming economies of south east Asia. Mr Li, also chief executive of The Bank of East Asia, a local competitor of Hongkong Bank, said a UK banker had described the move to him as 'just a colonialist going home'. He said the move would not damage the credibility of the financial market. 'Hongkong Bank is not that important today', he said. Mr Chim Pui-chung, a fellow Legislative Councillor, also expressed surprise. 'The English groups in Hong Kong always had the advantage, but right now they are no longer better off than the other groups. But they will still find that Hong Kong is the best place to invest', he said. However, few individuals in the political or financial community took the argument that Hong Kong's quasi-Central Bank was out to buy a British passport. The focus was firmly upon the commercial value of the deal. And once fears of a significant cash outlay had been calmed by insiders' assertions that it would be funded through new shares, the chief reaction was relatively positive. 'This is purely a commercial decision', said Mr Barry Yates, research director at Asia Equity. 'I am very positive. Midland Bank has got the greatest recovery potential of all the UK banks'. Despite the impact of a likely increase in issued share capital of more than 40 per cent, a number of analysts suggested the effect would merely be to push back the strong earnings growth of HSBC by one year. And with the announcement of inner reserves, the Bank would have to disclose full profits for 1992, boosting profit figures for that year. Baring Securities was forecasting a transfer to inner reserves of Dollars 2.67bn in 1992. Since this would become part of the disclosed profit figure, earnings per share for the enlarged group could exceed the original forecasts for HSBC.</p>

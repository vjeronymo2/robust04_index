			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Bretton Woods (50 Years): Guide-posts along the eastern route The breakdown of communism presented the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank with an unprecedented challenge. For me, charged in 1989 with the daunting task of designing Poland's transition from failed socialism to the market economy, their help proved invaluable. Particularly important was their insistence that Poland meet strict fiscal and monetary conditions. These institutions are right to be tough, which is in the best interests of their clients. The legacy of communism was far from uniform. The economic structure was worse in Slovakia, for example, than in the Czech Republic. Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and the former Soviet Union were burdened by large foreign debts, but Czechoslovakia and Romania owed relatively little. The most important differences, however, were macro-economic. Poland, in 1989, and the Soviet Union, in 1991, were afflicted by macro-economic imbalances. Czechoslovakia had the most stable economy, followed by Hungary. Bulgaria and Romania were in an intermediate situation, but closer to the Polish than to the Czechoslovak extreme. Nobody was fully intellectually equipped to deal with the post-communist transition. But some guide-posts were available. The first was the kind of economy to be reached at the end of the transition. It was natural to assume that it should be an economy capable of rapid and sustained economic growth. This criterion explained the reformers' vision of a stable, outward-oriented, market-based and mostly private economy. By comparing this goal with initial conditions, it was possible to derive the direction to be taken during the transition. This was towards macro-economic stabilisation, liberalisation, privatisation and related institutional reforms. This vision coincided with the views of the Bretton Woods institutions. The World Bank was helped by its own previous shift from project-lending towards lending for policy reform aimed at creating a stable, market-friendly economic environment. With its focus on the private sector, the International Finance Corporation was well placed to participate in privatisation and capital market development in post-socialist economies. The IMF's traditional preoccupation has been with macro-economic imbalances, a serious problem in most of these countries. It had also broadened its interests in the late 1980s, by introducing extended fund facilities, which were focused on the structural determinants of macro-economic disequilibria. It was also necessary to specify the timing, phasing and speed of reform. These were trickier questions, with less firm empirical and theoretical foundations for the answers. To this day they give rise to emotional debate and misunderstanding. Yet here, too, guide-posts were available. One was that high inflation calls for radical and sustained macro-economic stabilisation, because this approach offers the greatest chance of breaking inflationary expectations. Another, less frequently recognised one was that links exist among the various aspects of reform. Comprehensive price liberalisation is necessary, for example, if shortages are to be eliminated and relative prices adjusted, but this also demands comprehensive liberalisation of foreign trade. Price liberalisation must be safeguarded by a tough macro-economic policy. Comprehensive liberalisation is, in turn, necessary for sustained stabilisation. Otherwise, loss-making enterprises press government for fiscally ruinous assistance. All this argued for comprehensive and radical reform, launched without delay, partly to profit from the favourable initial political conditions after the great upheaval. Thereafter, the reform had to be sustained, despite unavoidable social and political complications. Social problems had to be mitigated by developing a safety net that would be compatible with the basic goals of the reform. This was the basic strategy of the Polish economic team between 1989 and 1991, one that was broadly shared by the Bretton Woods institutions. The fact that it was shared greatly facilitated the discussions that led to the historic IMF-supported programme of December 1989. Inevitably, there were controversies on some technical issues: the form of wage control, for example, and the path of disinflation. There were also shared mistakes. The size of the decline in output was one and the extent of the initial price jump was another. Given the extent of the ignorance, such forecasting errors were unavoidable. What mattered was that they were not allowed to derail the transition. The shared vision acted as a powerful safeguard. Such a vision was not equally present in all transition economies. The political position of the reformers may also not have been as strong as in Poland. Agreement with the Bretton Woods institutions was then not so easy to achieve, while conditionality became much more contentious. Nevertheless, linking agreement to a strong domestic programme must remain a fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods institutions. It should not be sacrificed for political expedience. Reforms often have great importance for the stability of the world, with Russia the main case in point. Even in this situation, however, IMF and World Bank conditionality should not be impaired. Western governments should come up with assistance themselves, instead. A small part of the 'peace dividend' is not a high price to pay for increasing the chances of enjoying the rest of it. The author was finance minister and deputy prime minister of the government that engineered Poland's transition to the market in 1989-91.

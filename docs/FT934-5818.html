			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Property: Making the grade - Listing aims to protect buildings of merit Listing historic buildings, so that they cannot generally be altered or pulled down without official permission, is already a fact of life for 500,000 owners, improvers and would-be demolishers, with more listings on the way. Officially, there are three grades: I, II* and II. Grade I means they are 'exceptional,' II* that they are 'unusual' and II 'regular.' In all cases, though, a grading provides the stamp of quality and of architectural or historical importance. The rankings help with getting grants from local authorities or English Heritage (EH), which in 1992/93 paid out Pounds 33m to owners of listed buildings (Pounds 3m of that for cathedrals and Pounds 9.2m for churches), and Pounds 7.4m on conservation areas. These grants go usually to help with major rehabilitation but, for most owners, recurrent maintenance is the problem: painting, pointing, and clearing the gutters of leaves (expensive when the builder has to hire extra-long ladders). Value-added tax of 17.5 per cent is an extra burden on such maintenance. This is odd when you consider that changes to the actual character of the building, which need listed building consent (LBC), escape the tax. Whether painting it an unusual colour or putting in a swimming pool, LBC means no VAT. LBC does not come automatically, though. The relevant authority will probably need plans, charge a fee and check the application minutely. Major decisions may be referred to EH or such designated amenity societies as the Georgian Group or the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Neighbours and the public can object or suggest changes. In the 1980s, the then environment secretary, Michael Heseltine, initiated a major re-listing project which revealed such hidden treasures as Odsey House in Essex (with work by the 18th century architect, William Kent). It rose from nowhere to grade I. But some areas still need updating. The city of Manchester awaits its new lists with 30-40 per cent more buildings, and Hull's list will be over 100 per cent larger. By now, almost 10 years after it began work, EH has sharpened its ideology of listing and its criteria. Contrary to general belief, being listed does not mean a building cannot be changed. It does mean that changes must be thought through carefully so they do not detract from the architecture already there. That is why LBC is needed - and, almost certainly, will be refused - for plastic windows. (Planning permission for them is not needed for an unlisted building; but in a conservation area it might be needed). It is the reason also why district councils share the decisions with EH and the amenity societies. In 1992/93, EH dealt with 8,627 LBC applications, 11.2 per cent up on 1991/92. With scholarship about the country's everyday architecture bounding ahead, spurred by the 1980s' re-listing, EH inspectors are more on the lookout for the medieval hall that might lurk beneath a Georgian facade. And if there is a sudden threat to an unlisted building of quality - such as demolition - today's greater knowledge means quicker decisions about whether to use an emergency procedure known as spot-listing. It is, of course, better to pre-empt that procedure by deciding in advance about categories of building that missed listing in the 1980s because they were too recent or the field-workers found them hard to type. Textile mills in Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire are under scrutiny and, helped by recent research, EH has prepared a list of 60, from which 40 to 50 will get gradings. While there is no point in listing all the surviving mills of the English north - there are 350 in Greater Manchester alone - some must be. They are grand buildings and an important component of the country's history. Likewise, the British Aerospace offices in Comet Way, Hatfield, north of London, have been listed both for their architecture and for their links with the Tiger Moth, Mosquito, Vampire and Comet aeroplanes - history that could vanish all too easily. In its thematic approach, EH is also looking at hospitals (helped by the property division of the National Health Service), cinemas and even pubs (in association with the Campaign for Real Ale). With so many hospitals becoming redundant, many pose the delicate problem of balancing architecture with expediency. 'Listing is fine if there is re-development,' says William Filmer-Sankey, the Anglo-Saxon archaeologist who has become director of the Victorian Society. 'It is less helpful if the building sits empty.' Holloway Sanatorium (grade I) at Egham, Surrey, is a particular worry. Nobody is interested in buying it without being allowed considerable scope for re-development. Meanwhile, it is being vandalised, water has come in, and it is falling to pieces. Filmer-Sankey points out that the VS - also an amenity society - is swamped by LBC applications needing comment. But the system falls down with neglected buildings like the sanatorium because it is designed to react to deterioration - by serving urgent works or repair notices that can lead to compulsory purchase - rather than preventing it. He wishes LBC applications had to be as detailed as those for planning; that way, the unnecessary destruction of special features might be prevented. Most listed buildings date from before the second world war. Listing post-war buildings had a shaky start when the environment secretary of the time rejected several of EH's initial candidates. But one building that passed with a II* grade was Sir Albert Richardson's Bracken House, the former headquarters of the Financial Times near St Paul's cathedral. Modern buildings become eligible after 30 years, or 10 years if they are outstanding and threatened. This year, schools, colleges and universities entered the lists. But private houses and commercial buildings are still few, as are churches despite Sir Basil Spence's Coventry cathedral (grade I). The Cummins Engine factory in Durham, designed by American architects Roche Dinkeloo, is grade II* while the Royal Festival Hall on London's south bank rates grade I. Jacob Epstein's statue of Field Marshal Jan Smuts in Westminster, and Henry Moore's Three Standing Figures in Battersea Park, are grade II. EH wants to list more houses, including pre-fabs and some in new towns. Any deterioration causes economic harm, and not just to the building. Buxton, in Derbyshire, is an extreme case. The decline of the 18th century Crescent (grade I) was damaging the success of other restoration schemes in the spa town until the Department of National Heritage served a repairs notice on the owner of a hotel that occupied half the Crescent. The hotel has now been sold to the local borough council, which was given a 100 per cent grant from the National Heritage memorial fund, while EH offered Pounds 1m for external repairs. The other half belongs to Derbyshire county council which had begun repairs already. By a circuitous route, the Crescent's listing has brought new hope to Buxton.</p>

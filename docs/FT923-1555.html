			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Pressure grows on Collor: President must present his defence today THE impeachment process against Brazil's President Fernando Collor reaches a critical phase today  - the deadline for Mr Collor to present to Congress his defence against sweeping corruption charges. Over the past week, pressure has been mounting on Mr Collor, with daily pro-impeachment demonstrations throughout Brazil, and the return from Miami of his younger brother Pedro, whose accusations in May prompted the congressional inquiry now threatening to bring down the president. Mr Collor's mother, Dona Leda, suffered three heart attacks last week after Pedro renewed his charges against his older brother, and is on a life-support machine in a Rio hospital. A congressional commission must present its recommendation on impeachment tomorrow. The final vote is expected next week, when a two-thirds majority is needed to unseat the president. The Supreme Court will rule tomorrow on whether this vote will be secret, which would aid Mr Collor by reducing public pressure on congressmen. Mr Collor's strategy is to try to delay the process through legal challenges while trying to win support in congress by releasing funds for assorted projects. With the impeachment clock ticking against him, Mr Collor is starting to show signs of losing control. At a dinner for congressmen last week he shocked guests with an outburst of coarse language against leading political figures, including Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, Brazil's most respected congressman. Mr Collor's spokesman explained: 'It was letting off steam by a man who has been suffering a process of lynching, injustice and slander for over 100 days.' Brazil and its creditor banks said yesterday they had completed negotiations on a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.8bn) debt deal, Reuter reports from Washington. But bankers say the accord, although important, is being held hostage by the political crisis facing Mr Collor. The crisis is affecting the country's chances of meeting targets of a recent IMF accord, without which the deal with the banks cannot go through.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: US forestry group rises sharply in quarter WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday posted sharp gains in fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting improved economic conditions and the benefits of the company's restructuring. Net income for the three months to December 27 was Dollars 85.3m, or 42 cents a share, on sales which rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.34bn. A year earlier, Weyerhaeuser took restructuring charges of Dollars 283m which contributed to a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 256.4m, or Dollars 1.27, on sales of Dollars 2.13bn. Excluding special items, it earned Dollars 26.6m, or 13 cents, a year ago. For the whole of 1992, earnings amounted to Dollars 372m, or Dollars 1.83, on sales of Dollars 9.2bn, against a net loss of Dollars 162m, or 80 cents, on sales of Dollars 8.7bn. Stripping out one-time items in 1991, the group earned Dollars 182.1m, or 90 cents, last year. Its timberlands and wood products division posted near record fourth-quarter earnings, driven by strong prices. The company benefited from environmental regulations which have reduced the supply of timber and pushed up prices. Operating profits from forest products stood at Dollars 175m for the quarter and Dollars 515m for the year. A year earlier, the division had a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 67m and earnings of Dollars 155m for the year, including restructuring charges of Dollars 152m in the 1991 fourth quarter. Pulp and paper operations saw operating profits of Dollars 47.8m in the 1992 fourth quarter and Dollars 251m for the year.</p>

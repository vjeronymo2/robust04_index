			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Astra bolstered in Japan afterlifting stake in drugs partner Astra, the Swedish drugs group, has finalised a SKr1.8bn (Pounds 154m) deal with its Japanese partner Fujisawa, strengthening its position in the world's second largest pharmaceuticals market. The agreement lifts Astra's stake in Fujisawa-Astra to 90 per cent, from 51 per cent, and gives it full management control. The Swedish group will also buy back the product rights for its local anaesthetics business from the Japanese group. Fujisawa will retain 10 per cent of the venture and support it with manufacturing and distribution services. Astra, one of the world's fastest growing pharmaceuticals companies, said the move was designed to bolster the position of its anti-asthma drugs in the Japanese market in the second half of the 1990s. 'Our partners were reluctant to invest in the development of new inhaled anti-inflammatory asthma agents such as Pulmicort,' it stated. Pulmicort, Astra's second biggest selling drug with 1993 sales of SKr2.96bn, has yet to be launched on the Japanese market. The drug, with its Turbuhaler inhaling device, will be filed for approval in Japan next year, and other anti-asthma products will be filed later. Mr Hakan Mogren, Astra president, said: 'Astra has substantially increased its influence over Fujisawa-Astra. We will now transfer local clinical research on Pulmicort Turbuhaler and other anti-asthma agents to this company.' Astra will continue to buy its local anaesthetics from Fujisawa, but by gaining the marketing rights it will get a higher share of profits. Sales through Fujisawa-Astra amounted to SKr1.9bn last year. The figure includes two-thirds of Astra's Japanese sales of Losec, the anti-ulcer agent which is the world's second biggest ulcer drug after Glaxo's Zantac. Losec has between 5 and 6 per cent of the Japanese market. Analysts said the deal with Fujisawa would give Astra greater control over its Japanese operations, but added that it might be moderately dilutive in the short-term.</p>

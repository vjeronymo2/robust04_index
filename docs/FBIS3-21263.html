The HTGR has a number of superb features, including safety, high  thermal efficiency, and nuclear heat use. Both the Fort St.  Vrain Reactor, a prototype reactor for power generation in the  United States, and the THTR-300, a thorium high-temperature  gas-cooled reactor in Germany, have ceased operations for  financial and other reasons. However, in addition to these two  nations, development plans for high-temperature, gas-cooled  reactors are underway in such nations as China, Russia, and  Indonesia.    In Japan, the high-temperature engineering test reactor  (HTTR) is under construction at JAERI's Oarai Research  Establishment, and is expected to come on line in 1998. Figure  II (2)-1 is a simplified diagram of the HTTR, and Table II (2)-1  summarizes its specifications. As the table illustrates, its  operating temperature is higher than that of conventional power  reactors, and, therefore, it has been necessary to develop  high-temperature materials. In this section, we will discuss the  development and testing of graphite (carbon) materials to  constitute the core section of the HTTR, the intermediate heat  exchanger, heat-proof alloys for the control rod structure, and  low alloy steels for the pressure vessel, all of which must  operate in a higher temperature range than in the case of  light-water reactors.          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table II (2)-1.

Graphite and Carbon Materials </H5> <H5>  (1) Core Graphite </H5>   As illustrated in Figure II (2)-1, graphite is used for both  the moderator and the reflector of the HTTR. For instance, it is  used in the graphite fuel sleeves, the hexagonal fuel assembly  blocks to load the sleeves, the mobile reflector blocks, and in  the fixed reflector blocks. These components are equipped with  nuclear and thermal capabilities, and are also structural  elements. Figure II (2)-2 is a diagram of the core section  components. The core supporting graphite structure consists of  fixed reflector blocks, high-temperature plenum blocks, and a  supporting post, as illustrated in Figure II (2)-1.       Although the fuel sleeves and the fuel assembly block of the  core graphite structure are replaced every two years, their  operational temperature, and their level of neutron irradiation  become high because they are in direct contact with the fuel.  Therefore, at the time of operation and shutdown, a sufficient  safety allowance is necessary considering the stress generated  in these components. Evaluation of the stress requires such data  as Young's modulus of elasticity, strength, thermal expansion  coefficient, and thermal conductivity in particular.  Characteristics particular to graphite include dimensional  changes and creep caused by irradiation.    Based on data about a number of characteristics including  the  items noted above, selection testing was conducted on several  types of candidate graphite materials from Japan and overseas to  be used for the HTTR. IG-110 graphite was selected for the core  graphite structure. This graphite was originally manufactured as  a regular material for various uses, such as particles produced  by the rubber press method for pots in which to melt  semiconductors. Prior to its use in the HTTR, JAERI and other  Japanese organizations developed a database for its physical,  chemical, and mechanical properties, including irradiation  effects, and conducted research and development on the  manufacturing side. This involved, for example, increasing the  size of the material, and improving quality control. The plan  for the graphite structure of the HTTR is based on this database.    The critical factor for a graphite material to be used in a  nuclear reactor for the first time is the effect of radiation on  it. The data needed to evaluate its soundness in the reactor  environment -- including dimensional changes caused by  radiation, thermal conductivity, corrosion speed, Young's  modulus of elasticity, and strength -- were studied for a range  of radiation temperature from 400-1200C, and a maximum  radiation exposure of 3x10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E &gt;  29 fJ).    With regard to the effects of radiation, creep caused by  radiation is an important characteristic of graphite used in  nuclear reactors. A creep phenomenon can be observed in graphite  irradiated at low temperatures, where thermal creep does not  occur. As thermal stress is relaxed by this phenomenon,  understanding creep behavior is an important element in  evaluating the soundness of the graphite structure.    In order to measure the creep factor of the selected IG-110  graphite under irradiation, JAERI developed an irradiation  capsule that is capable of irradiating a graphite test piece  under stretch stress, and conducted an irradiation test at the  JMTR. Figure II (2)-3 illustrates the results, showing  irradiation creep factors (K) in comparison with various  graphite samples. The results indicate that IG-110 graphite has  the same characteristics as other types of graphite studied  overseas. Here (K) can be calculated by the following equation  from the data on irradiation creep distortion _e_ c  in the case of a relatively high level of irradiation:    _e_[.sup]c[/] = _s_/E[.sub]O[/]  + K_s_    _s_: load stress, E[.sup]O[/]: Young's modulus  of elasticity, : neutron irradiation dose       Part of the irradiation creep research at JAERI has been  conducted within the framework of the high-temperature  gas-cooled reactor research collaboration between JAERI and the  U.S. Department of Energy. American graphite has been used for  irradiation. Establishment of a general model for creep damage  for international use has been set as a future goal.  <H5>  (2) Core Support Graphite </H5>   The graphite core support structure is a permanent structure  that consists of fixed reflector blocks, high-temperature plenum  blocks, plenum lower blocks, low-end blocks (PGX graphite made  by UCAR of the United States is used for these items), a  supporting post for the core section (made of IG 110 graphite),  and carbon blocks for insulation (made of ASR-ORB carbon made by  SIGRI of Germany).    PGX graphite was selected not only on the basis of an  evaluation of its various characteristics, but also because it  can be manufactured in sufficient quantities, a stable supply  situation, its record of use (at the Fort St. Vrain Reactor  reactors), and its price. For PGX graphite, the data necessary  to produce the core support graphite design plan were obtained  as in the case of IG 110 graphite.    ASR-ORB carbon for insulation was considered suitable due to  its material size, low thermal transmission factor (about 10  W/mK), and such data as measurement stability under compression  stress. It was confirmed that the measurement change was at most  0.1 percent at 1,000C with a compression stress of 0.3 MPa  loaded to reflect real conditions. It was also verified that the  thermal transmission factor remained almost the same at  1,000C for a long time.  <H5>  (3) Future Research Items </H5>   The supporting post, which is a permanent structure, is  important for safety as its function is to support the reactor  core. Evaluation of its durability against erosion caused by  gaseous impurities in the helium coolant has been conducted in  testing and analysis, and to improve corrosion tolerance,  research on the gradient materials constituting SiC has been  conducted. Experimental production at JAERI is based on chemical  reactions using SiO.    SiO (gas) + 2C (graphite) SiC + CO    At present, the corrosion behavior and strength  characteristics of IG-110 graphite made of SiC gradient  constituents produced by this method are under study. Figure II  (2)-4 is an example of one set of results. It indicates that the  corrosion resistance of SiC gradient constituent graphite is  improved when maintained in the atmosphere at 550C. In  addition, work on the development of high-performance materials  also has been conducted using compound carbon materials  reinforced with carbon fibers. Also, the development of  high-intensity and high-temperature conductive materials, the  production of experimental equipment elements, and the  acquisition of irradiation data are in progress with a view to  applications in nuclear fusion reactors.       With regard to inspection technologies, a method for  infrared  radiation measurement is being studied. This is in addition to  the supersonic method and the regenerative method used for  acceptance inspections of HTTR graphite. With regard to design  methods, improved and advanced research, such as adding the  fracture mechanics method to brittle material structure design,  is expected in future.  <H5>  2. Heat-Resistant Alloy </H5>   The performance required of heat-resistant alloys for HTGRs  includes maintaining the capabilities of these materials above  certain standards for a long period of time in the unique  environment of nuclear reactors. This is in addition to the  common performance requirements of general thermochemical  materials. Although there has been significant progress in the  development of heat-resistant alloys in recent years, we have  almost no experience in using massive amounts of heat-resistance  alloy in large-scale structures in an ultra-high-temperature  range over 850C. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a  new domain that takes into account the specific environment of  nuclear reactors from the standpoint of both material  engineering and structural engineering. The specific environment  of nuclear reactors involves a coolant helium gas atmosphere,  and neutron irradiation near the core. Although helium gas is  inherently inactive, and does not react chemically with metal  materials itself, the helium gas used as a coolant, which passes  and circulates through the high-temperature core where there is  a large amount of graphite, includes small amounts of CO,  CO[.sup]2[/], H[.sub]2[/], H[.sub]2[/]O, and  CH[.sup]4[/], which are produced by reactions between  absorbents, such as water and air, and high-temperature  graphite. Therefore, materials for use in high-temperature  structures, such as intermediate heat exchangers, must have  long-term durability in a helium gas atmosphere containing small  amounts of impurities. Structural materials for control rods  used near the core must be highly resistant to deterioration  caused by neutron irradiation.  <H5>  (1) Materials for High-Temperature Structures in HTTR </H5>   A maximum coolant temperature of 950C is expected at  the  reactor exit of the HTTR. Structural materials for use in  high-temperature sections, such as the heat-transfer pipe of the  intermediate heat exchanger, are exposed to coolant helium gas  with small amounts of impurities at temperatures above  900C. Maintaining the protective oxide layer reaction is  more difficult in an atmosphere of coolant helium gas containing  small amounts of impurities than in a strong oxidizing  atmosphere like ordinary air. In fact, research indicates that  many heat-resistant Ni-Cr alloys tend to undergo changes, such  as internal oxidation and decarburizing, that reflect inferior  protective properties of the oxide layer. Therefore, structural  materials for high-temperature sections must be adaptable to  such an atmosphere. In the HTTR design, the so-called insulated  double pipe structure is used. In this structure, a coolant  pressure of 4 MPa is supported by a pressure wall made of low  alloy steel that is in contact with the returned gas on the  low-temperature side, while the high-temperature side takes care  of about 0.1 MPa, the differential pressure with the secondary  system, without being affected by the direct pressure of the  coolant. By introducing such design, the primary stress exerted  on the structural materials for the high-temperature section  remains below 1 MPa, and the thermal stress is below 40 MPa.    The structural material used in the high-temperature section  in the HTTR is hastelloy X, a nickel-based alloy. It was  selected from among existing heat-resistant alloys after some  improvements in adaptability to the atmosphere described above  were made. The chemical components of the improved alloy, called  hastelloy XR, are presented in Table II (2)-2, and are compared  to the standard values for hastelloy X. The improvements made in  hastelloy XR are as follows:    [1] Improved resistance to corrosion in the coolant helium  gas atmosphere.        -  Control of uniform corrosion by a protective  MnCr[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] spinel oxide layer where the Mn  content is optimized.    -  Improved adhesive properties of the oxide  layer using SiO[.sup]2[/] granule formation in the phase  boundary between the oxide layer and the metal by optimizing the  Si content.    -  Control of internal oxidation and intergranular  corrosion by reducing the amount of Al and Ti.       [2] Improved high-temperature strength        -  Improved creep characteristics using structural  improvements such as form control of carbide by optimizing the B  content. (This was realized after other improvements were made.  Therefore, the alloy with this improvement may sometimes be  called hastelloy XR-II to distinguish it from the alloy without  an optimized B content.)    -  Improved creep characteristics using  separation control of stringer carbide, and unification of grain  size by optimizing the manufacturing process for seamless  pipes.       [3] Improved nuclear adaptability.        -  Control of radiation activation of corrosion products  by reducing the Co content.          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table II (2)-2.

Therefore, various tests related to long-term  durability were conducted for hastelloy XR in an atmosphere  simulating the primary coolant in a temperature range up to  1,000C. This made it possible to accumulate considerable  data and knowledge. In acquiring test data, standard helium gas  components for materials testing was designated based on  operational data from high-temperature gas-cooled reactors  overseas, as illustrated in Table II (2)-3. Next, various pieces  of equipment, such as a system for supplying and continuously  circulating the helium gas, a creep testing machine, a fatigue  testing machine and corrosion testing equipment were developed  for experiments in the intended atmosphere without changing the  components of the supplied helium gas. As details of this  testing equipment have been published in other issues, only some  examples of test results are presented here.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table II (2)-3. Impurities Components in Standard Helium Gas for Material Te-|  |sting                                                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |H[.sup]2     |H[.sub]2     |CO          |CO[.sub]2    |CH[.sub]4    |N[.sub]2     |  |[/]      |[/]O     |            |[/]      |[/]      |[/]      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |200         |1           |100         |2           |5           |&lt;5       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      [1] Creep and rapture properties    With regard to the creep properties of hastelloy XR in  standard helium gas, data for a total of 5 x 10[.sup]5[/]  hours have been acquired, including one experiment currently in  progress over the maximum of 47,000 hours in the range of  800-1,000C (Figure II (2)-5). Data for a total of 4 x  10[.sup]5[/] hours have been acquired, including one  experiment that reached the maximum of about 47,000 hours in the  same temperature range in the atmosphere. Hastelloy XR has  improved adaptability to the coolant helium gas atmosphere, and  the results indicate that there is no significant difference  between the creep properties in the standard helium gas and  those in the atmosphere, as the improvements were intended.       The creep properties of hastelloy XR, it was discovered, are  affected by the B content in the alloy, as illustrated in Figure  II (2)-6. Therefore, the optimized hastelloy XR-II was produced  twice on an industrial scale (2 tons) to examine long-term creep  properties in the standard helium gas, and in the atmosphere.  The extension effect for rapture life time due to optimization  of the B content proved to be about five times.       Further, it was verified that the accumulation law of damage  could be applied to high-temperature structure designs for  hastelloy XR by conducting two-step creep tests involving  changes in temperature and load, as well as creep tests with  short-term excessive load -- to take earthquakes into account --  in addition to creep tests under specific temperatures and loads.    In this way, it was demonstrated that hastelloy XR could  display excellent characteristics for long periods of time in  the standard helium gas. Its characteristics in helium gas with  changing amounts of impurities were also examined. It turned out  that, although its creep rapture properties in carburized helium  gas were equivalent to those in the standard helium gas, creep  rapture life time in decarburized helium gas was shorter than  that in the standard helium gas, and that it was possible to  forecast decarburizing behavior by regulating the impurities in  the helium gas through carbon activity, and oxygen partial  pressure. From the standpoint of maintaining the excellent  properties of this alloy, as well as ensuring the soundness of  the structure, it is important to be able to control the coolant  in nuclear reactors.    [2] Properties under fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction    Characteristics of low cycle fatigue were examined across a  broad temperature range from room temperature to 950C.  Under the standard condition for ordinary materials testing  (complete alternating distortion fatigue testing by triangular  waves at a distortion speed of 0.1 percent/second), fatigue life  time in the standard helium gas was at least as long as that in  the atmosphere.    The effects of both distortion speed and holding distortion  were examined to evaluate material properties under  creep-fatigue interaction. It was confirmed in the standard  helium gas that holding on the extracting side produced the most  serious effects, and that, as the temperature rose, the  saturation of life time reduction as a result of introducing  distortion holding moved toward a shorter life time (Figure II  (2)-7). In evaluating damage caused by fatigue and creep-fatigue  interaction based on such data, the principle value for damage  prevention was designated by restricting the addition of the  creep damage factor, and the fatigue damage factor under 1.       The effects of material change produced by aging on low  cycle  fatigue properties were also examined, and it was discovered  that a reduction of fatigue life time due to aging occurred when  the test temperature was below 700C. This tendency became  prominent under conditions of high distortion.    [3] Corrosion tolerance    To determine its corrosion tolerance in the standard helium  gas, corrosion testing, where a thermal cycle is added between  the room temperature and the test temperature, was conducted,  and data for 30,000 hours at 900C and 20,000 hours at  1,000C were obtained. The effects of improvements in  hastelloy XR for corrosion tolerance in the coolant helium gas  atmosphere were maintained for a long period of time. It was  also confirmed that partial corrosion did not occur, and that  progress in dechromation by oxidation took place as predicted by  the parabolic speed principle (Figure II (2)-8).       As illustrated above, sufficient data and knowledge about  the  hastelloy XR base material were accumulated through  comprehensive verification testing. Maintaining the performance  of the welded section -- an important problem to be solved in  constructing a structure with metal materials -- was also  examined. A filler metal for welding was developed in order to  obtain a stretching ductility, creep rapture strength, creep  rapture ductility, and fatigue strength equivalent to or greater  than those of the base material. By optimizing the filler metal  production process, and by adjusting the chemical components  through alloy design based on heavy regression analysis, a  filler metal with a performance far higher than that of  conventional filler materials was developed. It was confirmed  that this filler metal sufficiently satisfied the specifications  for welding sections of the thick structure of 50 to 60mm, which  was difficult to work on, as well as the thin structure of about  15mm. Figure II (2)-9 illustrates the results of creep rapture  testing as an example of its performance.       (2) Materials for Control Rod Structure for HTTR    Because the coolant temperature at the reactor exit reaches  a  maximum of 950C in the HTTR, most parts of the constituent  elements of the core and reactor structure consist of carbon and  graphite materials. The metal structure in the reactor is  designed not to exceed the maximum temperature of the materials.  This is accomplished by restricting the location of use, or by  introducing an insulating structure. Heat-resistant materials  used in the core section are limited to covering pipes for the  control rod, connecting rods, shock absorbers, etc. In general,  nickel-based alloys have high levels of heat and corrosion  resistance, but it has been discovered that they are sensitive  to the helium stiffening phenomenon, wherein He is created in  the structure by nuclear transformation reactions between  thermal neutrons and Ni or B. Therefore, an iron-based alloy,  800 H, has been used as a control rod structure material for the  HTTR.    When the HTTR is shut down, a two-step insertion method is  adopted: First, the reactor is made subcritical by inserting a  control rod into the relatively low-temperature reflector  domain. Second, the control rod is inserted to the fuel domain  after the core temperature is reduced to the designated  temperature. In this way, the temperature of the control rod  covering pipe is prevented from becoming too high. The  introduction of this method has made it possible to reduce the  temperature of the control rod covering pipe to about 400C  during ordinary operation. However, since the temperature of the  control rod covering pipe rises to 900C, and because  thermal stress is generated at the time of reactor scram, the  creep properties of alloy 800 H after neutron irradiation become  important.    Therefore, the creep rapture properties of alloy 800 H after  neutron irradiation were examined. For the HTTR, life time of  the control rod is designed to be five years, and the rod is to  be replaced when the temperature of the control rod covering  pipe exceeds 900C. (This occurs when a gas circulator of  the supplementary cooling facility fails to operate after  reactor scram due to a loss of commercial power.) Creep rapture  testing was implemented up to the maximum of 900C to  simulate irradiation of the material in real conditions  equivalent to the end of control rod life time (amount of  thermal neutron radiation: 2.3 x  10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]), and of the irradiation  material in accelerated conditions (amount of thermal neutron  radiation: 1.2 x 10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]). Figure II  (2)-10 illustrates the results of radiation testing designed to  simulate real conditions. Creep rapture life time of the  material after neutron irradiation proved to be 10-30 percent  that of the unradiated material. In this way, neutron radiation  reduces creep rapture life time, but creep rapture life time  after irradiation up to 1.2 x 10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]  is not significantly different from the data of irradiation to  2.3 x 10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] in Figure II (2)-10. In  other words, reduction of creep rapture life time by neutron  radiation is almost saturated at 2.3 x  10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/].       The effects of the simulated helium gas atmosphere of the  primary coolant, and the effects of its aging on the creep  properties of alloy 800 H, were examined using materials in the  absence of radiation. It was confirmed that the creep properties  of the alloy in the simulated helium gas atmosphere of the  primary coolant are not significantly different from those in  the ordinary atmosphere, and that the effects of aging could be  ignored within the range of assumed conditions of use due to the  fact that the control rod has a shorter designed life time than  the thermal heat exchangers. Based on these results, the design  allowance for the stress value was determined using data based  on atmospheric testing, of which there is a considerable body,  as well as from separate tests on the effects of neutron  irradiation.  <H3>  (3) Ultra-Heat-Resistant Alloy To Improve Intermediate Heat  Exchangers </H3>   One of the characteristics of the HTGR is that its nuclear  heat will be used directly in industrial processes. Therefore,  the higher the temperature of the helium gas extracted from the  reactor, the greater its industrial value. To achieve these  higher temperatures, it is necessary to further improve the  performance of the heat-resistance alloy used for the  high-temperature structure. The development of materials for the  high-temperature structure of high-temperature gas-cooled  reactors where the coolant temperatures reaches 1,000C at  the reactor exit began with a large project directed by the  Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry. This project,  entitled "Research and Development of Direct Iron-Making  Technology Using High-Temperature Reduced Gas," began in 1973,  and was completed in May 1981. The conclusion was that two types  of heat-resistant alloys, SSS 113 MA and KSN, which were capable  of achieving the goal of a creep rapture life time over 50,000  hours at 1,000C, were possible candidates for  ultra-heat-resistant alloys that could be used as  high-temperature structural materials for high-temperature  gas-cooled reactors where the coolant temperature reached  1,000C at the reactor exit.    It was decided that these results be adopted and further  developed by JAERI. Therefore, in 1982 JAERI established the  Ultra-Heat-Resistant Alloy Special Committee (led by Ryohei  Tanaka, Professor Emeritus of the Tokyo Institute of Technology)  consisting of experts from the industrial, governmental, and  academic sectors in Japan, and pursued ultra-heat-resistant  alloy development in consultation with the committee. In the  development program at JAERI, the methods of alloy development  were examined first. Because the two types of heat-resistant  alloys, SSS 113 MA and KSN, were both NiCrW-based alloys, it was  decided to pursue alloy development so as to improve corrosion  resistance and manufacturing capability as much as possible,  while increasing high-temperature durability, an advantage of  this type of alloy.    In the development of ultra-heat-resistant alloys, the major  specifications were set as follows:    [1] Creep rapture strength at 1,000C for 1 x  10[.sup]5[/] hours is to be 9.8 MPa (equivalent to or above  the development goal for AIST's large project plans).    [2] The level of internal oxidation and intergranular  corrosion is low after heat is applied at 1,000C for 1 x  10[.sup]5[/] hours in the standard helium gas simulating the  primary coolant in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors  (equivalent to or above hastelloy XR).    [3] Work on heat transmission pipes (external diameter of  32mm, thickness of 4-5mm, and length over 7 m) for heat  exchangers of the reactor is possible.    [4] Secondary working and welding needed to produce heat  exchangers can be done.    The goal of this development program was to develop  ultra-heat-resistant alloys that would satisfy such  specifications simultaneously, and in a balanced manner.    As the first step, because both SSS 113 MA and KSN have a  composition featuring a boundary where separation of the  _a_[.sup]2[/]-W phase occurs as illustrated in Figure II  (2)-11, an examination of the hot working conditions, tractive  characteristics, creep rapture characteristics, and corrosion  tolerance in the standard helium gas of alloys in this domain  was conducted to take advantage of this mechanism to improve  high-temperature strength by this separation. It was concluded,  as a result of this examination, that the optimum ratio for a  NiCrW composite was Ni-18-19 mass% Cr-20-22  mass%-W.       In the second step, hot working conditions, tractive  characteristics at the approximate time of aging, and creep  rapture characteristics of the alloy with this optimum NiCrW  composition, as well as the effects of additional accessory  elements such as C, Nb, Fe, Mn, Si, B, T, and Ti on corrosion in  the standard helium gas were examined systematically. Figure II  (2)-12 illustrates the relationship between the predicted creep  rapture strength, based on multiple regression analysis between  creep rapture strength and accessory elements, and extrapolated  values from the test data among other results obtained in this  examination process. Forecast values based on multiple  regression analysis test values coincided well for any  characteristics as in this example. Based on these results, the  chemical composition for the new alloy, whose high-temperature  strength and corrosion resistance would be improved by adding  small amounts of B and Y, was proposed. Figure II (2)-13  illustrates the characteristics of both the new alloy and the  conventional heat-resistant alloys in a semi-quantitative mode.  It clearly shows that the new alloy developed in this program  has well-balanced characteristics in terms of high-temperature  durability.          In the third step, this newly developed alloy was made on an  industrial scale (two tons), which was then used to produce  seamless pipes to be used as the heat transmission pipes of heat  exchangers on an experimental basis. It was confirmed that the  alloy had sufficient properties, in both hot and cold working  conditions, for the production of seamless pipes.    Current plans call for the energetic implementation of the  following tasks leading to the successful application of the new  alloy:    [1] Research for establishing welding technology, including  the development of filler metals.    [2] Evaluation of the various characteristics of base  materials and welding sections by tests conducted over long  periods of time.  <H5>  3. Low-Alloy Steel Materials for Pressure Vessels </H5>   Pressure-resistant low alloys are used for the coolant  pressure boundary (such as copper and pipes for pressure vessels  and intermediate heat exchangers), and for the core support  structure (such as support plates) (see Figure II (2)-1). This  section covers research and development efforts aimed at the  application of low-alloy steel to pressure vessels, which  requires the highest degree of reliability.  <H5>  (1) Use of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo Steel </H5>   The temperature of the pressure vessel of the HTTR is  400C during ordinary operation, and it is designed for  440C considering abnormal situations caused by transient  changes. Therefore, instead of using Mn-Mo-based SA 533 B steel,  2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo Steel (JIS SCMV 4-2 ASTMA 387 Gr.22) was adopted,  although it lacked a record of use in nuclear reactor vessels.    The design conditions for the pressure section of the HTTR  are a temperature of 440C, a pressure of about 4.75 MPa,  and a radiation level of 1 x 10[.sup]22[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E  &gt;  0.1 MeV). About 1 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours of operation are  planned. Because this steel has virtually no established track  record, it will be necessary how its brittleness characteristics  are affected by heat, stress, and radiation, as well as forecast  of material deterioration by evaluating such high-temperature  characteristics as fatigue.    Concerning the production of the material, the normalized  and  tempered steel (NT) used for the heat exchangers in fast-breeder  reactors and chemical plants was adopted instead of annealed  steel (AN), which was included in the ASME design code. This was  because (1) NT has good hardening properties, and the  normalizing and tempering process improves the designed stress  at high temperatures, and (2) it has a high level of tenacity at  room temperature or less. Based on the data about the  relationships among the various brittleness factors noted above  and the composition, the low-Si and high-purity NT steel was  considered appropriate. What was taken into consideration is the  following parameter of so-called temper brittleness:    J = (Si + Mn) (P + S) x 10[.sup]4[/] &lt; 100    Here, element symbols indicate mass%. It is noted  that not  only P and S, but also Si and Mn have large effects. An example  of the compositions of forged materials is presented in Table II  (2)-4.       Table II (2)-4.

With regard  to brittleness at high-temperatures, for instance, it was  confirmed that a sufficient level could be maintained after an  aging process at 450C for over 50,000 hours. Figure II  (2)-14 illustrates the effect of test temperature on Charpy  impact strength in the cases of isothermal aging, stress aging,  and step-cool processing simulating the temperature change for a  high-purity material (see Table II (2)-4) at 450C for up to  3,000 hours. The diagram indicates that both ductility  brittleness transient temperature and upper-shelf energy are not  affected by such processes.     <H5>  (3) Recent Research and Future Directions </H5>   Figure II (2)-15 illustrates the results of recent research  on the soundness of pressure vessels. The idea was to compare  the fracture toughness (J[.sup]IC[/]) of the welded metal,  the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and the base metal after  irradiation at 450C up to about 1 x  10[.sup]23[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E &gt;  1 MeV) against those not  subjected to irradiation. The results show that, although HAZ  shows the lowest J[.sup]IC[/] value before irradiation, there  is no difference among the welded metal, the heat-affected zone,  and the base metal after irradiation.       Figure II (2)-16 illustrates the interrelationship between  irradiation embrittlement and thermal embrittlement. In the  diagram, the vertical axis represents the J[.sup]IC[/] value,  J[.sup]iep[/] (J value at the start of cracking by the  potentiometric method), T[.sup]mat[/] (tearing modulus), and  variation by upper-shelf energy (USE) radiation as functions of  irradiation temperature. White symbols in the diagram indicate  samples subjected to thermal aging for 10,000 hours at  450C. Reduction rates for the values mentioned above become  smaller for temperatures up to 350C, but they become larger  at higher temperatures. The trends below 350C are believed  to correspond to a reduction of radiation hardening as a result  of increases in the irradiation temperature.       In addition to the efforts described above, research to  evaluate the strength, tenacity, and ductility-brashiness  transient properties using micro-test-piece technology, and  electrochemical methods, have been conducted as part of the  overall program of research and development of an evaluation  technology for material deterioration.</p>

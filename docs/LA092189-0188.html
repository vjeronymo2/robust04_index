			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY DEBT IS CASTING SHADOW OVER BREWER  </P> <P> Analysts paint a bleak future for G. Heileman Brewing Co., the nation's  fifth-largest brewer and a big holding in the troubled empire of Australian  industrialist Alan Bond.  </P> <P> Bond on Tuesday unveiled a complex series of corporate maneuvers, including the  planned sale of half his Australian brewery holdings, aimed at dealing with  problems posed by the reported $4.6-billion debt that he ran up building a  brewing, natural resources and media empire.  </P> <P> One major holding is Heileman, which Bond acquired in 1987 for about $1.3  billion. In announcing his plans, Bond deferred for 12 months any decision to  part with Heileman, a sale that analysts said could end up being unprofitable.  </P> <P> While the overall beer market has stagnated, Heileman's share has eroded,  falling from a high of 9.4% in 1983 to its current 7%. Industry observers say  Heileman was worth far less than $1.3 billion when Bond bought it, and he will  have a hard time fetching that price now.  </P> <P> "You're not getting anyone to pay $1.3 billion for the breweries," said Ben  Steinman, associate publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry  newsletter.  </P> <P> "The question is whether you operate it and bleed a little or take a big hit  and move on," said John Collopy, an industry analyst and chairman of the  Milwaukee investment firm Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp; Collopy Inc.  </P> <P> Analysts point out that sales for Heileman -- whose brands include Old Style,  Lone Star, Special Export and Colt 45 malt liquor -- started to slip before  Bond acquired it but that former Chairman Russell Cleary had been able to keep  the company efficient and profitable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discouraged by Problems  </P> <P> "His helmsmanship helped hold it together better than anyone could," said  Collopy. "When you lose that, the underlying softness got exaggerated."  </P> <P> Cleary, who built the company into a national power through a series of  acquisitions, says he is discouraged by the troubles that Heileman has  encountered since the Bond buyout.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate," Cleary said in a telephone interview.  </P></p>

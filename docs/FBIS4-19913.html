			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The German-Dutch Corps will be  established in The Hague on Friday [22 April] as the first joint  military unit of the two countries. Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and his Dutch counterpart  Relus ter Beek will sign the agreement, the FRG Defense Ministry  announced on Thursday [21 April] in Bonn. The corps will  probably comprise between 50,000 and 70,000 soldiers.    The corps will be commanded by a joint corps staff in  Muenster. Full combat readiness is to be reached in 1995. The  first commander will be Dutch Major General Ruurd Reitsma. The  first such unit to be established was the German-French corps,  which was later supplemented by Belgian units.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / German Federal Elections (October 16): Red Socks aim to get a foot in the German parliament's door - A look the poll prospects of the east's ex-communists Mrs Herta Plache had just started on her 3,560th tiny red woollen sock, the symbol - and the nickname - of Germany's Party for Democratic Socialism (PDS). The successor to east Germany's former communist party has become the repository for many east Germans' hopes. Still more important, it could end up holding the balance of power in the Bundestag after October's general election. Mrs Plache, 83, knits six socks a day. Then she gives them to Neues Deutschland, once east Germany's communist party daily newspaper and now the region's main left-wing daily, with a circulation of 135,000 copies. 'The paper sells the socks to PDS supporters,' she says, sitting in her small apartment in east Berlin. 'I've been doing it since 1990. It is my small contribution to the PDS.' She is one of the 130,000 paid-up PDS members in eastern Germany who hope the party will win at least three seats, the minimum required to enter the Bundestag in October. That prospect is being taken seriously in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl sees the PDS as the bogeyman of the election. His party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and its senior coalition partner, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), have issued constant warnings about the return of the communist threat in the guise of the Rote Socken - the red socks. Mrs Plache claims the established political parties in Bonn 'are doing everything in their power to discredit us. They accuse us of wanting a return to the old communist system. This is not true'. Criticism of the PDS intensified after the elections in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt last June when, after winning 20 per cent of the vote, the party lent its support to a minority Social Democratic/Green coalition and ousted the CDU. If it wins seats in parliament, this episode shows how the party could play a pivotal role in helping determine who will govern in Bonn. Recent opinion polls give the CDU a lead of 9 percentage points over the Social Democrats (SPD), but it is taking no chances. The party's main concern is that support for the PDS could usher in an SPD/Green coalition on the Saxony-Anhalt model by helping to dislodge CDU governments in forthcoming state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The SPD and the Greens repeated yesterday that they would not form a minority government tolerated by the PDS even if such a coalition would let them oust Mr Kohl in October. Yet the possibility that this outcome could emerge has become one of the main political talking points in Germany. In pre-election jousting in east germany, one of the PDS's main advantages is that it inherited the old party structures of the former communists, or Socialist Unity party (SED), and some of the membership. 'Our strength lies in our grassroots organisation,' says Mr Lothar Bisky, a leading member. Ninety per cent of all PDS members are former SED card-carriers. However, more than two-thirds of members are over the age of 60. Reflecting their long-term contacts with the regions in which they are based, most PDS activists are well-known locally. By contrast, many CDU and SPD activists, originally sent into eastern Germany to build up local organisations, have since returned to the west, leaving the local parties in disarray. 'The service the PDS provides is invaluable and we all know them,' said Mrs Plache. 'They help me fill out the endless bureaucratic forms. . . . Above all, they protect our interests.' In east Berlin, for example, the PDS has campaigned against a decision by the cash-strapped government of Berlin to scrap public transport subsidies for pensioners. 'None of the other parties bothered to help save this cheap travel for us. They don't understand our problems,' added Mrs Plache. Her monthly rent of DM646 (Pounds 271) - DM98 before unification - swallows up two-thirds of her monthly pension. Representing the interests of the east Germans is one of the main planks of the PDS election campaign. Mr Otto Theel, elected mayor of Neuruppin in Brandenburg last December, says he won because 'I am one of them. I understood their problems thrown up by unification'. He believes west German politicians do not understand the difficulties caused for east Germans by higher rents, privatisation of the housing stock, or the closure of local child care centres. Many politicians from the established German parties believe the PDS represents the voice of the disaffected, and hope it will disappear once a self-sustaining economic upswing materialises in the east. However, a study by Berlin's Free University indicates that this protest vote may be around for some time. Many PDS members who are on low incomes or unemployed, or have taken early retirement, are likely to remain dissatisfied with post-unity conditions for a lengthy period. Mr Gregor Gysi, one of the party's leading members, wants to transform it into a modern social democratic party to represent the east German population who feel they have no voice in united Germany. It will not be an easy task. The PDS is far from a monolithic, disciplined party of the old SED days. The grassroots comprise the Communist Platform splinter group, die-hard Marxists who reject the capitalist system, and which in turn provide easy prey for CDU's attacks on the party. Mr Gysi cannot yet rein in this section of the party - he needs them to help organise locally. The outcome of the federal elections might give him the chance to modernise it. 'If we get our three seats in the Bundestag, it will give us the clout and the authority to help us redefine the future direction of the PDS,' says Mr Bisky. 'The end of the cold war does not mean the end of the left here, or in eastern Europe, as recent elections in Poland and Hungary have shown. Maybe Bonn would wish otherwise. But the trends in post-communist countries suggest that voters want a stake in the changes brought about by the collapse of the communist era. Above all they want a voice to represent their interests. I hope the PDS is that voice.'</p>

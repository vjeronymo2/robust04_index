			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, April 21 (AFP) -- The attorney general of  Burundi was shot and killed overnight Wednesday [20 April] on  the outskirts of the capital, officials said Thursday.    Nathan-Audance Nibaruta was killed in Kamenge, an area where  armed residents have engaged the army in gunbattles that  continued Thursday.    It was not clear how he died. Some sources said he was  caught in a crossfire, while other sources within the military  said he had taken the side of the armed civilians and opened  fire on soldiers.    The presidents of Burundi and Rwanda were killed in a plane  crash on April 6. Rwanda exploded in ethnic bloodletting, but  Burundi has remained largely calm despite having the same  rivalry between the same two tribes.    The interim Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya met  with civil and military authorities to discuss how to end the  violence in Kamenge.    "All the rest of the country is calm," he said.</p>

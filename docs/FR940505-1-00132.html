			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) Authority. As explained above, in promulgating a FIP under section 110 (c) of the Act, EPA may take any actions that the state could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take. As section 209 of the CAA provides that California is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preempted from adopting and implementing a motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions control program provided its program satisfies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria of section 209(b), EPA believes that it, acting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behalf of California in the context of a FIP, may adopt a motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle program or supplement California's own motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program provided that EPA's actions would satisfy the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 209(b) for a waiver of Federal preemption. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it, acting on behalf of California in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context of a FIP, may adopt a nonroad engine program or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement California's nonroad engine program provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's actions satisfy the criteria of section 209(e)(2) for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver of Federal preemption and provided that the program does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not establish emission standards or accompanying enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for any new nonroad engines that California, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 209(e)(1) is precluded from regulating (i.e., new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locomotive and new engines used in locomotives and new engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in construction equipment or vehicles or used in farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment or vehicles and which are smaller than 175  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horsepower). Section 209 provides that EPA is to grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California a waiver of preemption if the State determines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its standards ``will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 209 further provides that no waiver or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization is to be granted if EPA finds that: (A) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of the State that the standards are, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as otherwise applicable Federal standards is arbitrary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capricious; (B) State standards are not needed to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling and extraordinary conditions; or (C) the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with section 202(a) (or are not consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 209, as is the case of nonroad engines under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 209(e)). EPA has interpreted the consistency criterion as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning that California standards and accompanying enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures must be technologically feasible within the leadtime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided, taking into account the cost of compliance, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they not impose inconsistent certification test procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements such that the same vehicle or engine could not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to comply with both State and Federal certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the on-highway and nonroad motorcycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program that would be applicable to vehicles and engines in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California under the proposed FIP would satisfy the section 209  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver criteria. Thus, California could undertake the on-highway and nonroad motorcycle program described above, and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, EPA has authority under section 110(c) to undertake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the protectiveness of the standards, all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standards are at least as protective as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise applicable Federal standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the need to meet compelling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary conditions, EPA has repeatedly found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's air quality problems satisfy the need criterion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 209. Moreover, the magnitude of the reductions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions needed to reach attainment in the FIP areas, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile source emissions, provides ample evidence of the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent motor vehicle emission standards in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, with respect to the criterion of consistency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 202(a) or section 209, EPA believes that its proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced nonroad program is consistent with both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological feasibility and certification elements of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion. EPA believes that the various elements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program are technologically feasible within the leadtime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided, taking into account the cost of compliance. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no aspect of the program establishes any new certification test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that are inconsistent with either existing Federal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California test procedure requirements. Consequently, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that its proposed on-highway and nonroad motorcycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program satisfies this prong of section 209 as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as none of the classes of nonroad equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is regulating under this program are new farm or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction equipment or new locomotives, this program meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of section 209(e)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Fee on Marine Pleasure Craft. Although the new national emission standards for spark ignition engines in marine pleasure craft described above will result in substantial emissions reductions per engine, overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in emissions from this category will depend primarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the amount of fleet turnover after the new standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced. Under conditions of normal turnover, EPA expects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that approximately one half of the total fleet of marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pleasure craft will meet the new standard by 2005. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even normal turnover may not result in enough emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accomplish the goals of this FIP. EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional measures are needed to strongly encourage the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only cleaner engines in the FIP areas. Therefore, EPA proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require that all owners of marine pleasure craft with spark  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignition engines obtain an emission permit before operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their boats in the FIP areas during each area's ozone season  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning in 2004.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

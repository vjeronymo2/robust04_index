			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Cleaning out If Kevin Maxwell really wanted a cheap bolt-hole, surely he could have done better than hide in what old City hands know as 'The Wardrobe'. After all, Wardrobe Place in the shadow of St Paul's Cathedral is not only a mere quarter mile away from where the missing millions were last seen, but an obvious resting place for fringe operators. Until the current property bust, it was about the only bit of the City left that was convenient, cheap and undeveloped. In the past it has been the home of slick PR operators like John Addey, and fringe financial operators such as LHW Futures which achieved notoriety in the mid-1980s for its hard-sell tactics and unusually high commission charges. If Maxwell should move out then 'The Wardrobe' will be virtually empty. However, this is unlikely to cause much heartache in the boardroom of Warnford Investments which owns most of the surrounding property, although not Number 2 itself. Headed by 81-year-old George Ross Goobey, one of the City's wisest old birds, Warnford is an unusual property company. It slept whilst its rivals developed, with the result that it has been able to increase its profits and its dividends last year.</p>

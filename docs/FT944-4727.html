			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Proud of a little nightcap Sir, With reference to 'Phantom extras on hotel bills' in your Letters column (December 1), it is not only when in Sofia that Ms Abdela needs to keep her wits about her. Not so long ago after dining alone in a London West End hotel, I was presented with, but did not settle, a bill for the meal and 64 drinks. I have to admit being flattered at their idea of my capacity. TC Hill, 55 Broome Road, Billericay, Essex, CM11 1ES</p>

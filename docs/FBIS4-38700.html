			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Abrosimov] </F>   [Text] Sofia June 1 TASS -- The NATO "Partnership for  Peace" plan should be signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin  who is also the commander-in-chief of the national armed forces,  but the country should not commit itself to signing the plan by  a fixed date, according to Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian  Security Council, who is currently on a visit to Bulgaria.    "There should be no haste in signing the `Partnership for  Peace'. The Russian (military) might is comparable to that of  NATO. We have first to understand what partnership we are being  offered. It is inappropriate to commit ourselves to putting the  signature by a fixed date because the talk is about a very  important issue," he told TASS on Wednesday adding that "when  time comes" the document should be signed by the Russian  president.    Lobov stressed that the issue also depends on the NATO  leadership, which has received Russian proposals on joining the  organisation. "NATO has to voice its attitude towards them", he  said.    "Russia has expressed its principled position -- it is for  partnership. As far as concrete questions are concerned, such  as armaments, the creation of corresponding structures and so  on, their consideration needs time", Lobov said, and added that  the Russian Security Council will discuss the results of the  consideration. The top Russian security body has not yet voiced  its point of view as the decision is currently being drafted, he  explained.    He denied mass media allegations that the Security Council  is  not engaged in discussing the prospects of Russia's joining the  "Partnership for Peace" plan. Lobov recalled that the Council  includes the president, the defence, foreign and interior  ministers, i.e. people who design the policy in this aspect.    Lobov is not confused by the fact that those people often  voice different opinions on the question. "Each of them can have  his own approach to the problem at the initial stage. Nuances  in viewpoints of Security Council members should not be assessed  as contradictions", he said, adding that the Security Council is  a body where various opinions are discussed in order to arrive  to the final conclusion.</p>

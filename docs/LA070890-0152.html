			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN HOSTAGE TO BE FREED SOON, SOURCES SAY;  </P> <P> LEBANON: SPECULATION CENTERS ON ANGLICAN ENVOY TERRY WAITE OR IRISHMAN BRIAN  KEENAN.  </P> <P> A Western hostage held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalist groups  may soon be freed, Iran's official news agency and Middle East sources said  Saturday.  </P> <P> The Islamic Republic News Agency did not identify which of the 16 Western  hostages would be let go, but Damascus-based diplomatic sources said it would  likely be Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, while a source in Beirut said it  may be Irishman Brian Keenan.  </P> <P> The Damascus sources said Waite's church has extended significant aid to the  victims of last month's earthquake in Iran, which killed an estimated 40,000  people. A spokesman for the Church of England in London would not put a dollar  amount on the aid, which he said had been channeled through a handful of  private agencies.  </P> <P> Ireland, meanwhile, has attempted in recent months to forge stronger ties with  Iran, and three Irish senators visited Tehran a week ago to appeal for Keenan's  release.  </P> <P> IRNA quoted well-informed sources in Beirut as saying that the Western hostage  to be released will probably be a European.  </P> <P> Ten Europeans and six Americans are still held in Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite  Muslim groups, which have demanded the release of Shiite prisoners held in  Israel and other concessions.  </P> <P> Iran has maintained publicly that it is not connected with the fundamentalist  groups but is widely believed to have considerable influence with the  kidnapers.  </P> <P> Well-connected Middle East sources confirmed the IRNA report.  </P> <P> "An announcement to this effect would probably be made in Beirut within the  next two days," a Damascus-based Iranian source said.  </P> <P> Waite was abducted in West Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while attempting to  negotiate the release of other hostages.  </P> <P> Keenan, a Belfast native who holds dual Irish and British citizenship, was an  English teacher at the American University of Beirut when he was abducted April  11, 1986, on his way to work.  </P></p>

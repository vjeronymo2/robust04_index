			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The Mozambican  Committee for Friendship With the People of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in a recent statement strongly  demanded that the United States thoroughly implement the agreed  conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact. The statement  expressed joy over an affirmative agreement at a recent  DPRK-U.S. contact.    Noting that the United States has continued to aggravate the  situation on the Korean peninsula, it said that the point is  what stand and attitude the United States takes to implement the  agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in the  future.    The statement said:    If the United States sincerely implement the agreed  conclusions, a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula would be smooth, and if the United States do  not implement what it should do under an unreasonable pretext,  it would be complicated.    The United States, which is directly responsible for a  peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,  must no longer disgrace itself.</p>

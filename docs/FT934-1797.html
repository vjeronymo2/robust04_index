			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Japanese money supply rise lower than expected at 1.5% Money supply in Japan expanded by a slower than expected 1.5 per cent in November, compared with a year earlier, indicating that business activity in the country remains sluggish and that the economy appears to have turned down during the past two months. The average balance of M2 plus certificates of deposit had grown by 1.8 per cent in October, and the Bank of Japan was hoping that the November rate would at least equal that figure. Japan's industrial production index for October was revised down yesterday by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which said the fall in production was 5.5 per cent against a month earlier, down from a provisional decrease of 5.1 per cent. The decline in the shipment index was also revised from 5.6 per cent to 6.0 per cent, while the inventory index was said to have fallen by 0.5 per cent, instead of the provisionally reported 0.4 per cent. Gathering signs that the economy is weakening are increasing pressure on the coalition government to announce another package of stimulatory measures in coming weeks. However, the finance ministry has opposed the suggestion, insisting that the country cannot afford another package and that the economy is on course for recovery sometime next year. The Japan Iron and Steel Federation gave an indication of the difficulties ahead by forecasting that steel production in the year from April is likely to slip to between 90m and 92m tonnes, the lowest level since 1970, and a sharp fall from the 96.5m tonnes which is expected this year. Steel companies expect demand to remain weak from core customers, including the automotive and construction industries, but based their forecast on the understanding that Japan's economy would expand next year by 0.5 per cent, a relatively optimistic target.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / People: Computer Users' Associations The task of a Computer Users' Association has changed as the computer industry itself has changed. There is less need to act as a forum for aggrieved customers; the associations act now more as mediators between the plethora of industry lobbies and standards organisations. The ICL CUA realised earlier this year that it needed to present a more forceful image; for the first time it has appointed a full-time national officer in the shape of Derek Cripps . Hailing from South Wales, Cripps, 54, is well qualified for the part in two ways; he was a member of the ICL CUA in an early incarnation as a dp in the construction industry and for 17 years was an ICL employee. He is anxious to increase membership and to see members getting greater value from the association. In particular, he wants a stronger user voice in industry concerns. In these roles he should benefit from his background in marketing and sales. Cripps is well aware of the paradox that CUAs - which are supposed to be champions of the customer - are more often than not funded by manufacturers, thus casting doubt on their independence and efficiency as a watchdog. He argues, however, that the CUA is not controlled by ICL and that it forms an effective interface between the company and its customers.</p>

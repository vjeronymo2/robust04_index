			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian national  press today leads with reports about the signing by Russian  Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev in Brussels of the  Partnership for Peace framework document and of the bilateral  protocol "Russia and NATO".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says in its comment on the event that it  took place, symbolically, on June 22, the anniversary of the  beginning of the Great Patriotic War which resulted in the split  of the world into two opposing camps. By becoming the West's  partner in European and global security, Russia cleared yet  another barrier on its way to the civilised world community".    "Moscow has secured a special relationship with the West,"  according to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. In its analysis of the  documents signed by the Russian minister of foreign affairs, the  newspaper says: "It appears that the key phrase of the  (Russia-NATO) protocol is "Russia and NATO agree to prepare an  extensive individual programme of partnership which is in line  with Russia's size, significance and potential". This means  that Moscow has finally got what it wanted and NATO has  recognised Russia's "special status".    TRUD stresses that "the move enables this country to take a  more active part in European affairs, including defence. By  joining the Partnership for Peace programme, Russia avoided the  danger of finding itself in a sort of isolation from the further  development of military and political cooperation on the  European continent".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes: "The most important thing is that  the  realisation of the Partnership for Peace programme will bridge  for Russia and NATO the gap which separated Europe a few years  ago. Another bridge will be provided by the agreement on  partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European  Union, which President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation  is due to sign on the Greek island of Corfu, where a summit of  the European Union member countries will take place on June 24.  When the agreement takes effect, it will open up a new, much  more extensive potential for cooperation between Russia and the  European Union in the economic and political fields.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- A gunman threatened  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [30 May] with  a shot at the ceiling of a Tokyo hotel in what he called a show  of protest against Hosokawa's past remarks on World War II and  economic policies, police said. [passage omitted]    The last known rightist attack on a politician came in March  1992 when a shot was fired at Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced  kingmaker of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding  his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile  coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the  LDP.    He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at  his Karuizawa retreat and at Tokyo hotels.</p>

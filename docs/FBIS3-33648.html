During the meeting a discussion took  place covering the latest developments in the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiating process and the deadlock it has  reached as a result of the obstacles placed by Israel in the way  of implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles agreement.    Brother President Abu-'Ammar has sent an appeal to U.S.  President Bill Clinton asking him to intervene, as the agreement  was reached under his auspices. Brother President Abu-'Ammar  also asked for the intervention of the United States in its  capacity as one of the two co-chairmen of the peace talks, in  order to overcome the deadlock in the negotiations and attain  the accurate and faithful implementation of the provisions that  were approved in Washington.

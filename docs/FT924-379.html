			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Cookery: How ideas sprout MOST COOKS have decided on, and ordered, their Christmas and New Year meats by now. But what about the vegetables? In some households, roast potatoes, chestnuts and Brussels sprouts are sacrosanct. Others think that roast potatoes, if they are to be as crisp and crunchy as they should be, need a higher oven temperature than will suit a goose or turkey. Besides, mashed potatoes are much better than roast for sopping up good gravy. Many consider roasting and peeling chestnuts too lengthy a task for Christmas day - and frozen or canned chestnuts, although acceptable in casseroles and puddings, are not good enough to partner the bird. As for the sprouts, there are those who believe they are one of the worst things to have come out of Brussels. Here are some alternative vegetable suggestions for Christmas day and to serve later with cold poultry or spiced beef, ham and tongue. BRAISED FENNEL WITH WALNUTS Trim 3lb fennel in the usual way. Cut each bulb into 6-8 wedges, slicing vertically through the core to keep the wedges in good shape. Put them into a shallow dish, buttered very thickly. Season, sprinkle with  1/2 teaspoon or more crushed fennel seed, add a squeeze of lemon and dot with 1 1/2 oz butter. Bake at 375`F-400`F/190`C-200``C (gas mark 5-6) for 40-45 minutes, basting the fennel at half-time. Then unveil the vegetables, baste again and cook for 10 minutes more, adding a handful of chopped walnuts for the final five minutes to toast the nuts nicely. RED CABBAGE WITH PLUMS Red cabbage is that rare and blessed thing: a vegetable dish that is almost better re-heated than cooked freshly. Grease a casserole with goose, duck or bacon fat or butter it well. Add around 2 1/4 lb shredded red cabbage. Stone  1/4 lb prunes (no need to soak them), chop them, and mix them into the cabbage together with 3 tablespoons damson jam or jelly, 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, some salt, pepper and bruised caraway seed ( 1/2 -1 teaspoon depending on your fondness for the spice). Cumin and coriander seed make good alternatives. Cover tightly and cook at 300`F-330`F/150`C-170`C (gas mark 2-3 1/2 ) for 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. SALSIFY GRATIN Scorzonera is equally suitable for this treatment and all the preparations can be done ahead. Choose long, thick roots with undamaged skins and a little stalk attached. Scrub 1 1/2 lb of them and cook them whole in salted water until just tender (10-20 minutes). Plunge in cold water to arrest cooking, peel, chop into short lengths and lay the roots in a gratin dish with a scattering of parsley. Pour over them a bechamel sauce made with 2 tablespoons each butter and flour,  1/2 pt milk or stock,  1/4 pt thick cream and a seasoning of pepper and grated Parmesan, or anchovy essence and lemon juice. To re-heat for serving, slip the covered dish into an oven heated to 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6) for around 15 minutes until bubbling. Scatter with toasted or fried crumbs just before bringing the dish to table. CARROTS NIVERNAISE Chop 2 large onions. Cook them in 1 1/2 oz butter until soft and beginning to colour. Add 2 lb carrots which have been sliced, or cut into sticks and blanched briefly in fast-boiling water. Stir to anoint the carrots with fat. Pour on a little stock. Bring to the boil, add a pinch of sugar, cover and simmer very gently, shaking the pan every now and then to encourage even cooking. When the carrots are cooked to your liking, add a knob of butter, a few spoonfuls of chopped parsley, a little salt and some pepper. Turn up the heat and drive off surplus liquid so that the carrots end up coated lightly with a syrupy sauce. CHICORY A LA CREME Cut 1 1/2 lb chicory lengthways into quarters or one-sixths depending on the girth of the chicons. Lay them in a shallow, buttered dish that will take the whole lot in two layers, and sprinkle with a little sea salt and plenty of pepper. Pour on 7-8 fl oz thick cream and put the dish onto the bottom shelf of a cold oven, placing on the shelf immediately above it some other foods to be cooked or, failing that, a baking tray. The idea is to allow some evaporation of the vegetable juices, yet to offer some protection against a fierce downblast of heat from the roof of the oven. Turn the oven on to 375`F/190`C (gas mark 5) and bake for 60-70 minutes until the chicory is tender, basting now and then. Stir a heaped teaspoon of mustard into the creamy sauce and scatter an ounce or two of grated or finely slivered St Paulin or Morbier cheese over the chicory. Turn off the heat and return the dish to the oven for 5-10 minutes until the cheese is molten. This rich dish goes well with cold roast turkey or ham.</p>

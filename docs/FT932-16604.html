			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Observer: Big blue chipped As Louis Gerstner goes through the gates of IBM headquarters in Armonk, NY, other senior managers will be heading in the opposite direction. First to go was Mary Lee Turner, vice-president of communications, who had reported directly to John Akers, Gerstner's predecessor. Turner, who comes from the 'no comment' school of press relations, retired after 26 years at IBM. No surprise, then, that no reason was given for her departure.</p>

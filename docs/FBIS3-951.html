After the signing of this document,  it was time for the reading of the summit's communique issued at  the end of this 29th UDEAC summit of heads of state. It was  read by UDEAC Secretary General Thomas Dakayi Kamga:    [Begin Kamga recording] The 29th regular summit of UDEAC  heads of state, as scheduled in December 1993 was held in  Ndjamena, capital of the Republic of Chad, on 15 and 16 March  1994, under the chairmanship of His Excellency Colonel Idriss  Deby, president of the Republic of Chad, current chairman of  UDEAC Council of Heads of State. Those who participated in the  summit were: His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, president of the  Gabonese Republic; His Excellency Professor Pascal Lissouba,  president of the Republic of Congo; His Excellency Ange Felix  Patasse, president of the Central African Republic; His  Excellency Anatolio Ndong Mba, deputy prime minister,  representing the president of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea;  and His Excellency (Luc Ayan), president of the Economic and  Social Council, representing the president of the Republic of  Cameroon.    Following their informal Libreville summit relating to the  setting up of an economic and monetary community of Central  Africa, with a view to giving a new impetus to the subregional  integration process, the UDEAC Council of Heads of State has  decided to officially launch CEMAC by signing today the treaty  instituting this organization. The main mission of this  organization is to promote the harmonious development of member  states, within the framework of the establishment of two unions,  namely the Economic Union of Central Africa, in abbreviation  UEAC, and the Monetary Union of Central Africa, UMAC. In each of  the two fields, member states intend to promote the already  existing cooperation between them to the status of a union to  achieve the process for economic and monetary integration.    Concerning agreements on UEAC and UMAC, the heads of state  decided to set up a committee of plenipotentiaries composed of  the ministers in charge of economic development problems,  finance, external relations, justice, the UDEAC secretary  general, and the governor of the Central Bank of Central African  States [BEAC], both of whom will be rapporteurs to the committee  of plenipotentiaries. This committee is assisted by a group of  experts to be named by it. It can call on, at any time, any  external person, in view of the competence of that person.  While awaiting the establishment of these new bodies, the heads  of state decided to settle all or part of arrears owed the UDEAC  general secretariat. They called on the staff to resume work  immediately.    The heads of state exchanged views on the economic situation  of the subregion since the devaluation of the CFA franc and  reaffirmed their desire to make coherent their economic  policies. For this purpose, they reviewed a number of projects  on integration, in the areas of land, river, and air transport,  and with the aim of easing the landlocked conditions of some  member states. They also reviewed projects in the areas of  electric power, fishery, and animal breeding, strengthening  trade exchange between UDEAC member states, in particular, the  assessment and management of human resources, the handling of  science and technology in order to introduce innovation as a  dynamic factor of development, as well as the fight against  desertification. To this end, they authorized the secretary  general and BEAC governor to expand studies as soon as possible.    The heads of state have decided to summon a top-level  meeting  of the CEMAC after all member countries must have concluded  their programs with the IMF. This meeting, to be attended by  all financial backers, will assess the compensation measures  following the devaluation and ways of revamping the economies of  the subregion. [passage omitted]    The term of office of the UDEAC deputy secretary general  having come to its end, the president of the Gabonese Republic  will propose another candidate for this post. The Council of  Heads of State congratulated Mr. Ambroise Ndoyi Bongo for the  work done during nine years in the service of the Union and  wishes him courage in his future duties. [passage omitted]    The heads of state made it a point to thank warmly their  peer, President Idriss Deby, the Government of Chad, the Chadian  people in general, and the people of Ndjamena in particular, for  the brotherly welcome and the African hospitality given them and  their delegations during their stay. For 1994, the chairmanship  of the UDEAC Council of States 1994 will be assumed by His  Excellency Paul Biya, president of the Republic of Cameroon.  The next regular meeting of the Council of Heads of State will  be held in Yaounde in December 1994.    Issued in Ndjamena on 16 March 1994. Thank you. [end  recording]</p>

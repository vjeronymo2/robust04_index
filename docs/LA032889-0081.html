			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE FILED IN BOY'S HIT-AND-RUN DEATH  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office Monday filed felony hit-and-run  and manslaughter charges against a Santa Ana man in connection with the death  of a 7-year-old Anaheim boy.  </P> <P> Police said Miguel Guerrero, 27, was driving a 1970 Chevrolet Nova from the  scene of a brawl March 11 when he hit the boy, Victor Magana, in an alley near  an apartment complex in the 1600 block of South Jeffrey Drive.  </P> <P> Police said Guerrero was arrested Friday and taken to Orange County Jail, where  he is being held in lieu of $25,000 bail. Police did not release many details  about the investigation or arrest, but said Guerrero was arrested without  incident at his business in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "Our investigation placed him behind the wheel of the car," Anaheim Police  Officer Clint Melberg said.  </P> <P> Police spent almost a week searching for leads in the case before they found  the Nova -- with license plate 322 ADX -- on Los Flores Street in Fountain  Valley. But they were unable to locate a suspect until Friday.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that two men had been fighting in a narrow alleyway  behind South Jeffrey Drive about 4 p.m. March 11.  </P> <P> One of the men, who appeared to be drunk, jumped into the Nova, police said. He  drove down the alley, striking two metal posts and a garage door before hitting  Victor, who was watching the fight. The driver did not stop, and Victor died an  hour later at a local hospital.  </P> <P> Victor lived with his parents, Celia and Guadalupe Magana, and four brothers  and sisters.  </P> <P> His parents moved to the United States in 1979 from their native state in  Michoacan, Mexico. The family had lived in the apartment complex just a block  west of the Disneyland Hotel for 3 years.  </P> <P> Guerrero's pretrial hearing is scheduled Wednesday in Municipal Court,  Fullerton.  </P></p>

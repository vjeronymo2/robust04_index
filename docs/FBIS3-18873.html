			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said  that the Cyprus Government is evaluating the UN secretary  general's report, the first part of which describes the  developments since his last report, issued on 22 November 1993.  In the second part of his report, Kasoulidhis added, the  secretary general proceeds with an analysis of the problems that  have arisen and the key points of which should be agreed upon by  both sides, as they constitute the substance of the current  phase of the proximity talks on the confidence-building  measures. The government spokesman said that the UN  Secretariat's approach is evident on some issues. Our side, has  outlined its views, he continued, and it reserves the right to  agree or disagree at the negotiating table. Kasoulidhis said  that in the third part of the report the UN secretary general  presents some notes related with the way the proximity talks  will proceed starting tomorrow, the logical timeframe for  expanding the talks, and the importance he attaches to the  prospect of concluding an agreement, or not.    Asked to comment on an observation that the secretary  general's report takes a clear stance on issues about which our  side has expressed disagreement, especially on the issues of  turning over sovereignty over Nicosia International Airport and  free use of it by Turkish Cypriots with their own travel  documents, the spokesman said that he can not comment on issues  under discussion at the negotiating table. Kasoulidhis added  that our side sees in the report some approaches by the  secretary general that are closer to our side and others that  differ from our side's positions. Replying to a question, the  spokesman said setting the end of March as the timeframe is  reasonable to reach agreements on the seven major issues.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Austrian group aims to raise Sch3bn Mayr-Melnhof (MM), a family owned Austrian company and one of Europe's leading carton and packaging companies, plans to raise about Sch3bn (Dollars 250m) through a share issue early in the spring, Mr Michael Groller, chief board executive, said yesterday. The Mayr-Melnhof family will keep a two-thirds stake after the flotation which is expected to take place in April with Morgan Stanley as international lead managers and Creditanstalt Bankverein, the Austrian bank, as domestic managers. The shares will be offered to investors in western Europe and the US, and will be listed on the Vienna Borse. The proceeds will finance acquisitions in Europe. 'The industry is going through a process of concentration. We have two options. We can either be a local niche producer or build up our strength in Europe,' said Mr Alfred Fogarassy, board member. Past acquisitions financed from own resources included the purchase in 1992 of Deeside Paperbox in Manchester, UK, and a 50 per cent stake in CP Schmidt Verpackungswerk of Germany. In addition to plants in Germany, the UK and Austria, MM also has subsidiaries in Switzerland, France, Italy and the Netherlands. MM's activities in eastern Europe are expected to grow as part of its strategy to supply multinational companies moving into new post-communist markets. MM has a plant in Hungary, and projects are planned for Poland and the Czech Republic. MM was founded 100 years ago, and is one of the world's leading cardboard manufacturers, producing carton board, folding cartons, and recycling waste paper. In 1992, it produced about 1m tonnes of carton board, giving it a 20 per cent share of the European market. Production of folding carton used primarily for packaging food, beverages, and other products such as washing powders, was about 100,000 tonnes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the LDDP Council Presidium and the LDDP Seimas </F> faction]    [Text] Recently, Lithuanian Center Union Chairman R.  Ozolas made several statements which, in our opinion,  deteriorate Lithuania's interstate relations, the development of  friendly ties with neighboring countries, and instigate ethnic  minorities residing in Lithuania.    The assessment of separate foreign ambassadors [reference to  Polish and Belarusian envoys] working in Lithuania is another  attempt to complicate our relations with neighbors, the process  of negotiations, and the signing of agreements on friendship and  cooperation.    The Presidium of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party  [LDDP]  Council and the LDDP Seimas [parliament] faction categorically  disagree with the moves of Seimas Deputy R. Ozolas. We believe  that such actions not only fail to protect the interests of the  state and the nation, as they are often interpreted, but are  even damaging to them. Nationalism and the scoring of  historical accounts are outdated matters in today's Europe,  impeding the construction of a common European home.</p>

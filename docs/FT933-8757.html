			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Shareholders face up to repercussions THE COLLAPSE in the equity of Ferruzzi Finanziaria is already having repercussions on some of its biggest shareholders. Mediobanca, the merchant bank leading the committee of Ferfin's biggest creditors, is most exposed. Its 3.5 per cent stake in Ferfin, valued at L123.3bn (Dollars 76m) at the end of last year, is now worth a fraction of that amount. Based on yesterday's official share price in Milan of L224.40, Mediobanca's holding is now worth little more than L9bn. Based on the proposed new nominal share price for Ferfin's for just L5 rather than L1,000 at present, the holding would be worth a meagre L204m. With the write-down imminent, even hardened analysts were unsure of the 'real' value of Ferfin with total borrowings of L28,838bn and losses of L1,165bn in the first five months of this year. Sai, a big insurance group, and Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, also face a collapse in the value of their Ferfin holdings. Sai owns 2.46 per cent, while Generali has 2.33 per cent. The stock market yesterday took some account of that, marking down the shares of all three of Ferfin's main shareholders. Mediobanca slipped almost 1 per cent to L16,129, while Generali fell by 0.78 per cent to L39,972 and Sai dropped 0.34 per cent to L22,892. Leading sufferers from the collapse in values are members of the Ferruzzi family, which owns about 48 per cent of Ferfin through the Serafino Ferruzzi family holding company. Their stake, formerly believed to be on the books at L1,690bn, is worth far less now. For many of the 49,000 small shareholders in Ferfin, seething at the plunge in the value of their holdings, the fact that the Ferruzzis have suffered the same fate is small recompense.</p>

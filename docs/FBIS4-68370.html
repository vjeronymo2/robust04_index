			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. Berzin, chairman of the Sverdlovsk Oblast </F> Government Committee for Relations with Public Organizations and  the Study of Public Opinion: "Poll: Which Way Will the Voters  Lean?"]    [Text] On 3-5 February the oblast government's Committee  for Relations with Public Organizations and the Study of Public  Opinion conducted an express poll of voters. The objective was  to reveal changes in the correlation of political forces that  have occurred since elections to the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly and to examine the overall situation in nine population  centers in the Central Urals. Participating in the poll were 904  people, selected to be representative in terms of sex, age,  educational level, social status, type of urban area and  geographical location. The poll's margin for error is three  percent.    For the past five years the public's social and  psychological  feelings and attitudes toward the changes taking place have been  conducted on a regular basis. During that period there has been  a drop in the number of people who are confirmed supporters of  radical economic reforms. Whereas in 1991 50 percent of those  surveyed supported such reforms, 27 percent were convinced of  the need for partial changes and only nine percent deemed it  possible to leave things as they were, in 1992, just three  months after the start of reforms, 19 percent of respondents  said that new opportunities were opening up for them, while 28  percent were ready to go back to the way things were before.    As of February 1994 the situation has to a certainly extent  stabilized for the time being, with a substantial number of  people -- 44 percent -- of the opinion that although they  personally have not gotten anything out of the reforms, they are  in fact essential to Russia. However, in comparison to 1992  there has been a decrease by a factor of three in the number of  respondents who feel that new opportunities have opened up to  them as a result of the economic changes, currently at six  percent. Today 33 percent feel that it would have been better  not to undertake reforms.    The adolescent type of emotional reactions so typical of the  mass mentality of Russia's people is also evidenced in the  correlation of political forces prior to elections to the oblast  duma and local governmental bodies. There has been an increase  in the number of voters who are willing as a sign of protest (or  perhaps in order to draw attention to their needs) to vote for  political parties and movements opposed to the president and the  government of the Russian Federation.    Survey data indicate that for many people that protest is a  subconscious reaction to the events occurring in their lives and  does not indicate an increase in the number of confirmed  opponents of radical economic reform in our oblast. On the other  hand, it is precisely at the level of the common, mass mentality  that the prerequisites for the creation of a social base for  emerging parties and social movements are created.    According to the survey data, prior to the start of the  active electoral campaign the public's pre-election sentiments  are as follows.    Of those surveyed, 25 percent are prepared to vote in the  upcoming elections for parties that favor radical economic  change (Russia's Choice, Democratic Russia, the RDDR, etc.). In  the December 1993 elections those groups won 23 percent of the  vote.    There are 23 percent prepared to support opposition forces,  which received 10 percent of the vote in the last election. This  includes the LDPR -- Zhirinovskiy's party -- with the support of  10 percent of voters (formerly 7.6 percent), parties of a  communist or socialist orientation, with 10 percent (formerly  2.5 percent) and the patriotic and nationalist movements, with  three percent.    This is the first time in recent years that an increase in  the popularity of communists and socialists has been observed,  and though it may be only relative (recall that according to  poll results in October-November 1993 similar rates of  increasing popularity held true for Zhirinovskiy's party as  well) this could indicate emerging trends in the mass  consciousness of people in Sverdlovsk Oblast.    Of those surveyed, 22 percent are thinking about voting for  parties that hold centrist positions, parties which got nine  percent of the vote in the December elections. The increase in  this bloc's popularity is primarily due to the fact that our  survey included among this group Transformation of the Urals  [Preobrazheniye Urala], which is headed by E. Rossel, and it  received the support of a majority of those surveyed.    A significant portion of those surveyed -- 19 percent -- are  planning to vote for independent candidates.    Another 13 percent remain undecided.    Generally speaking, it is clear that the position of  Russia's  Choice is strongest in large cities, with the opposition and  centrist parties having the most supporters in medium-sized and  small cities and in rural areas.    The voter turnout problem remains serious. Since 1990 voter  participation has been decreasing by an average of 10-15 percent  in the interval between each election. Survey data indicate that  this past trend will continue, with only one in two of those  surveyed expressing a desire to go to the polls.    As in the past, voters in rural areas are more active. By  way  of comparison, on 12 December 46 percent of voters in  Yekaterinburg went to the polls, while 61 percent did so in  rural areas. Considering this, and also taking into account a  likely drop in voter turnout among the residents of large  cities, the position of those living on the outskirts of the  oblast, in those areas where the standing of those critical of  the government is better, will be a significant factor in the  outcome of this election.    The poll also examined residents' attitude toward the local  administration, with 48 percent saying that life in their city  or rayon is largely defined by the personality of the individual  who heads the local administration, with that individual's  effectiveness hampered by the following factors: lack of  physical resources, lack of budget funding, lack of a clear-cut  program of action and insufficient knowledge of the public's  interests. Other reasons cited less frequently: a low level of  professionalism among those working in the apparatus, and a lack  of respect for the administration chief. Only one person in 20  was satisfied with the local administration's actions.    The least respect for administrators was found in large  cities (Yekaterinburg and Nizhniy Tagil). In rural areas and  small cities the public is more loyal to local administration  chiefs.    Summing up the findings of this latest express poll, one  should note the increasing alarm of the public in outlying  areas, trends toward change in the system of political and  social orientations, and greater social tension among those  working in agriculture, machine building and mining.</p>

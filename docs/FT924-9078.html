			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The parochial strain AFTER THE long economic recovery of the 1980s, in which capital flowed ever more freely around the globe, it was always on the cards that the 1990s would be a more introspective decade. Tuesday's outcome of the US presidential election, fought by the victor Mr Bill Clinton almost exclusively on domestic issues, confirms that prognosis; and the all-too-plausible threat of a trade war between the US and Europe, now acute after the resignation this week of Mr Ray MacSharry as European negotiator for the Gatt talks, accelerates the trend. Even the supposedly communautaire Mr John Major, after squeaking home in Wednesday's Commons vote, appeared to succumb to the parochial tendency in his own ranks when he announced that final ratification of the Maastricht treaty would be put back until after the second Danish referendum next May - a curious way to celebrate a victory. In the week after Hallowe'en the ghost of 1930s bilateralism is on the loose, political leadership is a questionable commodity and the world looks prey to a mean-spirited impulse. Yet the markets seem wholly unbothered by the darkness of the picture. With the outcome of the US election largely discounted, Wall Street is still at heady levels and the dollar has been cheering from the sidelines. While US long bond yields crept upwards over the week on well-justified fears of looser budgetary policy under Mr Clinton, the resulting fall in bond prices is precisely the opposite of what happens when markets confront a 1930s-style slump. In Britain, meantime, gilts were similarly buoyant after Mr Major's victory, reflecting relief that the government had not been blown further off-course. Gatt fall-out The insouciance may be overdone, at least where trade is concerned. After years of tortured haggling and the inescapable brinkmanship that accompanies all trade negotiations, the Uruguay Trade Round is no more than a blur in the markets' perceptions. Apart from a sudden fall yesterday in those French stocks which were judged to be potential victims of US retaliation, the fall-out from the row over farm trade has been negligible. Yet the odds have shortened considerably on a mutually destructive, tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war. That said, the parallels with the 1930s are inexact. The Federal Reserve could hardly be accused of pursuing a tight monetary policy of the kind that throttled the US economy in the Slump. Mr Clinton, the fiscal activist, has, so to speak, arrived early on the scene: Franklin Roosevelt, author of the New Deal, did not replace Herbert Hoover until early 1933, well after the introduction of the Smoot-Hawley tariff. There is, moreover, a striking trend towards fiscal expansionism worldwide. The Japanese, despite political uncertainties arising over the latest bribery scandal, are still intent on a fiscal boost of unprecedented proportions. Despite some warlike rhetoric before next week's Autumn Statement on public expenditure, Mr Major's government is not fiscally puritanical. As for continental Europe, the slide into increasing fiscal deficit has been one of the more striking characteristics of the 1990s. Indeed, it is the German people's reluctance to pay for unification, and the resulting budgetary consequences, that provides the underlying economic explanation for the tide of discontent about Maastricht that has been sweeping across Europe this year. Sterling escape Against a background of recession at home and slower growth in the rest of Europe, Britain's escape from the disciplines imposed by the Exchange Rate Mechanism looks more convenient by the day. Sterling is back in its old, comfortable position between the D-Mark and the dollar; and with short-term interest rates coming down, Britain has a steeper yield curve - increasingly like the one that helped generate an annualised 2.8 per cent growth rate in the third quarter in the US. Since the forward markets are already pointing to sterling interest rates of little more than six per cent within the next year, the pound is probably less vulnerable to falling rates than some have feared. But Britain could still find itself caught in the cross-fire if the European Community is foolish enough not to disengage from the incipient trade war. And for large British multinationals, Mr Clinton's arrival spells trouble of a different kind. The present arbitrage whereby they borrow in the US to invest at higher returns in UK deposits, thereby generating UK profits that reduce their advance corporation tax bills, has already been hit by the rising dollar. Those same multinationals may now fall victim to Mr Clinton's attempt to find new sources of tax to mitigate his budgetary problems. If there is good news this week, it is that Mr Clinton brings a message of hope to the American people; and the world needs its remaining superpower to be strong and stable. The worry for the markets is that it will take so much time to establish whether the president-elect is up to the job.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: A slowly-emerging blue chip share - Serious Money Emerging companies are the home grown answer to emerging markets: the investor's way of taking a stake in tomorrow's world. Not all new British businesses will succeed. But some will. And one of the better times to buy them is when the economy is moving out of recession - as it is now. But buying into emerging companies is tricky - as many Business Expansion Scheme investors found to their cost. So the safest way to do it is by taking a stake in a group with proven experience in the field. And when venture capital is concerned, blue chips do not come much bluer than the giant 3i. It will never be a hot shot growth stock. It is a long term value investment. That is the basic argument in favour of investing in the shares, which are coming to the stockmarket next month.* Of course there are other points to consider, like the price. You can expect weeks of debate over whether the investor is likely to get a cheap deal. The equity market is soggy and scared at the moment, and some other lesser new issues have been pulled. And since existing 3i shareholders are keeping the majority of their holdings, they have a strong incentive to make the issue a success. So the launch price could well be at an appetising discount to asset value. But of course the board and its advisers will be doing their best to create an atmosphere of scarcity. After all, only 40 per cent is on offer, and institutional investors need to get their weightings up. And so on, and so forth. This is all good clean fun, but it misses the main point. If 3i is a long term investment, skirmishing over the initial price is essentially a side show. Stags may make a bob or two out of the launch - if the pricing and the market move in their favour. Or the issue may struggle to get away. But anyone who approaches the issue in search of a small stagging profit is being street smart to the point of myopia. It would be churlish to carp at the shortcomings of the new monthly unit trust guide. Unit Trust Analysis** boldly goes where no serious consumer publication has gone before: it provides statistical information on over 300 of the most consistent unit trusts, plus a brief description of their investment objectives, strategy, and portfolio split. Given the dearth of accessible factual information on trusts, the guide is as welcome as a McDonald's in the desert. And it retails at under Pounds 150 a year. Each trust gets a page reminiscent of a simplified company Extel card. The individual reports, neatly collected in a looseleaf binder, will be updated twice a year. The six sectors covered, UK equity income, high income, international equities, UK equity growth, far east, Europe and north America are among those likely to be popular with private investors - though a section on general trusts might have been handy. The guide is produced by Fund Research, whose existing service caters for financial advisers. The professional service grades funds, more than half the 'marks' coming from the qualitative assessment of the fund and its managers. This qualitative assessment is the result of frequent and exhaustive interviews with the fund managers. Fund Research always insists that its ratings are not investment recommendations. But a Triple A rating for a fund from Fund Research keeps financial advisers happy. Lack of such qualitative assessment is the obvious flaw of the private investor guide. For, rather than piggybacking on the existing research, the retail guide is standing on its own feet. What a shame. Derivatives pop up in the most unexpected places. How many of the homeowners happily enjoying their fixed rate mortgage realise that it is probably based on derivatives? An increasing part of building society lending is at fixed rates, but the vast majority of their borrowing - from individual savers - is at variable rates. This mismatch leaves the society vulnerable to market movements. If interest rates fall,they benefit, if interest rates rise, they suffer. This lack of control over their own fortunes makes building society managers sleep badly. So the societies get rid of the risk by taking out a 'swap', which allows them to exchange their stream of fixed rate income for a stream of variable rate income. And suddenly they are back in a world where both sides of their balance sheet have variable rates again. If interest rates go down, they no longer benefit, but they are not at risk when they rise. The tricky bit is deciding whether to lend first and swap later, or vice versa. Dutch fund management giant Robeco this week claimed that its experimental portfolios based on 'behavioural finance' outperformed markets by 17 per cent in 1992 and 1993. Behavioural finance is the new name for a rather old theory: that markets tend to excess, both at the top and at the bottom. Investors frequently fail to act in a logical way. The canny investor is the one who bases his strategy on how people do act; not on how they would act if they were rational. * 3i Share Information Office: tel 0645-313131 ** The UTA Guide Pounds 149.50 a year (plus annual p&amp;p Pounds 12.50). 0800-132075</p>

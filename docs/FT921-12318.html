			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Fraud office to press for court transcript THE Serious Fraud Office is to challenge a High Court judge's ruling that it cannot see the transcript of an examination of Mr Muhammad Naviede, head of Arrows, the Cheshire-based trade finance company that was compulsorily wound up in December. The SFO has charged Mr Naviede with obtaining Pounds 10m by deception from NMB Postbank, a Dutch company. The criminal proceedings before City of London magistrates court were adjourned last week until June 15. The ruling was obtained by the liquidators of Arrows - Mr Scott Martin and Mr Nigel Hamilton, of Ernst &amp; Young - after they had been granted an order under section 236 of the Insolvency Act requiring Mr Naviede to attend for examination. The liquidators asked the High Court to rule that they would not have to disclose the transcript of Mr Naviede's evidence to the SFO because they feared that without such a ruling - the SFO having refused to give an assurance that it would not seek disclosure - Mr Naviede would not co-operate with them. The issue required Mr Justice Hoffmann to consider the apparently conflicting rights and duties of the SFO under the 1987 Criminal Justice Act and of liquidators under the Insolvency Act. He held that the SFO's right to demand information for a fraud investigation could be restricted by the court to the extent that it was outweighed by an overriding public interest in secrecy. Mr Naviede is to seek to have the order for his examination set aside, raising the privilege against self-incrimination. His application has been deferred until after the Court of Appeal's judgment on Wednesday on an appeal by Mr Kevin Maxwell against a High Court decision that he has no right to silence in proceedings brought under the Insolvency Act.</p>

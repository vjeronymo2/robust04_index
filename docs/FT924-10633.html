			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Russia bids for Pounds 2bn UK helicopter order RUSSIA is bidding for the Pounds 2bn British Army attack helicopter programme with its revolutionary Ka-50 aircraft. A preliminary bid has been made to the UK defence ministry. Group Vector, based in Geneva and Washington, and handling the bid by the Russian manufacturer Kamov, is seeking a British prime contractor to lead the bid. Mr Steve Stylianoudis, Group Vector's UK president, told Jane's Defence Weekly the company had approached GEC-Ferranti and Sikorsky. The Ka-50 was cheap at Pounds 8m and '30 per cent cheaper to run than other competitors'. The Ka-50, which has two sets of rotor blades, is expected to be powered by Rolls-Royce/Turbomeca RTM 322 engines with sensors supplied by GEC-Ferranti. The Apache AH-64, offered by Westland and McDonnell Douglas, is favoured by the Army Air Corps to win the contract for 117 helicopters. The Franco-German designed Tiger, offered by Eurocopter and British Aerospace, is also strongly favoured. Other contenders are GEC Avionics, teamed with Bell Helicopter Textron of the US, offering the Cobra Venom, and Boeing Helicopters (the Comanche).</p>

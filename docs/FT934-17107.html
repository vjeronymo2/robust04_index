			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Materials forced to halve forecast MITSUBISHI Materials, the metals and cement company, yesterday blamed the yen's rapid rise and the domestic economic downturn as it halved its pre-tax profit forecast, to Y4bn (Dollars 37.7m) for the year ending March. Most Japanese companies have cut forecasts for the first half to September, and for the full year, as hopes fade for an economic recovery. Some companies fear the economy will remain weak until late next year. Mitsubishi Materials also halved, to Y2bn, its pre-tax forecast for the first half, compared with a result of Y6.04bn in the same period last year. Sales in the half are expected to total Y340bn, down from Y377.1bn, while sales for the full year are forecast at Y700bn, against Y743.3bn. The fall in sales reflects the weak demand from leading Japanese manufacturers, including the car and electronics industries. These have been hit hardest by the yen's strength, and are continuing to reduce production targets. Mitsubishi Materials, formed through the merger of Mitsubishi Metal and Mitsubishi Mining and Cement, had hoped that a revival of demand from the construction industry would boost profits in the second half. However, construction orders have fallen sharply in the past two months.</p>

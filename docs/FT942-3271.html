			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metra down heavily to FM65m Metra, the Finnish industrial group, yesterday reported profits after financial items of FM65m (Dollars 11.8m) in the four months to the end of April, a dramatic fall from the FM145m posted for the same period last year. However, Metra, whose main operations cover diesel engines, sanitaryware and security systems, said the figure was distorted by unusually large deliveries by the Wartsila Diesel unit, its biggest division, in the first four months of last year. It predicted profits for the whole year would be ahead of 1993's FM472m, in spite of the effects of the merger announced last week between Metra's Abloy Security division and the locks division of Sweden's Securitas. The merger, the latest in a series of moves to narrow Metra's focus, will take effect later this year, creating Europe's biggest maker of cylinder locks. The surge in Wartsila deliveries early last year, combined with divestments, also led to a decline in Metra's group sales in the first four months, to FM3.4bn from FM4.2bn. Sales for Wartsila, one the world's leading manufacturers of diesel power generators, tumbled 35 per cent during the period, to FM1.6bn, and operating profits fell heavily to FM19m. However, Metra said the order book had grown steadily since January, foreshadowing increased deliveries in the last four months of the year. Wartsila sales in the full year were expected to remain around last year's level of FM7bn, with profits down slightly on 1993's FM449m.</p>

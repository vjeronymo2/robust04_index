			<p>BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri received a  south Yemeni delegation at his residence in al-Barbur this  afternoon. The delegation is led by Yemeni Socialist Party  Assistant Secretary General Salim Salih Muhammad.    They discussed developments in Yemen. Salim Salih Muhammad  said his meeting with the Chamber of Deputies speaker  complemented earlier meetings the delegation had with the  president and the prime minister.    He added: We briefed him on the latest developments in Yemen  and the ongoing fighting. We asked for Lebanese assistance to  enable us to resume dialogue. We had a useful discussion and  reached the conclusion that Lebanon's 16-year war experience  proved that none of the parties involved could abolish the other  parties and so dialogue proved indispensable. In Yemen we must  learn a lesson from this experience, regardless of the ferocity  of the fighting and one party's attempt to prevail over the  other with guns and tanks. Nevertheless, this party will not be  able to cancel the other party's political and natural rights.  We need to draw lessons from the experience of other Arab  countries that suffered civil wars. We must immediately accept  a cease-fire, implement the relevant UN Security Council  resolution, and start negotiations.    Asked if on this visit to Lebanon he was carrying specific  proposals or requests, he answered: We have made some  proposals. Lebanon is an Arab League and United Nations member  and has its own political and cultural role. Fraternal Lebanon  can provide effective help in the difficult circumstances that  Yemen is facing. Lebanon can join its Arab brothers who are  following up the events in Yemen to help us emerge out of our  difficulties.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Disposals and mergers boost AECI at halfway AECI, the South African chemicals producer, shrugged off politically-related labour disruption to record a rise in attributable profit, to R107m (Dollars 28.9m), for the six months to June. This compares with R75m for the same period last year. Although turnover dropped to R2.48bn from R2.78bn, net profit before abnormal items rose to R82m from R61m. However, the year-on-year figures are not directly comparable because of transactions during the reporting period which changed the structure of the company. These included the disposal of 51 per cent of the group's explosives business to ICI, and the purchase of 50 per cent of Afex Holdings. In addition, AECI merged its chlor-alkali, plastics and other downstream operations with the ethylene, propylene and polypropylene operations of fellow South African chemical producer Sasol. AECI retains a 40 per cent stake in the new venture, called Polifin. The transactions reduced turnover. However, investment income surged to R32m from a loss of R7m last time, largely because the Afex acquisition was equity-accounted. A R324m surplus on the ICI deal was included as an abnormal item. Tax paid dropped to R27m from R39m, but a R4m charge for the 5 per cent one-off transitional levy imposed on all South African companies in the June budget was also included as an abnormal item.</p>

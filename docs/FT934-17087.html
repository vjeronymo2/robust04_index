			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UDM's bid plan for British Coal hit as electricity group pulls out THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers' efforts to form a consortium to bid for British Coal in next year's privatisation suffered an unexpected blow yesterday when one of its partners said it was no longer interested. East Midlands Electricity said in a brief statement that 'it is not a partner in any consortium intending to bid for any part of British Coal'. It gave no reasons, but wished other members of the consortium success in their bid. Later Mr John Harris, East Midlands' chairman, said his company had decided as long ago as the beginning of this year that it did not wish to be an investor in any bid for British Coal. 'Perhaps we did not make our position clear enough at the time so we thought we should do so now,' he added. East Midlands chose to make its announcement only 24 hours after the UDM revealed that Jim Walter Resources, a US coal mining company, had joined the consortium, completing what was seen as a strong bidding trio. Mr Harris said this was not the reason for East Midlands leaving. 'Our decision was made long ago. In fact, we helped the UDM find an international partner.' Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the UDM, said he was not unduly worried by the East Midlands announcement. It was his understanding that the company would continue to advise and assist the group in preparing a bid. Mr Bill Carr, the president of Jim Walter Resources, said he found East Midlands' announcement 'a bit strange' but he intended to stay with the UDM. Mr Greatrex would be visiting him in Alabama later this month to discuss the partnership in more detail. Some observers speculated that the confusion had been caused by a boardroom split within East Midlands, with opponents of the consortium succeeding in overturning the original decision to join. However Mr Harris denied this. 'There is no split. This has been our consistent position,' he said. Like the UDM, East Midlands Electricity is based in Nottingham.</p>

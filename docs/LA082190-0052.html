			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Steel Can Recycling Increases: The recycling rate shot up more than 39% for  beverage cans made from steel bodies and aluminum lids, the Steel Can Recycling  Institute of Pittsburgh reported. More than 700 million cans have been recycled  so far this year. Many beverage producers are converting to steel, said the  institute, because they are easily sorted with magnets for recycling and can be  reprocessed efficiently in steel mills.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTON SAYS HE BACKS PROPOSALS FOR MORE CONTROL AT SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles school Supt. William Anton said Monday he will recommend approval  of proposals to give 27 schools more autonomy despite concerns raised by some  Board of Education members that more multicultural programs are needed.  </P> <P> Anton said some of the proposals were not as visionary as he might have hoped,  but he praised others for their innovation. "Change may be uncomfortable . . .  and there may be some reluctance," Anton said at Monday's school board meeting.  But he added that "all of us are committed to making it work."  </P> <P> In their first public discussion of the Los Angeles Unified School District's  experiment in what is being called school-based management, most board members  said they favor approving plans submitted by the schools.  </P> <P> "We need to allow these experiments to flourish," said board member Mark  Slavkin. "There's a tremendous risk in doing nothing and . . . a school is  going to know much sooner than we are if it's working and whether they need to  make modifications."  </P> <P> Several board members raised concerns about the lack of multicultural programs,  proposals by individual schools that might adversely affect other schools, and  schools that had failed to define academic goals.  </P> <P> Rita Walters, the most vociferous critic of school-based management, said she  will not approve the proposals until substantial revisions are made.  </P> <P> Walters voiced special concern that some of the proposals failed to address the  needs of multicultural student bodies, faulting one proposal for assuming that  all students of one race learn alike.  </P> <P> She also blasted a school that wanted to add popular, non-core classes, saying  that "inner-city kids don't need any more Mickey Mouse classes and Mickey Mouse  graduation requirements." She did not name the schools whose plans she  criticized.  </P> <P> Another problem, said board member Leticia Quezada, is that the plans lack  specific strategies to help low-income and non-English-speaking students.  </P> <P> "There are not a lot of specifics on what we're going to accomplish and how,"  Quezada said.  </P> <P> Board President Jackie Goldberg reminded her colleagues that the basic  philosophy behind school-based management entails relinquishing control and  giving schools the freedom to try new and localized programs -- even programs  that board members may not agree with.  </P> <P> "Even if we don't philosophically agree, if they set improved standards, then  we can see if it works," Goldberg said.  </P> <P> The restructuring plans, which could be implemented in September if approved by  the board and the directors of the United Teachers-Los Angeles union, range  from adding district-approved programs, such as after-school tutoring and  parent volunteer groups, to radical changes in what students study and how they  are evaluated.  </P> <P> One proposal calls for students to perform 10 hours of community or school  service in order to graduate. Another would create two classrooms where  children are mixed across grade levels and allowed to learn without the  pressure of grades.  </P> <P> Several representatives of the teacher's union urged the board not to pick  apart the proposals but to recognize the hard work of the 27 schools.  </P> <P> "Some of these proposals are very far-reaching but we have to make a very clear  philosophical statement . . . to back them up," said Nina Greenberg, elementary  schools vice president for the teacher's union.  </P> <P> "It's better to make a mistake and do something than continue to do nothing,"  she added.  </P> <P> The board asked its staff to recommend how to address some of the concerns that  were raised Monday. The board is expected to decide whether to approve the  proposals at its meeting next Monday. The proposals have been approved by the  Central Council on Shared Decision Making and School-Based Management.  </P> <P> Some of the proposals will require the board to grant waivers of district  policy and several will require waivers from the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> Seventy of the district's 600 schools were selected last spring to develop  plans. The schools had barely a month to prepare the proposals and only 38 were  able to submit plans by the July 16 deadline. Eleven of those were deemed  incomplete and will proably be revised and resubmitted in October, along with  the remaining 32 from the original group.  </P></p>

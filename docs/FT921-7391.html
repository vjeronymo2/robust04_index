			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: A lunch-hour slurp - A few short-cuts to home-made soups / Philippa Davenport and Giles MacDonogh and their tasters try commercial stocks and supermarket soups - with surprising results LORD Curzon, the former flamboyant viceroy of India and stickler for form, would have disapproved. So will those who perpetuate the old etiquette of serving egg dishes at lunchtime but never at dinner, and soup precisely the other way round, writes Philippa Davenport. I breach this code of conduct frequently in summer and almost daily in winter. Good soup is solace and comfort, food and drink conveniently rolled into one, and I rate a bowl of the piping hot stuff as an essential reviver after a morning at my desk. The soups that I eat are home-made. This is not because of some purist cookery writer snobbism. It stems from the simple observation that home-made soups taste much better than the commercial sorts I have tried and, whereas the superiority of home-cooking over shop-bought sometimes depends on mastering special culinary skills, possessing a batterie de cuisine or spending long hours at the stove (or even all three), soup-making is a doddle. The recipes that follow, although fast and easy to do, are not quite as speedily achieved as unzipping the cartons of commercial soups that Giles MacDonogh has been dipping into. They can, however, easily be cooked, eaten and washed up within a lunch hour. They could of course be served at dinner  -and so gain Lord Curzon's approval. For the sake of speed I have incorporated a few short cuts. One soup is made with frozen spinach, rather than fresh, which is not worth eating as a vegetable but acceptable for soup-making. The other uses leftover mashed potatoes, a commodity to be found in this house only if I deliberately cook more potatoes than needed for dinner the night before. Normally I use home-made chicken stock as the liquid base for my soups but to tie in with the 'almost instant' theme of this week's column I have used shop-bought versions here. To my surprise and that of my co-tasters, we found, in blind samplings, that we preferred stock cubes to the much more expensive and supposedly superior liquid stocks now on sale at some supermarkets and delicatessens. Jurgen Langen's poultry stock (sold in a glass jar at approximately Pounds 1.59 for 500 ml) got a thumbs down rating: low on poultry taste, and possessing the gluey quality of canned consomme, not entirely unpalatable but not really stock-like. Sainsbury's fresh chicken stock (available from 100 branches at 95p per 284 ml carton) met nose-wrinkling dislike all round and got bottom marks. It was condemned as unchickeny, the onions, celery, leeks, carrot, garlic, thyme and other flavourings seeming to outweigh heavily the taste of the bird. A very disagreeable after-taste also caused comment. Waitrose own-label chicken stock cubes (12 cubes for 65p) were marginally preferred to Knorr (eight cubes for approximately 73p) by most tasters, though we all agreed that both brands need to be diluted with more water than the label instructions suggest. The best of the commercial bunch by a long chalk, but still a very poor second to the home-made chicken stock, included in the blind tasting, was a relatively new brand, Just Bouillon cubes by Kallo (six cubes cost 65-75p). Jointly and severally we rated this as pleasant and unaggressive, with a mild chickeny flavour that bears some resemblance to the real thing. The fact that it contains no monosodium glutamate, no E320 (butylated hydoxyanisole) and no yeast extract will please those with special dietary problems. There are seven stocks other than chicken in the Just Bouillon range. For further details and stockists contact Kallo direct. Tel: 081-890-8324. LEEK, POTATO AND CORIANDER SOUP Fresh potatoes can of course be used instead of leftover mash. Dice them small to cook them quickly when speed is of the essence. The soup cost me an eminently modest Pounds 1.77 to make and it will serve six. 1 lb mashed potatoes; 1 lb leeks (trimmed weight); a bunch of coriander; 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 2 1/2 pt light chicken stock or salted water. Slice the leeks and simmer them in the liquid in a covered pan until tender but do not cook them so long that they are robbed of freshness. Strain off the cooking liquor and work most of it in to the potatoes, pouring it on slowly and beating the potatoes with a wooden spoon to make a creamy smooth mixture. Whizz the leeks in a food processor with the olive oil and a handful of coriander. Stir the fragrant green puree into the potato. Wash out the processor bowl with the rest of the cooking liquor and add it to the soup. Reheat gently, stirring occasionally, and season with salt and pepper. SPINACH SOUP WITH ANCHOVY CREAM Inspired by a favourite dish of spinach souffle with anchovy sauce from Langan's Brasserie, the Mayfair restaurant, this soup will serve five and costs about Pounds 2.30 to make. 1 lb frozen whole leaf spinach; 1 pt chicken stock and 1 pt water; the juice of half a lemon; freshly ground nutmeg; 1 x 2 oz can of anchovy fillets; 1/4 pt thick cream mixed with 3 or 4 tablespoons milk. Cook the frozen spinach in the stock with the lemon juice, some salt, pepper and a very generous grating of nutmeg. Whizz the mixture to an emerald green puree in a food processor and return it to the pan. 'Wash out' the processor bowl with the water, add the green freckled water to the soup and reheat. While the spinach is cooking, tip the anchovies and their oil into a small pan. Place over low heat and mash and stir with a wooden spoon until the anchovies disintegrate. Then pour on most of the milk and cream mixture. Stir to blend and heat through well. Stir the remaining milk and cream mixture into the basic soup to enrich it a little, and check seasoning. Finally, drizzle the hot anchovy cream over and through the soup in marbled swirls, and serve.</p>

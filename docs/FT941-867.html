			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: State Farm lifts estimate of earthquake loss January's California earthquake is likely to cost State Farm, the state's biggest insurer, about Dollars 1bn, according to the latest estimate issued by the company on Friday. The estimate is sharply higher than the Dollars 600m State Farm had initially predicted and ranks alongside the biggest one-off losses in the industry. It follows upward revisions made by other US insurers in recent days and takes the total insured cost of the disaster to around Dollars 4bn. State Farm had said earlier in the week that it expected its original estimate to be adequate. However, on Friday it said that detailed examinations had revealed more severe structural damage than had been anticipated. The scale of the damage stemmed from the unusual nature of the earthquake, which caused the ground to move in ways not normally experienced during earthquakes in the area, it said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rolf Paasch dispatch from Atlanta: "It Must Be Night for </F> Clinton's Stars to Shine...."]    [Text] Once again it was time. U.S. President Bill  Clinton was facing harsh criticism of his foreign policy -- or  of his neglect of foreign policy -- and he took the bull by the  horns. Over the 16 months of his presidency so far, the bull  usually was where the cameras stood. Be it a news conference in  the White House, which was convened just to justify his actions;  the carefully staged "town hall meeting" in the midst of an  impressive crowd of citizens; or the "Global Forum" that was  carried by the U.S. television station CNN on Tuesday evening [3  May]: The ups and downs of devastating accusations, their  "talkmasterly" refutation of political mishaps, their telegenic  correction of neglect of international crises, and correcting  this in a way that is very impressive for the public, have  become the characteristic quality of this President. The man in  the White House made mistakes in the Whitewater scandal, is  swaying in social policy, and is sloppy in foreign policy -- but  then he makes his critics look like school children in public.    This is also what happened on Tuesday at CNN in Atlanta.  Journalists from 80 countries asked hesitatingly -- and the  president answered grandly. The political pressure to act had  become too great; thus, Bill Clinton used the "Global Forum" to  sell the domestic and international audience a new policy for  Haiti. It is time "to go" for the military rulers in  Port-au-Prince and to let the elected and then ousted President  Aristide return from his exile in the United States. Suddenly,  the President "no longer" wanted to rule out military  intervention, knowing that junta chief General Raoul Cedras can  also receive "CNN International." However, the Clinton  administration's policy toward Haiti, with its direct  deportation of Haitian refugees, remains as morally dubious as  it was before and the threatened replacement of the diplomacy of  compromise with a military intervention can hardly be taken  seriously, particularly since the sanctions, which have now been  applied for at the UN Security Council, are far less than what  critics demand. However, Clinton's appearance in Atlanta was  certainly sufficient to reestablish the "image" of a competent  President who is dedicated to foreign policy. A strong  statement on Haiti, an elegantly oscillating answer regarding  the policy toward Bosnia, a monologue full of statistics on the  human rights conflict with China -- compared with that, the  harmless questions of the journalists felt like interjections by  gullible country bumpkins. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt  was the inventor of the charming "fireside chats" on the radio  and John F. Kennedy was the first U.S. President of the  television age, then Bill Clinton is the master of interactive  media talks, from the local radio talk show to global satellite  conferences.    However, it is quite a different question whether these  skills Clinton has guarantee a successful presidency, because  the rescue attempts are subject to the law of diminishing  returns: Every time he manages to talk himself out of a  quandary, a bit of the authority of his presidency seems to have  been used up. For the superficial television watcher such  tricks may be sufficient, but Clinton will hardly manage in this  way to create a community of supporters dedicated to him,  because what his critics have repeatedly accused the President  of is not a lack of competence, but a lack of concentration,  staying power, character, and credibility. These are qualities  whose credible presentation requires more than a "Global Forum"  a la CNN.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said we  are aware of the dimensions of national defense and will not  accept discrimination or compromise on our security. The prime  minister was addressing the student officers at the Command and  Staff College in Quetta today.    [Begin Bhutto recording] We are aware of the dimensions of  our national defense which call for heightened consciousness.  We are clear about the diagnosis and the prescription.  National security must always take precedence.    Pakistan is a peaceful nation. We are against territorial  aggrandizement. We are against nuclear proliferation and we  have exercised commendable self-restraint to demonstrate the  point, but we do not accept discrimination. A country which has  had three wars cannot afford to do so. Today it has become  fashionable to talk about nuclear phraseology, words like  capping, freezing, roll back are being thrown about in the open  with abundance without appreciating that national security must  be accorded collective responsibility. Each day self-centered  individuals intent on achieving narrow objectives throw about  strategic issues, indifferent to the damage they inflict on  national policies. We have said it before and I am saying it  here today before this august gathering that if even the sun  melts we will not accept discrimination or compromise on our  security. The right of survival is the first right. [end  recording]    The prime minister said we are determined to make Pakistan a  modern welfare state. She said we will have to take strong  decisions to achieve this objective. The prime minister said  there is a need to reform our taxation system and we have  decided to take steps in this direction. The prime minister  said the next budget will be a step forward for revitalizing the  economy. She said the government will give firm economic  foundation to the country to promote free market economy and  would ensure smooth economic progress and prosperity.    Earlier, the commandant of the staff college gave a resume  of  the training facilities available at the college. Some military  officers are also getting training at the college.</p>

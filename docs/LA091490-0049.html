			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: SAN PEDRO IS HOPING ITS STREET FAIRE WILL PUT THE COMMUNITY ON THE  MAP  </P> <P> It happens too often. "So many people call and say, 'Where is San Pedro," said  Dorothy Gordon of the San Pedro Revitalization Corp.  </P> <P> But after Saturday's San Pedro Street Faire, the nonprofit firm and other  sponsors of the sprawling outdoor community party are hoping that several  thousand more people will no longer ask that question.  </P> <P> "The San Pedro downtown has been revitalized several times over," said fair  coordinator Jerry Gaines. He calls the sixth annual fair a "showcase for the  downtown that has turned itself around. There's a lot of pride here."  </P> <P> There also will be a lot of fun, whether it's running a scenic mini-marathon,  enjoying varied entertainers, ogling the offerings of artists and merchants in  170 multicolored street booths, eating international foods or touring old Ft.  MacArthur.  </P> <P> "It's very festive, very community, with lots of children and happy people,"  said Bill Manuel, president of the San Pedro Downtown Business Assn., another  fair sponsor.  </P> <P> Festivities will center on 6th Street between Pacific Avenue and Harbor  Boulevard, where the normal daily traffic will be replaced by booths with  striped awnings.  </P> <P> Peppertree Plaza, at 6th and Harbor next to the San Pedro Municipal Building,  will be the site of the main entertainment stage, where bands and solo artists  will hold forth between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Opening ceremonies also will be held  there at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> But hours before that, more than 1,000 runners and walkers will take to the  streets under the sponsorship of the San Pedro &amp; Peninsula YMCA, which is  raising funds for youth fitness programs.  </P> <P> The 11th running of the Y's Harbor Light Half Marathon will send runners around  a scenic 13.1-mile loop taking in downtown San Pedro, Ports O' Call, Point  Fermin Lighthouse, the bluffs along Vista del Mar and Royal Palms Beach. The  race begins on 7th Street between Centre and Mesa streets at 7:30 a.m.  </P> <P> And a seven-mile walk also will held for people who want to enjoy the scenery  in a less strenuous way. It begins at the same time and place as the half  marathon. Fees are $18 for both events.  </P> <P> In addition to the marathon, the Y will sponsor a Kid K for youngsters under 12  that starts at 8 a.m. at 6th and Harbor. The fee is $5. Parents must accompany  their children.  </P> <P> At the fair, people strolling among the 6th Street booths will find clothing,  handmade crafts, paintings and other fine arts, plants and flowers -- even  handwriting analysis.  </P> <P> Roving sketch artists and photographers will be on hand to do portraits. There  also will be a display of 1950s cars.  </P> <P> The International Food Court on Centre will feature specialties from 11 San  Pedro restaurants, along with food that 11 community organizations will sell to  raise funds. The bill of fare includes Italian, Mexican, Caribbean Creole,  Chinese and Thai food.  </P> <P> For the first time, the fair will have a special Kids Court, located on Mesa,  featuring pony rides, games and an air bounce where youngsters jump up and down  in an air-filled enclosure.  </P> <P> The Del Rubio Triplets, who sing and play guitar, will be among entertainers at  the fair, which will have a smaller stage at 6th and Mesa in addition to the  main stage at Peppertree Plaza. Other attractions include '50s nostalgia and  surf music, a reggae band, a fusion of Latin, jazz and rock music, gymnastic  and aerobic dancing, and Yugoslavian and Mexican folk groups.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, a mini-van will leave from 6th and Pacific to take people  on free tours of Ft. MacArthur. Now used for military housing, the fort was a  major U.S. Army induction and training center during World War II. Visitors  Saturday will see the old parade ground and a collection of military artifacts.  </P> <P> Free parking will be available for fair-goers at Port of Los Angeles Berth 87,  1st Street and Harbor, and at city parking lots on 7th and 5th streets between  Pacific and Mesa. Paid parking is available at the multilevel parking structure  at 5th and Centre.  </P> <P> Free shuttles will circle the fair area, taking people to and from parking  lots. Tourist trolleys will take people around Ports O' Call and the harbor  area.  </P> <P> The first San Pedro fair was held six years ago when downtown revitalization  had yet to take off. Artist Stephanie Seitz, who has had a booth in every fair,  remembers that downtown "was virtually a ghost town" six years ago and that the  fair was more like a garage sale than a festival. "People had spots on the  pavement. There were no canopies or tables," she said.  </P> <P> Since then, San Pedro has gained new hotels, restaurants, buildings and  businesses. And organizers say the fair -- which receives financial support  from the city of Los Angeles, local institutions and businesses -- has grown in  size and attractions.  </P> <P> Coordinator Gaines said the backbone of the fair is the volunteers who spend  weeks organizing the event, work on fair day and clean everything up when it's  over.  </P> <P> Said Gaines: "When we walk down on Saturday, visit the folks strolling and see  that everyone is having a summery experience, our goals have been met."  </P> <P> What: San Pedro Street Faire.  </P> <P> When: Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:30 a.m., YMCA Harbor Light Half Marathon  and Walk; 8 a.m., Kid-K.  </P> <P> Where: 6th Street, between Pacific Avenue and Harbor Boulevard, San Pedro.  </P> <P> Admission: Free  </P> <P> Information: 833-8278.

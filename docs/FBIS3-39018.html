			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former PDS Chairman Gregor Gysi, by Axel </F> Vornbaeumen, in Berlin; date not given: "`We Are Annoying,  Because We Remind People of the GDR'"]    [Text] Does the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]  have a chance even in the old federal laender in the super  election year? Gregor Gysi, top thinker of the PDS, is convinced  that his party has a role in all of Germany. FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE correspondent Axel Vornhaeumen spoke with Gysi in  Berlin.    [Vornbaeumen] Mr. Gysi, are you secretly grateful to people  like Bavaria's Interior Minister Beckstein for wanting to ban  the PDS?    [Gysi] No, for one simple reason. It intimidates members and  sympathizers of the PDS. And it diminishes the inhibitions of  our real political enemies, the perpetrators of violence on the  extreme Right, to take action against us. They sense a kind of  legitimation for acts of violence.    [Vornbaeumen] But it has given you a great many advocates,  even in the camp of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. And  people are talking about the PDS.    [Gysi] The latter is right. This gives us a media public  that  we seldom have. But the disadvantages clearly outweigh the  advantages. There are two other things to consider: it could, on  the one hand, be a preparation for an old story in the FRG,  namely an occupational ban. And it could also inhibit people who  actually have the idea of voting for the PDS, as though they  were doing something almost illegal. I think that in the event  of an investigation it would turn out that the PDS stands very  much on constitutional grounds and certainly more so than the  CSU [Christian Social Union] in decisive matters. Above all it  poisons the political climate.    [Vornbaeumen] Give your enemies a tip: Where would they have  the greatest chances of proving your unconstitutionality?    [Gysi] I do not think that there is much chance of that  unless one takes the statements of individual members. But in  this way I can demonstrate the unconstitutionality of every  party in this FRG. I still assert that the statement by Bavarian  Minister President Stoiber, in which he warned against a  "racially mixed society" in the FRG is clearly unconstitutional,  because it is incompatible with Article 1 of the constitution as  well as with the principles on equality of people before the law  regardless of what nation or race they belong to. And it is  quite astounding how the CSU gets around this. I can only say  that a person could not remain a member of the PDS with a  statement like this.    [Vornbaeumen] What do you think about the classification of  the CSU land group chief Glos: "the radical leftist PDS and the  Greens are a greater danger to our country than the Republikaner  and the radical rightists."    [Gysi] That is an interesting quote. In the first place, he  thereby says that the Republikaner are not radical rightists. He  sees them to the right of the Republikaner and he can only take  them to be the DVU [German People's Union] and extreme rightist  splitter groups such as the NL [National List] and others. And  if he thinks that Alliance 90/Greens and the PDS are even more  dangerous than these extreme rightist groups, then that says  something about where he stands. That is a dangerous statement  that shows a total loss of a sense of reality.    [Vornbaeumen] Is a sharper wind blowing at the beginning of  the "super election year," because one was not--or no  longer--taking the PDS seriously and is suddenly startled by the  latest election successes?    [Gysi] I have noticed that the tone toward the PDS has  changed completely since 6 December 1993. Many were alarmed by  the good election result in Brandenburg and now some established  political forces are trying artificially to restore the  atmosphere of 1990 with respect to the PDS. Something quite  remarkable is happening: in large newspapers, including your  own, the talk was primarily of the "PDS" alone. They ceased to  point out that it is the successor party of the SED [Socialist  Unity Party of Germany]. And since 6 December all the newspapers  have again been pointing this out in every report. I am  interested in how something like that works.    [Vornbaeumen] What, in your opinion, is the effect of the  label "successor party"?    [Gysi] Two things: in the first place, that people are  afraid  to deal with our political statements and declare this  unnecessary. The SED is known and hence there is no need to deal  further with the PDS, with what it is doing, what it is saying,  and with what it wants. The other thing is that it is certainly  a negative label. Of course it is true that we came out of the  SED. That cannot be denied. Still, I think that one ought to try  to understand the changes. They avoid that through a label.  Besides, it is also offensive to the voters. They are thereby  saying that over 21 percent of the voters in Brandenburg really  voted for the old SED. I do not believe that.    [Vornbaeumen] Is not too much fuss being made about a party  that has not been able, despite the greatest effort, to campaign  for the Bundestag with prominent names on an "open list"?    [Gysi] What do you mean, am I not prominent?    [Vornbaeumen] You are but there is hardly anyone else.    [Gysi] Let us wait and see, the question is what prominent  means. We may have different ideas about this. So far we have  not published a list of names. It has just been dealt with in  the media and that is a trick too: they raise expectations very  high and then they can turn the results into a defeat....    [Vornbaeumen] ...or they keep names like Stefan Heym, for  example, in play and hence the name of the party.    [Gysi] Yes, that is not bad but that is really not our  initiative. Heretofore I have not cited the name of Heym.    [Vornbaeumen] Also a prominent person in the east.    [Gysi] The PDS did come out of the GDR. Since the entire GDR  is not supposed to have been, the fight against the PDS is also  a fight against the memories of the GDR and against GDR-identity  in general. In the view of established politicians and in the  view of journalists, we are simply a disruptive factor merely  because we are still reminding people of this history, even  though it is not so intoxicating. But we do not deny it, whereas  all the other parties that existed in the GDR have come to an  understanding with their sister parties in the west to treat  their history in the GDR as though it never happened.    [Vornbaeumen] So you are seeking your candidates primarily  in  the east?    [Gysi] Our goal is still to be a party for all of Germany.  But at the same time we will not deny our origins in the east.  Naturally the east Germans still need a specific representation  of interests, because unification has caused great problems and  because there is a humiliation of east Germans and  discrimination in all areas: from the woman receiving social  assistance to the entrepreneur in eastern Germany. Only the PDS  can articulate this effectively, because it is the only party  that is not continually forced to heed its clientel in the west.  But that can only be an option of our policy. We are also a  leftist party and we have developed leftist positions--and they  are not east German.    [Vornbaeumen] The problem of the PDS is that at this time  one  can make a lot of headway with "eastalgia."    [Gysi] This is not our fault. We have not promised any  blooming landscapes. It was not our doing that the deals reached  in the east are not being recognized. It is not our doing that  almost all of them almost everywhere are being subjected to  revision and many are now worried about their property and  dwellings. And now the established parties are reproaching the  people for finding access to us because we have always  criticized that.    [Vornbaeumen] So much for the east. In the west, however,  the  PDS is a foreign party.    [Gysi] I also underestimated the real division in Germany. I  assumed that we are a leftist German party that can be accepted  with respect to its leftist position in western Germany as well  despite the burden of its past. I underestimated the fact that  for the western Germans we are for the present a foreign party.  Quite well-meaning western German students have always treated  me a little like the chairman of an Indian party. At the same  time, the main difference is not between east and west. It is in  part artificial in nature. The decisive thing is still the  difference between rich and poor, between those on top and those  on the bottom. And the gap is widening. There are still some in  established politics who are interested in artificially  maintaining this east-west opposition to obscure the other  social contradictions.    [Vornbaeumen] Vote-getting in the west is probably your  role.  Otherwise you would not have withdrawn as party chairman. What  has your resignation done for the party?    [Gysi] Several things. The party does indeed exist, even if  I  am not chairman. That is something that used to be disputed.  There are considerably more personalities in the PDS than was  supposed. Who knew Mr. Kutzmutz just two months ago? We have  become more effective in the Bundestag. I can visit meetings in  the west more often. We have improved our profile in the west,  in part through other questions than in the east. An example:  when I consider our voter potential in the east, I know that  many vote for us despite our position on the right of asylum and  not because of it. Those who vote for us in the west probably do  so on account of our position on the right of asylum.    [Vornbaeumen] Is that a split that one can live with very  well?    [Gysi] One can live with it, because I would never say  anything else. In the west, our pronounced social, antimilitary,  and other leftist positions are yielding an increase in  acceptance. And not all of that is east German. That justifies  our claim to be a democratic party for all of Germany to the  left of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. I too know  that that is difficult. Nevertheless, I think that we have a  potential of 2 percent of the voters in the west.    [Vornbaeumen] For you is the result for Rolf Kutzmutz in  Potsdam the starting signal that there is an acceptance for  former members of the SED in the east?    [Gysi] We simply must see that the SED was never a  homogeneous institution. If a Mielke were to be elected, that  would really scare me--along with Mr. Glos. But I consider this  out of the question. The entire revolution would not have  happened without the critical part of the SED.    [Vornbaeumen] But it does block access to the solidary  society of the leftists. The Left in the west really does not  want it.    [Gysi] I am not sure. Some in the SPD, for example, do like  us. The leftists in the parliamentary group of the SPD always  argued: postal reform, right of asylum, Bischofferode--Do you  want to leave this theme to the PDS as well? We will be quite  pleased to be misused for this.    [Vornbaeumen] Under the motto: the GDR made the FRG "more  social." These are your words. Is there an analogy PDS-SPD?    [Gysi] It is a similar effect. It gives another chance to  the  leftists in the SPD. Sometime the leftists in the SPD must draw  the conclusion that in recent decades they have not been able to  prevail in a single question. If at all, they were sometimes  able to prolong a process but they could never stop it. Up until  the 1970's, it was typical for the FRG that the Left at least  determined the questions. Since the 1980's, at the latest since  unification, it was the conservatives who determined the  questions in Germany: right of asylum, eavesdropping  offensive--those are all their themes.    [Vornbaeumen] You have a nice field for action there.    [Gysi] Unfortunately we cannot do it. We must not  overestimate ourselves. At the moment only the SPD could set  real social-policy themes from another view than that of the  conservatives. But it is not doing it. So it needs pressure,  including from us.</p>

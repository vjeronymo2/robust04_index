			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Blair's lead undented following debate: Labour contenders address US-style primary Mr Tony Blair's apparently unstoppable advance on the Labour leadership remained undented by a three-sided debate at the annual congress of GMB general union last night. Mr John Prescott, his main opponent, who appeals most to Labour's core traditional voters, was on home ground and provided a punchy and emotional contribution stressing his trade union past and his socialist values. But his speech was also repetitious and poorly organised and seemed to disappoint some of his supporters. The GMB's US-style primary attracted surprisingly little interest among the 700 delegates. About half of them left the conference when normal business ended in the early evening. Only a few trickled back. Earlier Mrs Margaret Beckett, the third candidate, who took the formal slot reserved for the Labour leader, gave a lacklustre performance. Like Mr Prescott she stressed the importance of the union-Labour links, of full employment and of government support for industry. Mr Blair did little to rouse delegates. With typically fluent delivery he stressed public-private partnership and Labour's opportunity to be the party trusted on tax and economic management. He talked about skills development and lifelong learning, and played to his trade union audience by stressing his commitment to a new social partnership at work and to the social chapter of the European Union. Most delegates thought that he had won narrowly on points. The GMB is a centre-right but traditionalist union. Mr John Edmonds, its leader, has fallen out with the Labour modernisers. Neither the leadership nor the activists are enthusiastic about Mr Blair, but up to a third of the 700 delegates would probably vote for him. The biggest group of delegates seems set to vote for Mr Prescott with quite a large minority, and most of the women delegates, backing Mrs Beckett. But private polls of the union's ordinary members show almost 50 per cent backing Mr Blair, about 30 per cent for Mr Prescott, and the rest split between Mrs Beckett and others. That presents the union leadership with a problem. They cannot endorse Mr Blair because of his overt coolness towards unions - but endorsing anyone else may make them appear out of touch. One activist said: 'Blair doesn't stand for anything, we don't want to win at any price.' But support for Mr Blair is not only found among the ordinary members. GMB full-time officials are equally split between Mr Blair and Mr Prescott.</p>

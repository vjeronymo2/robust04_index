			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 12--The Union home minister, Mr  S.B. Chavan, today ruled out any economic and political package  for initiating the political process in insurgency-hit Jammu and  Kashmir saying such a package could be given only after the  installation of an elected government, report agencies.    Talking to journalists here after laying the foundation  stone  of a seven-storeyed headquarters of the Intelligence Bureau  (IB), Mr Chavan said the government had no objections to having  a dialogue with Kashmir militants.    But, he made it clear that talks could be held only under  the  constitution. "Going beyond the constitution is just ruled out,"  he asserted.    The home ministry has evolved a country-wide intelligence  network to counter the threat posed by the Inter-Services  Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan.    Talking to journalists in Jammu last night the internal  security minister, Mr Rajesh Pilot, said that the ISI was trying  its best to destabilise and disturb the peace in the country and  recent arrests of some activists revealed that they were  planning sabotage and create disruption at a number of places in  the country.    "We have evolved a co-ordinated approach involving  intelligence agencies all over the country to meet the challenge  posed by the ISI," he added.    He said that the ISI would not be allowed to succeed in its  designs and declared that a lot of success has been achieved  through this co-ordinated approach in checking its activities.    He said to check the influence of the ISI in the  North-Eastern and "operational command" of seven states had been  formed.    Fresh instructions have been given to the IB to meet the  senior police and civil officials once a week at the district  level to have a clear picture of the situation. "We should be  able to prevent a certain event from taking place instead of  waiting for it to happen," he added.    Mr Pilot said that a decision regarding starting of a  political process and reactivating the administration in Jammu  and Kashmir would be taken by the Prime Minister in a few days  after consultations with all political parties.    Mr Pilot indicated that the idea of appointing "political  advisors" had virtually been given up due to opposition from  certain quarters. He said that he had conveyed to the prime  minister the need to evolve a certain political mechanism for  the Kashmir Valley.    "Political process takes you towards normalisation as  politicians can go down to the grassroots level to look into the  grievances of the people.    Mr Pilot said that he favoured a political advisory council  consisting of politicians and having certain administrative  powers to solve the problems of the people.    He said to speed up the developmental works in the state  special high level teams from various ministries were visiting  the state. "We have already settled about 14,000 of the 18,000  insurance claims cases in the state. Others will be settled very  soon."    Mr Pilot said that the Centre was also thinking of setting  up  of a Kashmir infrastructure reconstruction fund to speed up  development activities in areas badly hit by militancy. "The  prime minister is also in favour of such a fund and final  touches are being given to it," he said.    Mr Pilot said he had conveyed to the prime minister the  feelings of various political leaders, including Dr Farooq  Abdullah and the state Congress president, Mr Ghulam Rasool Kar,  over the delay in announcing some kind of political,  administrative and economic package for the people of Kashmir.    Describing the situation in Doda as "complex" Mr Pilot said  security forces had been instructed to re-define their strategy  and results would follow soon.    Mr Pilot said that although there were limitations regarding  the availability of forces, he had ordered additional BSF  [Border Security Forces] and CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force]  troops for the state.    Referring to some provocations by Pak troops along Indo-Pak  border, he said "India is a peace-loving country and we will not  be provoked by these pinpricks. However, he said if Pakistan  stretched India's patience too far, it would be bad for that  country."    TOINS [Times of INdia News Service] adds: The  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today demanded that the Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, visit Kashmir and take some  firm steps to restore normalcy in the state. The party suggested  that the government prepare an action plan.    The party spokesman, Mr K.L. Sharma, said the situation in  the state was grave, and the Prime Minister should take personal  notice of it. He said the government's claim that the situation  in the Valley was gradually improving was a "cruel joke."    Meanwhile, the high-level Central team headed by Mr K.R.  Venugopal, secretary in the prime minister's office, today held  discussions on the overall development of the state with the  governor, Gen K.V. Krishna Rao.    An official spokesman said in Jammu the team was with the  governor for nearly two hours and issues covered related to  Central schemes, rural development, health and education and  ways and means of speeding up various works in the state.</p>

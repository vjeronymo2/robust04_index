			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Peru sets out to woo investors in sell-off plan: The state is in a tight financial corner Peru's privatisation commission, Copri, is to launch a scheme to attract at least 100,000 middle-income Peruvians as shareholders this year, and to cover the unpaid state pension funds due to workers who have converted to private pensions. In a series of privatisations of 'low-risk businesses', such as utility companies, Copri aims to transfer shares worth at least Dollars 300m (Pounds 197m) to small investors, who will be able to buy shares in fixed instalments, virtually eliminating any financial risk. Investors will pay by instalments fixed on the day of sale, but if the quoted share price falls, the state 'guarantees' to charge instalments at the lower price. The 'citizen participation' scheme also aims to get the state out of a tight financial corner. A year ago, it backed the establishment of a private pension fund system, AFPs, but it has been unable to pay the funds owed by the virtually bankrupt state pension scheme to workers who have switched to private cover. Workers may now opt to take all or part of their state pension in the form of shares in privatised companies. The AFPs will then trade the shares on behalf of the funds they manage, giving them a long-awaited new instrument. And Peruvians who have never owned a share in their lives will, the plan's designers hope, acquire a stock exchange mentality. 'Citizen participation' should provide a boost both for the AFPs and for Peru's underdeveloped capital markets, says Mr Carlos Montoya, Copri's general manager. He predicts that the Lima stock exchange's total market capitalisation will 'rise between two and three times' from its current Dollars 6bn with the public offerings via privatisations due in coming months. The programme is due to start in September with the sale of part of the state's holding in cement producer Norte Pacasmayo. Copri also expects the programme to cover the privatisation of electricity companies Electrolima (already split into three separate entities for sell-off) and Electroperu; telecoms company Entel (in which Spain's Telefonica already has a 35 per cent stake); another state-owned cement producer; and the state-controlled Banco Continental. In each case, the state will invite operators to bid competitively for a majority or controlling stake via public auction. Part of the state's remaining 30 or 40 per cent holding will then be offered to the Peruvian public. There will be a holding limit of 10,000 sols (Pounds 2,960) per company per individual, to ensure a broad ownership base. Copri is gearing up for an massive education and promotion campaign to launch the programme to overcome small savers' distrust of government-backed schemes. 'We want to make it as easy as possible for the new investor,' says Mr Montoya. Participants in the scheme will pay 10 per cent cash down for their share package and the rest over three years at a fixed 1 per cent a month interest rate. Local banks will hold on to shares until full payment is made. 'We consider this (instalment-plan) mechanism extrem-ely important both for the deepening of the process and to increase the direct identification of the population with privatisation,' said Mr Montoya. The programme will also help the Peruvian government with the embarrassing dilemma of how to spend its privatisation cash. Revenue from privatisations has already topped Dollars 1.5bn this year. The bulk of that came from the sell-off to Spain's Telefonica of the two state-controlled telecommunications companies, Entel and CPT. Such sums cannot be injected into the small Peruvian economy without jeopardising newly won control of inflation. The Dollars 1.3bn telecoms cash, therefore, has had to be placed on deposit with the central bank (swelling Peru's already substantial international reserves to an unprecedented Dollars 4.7bn). Even stepped-up poverty alleviation programmes are unable to spend more than Dollars 300m in a year. The citizen participation scheme will not mop up all of the privatisation cash, 'but it will allow the state to reduce its internal debt, and it will boost Peru's capital markets growth,' says Mr Montoya.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Court of Appeal setback for Lloyd's A Court of Appeal ruling yesterday threatened to undermine efforts by Lloyd's to collect more than Pounds 1bn owed by loss-making members and to create confusion about the legal status of some of the insurance market's practices. If the case is not resolved soon Lloyd's could find it harder to pass solvency tests required by regulators. Hard-hit Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - welcomed the court's verdict that Lloyd's might have broken European competition law, in particular by asking them to contribute to a 'central fund' while underwriting. The central fund is used to settle claims on policies underwritten by Lloyd's when Names refuse, or are unable, to provide the funds required and also to ensure the market passes UK government solvency rules. The court also raised a question mark over whether Lloyd's practice of encourag-ing the reinsurance of its policies within the market might also have breached Euro-pean Union competition law. The decision, overturning a lower court's ruling, could affect Lloyd's attempts to recover Pounds 1.2bn earmarked from the central fund (and other assets) to cover possible liabilities on policies underwritten by Names. It will give aggrieved members an excuse not to pay sums demanded by Lloyd's at least until the arguments are considered in a full court trial - possibly not until next autumn. If the central fund is declared void, that would raise the question of whether Lloyd's should repay money paid into the fund. However, Lloyd's said it would continue its debt recovery operation and planned an early appeal to the Lords. It pointed out that the court had been considering only preliminary issues and had not taken a view on whether Lloyd's had contravened European law. Lloyd's is also applying to Brussels for the necessary exemptions from European law to clarify the position. The Names' Writs Response Group argued that because the Lloyd's market comprised an 'association of undertakings', arrangements made centrally could amount to a cartel agreement under the Treaty of Rome. This is because, by offering buyers of Lloyd's policies extra protection, they may have given the market an unfair advantage over outside reinsurance companies. For many years Lloyd's had intended to check the arrangements with the European Community but it never actually took that step. Mr Alan Porter, chairman of the Devonshire Names Action Group, a group of loss-making members, said: 'The judgment must cast further serious doubt on whether Lloyd's should continue to trade.'</p>

In a statement, Gen Viljoen accused the ANC/South African  Communist Party alliance of deliberately destabilising the  homeland with the full knowledge of the South African  Government. "There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the  majority of the people involved in the unrest in Mmabatho are  bused in by the ANC."    The "sudden" military activity near the border by the South  African Defence Force could also be seen as intimidation, the  general added.</p>

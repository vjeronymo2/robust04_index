			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique from the Government Ministry and the National </F> Police on the murder of Constitutionality Court President  Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon; issued in Guatemala City on 3 April  -- read by announcer]    [Text] Through this document, which is related to the  events that took place in Guatemala City during the evening  hours of Good Friday, the Government Ministry and the National  Police hereby take the opportunity to advise the public of the  following:    On 1 April 1994, in a failed vehicle robbery attempt, Mr.  Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of Guatemala's  Constitutionality Court, was murdered in the presence of his  wife and youngest son.    In condemning this villainous crime, National Police  authorities hereby report they are already searching for the  parties responsible for this crime in light of evidence gathered  at the scene of the crime. The police are also receiving  support from the Guatemalan Armed Forces. The National Police  Criminal Investigation Department is working arduously to  locate, in the shortest time possible, those individuals  responsible for this crime and to turn them over to the  appropriate courts of law.    Because we live in a democracy and because Mr. Gonzalez  Dubon's activities were transparent, he readily refused to be  escorted by security guards which, unfortunately, proved to be  advantageous for the criminals.    The security forces will utilize all of their expertise in  investigating this murder. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan  people's cooperation is being requested to expedite the  investigation. All Guatemalans are also urged to provide any  evidence that may lead to identifying the murderers.</p>

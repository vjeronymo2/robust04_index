			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aim shares fall 30p on warning Shares of Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings, fell 30p to 143p yesterday following the company's warning on second half turnover and profits. It cited the recent announcement by Saab-Scania that certification of its new Saab 2000 airliner had been delayed by a year until October 1994. The supply of its interior is the group's largest contract. Aim said that the aerospace market continued to weaken and although first half profits should be in line with expectations, it was unlikely that current full-year profits would exceed Pounds 2m. Profits for the year to April 30 1993 amounted to Pounds 3.63m.</p>

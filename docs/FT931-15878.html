			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Brazil in debt restructuring move The new Brazilian government of President Itamar Franco yesterday signalled its intention to advance a Dollars 44bn debt restructuring with commercial banks by authorising the distribution to all bank creditors of a detailed agreement or term sheet negotiated with banks last year, Stephen Fidler and Bill Hinchberger write. The agreement will allow the banks six options aimed mainly at reducing Brazil's debt service bill. It is accompanied by supporting letters from the heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and InterAmerican Bank.</p>

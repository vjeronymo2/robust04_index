			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chinese group buys HK stake CHINESE steel company Shougang has taken a 74 per cent stake in a fourth Hong Kong listed company, Kader Investment, for HKDollars 582m (USDollars 75.3m), despite last week's tougher stance on back-door listings by Hong Kong's regulators. Following the acquisition, Mr Deng Zhifang, son of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, will join the Hong Kong company's board of directors, underlining the high profile role China is now taking in its future sovereign territory. Since the October announcement that Beijing would list nine mainland-registered companies on the Hong Kong stock market, there has been an explosion in the number of Chinese companies taking an easier route, through back-door listings. In the eight months these nine mainland companies have struggled to resolve legal and corporate obstacles to their Hong Kong flotations, Chinese entities have taken stakes of more than 25 per cent in 12 listed companies. The stock exchange said last week it was clamping down on companies circumventing listing regulations by purchasing shell companies and injecting in privately-held assets. Shougang said that it would neither sell any 'material' assets to Kader, nor change its focus from property investment. Only days before the stock exchange decision, Shougang had announced a HKDollars 1.8bn rights issue by another newly-acquired subsidiary, Tung Wing Steel. The Kader stake was purchased from the Ting family and the family's toy manufacturing company Kader Holdings.</p>

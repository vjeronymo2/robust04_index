			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Daf vans buy-out seeks state funds INFORMAL TALKS have started on possible government funding for the prospective management buy-out team at the threatened Leyland Daf van plant at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, Mr Michael Heseltine said yesterday. Speaking in Birmingham, the trade and industry secretary said that the talks about funding through the regional selective assistance scheme had been between the van plant management and department officials. He ruled out government finance to meet the day-to-day losses of the plant. 'Companies come to us for help in capital projects and it is in this context that assistance is available,' he said. Regional selective assistance is available under the Industrial Development Act 1982 for companies in Britain's assisted areas. To qualify for funding projects must cover either new ventures and expansions which create employment, or modernisation and rationalisation schemes which safeguard existing employment. The administrative receivers for Leyland Daf said yesterday that they had made a breakthrough in agreeing financing arrangements to allow dealers to re-start sales to customers. Sales have been hampered since the company collapsed into receivership three weeks ago by legal problems over the ownership of vehicles in dealer showrooms and in the supply pipeline. Technically, most of the vehicles at dealerships are owned by Leyland Daf Finance, which is not in receivership. Leyland Daf Finance, a subsidiary of Daf Finance in the Netherlands, was responsible before the collapse of Daf for much of the dealer stock financing and customer hire purchase and leasing arrangements. The UK receivers said yesterday that the arrangements would permit dealers to continue supplying Leyland Daf vehicles to customers. Mr David Gill, joint managing director of Leyland Daf, said that vehicles in the supply pipeline, many of which had confirmed customer orders, could now be sold. Dealers would be able to resume trading 'in a conventional way'.</p>

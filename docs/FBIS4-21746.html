			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Khalid Mush'il by Mahmud Ahmad Khan; date </F> and place not given--first two paragraphs TAKBEER introduction]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Dr. Khalid Mush'il, member of  the Hamas political bureau and one of its central leaders, is  visiting Pakistan these days. Dr. Khalid Mush'il joined Hamas  when it was just founded. He became a teacher after finishing  his education in Kuwait University in 1987. During that time, he  also started his own business. However, because of his special  love for Palestine's independence, he spent all his time working  for it. TAKBEER arranged a meeting with him while he was in  Karachi. The editor in chief of TAKBEER, Muhammad Salah-al-Din,  was also present during this meeting. [passage omitted]    Khan: Hamas is active in militant actions in  addition to on the political front. How successful is Hamas on  this front?    Mush'il: Al-Ahmadullah [Thanks to God] it is very  successful. I can say with full confidence about the intifadah's  activities and military operations against the Jewish forces  that 90 percent of these activities are carried out by Hamas  members.    Khan: If a new state is established under the  leadership of `Arafat, will there not be the danger of Israel  using it to eradicate Hamas? Considering that Hamas is already  directly fighting the Jews, what will be your method of  operation when the new country with full government and weapons  support from Israel also rises against Hamas?    Mush'il: The fact is that the job given `Arafat  according to the `Arafat-Rabin agreement is to eradicate all the  opposition parties led by Hamas in Palestine. He will be given  Israel's police force, weapons, and economic assistance for this  purpose. He will have to terminate the Palestinian mujahidin who  are fighting against the Jewish Army controlling this area.  Thus, `Arafat's main responsibility will be to defend the Jewish  Army. At the same time, the Palestinians, especially the freedom  fighters, will be punished for demanding their freedom and  rights. This way he will be doing his duty to protect the Jews.  The Palestinians will receive neither protection nor their  rights. Several of `Arafat's associates have mentioned in their  statements that they will fight against Hamas with the support  of Israel and the state police.    Despite all this, the declared Hamas policy is that Hamas  will never raise a weapon against a Palestinian and its fight is  against the Jewish imperialists who have occupied Palestine  illegally. Hamas knows its responsibility and invites all  Palestinians without any exception to join the struggle for  freedom. Hamas will try its best not to be involved in any civil  war, which the Jews and `Arafat are aspiring to start. [passage  omitted]    Khan: What kind of administrative structure does  Hamas have, and how does it function?    Mush'il: Hamas operates underground in Palestine.  Its organization and leaders do not come out; they work  secretly. There are political and information bureaus of Hamas  outside of Palestine. It has a central committee, officers in  various places, and there are Hamas representatives in some Arab  countries. We have a regular office in Sudan. The leadership in  Palestine and outside work together and consult with each other.  The leaders and shuras [councils] in both places make decisions  jointly. However, these associations are kept totally secret and  no one knows about the council members. Hamas faces a lot of  problems in this effort because, if the Jews learn about a  person having Hamas association, he is sent to jail. Membership  in Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood is a crime in Israel's eyes.    Khan: Where does Hamas get money for its  operations?    Mush'il: We receive donations from all Muslim  countries. Whenever possible all Islamic countries give us  donations. We receive donations from Europe and the United  States also. People are very helpful; however, our income does  not meet our needs.    Khan Where do you get weapons for military  activities?    Mush'il: The main source is the Israeli soldiers.  We confiscate their weapons in confrontations with them. The  second source is the weapons black market. We face a lot of  problems as some of the weapons traders have connections with  the Jews and are actually Israeli agents. At times, the Israeli  Army tries to trap us through these traders. In addition,  weapons bought this way are very expensive. Weapons are not  available in Palestine, and a weapon that can be bought for $700  to $800 in Jordan costs as much as $75,000. [passage omitted]    Khan: What is the purpose of your visit to  Pakistan?    Mush'il: The first purpose in visiting Pakistan  is to inform all segments of Pakistani society, including  intellectuals, journalists, politicians, and Islamic parties,  about Hamas and to spread its message among our brothers. We  want to inform them of the Jewish conspiracies against the  Muslims, warn them about the future dangers, and exchange ideas  of mutual interests and relations of Muslims. The second purpose  is to bring our message to the Pakistani Government and its  policymakers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> 1 WRITER, MANY VOICES MAKE UP COLLECTION;  </P> <P> NO GUARANTEES, BY MELISSA LENTRICCHIA. WILLIAM MORROW AND CO. $16.95, 182 PAGES  </P> <P> Not content to be merely versatile, Melissa Lentricchia reaches for  ventriloquism in her first collection of short fiction. The result is a  one-woman anthology of 10 stories so varied in style and tone that each seems  an experiment; only "Relatives" and "A Love Story in One Act" having anything  in common. Both these stories happen in an Italian-American milieu, an  atmosphere in which the author seems both at home and at ease.  </P> <P> "Relatives" is told in the altogether authentic voice of a homosexual family  member, re-creating his all-too-brief love affair with a distant cousin. While  the narrator is secure and accepted by his relations, his lover is "Lucky" in  name only, still tormented by a mother who calls on holidays "to say things  like, 'Happy New Year from the mother you killed.' " Satiric and poignant by  turns, "Relatives" is an altogether original take on a newly classic theme. In  "A Love Story," the projected voice is raucously, hilariously female, an  amateur opera singer's sweetie vamping the cop who investigates a suspicious  accident involving the singer's archenemy -- the critic who savages his  performances and his avoirdupois.  </P> <P> "The Golden Robe" takes place in the mind of a Mexican woman working as a maid  in Marina del Rey. Here the mood is a heady mix of pathos and melodrama; areas  notoriously difficult to negotiate successfully. "Red Horse Running Through  Water" presents the mysterious tale of the death of Raymond White Eagle. This  time Lentricchia has adopted a kind of Indian syntax: "On the first night Jack  began at what he thought was the beginning that would carry him straight and  smooth to the end. . . ." This counterproductive exercise turns a solemn and  mournful story into a Hemingway parody. "No-Chickens-to-Count-Blues" is offered  as an "anti-fable," a curious category in which the moral remains permanently  elusive.  </P> <P> "Wandalinda" is a physical therapist who runs away with Gypsies to become a  palm reader, a discipline for which she has a truly amazing aptitude. Until  recently plain Linda Miller, this character is one of the author's most  felicitous creations. "From You Know Who" explores the dark underside of  country life from the point of view of an aged and vindictive spinster. Here  the characters are not only remarkable but believable, leaving the reader  dazzled and disconcerted. Striving for a similarly chilling effect, "Some  Enchanted Evening" undermines itself by beginning with its end, thus depriving  the story of a crucial element of suspense. "Ole' Henry" introduces us to a  woman academic obsessed with Henry James. You have to sympathize with a  character whose "thing with Henry began in medias res, when soon-to-be Gloria  was more or less in graduate school at NYU, verging virginally on 30, going by  the name of Ricky or sometimes Rickety, her hair wild, red, her clothes  ranch-style bohemian, her demeanor incognito and incommunicado, her essays all  in one way or another about the fleetingness of phallic images." A writer who  realizes that a monograph by a Ricky on James would be a mistake must be on the  right track, if she'll only stick to it.  </P> <P> Previously published in small literary magazines, these stories are clearly the  work of an author diligently exploring style and form in an attempt to discover  the mode that suits her best. In the Italian ethnic pieces and her excursions  into the hearts of society's female rebels, she seems to have found precisely  what she's seeking.  </P></p>

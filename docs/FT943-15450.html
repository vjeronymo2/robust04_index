			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / OECD guidelines seek to avert double tax Leading industrialised countries have agreed in principle on draft guidelines intended to discourage double taxation of multinational companies' profits and to avert international conflicts between tax authorities. The guidelines, published yesterday in a report by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, lay down principles for treating companies' transfer pricing methods. They follow controversy over efforts by some tax authorities to maximise revenues by, for example, taxing local subsidiaries on their parent companies' worldwide profits. The OECD report strongly condemns such 'unitary' taxation methods, one of whose best known practitioners is the state of California. Last month, the US Supreme Court upheld California's rules after a legal challenge by Barclays Bank. The report says unitary taxation disregards market conditions and is inflexible, arbitrary and imprecise. It says that it also imposes an 'intolerable' administrative burden on companies. The guidelines, drawn up in consultation with leading multinational companies, including IBM, Shell and Unilever, are due to take effect next June. Unusually, the OECD has invited public comment on them before they are finalised. Though they will initially apply only to the central governments of the OECD's 25 members, it is hoped that they will eventually be adopted by other countries and by state and local governments. The guidelines are based on the 'arm's length' principle that related enterprises within a multinational company be treated for tax purposes as if they were separate businesses, so as to ensure that only profits earned in a particular country or state are taxed. The report recommends that the principle should be implemented by using transaction-based methods, such as examining comparable prices in independent companies. It says authorities should use profit comparisons, to determine whether a multinational company is paying its fair share of taxes in their jurisdictions, only as a last resort, when transaction-based methods are not practicable. The guidelines set limits for the use of profit comparisons. The final version of the US rules, published this month, give multinational companies greater freedom in the ways they determine transfer prices and are broadly consistent with the OECD draft guidelines.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART NEWS: A MURAL THAT'S NOT GONE WITH THE WIND  </P> <P> "It's really a trip through the movie," says painter Stephen Verona of his  100-foot mural commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the epic "Gone With the  Wind." "(By viewing the mural) you can walk into this movie and feel all those  famous moments that we've grown up watching in clips all of our lives."  </P> <P> Verona has spent a year making his acrylic-on-masonite mural, which is on view  this week (Tuesday through Saturday) at the Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway,  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "The mural depicts in chronological order the entire movie," said Verona,  adding that he has included such famous scenes such as Tara, the burning of  Atlanta, the Civil War and Twelve Oaks. The "modular mural" also contains  life-size cutouts of the film's stars Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.  </P> <P> Verona, who is also a film maker ("The Lords of Flatbush," "Boardwalk"), said  creating the mural enabled him to bring his two passions together.  </P> <P> The mural was commissioned by Turner Home Entertainment and is scheduled to go  on display at Turner Broadcasting Systems headquarters in Atlanta for "Gone  With the Wind's" 50th anniversary celebrations in December.  </P> <P> GRANTS: The Getty Center for Education in the Arts has awarded $3.75 million in  grants to six U.S. institutions as part of its continuing effort to restructure  the way visual arts are taught in the nation's public schools.  </P> <P> Each institution will receive $625,000 (which will be provided in five yearly  increments of $125,000 and must be matched by each institution) to establish  regional institutes to provide general classroom teachers, art specialists, and  school administrators with intensive training in the theory and application of  the Getty's discipline-based art education program.  </P> <P> The Getty program advocates that art should be taught with the same substance  and rigor as other basic subjects by integrating skills, knowledge and  understanding from the disciplines of art production, art history, art  criticism and aesthetics.  </P> <P> Those institutions receiving the grants are the Florida Institute for Art  Education, the Minnesota Discipline-based Art Education Consortium, Nebraska  Prairie Visions, the North Texas Regional Institute for Educators on the Visual  Arts, the Southeast Institute for Education in the Visual Arts, and the Ohio  Partnership for the Visual Arts/Regional Institute for Educators.  </P> <P> FRINGE: The third annual Fringe of the Fringe Arts Festival in Pomona Valley  begins its month-long festivities on Saturday. Featuring about 500 artists from  the inland communities, the festival will include exhibitions of art, music,  dance, film, theater, poetry, puppetry and storytelling. The festival runs  through Oct. 14.  </P> <P> More than 20 of the area's galleries and museums are scheduled to have shows  coinciding with the festival, and a series of artists' lectures will be held at  4:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Claremont Graduate School Art Building. Opening  the festival on Saturday is a mask parade, sidewalk arts fair and concert at  Claremont's Memorial Park.  </P> <P> For more information or a schedule of events, call (714) 626-4009.  </P> <P> GRANT WORKSHOPS: The Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department is holding a  series of workshops to help artists and arts groups prepare applications for  the city's January 1990 grants.

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Brazilian banks taken over Brazil's central bank yesterday took over two of the biggest state-owned banks in the country, two days before a new government takes power, in a move intended to stop the drain of government funds that were being used to prop up the institutions. The troubled state banks of Sao Paulo (Banesp) and Rio de Janeiro (Banerj) have been making losses for years, and have required big financial support from the federal government to survive. Before the takeover, the central bank was providing funds daily to keep the banks afloat - which was weakening the government's anti-inflation strategy. Their financial condition has deteriorated rapidly since the introduction of the Real plan this year and the consequent sharp reduction in inflation. In a statement yesterday, Brazil's central bank said the aim was to 'restore the financial condition of those institutions and thereby pave the way for a future transfer of their controlling interest'. The current central bank president, Mr Pedro Malan, takes over tomorrow as finance minister, suggesting the move is an initiative from the incoming government to avoid a banking crisis such as that which beset Venezuela a year ago. Bankers said the move, and the explicit suggestion that the banks will be privatised, indicates an active approach in financial policy by the new government.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Top Danish bank launches Dollars 100m subordinated FRNs DEN DANSKE BANK, Denmark's biggest bank, has launched an international offering of subordinated floating-rate notes. The Dollars 100m, eight-year issue is intended to count as upper tier 2 capital. It marks the first time a Danish bank has launched such notes in the international market since the implementation of the EC Own Funds and Solvency Directives in 1990. Under the Basle Accord on capital adequacy, banks must maintain a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent. Half of the total capital must be tier 1 (or core capital), consisting of common equity and perpetual preference shares, and the remainder can be tier 2 (or non-core capital), including dated preference shares, subordinated loans and hybrid debt instruments. Den Danske Bank's Dollars 100m issue has a coupon of Libor plus 110 basis points during the first five years. Den Danske Bank has the right to redeem the notes at par after five years; however if the bank does not call in the notes it will pay a coupon of Libor plus 250 basis points. It has a long-term senior debt rating of Aa2 from Moody's Investors Service, and A-plus from Standard &amp; Poor's. Salomon Brothers said the issue was sold to traditional floating-rate note investors.</p>

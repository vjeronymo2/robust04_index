			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds that Utah's proposed amendment to its definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road,'' as submitted by Utah on September 17, 1992, and as revised by it on March 24, 1993, is no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background on Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 25, 1991, Utah adopted certain revisions to its definitions of ``road'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, along with a supplemental policy statement. On March 1, 1991, Utah, as required by 30 CFR 732.17, submitted those revisions and the supplemental policy statement to OSM for approval (administrative record No. UT&hyph;610). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM did not approve in part the March 1, 1991, submittal in a final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 58846, November 22, 1991) (the final roads rule). In the final roads rule, OSM found that the definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' at section 701(28) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1291(28), and its counterpart in the Utah program require the regulation of certain public roads (56 FR 58846, 68847&hyph;49, November 22, 1991). OSM also found that, when determining whether a road is subject to regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program, the regulatory authority must consider the extent and effect of the mining-related use of the road (56 FR 58846, 58847&hyph;49, 58851&hyph;52, 58854&hyph;55, November 22, 1991). Based on these findings, OSM did not approve Utah's revision to its definition of ``road'' and its supplemental policy statement because, when considered together, they would have exempted all public roads from regulation, regardless of their mining-related use (56 FR 58846, 58847&hyph;49, November 22, 1991). OSM approved Utah's revision to its definition of ``public road,'' but only in the limited context of the rules in the Utah program for designating lands unsuitable for mining (56 FR 58846, 58849&hyph;50, November 22, 1991). OSM also required Utah to make certain amendments to its regulatory definitions of ``road'' and ``public road'' and to withdraw its supplemental policy statement (56 FR 58846, 58857&hyph;58, November 22, 1992.) These required program amendments are codified at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 17, 1992, Utah brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, pursuant to section 526 of SMCRA, for judicial review of the final roads rule ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 92&hyph;C&hyph;063&hyph;G (D. Utah)). On September 4, 1992, OSM and Utah resolved  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by entering into an agreement (the September 4, 1992, agreement). Under the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah agreed, among other things, to withdraw its claims in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  confirm the withdrawal, effective December 5, 1991, from the Utah program of its supplemental policy statement, and to submit to OSM a proposed amendment to the Utah program that would revise the definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 to read the same as the corresponding definitions in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 and 761.5. For its part, OSM agreed to a blanket exemption of certain Utah mine roads from regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah filed a motion with the district court to dismiss  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, Utah did not submit the agreement to the court for review or approval. On September 24, 1992, the court granted Utah's motion and dismissed the case with prejudice. Also pursuant to the agreement, Utah submitted to OSM the proposed amendment that is the subject of this notice. Subsequently, OSM sent to Utah a letter dated May 19, 1993, invalidating the September 4, 1992, agreement to the extent that it exempted certain mine roads existing on September 4, 1992, from regulation under SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;842). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

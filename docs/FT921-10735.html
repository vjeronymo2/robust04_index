			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Genscher proposes states to join EC POLAND, Czechoslovakia and Hungary should be made full members of the European Community 'as soon as possible', Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, said at the close of a one-day visit to Warsaw. Mr Genscher explained that the recently signed association agreement between Brussels and the three central European countries, for a gradual removal of trade barriers on non-farming goods by the end of the century, meant that the path to full membership 'could be shortened'. He added, however, that the moment of full membership would depend on 'economic progress'. Mr Genscher's visit was designed to establish contact with Poland's new government, which met yesterday to give preliminary approval to economic plans for this year. Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the chief minister responsible for the economy, said afterwards that the Polish budget deficit this year would reach 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), a slight increase on 1991, when the deficit touched on 4 per cent of GDP. The deficit, he said, would not be eliminated before 1994, while tax incentives would be introduced this year to boost exports. He did not expect growth to resume until 1993, but did expect that single-digit inflation could come within reach in 1994. Retail prices rose by 60 per cent last year, but by only 7 per cent last month.</p>

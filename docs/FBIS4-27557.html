			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's exports of cars,  trucks and buses in April dropped 16.2 percent from a year  earlier for the 13th straight month, an industry association  reported Monday [30 May].    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, however,  said  exports to the United States climbed 11.4 percent, marking the  first upturn in nine months.    The association said April exports totaled 367,230 vehicles,  with passenger cars accounting for 272,923, down 17.3 percent.    Exports of trucks fell 10.5 percent to 88,756, while  shipments of buses overseas plunged 36.6 percent to 5,551.    The association said exports of automobiles to the U.S.  totaled 135,147, up from 121,367 a year earlier.    Exports to Europe plunged 24.5 percent to 83,456 vehicles,  reflecting sluggish demand on the European market, the  association said.    It said exports to Asia plummeted 43.7 percent, reflecting  flagging demand in China and Thailand.    The April exports, including components and parts, were  valued at 6.91 billion dollars, down 2.4 percent from a year  before, the association said.</p>

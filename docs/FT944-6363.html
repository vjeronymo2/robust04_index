			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Nuclear Electric sale hope recedes Executives at Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power utility, are close to abandoning hopes that the company can be privatised before the next election. In spite of confident statements at the company's interim results presentation yesterday, executives concede privately that the chances of a sell-off being agreed as part of the government's nuclear review are small and declining. One executive said: 'Unless there is a significant change in government thinking in the next few weeks, there will not be enough time for ministers to steer through privatisation before an election.' However, the company is still hoping that the government will accede to its request for a restructuring of the business, with perhaps the Magnox stations being hived off into a separate company. That would increase the chances of privatisation of the rest of the business later in the decade. The review is expected to leave open the possibility of this happening. In the six months to September 30, Nuclear Electric made an operating loss of Pounds 126m (Pounds 118m a year earlier) before adding the nuclear levy on consumers. With the levy, operating profits rose Pounds 2m to Pounds 499m. Part of the reason for the flat performance was the cap on prices in the electricity pool which Nuclear Electric estimates will reduce profits by about Pounds 100m this year, mostly in the first half. The cap was also responsible for an 11 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 779m. Mr John Collier, chairman, said the company was showing its underlying strength by maintaining its forecast of being profitable before the levy next year in spite of the effects of the pool cap. He said the company had reduced unit costs by 8 per cent to 3p during the half year and achieved record productivity, up 20 per cent. It had also become the second-largest generator for the first time in any half year by capturing 25.2 per cent of the market, up from 23.3 per cent in the first six months of 1993-94. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said PowerGen could overtake it for the full year but next year Nuclear Electric could be back in the number two position because of the forthcoming full commissioning of Sizewell B. Manpower fell 57 to 9,397 during the six months. Mr Hawley said the company was on target to become the lowest-cost generator by 1997. Mr Collier said the company's case for privatisation lay at the heart of its submission to the nuclear review. 'Whether it happens, how or when it happens, is of course strictly a matter for our shareholder.' But Nuclear Electric was poised to be another privatisation success story. The chairman said the company would only build Sizewell C, the planned station on the Suffolk coast, if it added to shareholder value. The company believed it would be possible to fund the station entirely in the private sector. Mr Hawley said there were grounds for optimism on contract negotiations with BNFL, the reprocessing company.</p>

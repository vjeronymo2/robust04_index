			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Further losses as equity account ends DISCLOSURE overnight of a significant move in the insurance industry failed to excite the UK stock market for long yesterday. Trading volume remained disappointing and shares were sold down steadily in the second half of the session as the two week trading account in equities closed. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 22.9 at 2,829.9, effectively the low of the day. The Index ended 10.8 down on the week, after steady selling over the last two sessions brought the market back from the 2,868 area touched on Wednesday. The market remained 17.7 Footsie points up over the two week equity account but has been chastened by the absence to date of any downward move in interest rates, either in Germany or in the UK. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also fell yesterday, closing 8.5 off at 3,175.1. The Mid 250 Index has outperformed the blue chips, gaining 10.7 points this week and 9.7 points over the two week account. Much of yesterday's activity was driven by the stock index futures sector where the June contract on the Footsie fell to a discount against the cash market in the second half of the session. But dealers said that both equities and index futures were sluggish. London was depressed at the close when Wall Street opened worth a loss of 8 Dow points in early trade in spite of favourable news on US employment levels. Seaq volume increased to 625.6m shares from Thursday's 568.2m, swollen by intra-market business as the big securities houses balanced positions for the new account which effectively opened last night. Non-Seaq business, at 62 per cent of the day's total, returned to average levels. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.31bn on Thursday, confirming that genuine investment activity has returned to satisfactory levels after a brief setback at the beginning of the week. The strongest features in the market yesterday were the composite insurance stocks, after the news that Transatlantic Holdings, a financial services group owned by French and South African interests, has become one of the largest shareholders in Sun Alliance, with a 3 per cent-plus stake. US sources sold pharmaceutical stocks again at the close of the London market; Zeneca and Glaxo gave ground, while ICI, now purely a US chemical company, continued to move ahead.</p>

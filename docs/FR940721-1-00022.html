			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 6, 1980 (45 FR 29801) and February 7, 1985 (50 FR 5250), USEPA fully approved Michigan's SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act with the exception that Michigan must meet the part D RACT requirements for the ozone SIP. The 1990 Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to satisfy the requirement that the SIP meet all applicable requirements under the 1990 Act, USEPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the amended 1990 Act prior to or at the time Michigan submitted its redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The USEPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due subsequently, continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates [see section 175A(c)] and, if the redesignation of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 110 Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although section 110 was amended by the Act, the Detroit-Ann Arbor area SIP meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, USEPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended (57 FR 27936 and 23939, June 23, 1993) many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. The USEPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Part D Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Before the Detroit-Ann Arbor area may be redesignated to attainment, it must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). As described in the General Preamble for the Implementation of title 1, specific requirements of subpart 2 may override subpart 1's general provisions (57 FR 13501 (April 16, 1992)). The Detroit-Ann Arbor area was classified as moderate (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991), codified at 40 CFR 81.323. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176 as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B1.) Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions. Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator, but no later than 3 years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the amended Act. The USEPA has not determined that these requirements are applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1993_the date the State submitted a complete redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. Therefore, the State was not required to meet these requirements for redesignation purposes. In addition, as discussed below, Michigan has either satisfied the section 172(c) requirements or, as is the case for several of them, they lose their continued force once an area has demonstrated attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) RFP is defined as progress that a nonattainment area must make each year toward attainment of the ozone NAAQS. This requirement only has relevance during the time it takes an area to attain the NAAQS. Because the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has attained the ozone NAAQS, its SIP has already achieved the necessary RFP toward that goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In addition, because the Detroit-Ann Arbor has attained the ozone NAAQS and is no longer subject to an RFP requirement, the section 172(c)(9) contingency measures are not applicable unless the redesignation request and maintenance plan are not finally approved. Such contingency measures must take effect if the area fails to meet an RFP milestone or fails to attain the ozone NAAQS; the Detroit-Ann Arbor area no longer has RFP milestones and has already attained the NAAQS. However, section 175A contingency measures still apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Similarly, once an area is redesignated to attainment, nonattainment new source review (NSR) requirements are not generally applicable. The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements instead of the NSR program (57 FR 13564). The State has an acceptable program for review of new sources (45 FR 29790, May 6, 1980 and 47 FR 3765, February 7, 1985). The PSD program was delegated to the State of Michigan on September 10, 1979 and amended on November 7, 1983 and September 26, 1988. Moreover, as discussed with respect to the NSR requirements of part D, the USEPA believes that the applicability of the part C PSD program to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary to require that an area have obtained full approval of the NSR revisions required by part D in order to be redesignated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The 172(c)(3) requirement for an emissions inventory has been met by submission and proposed approval of the 1990 base year emission inventory required by section 182(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) No additional Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) controls beyond what may already be required in the SIP are necessary upon redesignation to attainment. The General Preamble (57 FR 13560, April 16, 1992) explains that section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of all RACM as expeditiously as practicable. The EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area as components of the areas attainment demonstration. Because attainment has been reached, no additional measures are needed to provide for attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) For purposes of redesignation, the Michigan SIP was reviewed to ensure that all requirements of section 110(a)(2), containing general SIP elements, under the Act were satisfied. Title 40 CFR 52.1172 evidences that the Michigan SIP was approved under section 110 of the Act, and further that it satisfies all part D, title I (as amended in 1977) requirements on May 6, 1980 (45 FR 29801) and February 7, 1985 (50 FR 5250) with the exception that Michigan must meet the part D RACT requirements for the ozone SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

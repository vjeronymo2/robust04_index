			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, February 17 (XINHUA) -- German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl today urged all parties concerned with the conflict  in Bosnia to explore every chance of finding a settlement  through negotiations before the NATO ultimatum expires.    Speaking on German television, Kohl said he had phoned U.S.  President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin about  the Bosnian conflict and the NATO ultimatum during the day.    He said the two presidents should seek a peaceful solution  to  the conflict by taking advantage of the good relations between  them.    The chancellor also announced that Germany will provide  backup support for their NATO allies when necessary.    The NATO ultimatum orders both Bosnian Serb and Moslem  forces  to relinquish control of their heavy weapons in Sarajevo by  midnight on February 20, or face Allied air strikes.    The ultimatum came after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo  street  market on February 5 killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200.    Over the past few days, the international community has  tried  to avert an escalation of the Bosnian war in hopes that the NATO  ultimatum will be able to end the 22-month-long Bosnian war.    Also today, the United States, Britain, and France welcomed  a  Russian proposal to send Russian troops to Sarajevo in exchange  for the withdrawal of Serbian heavy weaponry from around the  Bosnian capital.    But they emphasized that the NATO ultimatum still holds --  heavy weapons must be withdrawn or placed under U.N. control by  the deadline, or face Allied air strikes.</p>

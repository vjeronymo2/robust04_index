			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has held  a joint news conference with the president of Hungary, who is  continuing his official visit to Spain. Felipe Gonzalez said  that Spain will support the process of Hungary's integration  into the European Union once the corresponding period of  adaptation has passed.    Asked about a possible withdrawal of the Spanish blue  helmets  deployed in the former Yugoslavia if the conflict worsens,  Felipe Gonzalez said the Spanish Government will not make a  unilateral decision on this, but rather in the context of the  commitment agreed with its partners in the European Union. He  said, however, that security measures are envisaged and  expressed his hope that the situation will improve. [passage  omitted]    At the news conference on the occasion of the Hungarian  president's visit, Prime Minister Gonzalez said he is against  sending more reinforcements of blue helmets to the city of  Sarajevo, as requested by General Rose. However, he is not  opposed to a change of position by the Spanish blue helmets.  Here is what he said:    [Begin Gonzalez recording] In Bosnia I have to say that the  effort for us is at the limit of our possibilities from the  human point of view -- you know this well. I have said as much  on a number of other occasions. A change in our deployment in  the territory can always be studied, if it were useful, but for  the time being that is not a question which has been raised. We  occupy a place in the territory of great importance from all  points of view, but, naturally, we are open to cooperating with  the other UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in whatever is  necessary.

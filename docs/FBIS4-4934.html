			<p>BFN     [Text] Thai military officials yesterday dismissed  Cambodian Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh's accusations that  Thai soldiers had helped Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot flee a  recent government offensive on the radical faction's  headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia.    "The report is groundless. A convoy of trucks was used, but  only to repatriate Cambodians fleeing the fighting into  Thailand," armed forces spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsana-seni  said.    This was the only instance of a Thai convoy entering  Cambodia  without the permission of the Cambodian government, he said.    Foreign news agencies quoted Ranariddh as saying yesterday  that Thailand had helped Pol Pot flee Pailin.    "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to  prove it," the prince told reporters during a break in the  second session of parliament.    "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being  attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks  driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," he was quoted  as saying.    The prince was adamant that the guerrilla leader escaped  through Thai territory.    "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such  good roads in that region," he said, but did not produce the  photographs.    Anuson said such an accusation could destroy Thailand's  image  and insisted that Khmer Rouge leaders would be arrested and  repatriated if found on Thai soil.    First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo  meanwhile said that the Army would fire a warning shot before  opening fire should there be any further spillover of refugees  into Thailand.    Thai officers along the Thai-Cambodian frontier said last  week that Thai authorities did not provide refuge to Khmer Rouge  forces in the wake of the fighting in Pailin, allowing only  civilians to enter Thai territory.    Ranariddh meanwhile said his government was keeping the door  open for talks with the Khmer Rouge. Reconciliation has been  stressed by King Norodom Sihanouk, who on Friday returns to  Cambodia from China, where he has undergone treatment for cancer.    A Khmer Rouge spokesman in Phnom Penh said the nominal Khmer  Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan, would return to the Cambodian  capital to pay homage to Sihanouk.</p>

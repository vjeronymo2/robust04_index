			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORD VICTOR ROTHSCHILD, 79; ONCE LINKED TO SPY SCANDAL  </P> <P> Lord Victor Rothschild, millionaire banker and a former British intelligence  agent who was once briefly linked to one of Britain's most controversial spy  scandals, has died, his wife said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lady Rothschild said in a statement that her husband died Tuesday at age 79.  </P> <P> She did not disclose the cause of death or other details.  </P> <P> Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild was born into the 200-year-old family  descended from German coin collectors who founded a banking dynasty.  </P> <P> He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College in Cambridge as a  biophysicist.  </P> <P> He succeeded his uncle as the fourth Baron Rothschild in 1937 and took his seat  in the House of Lords as a member of the Labor Party.  </P> <P> At Cambridge in the 1930s he had joined an exclusive debating society known as  the Apostles, which included Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and  Anthony Blunt, who were later exposed as agents for the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In 1986 some parliamentarians called for investigations into whether Rothschild  had also been a Soviet spy. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dismissed the  speculation, and Rothschild strongly denied the allegations.  </P> <P> At the start of World War II, Rothschild joined British military intelligence.  In 1944 he was awarded the George Medal after defusing German explosives hidden  in a case of onions in a ship's hold.  </P> <P> Stylish even while endangered, he carried out the operation with a set of  jeweler's screwdrivers given to him by Cartier.  </P> <P> Rothschild had spent 20 years as an executive with Shell Oil Co. He took that  job after just two months working in the family bank, a job he said he found  dull. But he remained a director of Rothschild and Sons and was chairman from  1975-76.  </P></p>

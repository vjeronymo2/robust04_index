			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Industrial outlook still sluggish JAPANESE industry continues to drift in the doldrums, according to the latest production figures. Industrial output fell by 5 per cent last month from September 1992, and registered a 1.5 per cent rise from the August level, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday. That was better than the market expected, but Miti warned that the month on month improvement is shaky. Companies expect a sharp drop in production next month, followed by a rise in November. The general outlook is sluggish, Miti said. Companies appear to have difficulty in getting rid of excess stocks, down a mere 0.6 per cent from August to December, while the prospects for demand are unclear. Any hopes that overseas markets will help to lift Japan out of recession were further disappointed yesterday when car producers reported that exports fell by 11.7 per cent in the six months to September, compared with the same period last year. That was the sharpest six monthly drop for nearly 15 years, said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. A 31.9 per cent rise in exports to other Asian countries over the six months was not enough to compensate for declines in exports to the US and the European Community, Japan's two main foreign markets, where local production by Japanese manufacturers has been increased. The association expects sales to Asian countries to decline, partly due to China's attempts to cool its economy.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD SUGGESTS STUDY OF STATE LAW COVERING ROLE OF ALTERNATE JURORS  </P> <P> In the wake of delays in the Night Stalker trial caused by the replacement of  one juror, who fell asleep during deliberations, and a second juror, who was  shot to death, Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday called for a study of  revising state law to allow alternate jurors to attend jury deliberations.  </P> <P> "While the alternates may not take part in the deliberations," said Supervisor  Mike Antonovich, "they would be up to date on the jury's discussions and would  be able to immediately participate if their seating becomes necessary.  </P> <P> "This would save time and taxpayers money without impairing a defendant's right  to a fair trial," Antonovich said.  </P> <P> The supervisors directed the county Criminal Justice Coordination Committee to  study the issue.  </P></p>

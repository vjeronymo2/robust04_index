Kolosovskaya; UDC 621.372.8] </F>   [Abstract] A solution was obtained for the problem of  electro-optic interaction of the fundamental mode of a channel  waveguide with the field produced by electrodes. Generalized  variables were used for the solution. Computations were made for  one of the most promising class of integrated optical devices -  modulators on ferro-electric LiNbO[.sup]3[/] type crystals,  where the wave structure is formed by diffusion of additives  from the applied thin film. Based on the analysis of the  solution, the combination was found of the waveguide - electrode  system parameters, which provide the least possible half-wave  voltages U[.sup][/]. It was established that the factor  theoretically limiting from below the U[.sup][/] values in  the red and infrared spectrum region is the maximum value of the  increment of the refraction index attainable in a diffusion  waveguide. The relationship of the minimal U[.sup][/] as a  function of _l_ was constructed for the Ti:LiNbO[.sup]3[/]  waveguides. Introduction of a buffer layer does not change  qualitatively the results of the analysis. Figures 8, table 1,  references 19: 7 Russian, 12 Western.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Courting the attentions of the Old Lady: With the imminent publication of a report into the BCCI affair, UK banks are favouring tighter regulation An odd thing has been happening to the relationship between the Bank of England's supervision department and the chairmen of big UK banks. Several chairmen have privately expressed the view that the Bank should adopt more aggressive tactics in the way it monitors the soundness of banks  -an apparent case of turkeys voting for Christmas. Until recently there was a consensus among bankers that their non-adversarial relationship with the Bank works well. But now some are suggesting that it would be a useful discipline if the supervisors were more interventionist - their lenders, for example, might have shown more caution in the late 1980s if subject to greater Bank scrutiny. The City-wide discussion on banking supervision has been prompted by press accounts of Lord Justice Bingham's forthcoming report into the role played by the UK authorities prior to the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. This long-awaited report is likely to be published next week. The BCCI affair probably does not point to serious flaws in the law relating to bank supervision. It is the implementation of the law which appears unsatisfactory. The main purpose of banking supervision is to protect depositors. At the heart of the 1987 Banking Act is the requirement that no one should take deposits from the public without being authorised by the Bank of England. In deciding whether to give this authorisation, the main issue for the Bank's supervision department is whether a bank is financially sound according to a set of standards described in general terms in the act. The detailed description of the standards are enshrined in a statement of principles drawn up by the Bank of England itself. There are at least two BCCI episodes which indicate flaws in the UK supervisory system. In the first, during the spring and summer of 1990, the Bank should probably have become more directly involved in an attempt to rescue and reorganise BCCI. At the time, Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, had passed to the Bank details of BCCI transactions which were either 'false or deceitful', in PW's words. The Bank, which had long mistrusted BCCI, insisted at the time that the bank would only be allowed to continue in business in the UK if it received a substantial injection of new capital and if its structure was reorganised. This new capital was promised by Abu Dhabi, the Gulf emirate, which also gave a commitment to reorganise BCCI. At the time it may have been justifiable for the Bank to allow BCCI to continue trading, in the interests of protecting depositors, who would have incurred heavy losses if the bank had been wound up. But in view of BCCI's questionable past and parlous financial condition, it might have been advisable for the Bank to place its own representatives into BCCI to ensure that the rescue took place efficiently and speedily. At the least, senior Bank supervisors should probably have established close contact with high-ranking Abu Dhabi officials. Had the Bank been more involved in BCCI's affairs in 1990, it might have uncovered evidence of the systematic fraud which it eventually did discover and which led to BCCI's closure on July 5 1991. There was a second salutary episode in the BCCI affair. Detailed information on the fraud was passed to Bank officials in early 1991. But senior Bank directors, with the ultimate responsibility for any decision on whether to close BCCI, did not appreciate the magnitude of the corruption until the end of June. In the first three months of 1991, PW uncovered details of every major element of the fraud at BCCI. Its partners were part of a team set up by BCCI in October 1990 to investigate fraud at the bank. The team reported to BCCI's investigating committee on February 26 in Abu Dhabi and outlined every substantial area of fraud at BCCI. These included: a cover-up of loss-making loan accounts by transferring funds from other accounts; failure to record deposits; creation of false accounts; the misappropriation of funds managed by ICIC, an offshoot of BCCI; the disguised ownership of US banks in contravention of US law; the extent of losses incurred by BCCI's Treasury division; PW communicated full details to the Bank. But Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank director responsible for supervision, has said that it was not until the Bank received a formal report on BCCI, under section 41 of the Banking Act, on June 22 1991 that he felt able to close the bank: 'The section 41 report completely transformed our view of BCCI,' he told a Commons select committee earlier this year. However, both PW and Abu Dhabi told Lord Bingham that they were surprised that the Bank had to wait for the section 41 report to appreciate the extent of the corruption. What the BCCI episodes indicate is the need for cultural change at the Bank, say bankers. It is thought highly likely that there will be staff changes at the Bank after the publication of the Bingham report. But changes in personnel may not be a full remedy. Had the bulk of BCCI's operations been in the US, teams of bank inspectors would probably have been drafted into BCCI to investigate its affairs and implement the reorganisation planned in 1990. Scrutiny of the Banking Act and the Statement of Principles show that the Bank had the powers to become more directly involved in BCCI's affairs. But in its relationship with BCCI stretching back more than a decade, it showed a consistent reluctance to interfere directly. In part, the Bank may, however, have been hamstrung by a shortage of the appropriate resources. Even today, its supervision department contains only 200 professionals, who derive the bulk of their information from reports supplied by banks and their accountants. The Bank has only 15 executives specialising in on-site examinations of banks and a further 10 investigators who probe alleged Banking Act offences. Both teams should probably be expanded. But the Bank may also need to adopt some US practices and become more interventionist and adversarial in its relationship with banks. In the supervision of banks the Bank has extensive independence from government. Some Treasury officials are arguing that the Bank would be less complacent if it was directly answerable to the Treasury, as is the Securities and Investments Board, regulator of financial institutions other than banks. But given the SIB's difficulty in establishing a clear role for itself, the benefits of government tutelage are not axiomatic. An opportunity to bring about the requisite changes has been presented by the impending retirement of the current governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton. The conclusions of the Bingham inquiry may determine whether the government appoints a sucessor committed to reform and with no ties to the ancien regime.</p>

He held  talks with Iranian Foreign Ministry officials and other  government representatives on that crisis.    The Caucasus has been the site of political and military  clashes for more than five years. Regardless of the mediation  efforts of several countries, the clashes and tension in that  region have not subsided. On the contrary, they have increased.  Reports have said that a large percentage of Azerbaijan's  territory has been occupied by the Armenians. More than 40,000  innocent people in Azerbaijan have either been killed or wounded  and more than 1,000,000 others have been evicted from their  places of residence to become refugees. In addition, the  national monuments and establishments of the two sides have been  destroyed as a result of the war, in which neither side stands  to gain anything. Obviously, the prolongation of the present  state of affairs will lead to destruction and weaken the two  countries.    Considering the need for the establishment of security and  peace and the removal of the crisis in the region, several  countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, have made an  effort to hold talks with the warring sides to end the fighting.  In fact, several international organizations have urged them to  hold bilateral talks to find a political way to end the clashes.  In view of that, the objective behind Kazimirov's visit to  Tehran was aimed at establishing an identity of views with the  Islamic Republic of Iran's officials on the situation in the  Caucasus and finding a way to end the clashes in  Nagorno-Karabakh. It will be recalled that the Islamic Republic  of Iran's officials have tried political initiatives to persuade  Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve their problems right from the  very beginning of the clashes. In fact, they have taken  positive steps in that direction.    The alteration of recognized borders through the use of  military pressure is unacceptable in the world. The maintenance  of territorial integrity is regarded as a most important  principle for peace and security. In view of that, the Islamic  Republic of Iran has urged all the countries to resolve their  problems through talks and reconciliation.    The political experts are convinced that the coordination  that may be established between the Islamic Republic of Iran and  regional organizations and foreign countries, Russia in  particular, will be an effective step to end the war in  Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow softens on doubts over EC prospects Wall Street SHARE PRICES eased slightly in light trading yesterday as investors struggled to digest the implications for US markets of the French referendum on the Maastricht agreement, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 6.22 at 3,320.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.79 to 422.14, while the Nasdaq composite lost 0.54 at 588.58. NYSE turnover was 154m shares. The narrow margin in the French vote on Maastricht  - 51 per cent in favour of the agreement, 49 per cent against  - eased tensions on world financial markets, but in the eyes of US investors the result failed to clear away doubts about the long-term viability of either the treaty or the whole question of closer European economic integration. Analysts said the key was the future direction of German interest rates. Equity market sentiment was also undermined by the dollar's weakness and losses on domestic bond markets. The US currency slid about 1 1/2 pfennigs to DM1.4835 as international investors bought D-Marks following the French vote, while fears that lower interest rates in Europe might rekindle inflationary pressures in the world economy left US Treasury prices lower. The benchmark 30-year bond was down half a point in early afternoon trading but recovered to end only a quarter-point lower. Those same fears of inflation have led some analysts to suggest that investors might shift out of interest rate-sensitive sectors of the stock market and into cyclical areas such as energy and technology stocks to protect against the long-term threat of higher prices worldwide. Among the busiest stocks yesterday was insurance group Travelers. After a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, the stock jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 in turnover of 2.2m shares as investors welcomed Sunday's news that financial services group Primerica had invested Dollars 722.5m in Travelers in return for a 27 per cent stake in the troubled insurer. The market was particularly impressed by the news that Mr Sanford Weill, chairman of Primerica, will play a key role in the running of Travelers' operations. Primerica was down in early trading but ended Dollars  1/4 ahead on balance at Dollars 41 1/8 . AT&amp;T put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 in spite of broking house Paine-Webber lowering its 1993 earnings estimate for the telecommunications giant because of sluggishness in equipment sales. PaineWebber still has a 'buy' rating out on the stock, however. Canada A RENEWED drop in the Canadian dollar returned traders' thoughts to domestic ills and pulled Toronto stocks sharply lower. The long-awaited Maastricht vote in France ended up having little direct effect on the market. Investors instead were concerned about Canada's own referendum on the unity deal. Former prime minister Mr Pierre Trudeau entered the debate with an article slamming the deal. The TSE 300 index fell 25.0 to 3,420.0 and declines led rises by 363 to 212 after volume of 27.4m shares.</p>

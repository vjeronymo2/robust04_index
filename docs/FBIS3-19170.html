Fires erupted  on both ships as a result of the collision. The fire on the  freighter is under control, but the fire on the tanker loaded  with fuel continues. Two persons were killed in the accident,  29 were wounded, and 23 crew members from both ships are missing.    Our correspondents have learned that the Greek Cypriot  tanker  (Nafia), which was entering the strait from the Black Sea,  collided with (Sharprock), a freighter sailing toward the Black  Sea, at around 2230 last night. Fires erupted on both ships as  a result of the collision. The freighter, in flames, ran  aground at Anadolu Kavagi. The fire was gotten under control  early this morning. The tanker, also in flames, sailed on out  of control for a while. The tanker had loaded 50,567 tonnes of  fuel in Russia and was on its way to Italy. It hit rocks in the  Cakar region near Rumeli Kavagi and ran aground. The tanker is  250 meters long and weighs 66,820 tonnes. The fire continues to  rage and explosions are occurring.    Fire fighters from the Port Authority and from the Istanbul  Fire Brigade are at work. Two fire-extinguishing ships have  sailed from an Izmit refinery to help with the efforts to put  out the fire.    State Minister Yildirim Aktuna, Istanbul Governor Hayri  Kozakcioglu, and Istanbul Mayor Nurettin Sozen went to the site  of the incident. Kozakcioglu said that the fire does not pose a  threat to the residents in the area. He noted, however, that  the fire will continue for some time. The governor said that  there were 30 crew members aboard the (Nafia). Of them, 23 were  wounded, one was killed, and six are missing. There were 24  crew members on the freighter, of whom one was killed, six were  wounded, and 17 are missing. The governor said that there are  reports of bodies on the freighter, but they have not been  reached yet.    State Minister Aktuna said that efforts are being made to  ensure that the tanker remains where it is. ANATOLIA reports  that Aktuna said that the (Nafia) has 10 oil tanks and that  three of them are empty and three are burning. We are cooling  the four other tanks, he said, to prevent them from burning,  too. He explained that measures have been taken to prevent the  burning tanker from being dragged toward the Bosphorus by the  wind. He stressed that residents in the area need not worry and  that every necessary measure has been taken.    Minister of Environmental Affairs Riza Akcali said that the  incident proves once again how Turkey is right when it says that  transporting fuel through the straits has risks and might be  very dangerous for Turkey. In a statement to Turkish Radio and  Television, Akcali stressed that the international agreement on  the traffic through the straits must be reassessed in accordance  with present conditions. Akcali went to Istanbul to check the  site of the incident.    State Minister Ibrahim Tez said that after the accident, the  relevant crisis centers have been activated and that the  Istanbul Strait has been closed to maritime traffic. He pointed  out that barriers have been sent to the area to prevent the  spread of oil leaking from the tanker. He noted that there were  no traffic guides on either of the ships. He also said that  even though there is no danger of a big explosion on the tanker,  the ships at the Kavak Pilot Station, in Altinkum, and in  Buyukdere Bay have been evacuated as a precaution.    [Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish at 0600 GMT on 14 March  reports that the freighter (Sharprock) is Greek and that at  least eight persons are dead, 18 are missing, and 23 are  injured.]</p>

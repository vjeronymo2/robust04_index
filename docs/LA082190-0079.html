			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG HOMICIDES INCREASE 69% IN L.A. COUNTY AREAS;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: AUTHORITIES BLAME HEAVY FIREPOWER, IMPACT OF POVERTY AND APPEAL OF A  'TRENDY' IMAGE.  </P> <P> Gang killings in unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County soared 69%  during the first eight months of this year, a period during which all violent  crimes in the same region rose 20%, according to figures released Monday.  </P> <P> The homicide increase is concentrated in the southern and eastern portions of  the county where gang activity has been a constant problem, Sheriff's  Department officials said.  </P> <P> Deputies and representatives of agencies whose primary mission is to deal with  gangs offered a range of theories why the rate of gang-related murders has  risen so suddenly and so high. The reasons vary from the powerful armaments  being carried by gang members to the worsening impact of poverty and the  growing appeal of the gang image in urban pockets.  </P> <P> "It's become trendy to belong to a gang," said Steve Valdivia, executive  director of County Youth Gang Services, which counsels youths, monitors gang  activity and educates the community about gangs. "Innocent kids are dressing  like gang members . . . and getting blown away for it."  </P> <P> Valdivia also cited a major influx of immigrants from Latin America and other  Third World areas "who have adopted the gang lifestyle and are not as fearful  of law enforcement in this country as they were in their homelands."  </P> <P> Wes McBride, operations sergeant for the Sheriff's Department, placed the  blame, among other factors, on worsening social conditions in the urban core.  "To find the hot spots for gang activity all you do is lay a poverty map over  Los Angeles County," he said. "The social conditions surrounding poverty create  a ripe gang environment; some people see crime as the only outlet available to  them."  </P> <P> According to the statistics, 103 gang slayings were committed in unincorporated  county communities this year, compared to 61 during the same period a year ago.  That compares to 116 gang murders committed in the same parts of Los Angeles  County in all of last year.  </P> <P> "It's a humongous increase," McBride said.  </P> <P> Within the city limits of Los Angeles gang-related murders rose, but not nearly  as dramatically. During the first six months of this year -- the last period  for which statistics were available -- police reported gang homicides up 12.4%  </P> <P> The rapid rise in these gang crimes coincides with a dramatic increase in gang  membership, officials said.  </P> <P> According to law enforcement authorities, the estimated number of gang members  in the greater Los Angeles area has doubled in the past five years. In 1985,  these officials estimated there were 50,000 gang members in the region. This  year, that number is placed at 100,000.  </P> <P> Many of the newest gang members are Latinos, who are dying in gang-related  violence in record numbers.  </P> <P> "In the first half of 1989, we had 20 Hispanic-versus-Hispanic gang murders,  compared with 47 so far this year," said Undersheriff Robert Edmonds.  </P> <P> "The gang problem is out of control but law enforcement cannot take care of it  alone. We need to come to grips with it together -- the county, law  enforcement, schools, parents."  </P> <P> The worsening gang homicide statistics have prompted the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office to consider reassigning prosecutors to its  overloaded gang division, and has renewed calls for additional funding for  community anti-gang programs.  </P> <P> "The gang murder rate is up and I need more people to effectively prosecute,"  said Mike Genelin, who heads the Los Angeles County district attorney's  hard-core gang unit. "Theoretically, that means we'll have to fault another  area because our entire office is constrained to work within a budget."  </P> <P> Among the communities patrolled by sheriff's deputies, the largest increase in  gang slayings was reported in Lynwood, where there have been 23 gang homicides  to date. There were 13 murders reported there during the same period last year.  In Industry there have been 10 such slayings so far this year, compared with to  a year ago.  </P> <P> "This weekend I had between 10 and 15 reported shootings and two weeks ago I  had 15 shootings," said Lynwood Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Holmes. "I don't know the  reason why. I wish I knew."  </P> <P> The picture is not all bleak.  </P> <P> In the once-notorious jurisdiction of Los Angeles' South Bureau, the number of  slayings continued to decline. Police and community activists credit law  enforcement crackdowns coupled with gang intervention programs for the steady  decrease that has gained the attention of communities throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> The South Bureau's Southeast Division reported no gang-related killings during  the month of July for the first time in years.  </P> <P> "Things we're doing are paying off," said South Bureau Deputy Chief William  Rathburn. "We're targeting specific gangs and gang members, and we've improved  our intelligence and analysis-gathering ability."  </P> <P> "At the same time, gang intervention groups such as County Youth Gang Services  are working very hard here," added Rathburn, "and we are organizing youth  programs we run out of the police stations such as basketball, soccer and  baseball."  </P> <P> Even as the new statistics were being released, the body count continued to  rise in greater Los Angeles as 22 people died in violent confrontations over  the weekend.  </P> <P> The weekend slayings included the deaths of three gang members in Los Angeles  and a man shot when rivals in a passing car fired an assault rifle at a crowd  celebrating the birthday of a 9-year-old in Pomona, authorities said.  </P> <P> In a separate attack, a 26-year-old man was was shot several times early Monday  morning while standing on a sidewalk in a South Los Angeles neighborhood known  for gang activity, authorities said.  </P> <P> In response to the worsening gang picture, Sheriff Sherman Block has scheduled  a meeting for October in hopes of mobilizing elected officials and community  leaders from gang-plagued communities.  </P> <P> "The growing problem of gang killings is a tragic phenomenon that must be  addressed by all law abiding citizens," said sheriff's spokesman Doug McClure.  "It is hoped that this meeting will result in a clear commitment to start on  the long road to a resolution of this appalling situation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Statistics on gang crimes depend largely on how law enforcement agencies do  their counting. The Los Angeles Police Department defines gang-motivated crimes  as those resulting directly from gang activity. Gang-related incidents are  defined as those in which the assailant or the victim is a gang member, but  where the crime does not necessarily result from gang activity. The Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department, by contrast, makes no distinction between  gang-motivated and gang-related crimes, placing all such crimes in a single  category.  </P> <P> MORE GANG KILLING  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reports a 69% increase in gang  homicides in unincorporated areas for the first eight months of the year.

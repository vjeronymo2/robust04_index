			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo], said in Maputo yesterday that he  does not accept that demobilized government and Renamo soldiers  should only be paid 35,000 meticals per month. [passage  omitted] Do the state coffers have the funds to pay 82,000  meticals to each demobilized soldier? According to Afonso  Dhlakama, they do.    [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I think so. For God's sake, I  think funds are available. We are not demanding that each  Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] soldier or every Renamo  combatant should be paid 1 million meticals per month. That is  not the case. We are not going to demand what the government  cannot pay. The Mozambican Government at least has 82,000  meticals. If it does not pay it is because [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] If the government insists on its position  you  said you would be willing to raise money from the trust fund.  [preceding two words in English] Is that decision final?    [Dhlakama] That is my position. Tomorrow, I will speak on  the phone to members of the Renamo National Council in the  provinces because I am very shocked. I know that the trust fund  does not have enough money. Although the trust fund is designed  to pay for Renamo's transformation from a political movement  into a political party, Renamo must also remember the most  trying moments. After all, all those (?youngsters) will return  home, their bodies covered in tree leaves and sacks, and with  (?a few meticals). I cannot do that. I am not doing it as mere  political propaganda. The soldiers ought to have some  conditions. I will do my best because the trust fund is not  enough. I am not favoring Renamo guerrillas. Soldiers from  both sides will be demobilized. They are Mozambicans and my  brothers. [end recording]    Reacting to Dhlakama's position, Labor Minister Teodato  Hunguana, the government's number two in the Supervision and  Control Commission, said the figures mentioned by the Renamo  president are false. Cited by NOTICIAS, Hunguana said: Those  figures are only designed to create subversion or even revolt  among government soldiers. What Renamo should do right now is  to organize itself at once in order to ensure that soldiers of  the two sides are demobilized at the same time.    NOTICIAS also contacted Government Major Eduardo Lauchande  who categorically denied that the government would pay 82,000  meticals to each private, as alleged by Dhlakama. Lauchande  said all troops will received their demobilization allowances in  line with the ranking system in force in the government's army.  At present, the government pays 32,000 meticals to privates per  month, while third and second noncommissioned officers receive  82,500 and 106,500 meticals, respectively. First  noncommissioned officers receive 139,000 meticals per month. In  addition to a six-month allowance to be paid by the government,  demobilized soldiers will receive an additional allowance paid  by the international community, amounting to between 75,000 and  600,000 meticals.</p>

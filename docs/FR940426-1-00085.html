			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Timing of Reductions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the OTC recommendation calls for adoption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the LEV program in the OTR in 1996, providing two years lead-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to auto manufacturers with the LEV standards applicable to model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year 1999 vehicles. The benefits of this program are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent upon turnover in the vehicle fleet. As referenced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, EPA is thus mindful that this schedule for the LEV program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not generate reductions in time to assist areas in meeting a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate area 1996 and will generate only minimal reductions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the serious area 1999 attainment deadline. More benefits would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be available for severe areas with a 2005 or 2007 attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline. The importance of when upwind reductions are necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for downwind attainment, and when the LEV program will generate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such reductions raises a number of important issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, in order for the LEV standards to apply in model year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999, EPA may have to reach a decision to approve the OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation by the end of 1994. This may be an important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor supporting EPA's action within the nine month statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timetable based on the best available current information. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 177 of the Act, States may adopt motor vehicle emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards identical to California's standards if ``California and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State adopt such standards at least two years before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator).'' Under EPA's current regulations, model year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999 may begin as early as January 2, 1998 (See 40 CFR 86.082&hyph;2). To provide two years lead-time, States might then have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt California's standards by January 2, 1996 in order for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards to apply for model year 1999. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  If EPA were to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the OTC's LEV recommendation, section 184(c)(5) provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that EPA's finding of SIP inadequacy is to require that States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revise their SIPs to include the LEV program within one year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the finding. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, if EPA is to require that States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt the LEV program and submit SIP revisions by January 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, then EPA must make a finding of SIP inadequacy no later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than January 2, 1995. Delays in an EPA decision could delay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of an approved program, and would further delay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits and the degree to which such benefits could contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to timely attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An issue in litigation in New York and Massachusetts has been whether the model year and two-year lead-time requirement under section 177 may vary for different manufacturers that begin their model years at different times, or whether the model year begins for purposes of section 177 for all manufacturers as soon as the model year may begin for any manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is not entirely clear whether EPA has discretion to give States less than one full year to submit their SIP revisions. Under section 110(k)(5), EPA ``may establish reasonable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months after such notice) for submission of such plan revisions.'' The more specific provision in section 184 that lacks the explicit grant of discretion from section 110(k)(5) itself arguably indicates that EPA does not have such discretion. EPA requests comment on this view. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, EPA believes the time when the LEV program would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generate reductions also relates to the locations where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions are needed for purposes of relieving contribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transported pollutants that interfere with timely attainment. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appears that the LEV program will generate reductions in time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to help areas to achieve attainment by the severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification deadline of 2005 or 2007. States in the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> northeast portion of the OTR, including Rhode Island,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, contain no such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. EPA believes that its recent considerations in response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ozone transport problems in a letter to Senator Carl Levin <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  and in subsequent March 21, 1994 letters to the Massachusetts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Environmental Protection and the Conservation Law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foundation (CLF) <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  may be relevant to the timing of LEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions. In particular, certain moderate nonattainment areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have raised a concern that they may not be able to themselves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt controls to ensure attainment of the ozone standard by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 deadline for areas classified as moderate because air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution transported from upwind may be the dominant factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting for their nonattainment problem. The solution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplated in the section 184 transport provision is for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible upwind areas to relieve their significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution so that the downwind areas may attain on time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Still, in certain cases this view could be at odds with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall title I scheme that establishes later deadlines for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment in more polluted areas and also establishes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduated program of additional and more stringent requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be accomplished in those areas over the longer time-frame. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accelerating controls in the upwind areas is impracticable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain facts related to ozone transport could be shown, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested it might consider reasonably interpreting the Act to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant the downwind areas additional time to reach attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the dates specified in section 181(a)(1). EPA concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its letters to Senator Levin and the CLF by indicating that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing to develop policy to address this problem. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the relevance of this policy here. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, reductions generated over time through fleet turnover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to vehicles meeting LEV standards could be more important in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assisting areas in reaching attainment by later deadlines. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any moderate or serious areas in the OTR have until later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999 to attain, this could affect the utility of the LEV program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such areas to reach attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Mary D.

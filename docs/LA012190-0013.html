			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VETERANS' AFFAIRS  </P> <P> After almost 40 years, the long- awaited memorials are finally being erected  and dedicated to and for both the living and dead veterans of the Korean  "Conflict."  </P> <P> For the purposes of a book, I would appreciate hearing from readers who served  in that war (June, 1950-July, 1953). I am interested in what kinds of welcomes  awaited the returning veterans when they set foot on U.S. soil again.  </P> <P> What did their loved ones, their families, friends or local citizens say to  them? How were they received back into their communities? What kind of  obstacles confronted them as newly returned veterans from such a distant and  relatively unpopular war?  </P> <P> GEORGE LIPPONER, 49 Midland Blvd., Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y. 11779  </P></p>

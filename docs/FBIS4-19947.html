			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "GATT: Italian Farm Groups </F> Criticize Accord"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 19 -- A drop in exports, the  compression of farm income -- with its consequent expulsion from  the productive cycle of tens of thousands of farming outfits --  thereby leaving more and more farmland fallow and unproductive  are the negative repercussions Italian agriculture must grapple  with because of the recent accord forged within the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Italian farm organizations consider this accord insufficient  and in a joint communique, Coldiretti [National Confederation of  Small Farmers], CIPA [Italian Confederation of Agricultural  Experts], and Confagricoltura [General Confederation of Italian  Agriculture] today insisted that the new international regime  for farm products would prove deleterious for this primary  sector in Italy and especially for those particularly  Mediterranean products such as wine, olive oil, olives, fruit  and vegetables.    These organizations are calling for a reform of the relevant  joint market organizations within the European Union [EU] and  revised guidelines which take into account the increase in EU  resources that will be brought about by Community enlargement to  include Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria.</p>

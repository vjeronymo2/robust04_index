This corresponds to the treaty on  reducing conventional armed forces in Europe. A more  substantial reduction had originally been envisaged. The army's  significance, however, will increase appreciably, among other  things, because of the continuing conflicts in the former  Yugoslavia and in the southern regions of the former Soviet  Union, said Oldrich Holecek of the Defense Ministry's Press  Department. At the moment, the planned number of Czech Army  personnel is 92,599. The actual number is somewhat lower.  Roughly a third of the army is made up of career soldiers. In  two years, however, professionals should make up 50 percent of  the army, while soldiers on their basic service should make up  the other 50 percent.</p>

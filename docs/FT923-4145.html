			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Poseidon Gold unit in powerful return to black COMPANIES in the Poseidon Gold group, the Australian mining empire controlled by Robert de Crespigny, have reported mixed results for the year to June. Poseidon Gold, the main group operating company, made a strong return to the black after a big loss last year, mainly induced by a ADollars 194m asset write-down. In the latest year, the company turned a ADollars 202.2m (USDollars 144.40m) loss into a ADollars 49.2m profit on a 50 per cent increase in sales to ADollars 675.1m from ADollars 449.2m. The annual dividend has been raised to 9 cents a share from 5 cents. The results were improved by the inclusion for the first time of results from ACM Gold, acquired by Poseidon in April. Mr de Crespigny said the result was achieved despite weakness in the gold price. Poseidon's equity share of gold production more than doubled to 890,059oz from 437,155oz. During the year the company raised its stake in Mt Leyshon Gold Mines to 75.6 per cent from 44.6 per cent, but Mt Leyshon's earnings fell to ADollars 17.6m from ADollars 30.2m.</p>

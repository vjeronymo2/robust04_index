			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Two sides of the BES The Business Expansion Scheme has spawned two new companies. HarleyScreen, sponsored by Matrix Securities, is looking for money to back its work developing and expanding an HIV and AIDS testing service. It raised Pounds 151,750 during the last tax year, and has raised Pounds 297,000 in total from subscriptions. Providing it raises a further Pounds 53,000 via BES investors, it will receive a further Pounds 250,000 from venture capital organisations. Keele Cash, sponsored by Capital Ventures, is less speculative. Money from the scheme will be used to buy accommodation for Keele University. Keele has promised that in five years it will buy back the accommodation, paying Pounds 1.25 for every Pounds 1 spent now.</p>

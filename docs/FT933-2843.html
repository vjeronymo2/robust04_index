			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Citibank to buy out Hungarian venture minority CITIBANK Overseas Investment, part of the big US bank, is to take full ownership of its Hungarian joint venture by buying the 20 per cent held by the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The joint venture, Citibank Budapest, was set up in 1985. It made Ft1.36bn (Dollars 14m) profit after tax in 1992 on a prime capital of Ft1.93bn. Citibank Budapest has concentrated on operating with local subsidiaries of international companies and has helped create new capital markets, like that for commercial paper. It announced yesterday a Ft2bn commercial paper issue for Ciba Hungaria, part of the Swiss Ciba-Geigy group. Recent national banking legislation called for the central bank to dispose of shareholdings in domestic banks. These stakes were built up at a time when the authorities were reluctant to allow foreign entities full ownership. The central bank is soon expected to sell its 20 per stake in Unicbank, another joint venture bank. The buyer is expected to be Austria's Raffeisen group, which owns 72 per cent of the shares. There is greater uncertainty surrounding the future of the the National Bank's 34 per cent stake in Central-European International Bank (CIB), in which it is partnered by five western banks. CIB, the first and largest of Hungary's joint venture banks, has special offshore status. Its offshore classification exempts CIB from Hungarian reserve requirements and, rivals claim, gives it a competitive advantage. Hungary's finance ministry is pushing hard for the central bank to give up its stake and to relinquish CIB's offshore status. Hungary's joint venture banks have succeeded in winning big customers from the large state-owned commercial banks, which have had to wrestle with provisions against loan losses. A recent World Bank report said that most of Hungary's commercial banks were 'technically insolvent under international accounting standards'. Competition for top-tier clients in Hungary is increasing as western banks set up branches in Hungary. Credit Lyonnais is due on Friday to inaugurate its Budapest office.</p>

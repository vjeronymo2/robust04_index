The Board of Governors will hear a report from IAEA Director  General Hans Blix about the inspection work by a group of  inspectors on North Korean facilities but North Korea threatened  Monday to quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A  North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that  Pyongyang has "no alternative" but to (?reactivate) 1993  decision to leave the international pact on the nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons.    The U.N. nuclear watchdog body is expected to pass a  resolution that will refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the  U.N. Security Council, Agency sources said.    If the matter is referred, the Security Council may discuss  possible economic sanctions against North Korea, the sources  said.    China, one of the five permanent members on the Security  Council, may oppose any tough action against North Korea with  which Beijing has maintained close relations, they said.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during weekend  meetings with Chinese Premier Li Peng, voiced grave concern over  North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, saying  the international community's patience is nearing its limit.    Li told Hosokawa that the international community should try  to solve the problem through patient negotiations.    Li also said it is important to give North Korea "what it  needs." The Chinese premier, however, did not specify what North  Korea needs.    A group of IAEA nuclear experts returned from North Korea  earlier this month after being unable to verify whether nuclear  material had been diverted from a radiochemical laboratory in  Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.    Amid mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula over North  Korea's suspected nuclear development program, the United States  and South Korea are moving toward resuming the Team Spirit  military exercises.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam instructed his ministers  Monday to consult with the United States about when to hold the  Team Spirit military exercise, Presidential Press Secretary Chu  Ton-sik said.    Seoul's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported South Korea and the U.S.  plan to deploy Patriot air defense missiles at U.S. military  bases in South Korea next month.</p>

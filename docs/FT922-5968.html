			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Turkey-Russian debt pact paves way for gas deal TURKEY and Russia have agreed terms for settling an outstanding debt owed by Moscow, paving the way for a new gas trade accord, worth Dollars 290m (Pounds 163.8m) in 1991. During a two-day visit to Moscow this week, Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkish prime minister, won assurance from Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, that Russia would repay a Dollars 35m debt over the next three months. In addition, Russia has agreed a Turkish request that proceeds of the gas trade be paid into the Turkish Eximbank in Ankara, rather than the Vnesheconombank, the bank through which former Soviet foreign debt is paid. Under this week's deal, Russia assumes contractual responsibility for the natural gas contract first agreed with the former Soviet Union in 1984. However, the two sides have still finalise details on changes on both the price and volume of the gas shipped. Turkish-Russian trade, worth Dollars 1.7bn in 1990, collapsed with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This week's talks were aimed at finding new ways to facilitate the accord under which Russia is obliged to dedicate 70 per cent of the hard-currency proceeds to purchase Turkish goods and services and 30 per cent as a free exchange portion to repay credits extended by the Turkish Eximbank. Turkey is projected to face a domestic power shortage, and has asked Russia to boost gas volumes from the current 4bn-5bn cu metres to 8bn to satisfy growing energy demand. Russia is seeking to renegotiate the price under the original contract, using central European benchmark crude prices rather than Mediterranean prices, on which the present arrangement is based. This year, Russia is committed under best-effort terms, to buy Dollars 140m-worth of Turkish goods and services. Turkish officials say Russia has also pledged to buy an extra Dollars 73m-worth of goods, representing amounts unrealised from 1991. Turkey's Eximbank, which has extended more than Dollars 1bn-worth of export credits to the Soviet Union, says that in June it will renew its credit programme with Russia. All new Eximbank credits to Russia were frozen after Vnesheconombank's moratorium on its Dollars 60bn debt to western banks last year.</p>

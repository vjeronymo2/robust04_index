			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TARGET OF BITTER LAWSUITS;  </P> <P> TOP BUILDER IS ACCUSED OF SHODDY WORK ON HOMES  </P> <P> Beverly Vedder was so upset by angry phone calls from homeowners that she  occasionally broke down and cried.  </P> <P> "I was reduced to tears at times," testified the former secretary for giant  housing developer Kaufman &amp; Broad. "I was overwhelmed."  </P> <P> Of the many homeowner grievances that Vedder received, one especially stuck in  her mind. It came from owners of a home in the Riverside area who complained  that the bathroom floor in their new house slanted so badly that they had to  hold on to the toilet to keep from sliding off.  </P> <P> That and similar complaints from other homeowners in the Riverside area were  initially ignored by Kaufman &amp; Broad, Vedder testified. She said company  officials seemed to think that "if this was pushed aside long enough it would  go away."  </P> <P> The complaints have not gone away, however, and are now at the center of an  uncommonly bitter and prolonged lawsuit between Kaufman &amp; Broad --  California's largest builder of single-family houses -- and dozens of  homeowners in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad officials dismiss most of the allegations in the suit as  sour grapes by disgruntled or misinformed former employees and characterize the  Riverside litigants as fortune-seekers manipulated by unethical attorneys who  are trying to capitalize on honest and fixable errors. The company maintains  that it consistently builds quality houses at reasonable cost to fulfill the  American Dream of home ownership.  </P> <P> "The Riverside litigation is driven by plaintiffs with unreasonable  expectations and fueled by greedy lawyers," said company chief executive Bruce  Karatz.  </P> <P> But accusations emerging from interviews and testimony under oath in  depositions taken by homeowners' attorneys in the 4-year-old lawsuit tell a  story of dozens of dream homes gone bad.  </P> <P> It is a story that began with the promise of that increasingly rare commodity  in California: quality housing for first-time home buyers at affordable prices.  But, according to customers and former employees of Kaufman &amp; Broad, the  promise of quality was frequently compromised by fast-paced construction  schedules, and homeowner complaints of shoddy workmanship often were ignored.  </P> <P> Privately, some construction workers laughed about the quality of the homes  they were building in Riverside and even referred to them as a "joke,"  according to the testimony of one former construction employee.  </P> <P> Dozens of homes were built in Riverside and neighboring Corona without proper  plans and, when serious structural problems appeared, company officials tried  to cover them up, according to sworn statements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gifts for Inspectors  </P> <P> In addition, Kaufman &amp; Broad gave liquor and substantial gifts to building  inspectors who were responsible for enforcing construction code standards, and  one inspector from the city of Riverside approved homes without even looking at  them in order to help the company meet its construction schedule, according to  a sworn admission by the inspector and other sworn statements.  </P> <P> Homeowner litigation is common in the building industry, and it cannot be  determined with certainty how the quality of Kaufman &amp; Broad homes compares  to those of other large developers. But the company has been at the center of a  series of high-profile controversies.  </P> <P> The Riverside County lawsuit marks the fifth time in two decades that Kaufman  &amp; Broad has been accused of serious misconduct, ranging from bribery to  substandard construction practices. The district attorney's office in Riverside  County is examining transcripts of witnesses' testimony gathered in the civil  case, but no charges have been filed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FTC Probes Complaints  </P> <P> The Federal Trade Commission staff is also looking into complaints of shoddy  building practices in connection with the Riverside suit, according to Thomas  Massie, attorney with the FTC enforcement division in Washington. Kaufman &amp;  Broad is currently operating under a 1979 FTC consent order based on alleged  substandard building practices.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad officials insist they have fewer problems than the building  industry norm, saying that they have sharply increased the time and money spent  on ensuring that buyers are happy.  </P> <P> The firm has built more than 175,000 homes worldwide in the last 32 years,  fewer than 1% of which have problems, company officials say. The company  contends that nearly a quarter of its buyers say they have gotten favorable  recommendations from other Kaufman &amp; Broad homeowners.  </P> <P> "We are not perfect, by any means," company chief executive Karatz said. "Our  products are built by hand, in the heat, rain and wind. This is a people  business and people can make mistakes. In the vast majority of incidents, we  take care of these mistakes quickly and to our customers' satisfaction."  </P> <P> The company has received numerous industry design, architectural and marketing  awards in recent years. "For the volume they do, they're an exceptional  company," according to Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leading Builder  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp., as the Los Angeles-based company is now  formally known, occupies an important corner of the California housing  marketplace as a leading provider of shelter for the middle-class. Its  customers are commonly young couples acquiring a home for the first time.  </P> <P> The company expects to build more than 4,000 homes this year statewide, largely  in fast-growing, metropolitan areas. The prices average about $160,000  statewide, which is inexpensive by California standards.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad's financial fortunes have never looked better. Profits have  reached record levels and sales are expected to surpass $1 billion this year  for the first time following a reorganization last year that turned Kaufman  &amp; Broad Home Corp. into an independently owned and operated company.  </P> <P> But the firm has a long history of serious problems, ranging from criminal  convictions in Chicago in the early 1970s to homeowner lawsuits all over  California in the 1980s.  </P> <P> One of the Chicago cases involved a former president of Kaufman &amp; Broad of  Illinois who pleaded guilty to bribing a federal building official with three  cases of liquor while he was head of the company. In the second case, in 1973,  Kaufman &amp; Broad was fined $50,000 after pleading no contest to charges that  the company was involved in bribing officials of suburban Hoffman Estates in a  zoning change scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chicago Investigation  </P> <P> The company also was under such heavy fire from dissatisfied homeowners in the  Chicago area that the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into the  firm's building and sales practices dating back to the late 1960s.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad promised the public and its investors that it would do  better. "We've learned our lesson," company Chairman Eli Broad told a trade  journal in 1972. "The industry has to increase its quality and learn to treat  consumers differently."  </P> <P> By 1979 the FTC had completed its investigation, and without admitting guilt,  Kaufman &amp; Broad signed an agreement that it would cease such practices as  false advertising, building substandard houses and furnishing model homes with  undersized beds to make rooms look larger than they actually were.  </P> <P> By 1980, the company was again in criminal trouble, this time in Santa Clara  County Superior Court where it was fined more than $200,000 in connection with  charges that it induced Milpitas city inspectors to falsify building inspection  reports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cases of Liquor  </P> <P> Company documents obtained by authorities investigating that case indicate that  Kaufman &amp; Broad routinely offered cases of liquor to city, county and  utility company officials with which the developer dealt in Northern  California.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad officials admit that the company has had problems in the  past, but they say they are ancient history and irrelevant. And they say they  have fired any employees found guilty of wrongdoing.  </P> <P> "The company is as different today as . . . Chrysler is today versus 15 years  ago," chief executive Karatz said.  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago, Kaufman &amp; Broad was a far-flung company with operations  across the United States and Europe. But the firm has since cut back and now  operates primarily in California and France.  </P> <P> "We thought it was impossible to meet a standard (of excellence) in multiple  markets," Karatz said. "We decided to focus on a few areas and do it well."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints Continue  </P> <P> Despite the new smaller-is-better philosophy, serious customer complaints have  continued into the mid- and late-1980s, interviews and court records show.  </P> <P> In the Northern California town of Novato, for example, 88 townhouse owners are  suing Kaufman &amp; Broad, charging that their homes were so poorly constructed  that many of them must be reframed and that whole walls must be ripped out and  rebuilt.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad's own building expert corroborated many of the homeowners'  complaints in a sworn deposition taken by the San Francisco law firm of  Alexander Anolik, representing the homeowners.  </P> <P> The 1984 suit, concerning homes built in the early- to mid-1970s, is scheduled  for trial this month, but Karatz noted that "lots of settlement discussions are  going on." He declined to discuss the homeowner allegations in the case.  </P> <P> But of all the complaints by buyers of Kaufman &amp; Broad homes, perhaps the  most acrimonious are the ones in Riverside County, where several lawsuits have  been filed in recent years involving new housing tracts near the Riverside  Freeway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bitter Standoff  </P> <P> Although some of the litigation has been settled in recent months, a major  lawsuit remains in a bitter standoff. That suit, which involves 34 homeowners,  is scheduled to go to trial next March.  </P> <P> Karatz believes the homeowners no longer want to fix the problems but are  simply seeking "money, lots of it." In related cases that have been settled out  of court, the firm has agreed to fix the homes or buy them back at fair market  value. Both offers also include compensation payments.  </P> <P> Karatz has also attacked the plaintiff's attorneys, claiming he can see the  "venom in the eyes" of one of the lawyers, Christopher P. Ruiz.  </P> <P> "It's the defense of the desperate: 'Kill the lawyers,' " replies Ruiz, whose  high-rise office is just a few blocks down Wilshire Boulevard from Kaufman  &amp; Broad's corporate headquarters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sending a Message  </P> <P> E. Allen Tharpe III, a senior partner in the firm for which Ruiz works, said  the homeowners have turned aside settlement offers because they are furious  over the company's previous behavior. "They want to send a message to the  building industry that they can't get away with this kind of behavior," Tharpe  said.  </P> <P> According to interviews and an extensive review of depositions and court  records, here's what went wrong in Riverside:  </P> <P> Although the homeowners charge that their houses are badly built throughout,  central to their case are homes built with second-story overhangs, known as  double cantilevers, at the rear and sides of the houses.  </P> <P> In late 1983 and early 1984, after they moved into their houses, it became  clear to some of the homeowners that something was seriously wrong: the  second-story bedrooms slanted, the bathtubs did not drain properly, the toilets  tilted, and gaps had opened between walls and baseboards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Notified  </P> <P> The case came to the attention of top management at Kaufman &amp; Broad in the  spring of 1984 when Martin G. Roberts, then head of the firm's Southern  California operations, said he got a call from a homeowner whose tub did not  drain properly.  </P> <P> Roberts said he became curious when he found similar complaints in the company  files and asked Gary Clark, then director of operations, to explain.  </P> <P> Roberts testified that Clark ultimately acknowledged that he had changed the  design of the homes by extending a single overhang at the rear of the houses to  the sides as well, in effect turning a single-cantilever home into a  double-cantilever design.  </P> <P> It was a change that Clark made in the field without the advice of an architect  or engineer because it provided more room upstairs in order to help  salespeople, who were "having a tough time selling that particular house  because the rooms were too small," Roberts said in a deposition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confirmed by Subcontractor  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Valdemar Montalvo, president of the framing company that did  subcontracting work on some of the Riverside homes, confirmed that he added the  second overhang without new plans or engineering at Clark's request.  </P> <P> Concerned about the problem, Roberts testified that he told Karatz what he had  learned and recommended that Clark be fired because of the design change, among  other reasons. Clark did resign, but Karatz then hired him back over Roberts'  objections.  </P> <P> Karatz "did not feel we could fill Clark's shoes and still maintain the number  of closings (completed homes) that we had projected for the year," Roberts  testified. Roberts said he resigned shortly afterward.  </P> <P> Karatz denied Roberts' assertions regarding Clark and maintained that Roberts  himself was asked to leave the company rather than resigning on his own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Points to Plans on File  </P> <P> Clark has testified that a bona fide set of plans was used to build the  double-cantilever homes. And while Karatz admits framing errors were made on  the homes, he refutes allegations that the overhangs were improvised and points  to a set of double-cantilever plans on file with the federal Veterans  Administration.  </P> <P> Veterans Administration construction analyst Ernest Mentas, now retired, signed  a sworn statement last June that he did indeed sign such a set of plans in  April, 1983, prior to construction of the double-cantilever homes.  </P> <P> Construction plans are submitted for approval to the Veterans Administration to  provide a measure of protection for veterans applying for federal loans. For  homes carrying a 10-year warranty -- as did the Kaufman &amp; Broad houses in  Riverside County -- the structures are inspected by federal officials only  after completion.  </P> <P> Local inspectors from the cities of Riverside and Corona were responsible for  ensuring that the homes met building code standards at various stages of  construction, such as the pouring of foundations and framing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Witnesses  </P> <P> But no such double-cantilever plans for the homes in question can be found on  file in the building departments of Riverside or Corona, and other witnesses  besides Roberts and Montalvo testified that no bona fide plans were used to  build the overhang sections of the homes.  </P> <P> "Kaufman &amp; Broad's production schedules were such that there was no time to  get the plans or calculations drawn up and submitted for approval," said Lou  Baxter, former general superintendent with the company. "Production went  forward immediately."  </P> <P> When homeowners began complaining that their floors were sagging, company  service representatives were told to cover up the fact that the problems were  caused by a structural defect, according to sworn statements.  </P> <P> Peter Sorenson, a director of customer service for Kaufman &amp; Broad for  seven months in 1984-85, said in a sworn statement this spring that company  Vice President Frank Scardina "gave me the impression that he wanted me to lie  about the problem and deny and cover up the fact that a problem existed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Stucco Theory  </P> <P> Sorenson also said company officials misled homeowners by telling them that  stucco applied to the outside of their homes would prevent further sagging of  the cantilevered overhangs.  </P> <P> "The stucco theory was created to cover up the truth and hide the fact that the  homes had a structural defect," Sorenson said in a deposition. "In fact, both  Lou Baxter and Frank Scardina told me that the application of the stucco made  the double-cantilever problem worse. . . . When Frank Scardina told me about  this 'stucco theory,' I thought it was a joke. We both laughed about it for  some time."  </P> <P> However, Baxter insisted in a sworn statement that he did indeed believe the  application of stucco would prevent further sagging of the second-story  overhang, while Scardina denied having any such conversation with Sorenson.  </P> <P> Angry homeowners in Riverside also maintain that their homes might not be  flawed if public building inspectors had not been so chummy with Kaufman &amp;  Broad.  </P> <P> Riverside city inspector Dean C. Johnson, now retired, admitted in a sworn  statement that he received gifts from Kaufman &amp; Broad of at least 120  2-by-4s, 60 sheets of plywood sheathing, 20 to 30 gallons of paint, four window  frames, plastic piping, a countertop, a garbage disposal and miscellaneous  hardware. Johnson, who testified in exchange for a promise that he would not be  sued, said the company gave him and other inspectors liquor as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inflating the Price  </P> <P> A sworn statement by former company tract superintendent John Davis maintains  that Clark arranged for a subcontractor to pour a cement slab for Johnson's  mobile home and to hide the cost of the slab by inflating the price of other  work billed to Kaufman &amp; Broad.  </P> <P> "In order to bury the costs for this labor and material," said Davis, "Gary  Clark told me to tell the subcontractor . . . to overbill Kaufman &amp; Broad  for . . . work which was actually done." Johnson denied in a sworn statement  that the gifts were bribes, but he nevertheless admitted routinely falsifying  inspections of Kaufman &amp; Broad homes at the request of company construction  superintendents.  </P> <P> Johnson said he frequently declared on official city reports that houses had  been properly finished when in fact they were incomplete. He also stated that  in many cases he signed final inspection reports for houses he looked at only  from the curb or not at all.  </P> <P> Sometimes Johnson would not even require the company to obtain city building  permits for houses until after foundations were poured and framing was to  begin, according to a document in the suit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 50% Lapse Admitted  </P> <P> Davis said in his sworn statement that "Johnson on occasion would allow certain  aspects of the beginning phases of construction to move forward without a  building permit in order that Kaufman &amp; Broad's production schedule would  not be held up."  </P> <P> In a sworn statement, Johnson admitted that in 50% of the homes in the Kaufman  &amp; Broad tracts, he did not make legally required inspections of framing,  insulation, exterior lath and wallboards, rough or final electrical wiring,  rough or final plumbing and other elements of construction.  </P> <P> Kaufman &amp; Broad denies giving presents to inspectors in Riverside County or  improper relationships with the officials, pointing to an official company  policy against making such gifts.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Riverside County district attorney's staff is reading  through the volumes of sworn testimony in the case. "It's something we're still  interested in," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Randy Tagami.  </P> <P> Staff writer Ronald B. Taylor and researcher Tracy Shryer contributed to this  story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HISTORY OF PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Problems involving Kaufman &amp; Broad housing construction have brought  accusations ranging from bribery to substandard construction, in cases dating  back almost two decades.  </P> <P> YEAR  </P> <P> PLACE  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> ACTION  </P> <P> YEAR  </P> <P> 1972  </P> <P> PLACE  </P> <P> Chicago  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> Former president of Kaufman &amp; Broad of Illinois indicted for bribing a  federal building official with $800 and three cases of liquor while head of the  company.  </P> <P> ACTION  </P> <P> Former president pleads guilty to offering liquor as bribe and building  official pleads guilty to accepting bribe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> YEAR  </P> <P> 1973  </P> <P> PLACE  </P> <P> Chicago  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> Bribery, tax fraud  </P> <P> ACTION  </P> <P> K&amp;B fined $50,000 after pleading no contest to charges that firm was  involved in bribing officials in suburban Hoffman Estates to obtain zoning  change.

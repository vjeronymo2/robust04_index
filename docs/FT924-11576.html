			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Dividends; it's time for caution - Serious Money DOOMSDAY for dividends? That is the sombre title of a new review of the investment trust sector from County NatWest's gurus Hamish Buchan and Robin Angus. The premise is that the cuts in dividends which have been occurring across the UK corporate sector have yet to be felt by investment trust shareholders. There is a natural lag in the system, with trusts still paying out dividends earned in 1991 and early 1992. But the corollary is that trust dividends will really start to show the pain in 1993. Some may be able to meet the deficit by drawing on their revenue reserves (which is what reserves are for). But other high-yielding trusts may have few reserves to draw on. They might therefore try to maintain dividends by buying high-yielding securities, at the expense of capital performance. In short, the investment trust sector cannot escape the pain being suffered in the real economy. County points out that UK corporate dividends fell in nominal terms in the year to August, for the first time since 1967. Meanwhile dividend cover - the ratio of corporate earnings to dividend payments - has slumped to well under two, below the historical average. This implies that, even when profits recover, dividends will not grow in line. Before this sounds too gloomy, one should emphasise County's view that 'there is no cause for undue concern about the large diversified trusts or income trusts.' For example, Foreign &amp; Colonial, the biggest trust in the sector, is given a 'strong' dividend paying rating by the County team. One should also point out the problem highlighted on Page III, namely that returns from building societies are falling. With bonus cuts in the life industry and the unit trust also facing dividend payment problems, private investors should not be frightened away from investment trusts altogether; the sector might still offer better returns than the other options. Investors have to learn that returns across the savings field are likely to be lower for the next few years than they were in the 1980s. Single rather than double digit returns may be the norm. So the best strategy might be to make switches within the investment trust field, rather than to abandon the sector altogether. Back in April, I suggested that those who had opted for the M&amp;G Income Investment Trust Pep in the 1991-92 tax year might consider a transfer, now that the rules have changed to allow a full Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance to be placed in an existing, rather than merely a new issue, trust. The argument still applies. The M&amp;G trust stands at a 9 per cent premium to its asset value; you can buy perfectly respectable long-standing trusts at a 10 per cent discount. A switch might result in a temporary loss of income, but it should boost the long term prospects for both income and capital growth. Sadly, the market has moved against you. In April, you could have made the switch and still have seen a profit on the 100p issue price; yesterday morning, however, the packaged units were down to 95p. Which trusts should you switch to? County NatWest cite a number of trusts which rank as 'strong' dividend payers, including Electric and General, Foreign and Colonial Smaller Companies, River &amp; Mercantile Extra Income and Value &amp; Income. All the above stand at a discount and qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 Pep. But a stockbroker should be able to advise you on the most suitable trusts and the transfer costs. Another part of the investment trust sector which came under scrutiny this week was zero coupon preference shares. These have been popular with private investors, because they offer the prospect of tax-free gain (for those who do not use up their annual CGT allowance). In a new report, Smith New Court argues that the market has failed to give sufficient weight to portfolio yield when valuing stocks. The argument is similar to County Nat West's. The assets of most split capital investment trusts have to grow substantially to repay the zeros. If the trust's portfolio consists of high-yielding assets, then such capital growth might be impossible. So the higher the portfolio yield, the worse for the zeros. After assessing these factors, Smith New Court cites the zeros of the following trusts as 'very good value': Exeter Preferred, Finsbury Growth, New Throgmorton, Sphere and TR Technology. The following zeros are ranked as 'dear': Abtrust Preferred, Contra-Cyclical, EFM Income, Exmoor Dual, Olim Convertible and Scottish National. Such is the complexity of these instruments that private investors with large lump sums should take expert advice from a stockbroker before plunging into the sector. But the small saver who is investing Pounds 50 a month into a large general trust via a savings scheme should not be too panicked by all these calculations. Provided they are saving for the long term - at least five years - the investment trust remains one of the cheapest and most attractive vehicles in the market.</p>

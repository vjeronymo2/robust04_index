			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FRENCH NAME DAVIS CUP SQUAD  </P> <P> Yannick Noah, Henri Leconte, Guy Forget and Jean Fleurian were named to the  French Davis Cup squad today to face Australia in a first-round match on the  grass courts at Royal Kings Park in Perth on Feb. 2-4.  </P> <P> French Tennis Federation officials announced the team at the Australian Open.  </P> <P> Fleurian is the newest face on the squad. His selection was based on his  Australian Open results -- he reached the third round and upset No. 7 seed  Emilio Sanchez in the opening round.  </P> <P> The Australians will be playing under less than ideal circumstances, having  lost likely singles starter Mark Woodforde to an ankle injury. Former Wimbledon  champion Pat Cash is on the team, but has not played singles for the past 10  months after undergoing surgery on an Achilles tendon.  </P></p>

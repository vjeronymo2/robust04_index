			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Technology (Software At Work): The IT team strikes gold - Computers are running the show at the Barcelona Olympic Games There is one British team in Barcelona with no hope of a medal, though it may well deserve one. It shares one of the most nail-biting, but tedious jobs at the Olympics, sitting in a windowless cavern watching ranks of computer screens on which - it hopes - nothing happens. If a screen flickers, a problem has to be fixed immediately. Without the computer systems the 800 commentators and thousands of press and media people serving millions of viewers worldwide will have no results, no information. The entire Olympic 'family' relies on a army of computer experts, supported from a secret bunker. The Committee for Organising the Olympics at Barcelona (COOB) has undertaken a vast one-off software project to support the Games, on a scale that would frighten most commercial organisations. Its systems run everything to do with transport, accommodation, administration and security, as well as delivering the results and all media information. The project is extraordinary for several reasons - its scale, its scope, and the fact that there is no continuity. This is the first Olympics for everyone on the project. And there is no chance to improve the system - it must work the first time. The media plays an important role in the Games. Although various sponsors make a significant contribution, such as Coca Cola, and in the case of the computer equipment, IBM, COOB's balance sheet relies heavily on the income from media sources. The largest single presence is the US National Broadcasting Corporation, for whose peak-viewing time many of the events are scheduled. A visit to the weightlifting arena demonstrates the amount of IT required to cover each event. The small stage on which the muscle men sweat and groan is the central focus for the television cameras. Beyond, ranks of computer screens slope back from the stage. These prime sites are for journalists. In front of them are the judges, also at computers linked to the results system and display boards. Above them sit the sound controllers (even the national anthems are computerised), and behind them the spectators. Behind the scenes there is a press room, just for the weightlifting event, served by another clutch of computers. The size and complexity of the information network is staggering. Local area networks (Lans) are installed in converted swimming pools, conference centres and other sundry buildings pressed into service for the Games. The network supports 4,400 PS/2 computers in 45 venues, each Lan linked to the IBM mainframe in the secret bunker. On the software side, COOB commissioned several different companies to write various systems, all of which work together. The systems are in English, French, Spanish and the local variant, Catalan. IBM's sponsorship dictated that all the systems were developed in IBM-compatible software tools. Security underpins every project to do with the Olympics. The data support site is bomb-proof and self-sufficient in power and light. It even has its own telephone exchange. In case of disaster, there is a second 'shadow' installation with another mainframe. An IBM banner above the control centre reads 'El 92 en bones mans' - Catalan for 'Safe in our hands'. Josef Bertran is one of four information technology managers at the Centre for Information and Operation Technology (CIOT), located at another secret site. 'This is all going to happen just once. We simply have to be ready, and we can't make mistakes,' he explains. 'In the past year we have been going to hundreds of competitions trying out the system and running it live.' There have been changes, he says, all along the line, constant revisions and adjustments discussed with the various software partners. In setting the specifications for the systems, COOB recognised the difficulties of the 'clean sheet' presented by the 1992 Games. The International Olympic Committee only audits the plans, making sure that all is up to standard in terms of facilities and security. There was no history of software management on which to draw. COOB recognised that it would not find sufficient skills, equipment or staff locally, so it turned to major software suppliers for the bid. The job of facilities management (FM) - running the computer and all its software - was won by a consortium headed by pan-European software house Sema. Sema combined with Spanish software developer T&amp;G (which it has now absorbed) to beat a French consortium. The FM team is two-thirds British, one-third Spanish. Sema also won a development contract for the accreditation system, known as SIGO. This registers every member of the 140,000 strong Olympic family - competitors, volunteers, administrators, press, government representatives, technicians and others. The system issues them with hologrammed badges which serve as their keys of entry to the venues. In addition, the system manages COOB's role as a travel agent, meeting, accommodating, transporting and organising facilities for 50,000 people daily. The various components manage accommodation in the Olympic village (24,000 capacity) or in hotels and boats (25,000), plus arrivals and departures, press facilities, ticketing, medical services and scheduling of events. The transport system alone manages 2,500 vehicles operating 8,000 separate pick-up and set-down points. Another system co-ordinates the 30,000 volunteers, 2,000 staff and 3,000 sub-contractors. The information system, known as AMIC, gives biographies and details of all the competitors - right down to the age and breeding of the horses in the equestrian team. AMIC is available to the entire Olympic family on 2,000 terminals. The rigorous system auditing seems to have paid off. Morale is high at CIOT despite dozens of users crammed into a warren of rooms. Telephone conversations and simultaneous keyboard tests take place in various languages. Catalans predominate, but there are Yugoslavian, Serbs, Croats, Mexican, American, French, English and Japanese staff at CIOT. 'The interest in the Games for our people is so high that it's not like an average company,' says Jordi Lopez, director of telecommunications. 'We have all been working 14 to 18 hours a day.' Although the COOB contract is by no means Sema's largest, according to managing director Pierre Bonelli, it has engaged fierce loyalty from its participants. Senior project manager Paul Reynolds is angry that such effort should not be preserved as a facility for the next Games. 'There are so many organisations with vested interests that it will all go to waste. It's not owned by anybody, so there is no incentive to keep it going. It could be a valuable asset, the ideal sports information database for any events worldwide.' The system will not go entirely to waste, however, since it is being used at the Mediterranean Games next summer. Although the Atlanta organising committee is still considering bids, it has expressed interest in parts of the current set-up. 'They don't want to reinvent the wheel,' says Rupert Deighton, IBM's sports service manager for Europe. But if any other hardware vendor gets the 1996 contract it is highly unlikely that this particular software will ever run again. BUZZWORDS FACILITIES MANAGEMENT refers to the handing over of an installation and its maintenance, including software and hardware, to an external supplier. LOCAL AREA NETWORKS mean the linking together of terminals or PCs, usually in one location, so that they can share common resources.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bridgestone to halve Japan capital outlay Bridgestone, Asia's largest tyre manufacturer, is to halve its domestic capital expenditure because of poor demand in Japan. The company intends to spend Y22bn (Dollars 203m) during 1994, compared with Y44bn last year and a peak of Y65bn in 1992. Capital investment is unlikely to increase much above Y22bn over the next three years. Bridgestone is suffering from the sharpest fall in Japanese vehicle production for 19 years. Output of vehicles last year fell 10.2 per cent to 11.2m. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association projects it will fall below 11m vehicles this year. Bridgestone refused to identify which projects it would cut. It said spending would be on productivity improvements and savings rather than capacity expansion. However, it stressed its overseas investment programme would continue. The group is building a second plant in Thailand, due for completion in 1996, and expanding plants in Warren, Nashville, Brazil and Indonesia.</p>

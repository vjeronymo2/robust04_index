			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports from occupied Kashmir speak of widespread  demonstrations and strikes against the Indian military siege of  Dargah Hazratbal [shrine] to prevent the devotees from ziyarat  [paying respect to] of mue-i-mubarak [holy hair] on the occasion  of Merajunnabi [anniversary of prophet Mohammad's ascension to  heaven].    The demonstrations were particularly violent in Srinagar,  Baramula, Kupwara, Anantnag-Islamabad, Sopor, Badgam, and  Pulwama. The demonstrators raised slogans and demanded complete  withdrawal of Indian troops from around the dargah. Meanwhile,  repressive siege and search operations by the occupation forces  continue unabated all across the valley. The mojahedin in  retaliation attacked the Indian troops and killed three of them.  Three mojahedin were martyred in a clash near Badgam. Three  bullet-riddled bodies suspected to be killed by the Indian  troops have been recovered in Kupwara.</p>

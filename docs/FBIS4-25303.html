			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, June 7 (XINHUA) -- The second stage of the  China trade and investment forum was held in Australia's largest  city of Sydney today with a view to attracting more Australian  investors to China.    The first phase of the forum was held in Melbourne early  this  month, with the presence of Chinese Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang  of foreign trade and economic cooperation and Australian Trade  Minister Bob McMullan.    Officials said that during the two-day forum held in  Melbourne, 147 letters of intent had been signed, which  indicated a great interest the Aussie businessmen have shown in  the forum.    The 147 letters of intent covered mainly on power stations,  railway technology and petrochemicals.    The purpose of the forum, the largest ever held in  Australia,  is to brief the Australian business on China's investment  environment, its investment policy and laws.    It also aimed at increasing their understanding of China and  furthering the development of bilateral economic and trade links.    More than 100 businessmen from China's 20 provinces and  cities attended the forum and have brought with them over 500  projects, valued at seven billion U.S. dollars.    The projects cover the fields of communications, energy,  petro- chemical industry, electronic industry, textile industry,  building materials, agriculture, and service industry.    China and Australia enjoyed a two-way trade of three billion  U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29 percent  over the previous year, according to China's official figures.    More than 200 Australian company representatives  participated  in the forum held in Sydney today.</p>

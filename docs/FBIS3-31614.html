			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Leader of Russian Liberal Democratic Party,  Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, is to visit Poland on 12 March  at the invitation of Janusz Bryczkowski, chairman of the  Sammoobrona-National Front, who met Zhirinovskiy today in  Moscow. Here's Andrzej Siezieniewski from Moscow. [passage  omitted]    [Begin recording] [Siezieniewski] Zhirinovskiy will take  part  in the first congress of the National Front. His will probably  stay several days. Asked about the agenda of the visit,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said:    [Zhirinovskiy with superimposed Polish translation] Janusz  Bryczkowski promised to prepare the whole program. There will  be meetings with social organizations, representatives of  business and journalists. We will want to pay a visit to some  places of national remembrance.    [Siezieniewski] Asked if he is not afraid, that his remarks,  for instance about the corridor from Germany to East Prussia  across Poland, will not ensure a good reception among the Poles,  Zhirinovskiy said:    [Zhirinovskiy] I spoke about it as a possible course of  events. If the leaderships of Russia and Poland do not take  preventive actions in due time, then the West will try to move  its border further. I was in Germany and I know that there are  forces willing to regain Moravia, Silesia, or Prussia. I  stress, however, that what I was saying was just an outline of a  possible scenario for the development of events. We would like  that Poland and Russia were linked by good relations, that we  finally break with, to a certain extent, the hostility that  existed between us. [end recording]    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed the hope that his visit to  Poland would serve the rapprochement of our both Slavonic  nations.</p>

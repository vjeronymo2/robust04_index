			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 26 Apr (DPA) -- At least 40 public sector  union organizations decided to go on a 48-hour strike on Tuesday  to protest the privatization program of the Liberal  administration headed by Sixto Duran-Ballen. The strike  coincides with the closing stages of the campaign by provincial  deputies, advisers, and councilmen seeking reelection in the 1  May elections.    The unions expressed their opposition to the privatization  program in general and in particular as it relates to so-called  strategic sectors such as petroleum, electricity, and  telecommunications.    Recent announcements related to electricity cuts and fuel  interruptions have not yet materialized, but the government has  announced through Carlos Larreategui, secretary general of the  administration, that it could take a tough stance against the  union leaders, warning that it could even put them on trial.    In the meantime, the Education Ministry suspended classes at  all schools and universities throughout when teacher joined the  48-hour strike. Indian groups also decided to support the unions  and threatened to block all highways to keep "Ecuador from being  auctioned off to foreign interests."</p>

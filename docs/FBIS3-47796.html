			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The ruling coalition and  the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party failed Wednesday  [19 January] to narrow differences over the government's  political reform bills.    The coalition was poised Wednesday night to vote on the  package at the House of Councillors Special Committee on  Political Reform.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said his party will not  resume talks with the coalition Wednesday over possible  revisions of the package.    Eleventh-hour talks between the coalition and LDP took place  earlier in the day in an attempt to compromise on LDP demands to  modify the bills. The talks involved Juro Saito, chief of the  LDP's House of Councillors members, Manso Hamamoto, Saito's  Social Democratic Party counterpart, and Hiroshi Tsuruoka, his  Komeito [Clean Government Party] counterpart.    The government package cleared the lower chamber on November  18.    The coalition holds a slim majority in the upper house. Some  dissent in the Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the  coalition, and the LDP have made the passage of the package  unclear.    Hosokawa has staked the fate of his six-month administration  on the passage of the package during the current Diet session,  which ends on January 29.</p>

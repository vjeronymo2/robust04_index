			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Project that posed a real banking challenge  -The complexities of financing the Lesotho Highlands water scheme THE Maastricht summit was a picnic in comparison with getting this project financed said Mr Perry Farmar, lighting his seventh cigarette in less than an hour. One had to wonder whether he was a smoker until his bank, Chartered WestLB, took on the task almost four years ago of finance adviser to the Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.37bn) Lesotho Highlands Water Project. It is not the size of the project that makes it unique. Nor even that the country paying for it is not the country responsible for the project. But mix these complexities with the fact that the two countries - Lesotho and South Africa - involved had to count among the world's worst investment risks when the project was mooted five years ago, and you have a unique financing challenge. When financing was finally sealed late last year, the offshore funding alone involved 25 different facilities co-ordinated by seven lead banks in six currencies, five multilateral agencies and five government aid programmes. At least five South African banks are providing the bulk of R4.4bn (Pounds 870m) of commercial loans and export credits. 'The complexity of the loans, by their terms, characteristics and inter-relationships, has been a real banking challenge,' says Mr Farmar, the director at Chartered WestLB who has been most closely involved in its role as project finance adviser. And this is just Phase 1A of the project. By the late 1970s South Africa was anxious at the prospect of running short of water by the mid-1990s. The best long-term new source lay in the gushing streams and rivers of Lesotho's Maluti highlands. That was when the World Bank first began looking at the project, at the request of the Lesotho government. More than a decade later, the first stage of a project is taking shape which will enable Lesotho to meet its own water needs, to become self sufficient in electricity and to sell South Africa all the water it needs. South Africa is footing most of the bill. In resource-poor Lesotho, the water is called 'white gold'. Phase 1A of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project involves two consortia comprising 12 international companies. The consortium led by Impreglio of Italy will build a 180-metre-high dam at Katse, to be the highest dam in sub-Saharan Africa. The second consortium, led by Spie Batignolles of France, will construct 70km of tunnels. Long term plans, stretching to the year 2020, involve four dams. The first task in mounting the project was to ensure Lesotho rather than South Africa was responsible for the project. As one of the world's poorer countries, its status in attracting concessional aid and financing terms was essential. But Lesotho had none of the collateral needed to guarantee loans. The problem for Chartered WestLB, then called Standard Chartered Merchant Bank, was to persuade potential lenders to cough up long-term funds for a project whose sole customer was to be South Africa, which not only had acute debt problems of its own, but was also shunned for political reasons by the international financial community. The result: what is probably a unique arrangement where providers of funds will be repaid not by the South African government, but by a London-based trust. Despite early headaches with the trust approach - not least among them that trusts are almost wholly unknown among German and French banks - it offered several advantages: it provided a safe buffer for banks uncomfortable about a direct relationship with South Africa. it put all lenders on an identical footing in terms of rights to repayment. it meant that if South Africa were to default on debt service payments, it would automatically fall foul of all lenders - including the World Bank and national export credit agencies. A second original aspect of Chartered WestLB's approach was to require contractors bidding for the work to come to the table with organised financing, while at the same time holding a separate 'beauty contest' of banks interested and able to lead the funding of the project. These banks were then introduced, without commitment, to the bidding consortia. This saved time, and gave appropriate emphasis to the importance of the financing package in selecting the preferred bid. It is probably no accident that the five banks who 'won' the beauty contest became the lead banks for the project - Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais of France, Dresdner Bank and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau from Germany, and Hill Samuel from the UK. Alongside them were the multilateral agencies - principally the World Bank, which lent Pounds 110m, and Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation, which has loaned Pounds 20.7m. In the hope of attracting the best possible financing package, Chartered WestLB won agreement for a 'more the merrier' approach to initial bids. This 'post-qualification' of bidders, contrasting with the normal World Bank requirement for pre-qualification, meant that 35 bidding groups initially threw a bid into the ring. This was filtered to 12 groups, and finally to five serious bidding consortia. This process added to the time taken to appoint the winning contractors, but created competitive pressures that probably succeeded in securing better financing terms. A full percentage point was pared from rates by use of 'competitive pressures'. Commercial loan periods stretched to six years. Another two months, and the whole project would have been in jeopardy. Long-term OECD consensus interest rates of 8.3 per cent, agreed at the outset because of Lesotho's status as one of the world's poorest countries, would have had to have been revised upwards in line with prevailing consensus lending rates if funding had not been agreed by December. Even now, long-term rand financing has to be finalised. The small local financing market was first wooed for R135m, with this bridging loan then being replaced by a larger facility of R750m. The final facilities, in which South African banks take the lead, should be signed this month. A total of R4.4bn has been raised. 'It has been a huge undertaking, and taken longer than anything else we have done,' recalls Mr Farmar. 'Our original contract was for 18 months, but even after three weeks I knew it would take at least two and a half years. In the end, it has taken three and a half.' The reward was clearly a handsome fee. But on that Mr Farmar remains coy.</p>

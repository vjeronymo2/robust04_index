			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: Rupert Brooke: no relation Sir, Michael Arditti is to be congratulated on his article 'Drama at the Marlowe Society' (Arts, February 20). However, he is in error in suggesting that Rupert Brooke was in any way related to my late father. Apart from a writer of doggerel verse, we have no poets in our family. Justin Brooke, Chymorvah Vean, Marazion, Cornwall TR17 0DQ</p>

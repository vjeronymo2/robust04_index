			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING TO 1992;  </P> <P> BRUSSELS: A CAPITAL CASE OF EURO-ITIS  </P> <P> On the train coming into Brussels, a pleasant tape-recorded voice welcomes  passengers to the "Eurocapital."  </P> <P> Bureaucrats here are Eurocrats. But there are also Euro-consultants,  Euro-hair-stylists, Euro-schools and even a Euro-piano store. One shop not far  from the European Commission headquarters sells Euro-gadgets.  </P> <P> "We have 120 different items," boasted Euro-Tempo Boutique owner Nicole du  Jacquiere, "including ties, umbrellas, bath towels, badges, key rings and  leather goods. Our best sellers are the jogging outfits with the European  colors (blue and gold) and emblems (a circle of 12 stars)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Superstate in 4 Years  </P> <P> The 12 members of the European Community -- France, West Germany, Italy,  Britain, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg  and Denmark -- have pledged to open their common borders and form a potentially  powerful superstate of 300 million people in four years.  </P> <P> As the deadline of Dec. 31, 1992, for this new Europe approaches, the city of  Brussels has come down with a capital case of Euro-itis. On one level, at  least, the boosterism is well-founded. If the 12 member states realize their  dream to become the "United States of Europe," one of the main beneficiaries  will be this soot-gray city of 1 million in the historic battleground of  Europe, not far from Waterloo and Flanders Field.  </P> <P> As headquarters of the European Commission, home for most of the 12,000  commission bureaucrats and principal meeting place for various European  councils and committees, Brussels seems destined to be the Washington, D.C., of  this increasingly important federation of European states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parliament Sessions Here  </P> <P> The city was given another boost recently when the European Parliament, a body  of elected representatives from the member states that is steadily gaining  power under the 1992 format, voted to hold some of its sessions here instead of  in Strasbourg, France, where the main Parliament building is located.  </P> <P> The motion by a British representative called for only "supplementary sessions"  to be held in Brussels. However, many observers, including outraged French  delegates, interpreted the vote as the first step in the eventual relocation of  the Parliament to the Belgian city.  </P> <P> "Within 10 years, 80% of national economic and perhaps social decisions will be  taken in Brussels," European Commission President Jacques Delors predicted  recently.  </P> <P> But the heady role cast for this city by the choreographers of the new Europe  also has produced a healthy amount of skepticism among the Bruxellois -- the  native inhabitants of this odd, French-speaking city, who often think of  themselves as stateless orphans in their own country -- and among the various  international representatives who live and work here.  </P> <P> Euro-talk is cheap, they say, but can this frumpish, conservative trading town  rise above its limitations to shine as a world capital? Can a town where the  most famous monument is a statue of a little boy urinating in a fountain -- the  manneken-pis -- emulate the triumphant grandeur of Paris and London and Rome?  </P> <P> Can a place where hostilities between French- and Flemish-speaking populations  have often erupted into violence and where huge North African and Turkish  minorities live in poverty become the standard of an ethnically integrated  Europe?  </P> <P> Can a political hodgepodge with 19 police chiefs and a debt of more than $1  billion lead the way to a new European prosperity?  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Soulless City'  </P> <P> "The only way it could possibly work is if it could be sold off to the 12  nations," said Eric Rajendra, an American economist who acts as a corporate  adviser on European questions in Paris and Brussels. "Otherwise, it will always  be a soulless city with potholes and lousy city services."  </P> <P> It could work, countered sociologist Rene Schoonbrodt, leader of the activist  Urban Research and Action Workshop here, "if we could move the site of the  capital outside the center of the city and create there a European quarter that  reflected European cultural values."  </P> <P> "As it is," Schoonbrodt said, "we have big problems trying to welcome any  expansion in the European Community. This is a small city of little houses  where life is very fragile and threatened by the big office buildings and the  thousands of functionaries. There are already days in Brussels when there is  not a single place to hold a meeting because all the meeting places are booked.  It's scary."  </P> <P> According to Schoonbrodt and other urban scholars here, the city is only now  recovering from urban renewal projects begun here just before the 1958 World's  Fair, when a phenomenal network of freeways was carved through the city and  surrounding countryside. By the time American astronauts got to the moon in  1969, only two man-made objects were visible to them from the lunar surface:  the Great Wall of China and the brightly lit Belgian highway system.  </P> <P> More development followed in the 1960s after the European Commission installed  its headquarters here and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, ordered out  of France by Charles de Gaulle, moved here in 1967.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Worse than Houston'  </P> <P> The result was massive overbuilding of modern office space, some of its cheek  by jowl with medieval churches, and the destruction of entire neighborhoods.  "It was a city without a plan -- worse than Houston, Texas," Schoonbrodt said.  </P> <P> Pockets of the original culture remained, however. Most of the city's major  tourist sites were left intact, including the ornate 15th-Century central  square, the royal palace, the manneken-pis -- which residents occasionally  dress up in costumes ranging from a scuba diving suit to an American Army  sergeant's uniform -- and the huge 19th-Century Hall of Justice, a bizarre  combination of Roman and Egyptian architecture.  </P> <P> Longtime residents say the city's virtues can be found in the small quirks of  daily life such as its colorful local dialects; its rich, abundant food  ("French food with German quantity," purred one plump American diplomat based  here), and its marvelous beers, some of which are brewed by Trappist monks.  </P> <P> But in his classic novel, "Heart of Darkness," author Joseph Conrad described  Brussels as a "sepulchral" city, gray and melancholy like the grave.  </P> <P> Also on the down side, city finances are a shambles. Metropolitan Brussels is  divided into 19 political units called communes. The central commune of  Brussels proper has a population of 140,000 residents and a deficit of nearly  $1 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> French-Speaking Town  </P> <P> Also, because Brussels is a French-speaking town in a Flemish-speaking area of  Belgium, it is unloved, and therefore mostly unfunded, by the rest of the  country.  </P> <P> "Brussels is a city that hardly knows what it is," said John Palmer, a British  journalist and author who has lived many years in the Belgian capital. "It is  an island of Francophonism because its Flemish feudal leaders spoke French. But  its original inhabitants were mostly Flemish peasants who are still mistrusted  by the French-speaking Walloon population of the south. Meanwhile, they are  considered Uncle Toms by the Flemish speakers of the north."  </P> <P> Although the city's subway system is among the best in Europe, the rest of city  services suffer. Municipal emergency and police services are overtaxed because  nearly one-fourth of the city population is composed of illegal immigrants,  mostly from North Africa and Turkey, who live in areas of high crime and high  unemployment.  </P> <P> Native Bruxellois refer derisively to the ghettos as "Little Marrakesh" and  "Little Istanbul." Meanwhile, many Arab immigrants say they dream of someday  returning to North Africa, where they can be free from the prejudices and  intolerance of life here. Indeed, the bitterness here may be more intense than  in the industrial cities of France.  </P> <P> Whether these unwanted, unhappy aspects of Brussels detract from the image of  one of the world's great new capitals remains to be seen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Independent District  </P> <P> Belgian officials are hoping that a vote in the Brussels area June 18 will  solve many of the capital's problems. Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, as part  of his reforms aimed at solving Belgium's chronic language wars, has introduced  a federal plan for his country, in which Brussels will become an independent  district ruled by a council formed from the 19 communes.  </P> <P> "It will put the whole metropolitan area under one authority," said Anne-Marie  Lizin, a Belgian Cabinet minister who has been designated minister for 1992  under Martens. "We think it will solve our biggest problems." The Belgian  government, meanwhile, has pledged to pay nearly all of the Brussels debt.  </P> <P> The biggest advantage of Brussels and Belgium, Lizin said, is that the people  have never been very patriotic. Historically, Belgium is a young and  artificially created independent state that came into existance in the mid-19th  Century.  </P> <P> "It is clear it is easier for us to be a citizen of the new country of Europe  than it is for a Frenchman, for example," Lizin said. "We have little or no  sense of nationalism, and the constant fighting between the Flemish and the  Walloons has actually helped us in this regard."  </P> <P> In fact, a surprising number of Bruxellois think of themselves as stateless  beings, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their new country: Europe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Great Crossroads'  </P> <P> Said Alain de Clerck, the 46-year-old owner of a sporting goods store in  Brussels:  </P> <P> "I think of myself as European, never Belgian. To be Bruxellois means to live  in a city in the center of Europe that is a great crossroads. It is to belong  to three or four cultures at the same time. One part of my family is Flemish,  another part Walloon and another part French. As a result, I don't have much  nationalistic sentiment."  </P> <P> To demonstrate their new nationality, these Europeople have taken to flying the  blue-and-gold European flag from their businesses.  </P> <P> An equally ubiquitous symbol of the new order seems to be the bumper stickers  from Nicole du Jacquiere's boutique, judging from the cars parked around the  European Commission headquarters. Each car owner, the stylish blue-and-gold  stickers proudly announce, is a "Citizen of Europe."  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: In the bag in Tokyo - Changes to rubbish collection rules have caused uproar When Eiko Fukagawa, a 40-year-old housewife in Tokyo, turned on her television last August, she was surprised to see an unfamiliar advert with a film star shaking a translucent rubbish bag, telling viewers about new rubbish collection rules due to begin this month. 'At first I didn't quite understand what it was about,' she says. Fukagawa was not the only one confused by the sudden changes. The Tokyo metropolitan government's decision to enforce the separation of combustible and unburnable waste using translucent bags, has caused such an uproar among residents, retailers and plastic manufacturers that city officials have been forced to postpone the changes until January. The new rules, which require rubbish to be thrown away in semi-transparent bags approved by the metropolitan government, apply to the 3.4m households in Tokyo's central 23 wards. In order to burn easily, the polyethylene bags must contain 30 per cent calcium carbonate. Initial plans also required residents to write their names on the bags. However, the unexpected announcement and rumours that rubbish thrown away in bags other than the designated type would not be collected, caused panic buying of translucent bags, triggering shortages at supermarkets. Amid the confusion, some households were visited by door-to-door salesmen claiming to be Tokyo metropolitan government employees, trying to sell translucent rubbish bags at high prices. On October 1, only about 10 per cent of the rubbish was thrown away in the designated bags. The confusion was such that Shunichi Suzuki, governor of Tokyo, had to apologise before the city assembly. 'The Tokyo government is to be blamed for the short notice over the rule changes,' he said. Many people are still unhappy at having to pay double the price of the ordinary plastic rubbish bags for the designated ones. And the requirement to label the bags with residents' names drew so many complaints from people who saw the rule as an invasion of privacy that it was abolished. Retailers still hold stocks of black plastic and paper rubbish bags and manufacturers are unable to catch up with the demand for the new translucent ones. Other Japanese cities which have implemented similar changes in rubbish collection rules have owed their success partly to starting their promotional campaigns one or two years before their implementation. The Tokyo government, which started publicising the changes in mid-August, admits that the campaign period was too short. 'We now realise we need time to make people understand the purpose of the changes and to allow retailers and manufacturers to get rid of their inventories,' says a spokesman at the Tokyo sanitation bureau. However, the spokesman adds, the tumult has brought Tokyo's rubbish problem to the centre of everyone's attention. 'Awareness of the seriousness of the situation needs to be raised,' he says. Having seen a sharp increase in rubbish during the economic 'bubble period' of the late 1980s - last year's Tokyo garbage total was 4.5m tonnes - the city's existing waste landfill will be full in two-and-a-half years. A new landfill, planned for the Tokyo Bay, is expected to last only 20 years. The Tokyo sanitation bureau says that Tokyo's unburnable waste contains 20 per cent combustible rubbish, increasing the bulk of waste put into landfills, while its burnable waste contains 10 per cent unburnable rubbish, which decreases the burning efficiency of the incinerators. By making people use translucent bags, 'they will be more responsible for their rubbish,' says the bureau. The new rule is also expected to protect Tokyo's rubbish collectors, who face a high risk of being injured by broken glass and bamboo skewers in the bags. Over the next three months, the city government intends to increase its campaign activities, and explain to residents what is burnable and what is not. The city intends to collect 'incorrect' rubbish for a while after it implements the rule changes in January. Meanwhile, the city's sanitation bureau faces a challenge from plastic bag manufacturers, who are unhappy with the rule changes. 'We weren't even consulted,' says the Japan Polyolefin Industry Association, which says many of the smaller plastic bag makers may be hit by the shift in new requirements. 'Making the designated polyethylene bags containing calcium carbonate means capital investment, which is hard for smaller makers already facing hard times due to the bad economy,' says the association, which officially handed in a complaint to the Tokyo metropolitan government last week. The association is also challenging Tokyo's notion that the bags containing calcium carbonate will burn more easily than traditional polyethylene bags. It contends that since the designated bags are thicker than the usual polyethylene bags, the amount of heat needed to burn them does not differ radically.</p>

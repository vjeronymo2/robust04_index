			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts continue to slide on fears over Budget funding UK government bond prices continued to drop yesterday on political worries and concern over the funding implications of the forthcoming Budget. Long-dated gilts fell by almost half a percentage point, partly on rumours that an opinion poll due out today would show the opposition Labour party five points ahead of the Conservative party in some key marginal seats. The Labour lead in the opinion poll, which appears in the Local Government Chronicle, was confirmed later yesterday. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 114 7/8 and traded at 114 7/16 by late afternoon. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.16 to 96.06 - an important resistance level - but then recovered some of the ground to end at 96.10. Trading volumes were heavy at 51,000 contracts. Traders said sterling's weakness in the foreign exchange markets undermined shorter-dated gilts, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 falling to 100 3/4 from 100 29/32 . A decline in weekly jobless claims that exceeded market forecasts and nervousness ahead of today's February employment data depressed US Treasury prices at both ends of the yield curve yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/16 at 100 13/32 , yielding 7.957 per cent. The two-year note was also sharply lower, down  7/32 at 99 17/32 , yielding 5.611 per cent. The market was subdued primarily because many participants, especially on the retail side, were reluctant to commit themselves to active trading ahead of the key February employment report, which is due out today. Prices slipped lower on the news that initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 21,000 in the third week of last month. The figures suggested that today's February employment numbers would be broadly positive, and when added to other recent data, indicated that the long-awaited economic recovery may be underway. JAPANESE government bonds ended stronger on short-covering after a report that the Bank of Japan may cut the official discount rate by 75 basis points after March 13. According to a report from Johnson Smick International, the Washington-based consultancy, the discount rate may be cut by 0.75 of a percentage point from its current level of 4.5 per cent between March 13 and March 20. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, is due to return to Japan on March 11 and many traders believe the central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates while he is out of the country. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened on a firmer note at 5.445 per cent, and closed at 5.40 per cent. The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey, due out today is expected to show that Japanese companies still have a bearish outlook on the economy, which would provide the central bank with an incentive to ease rates. STRONG industrial output figures for former West Germany announced yesterday helped to push German government bond prices lower. Industrial production in the area rose a provisional 5.9 per cent in January from the previous month after a drop of 4.2 per cent in December. The figure was much higher than expected. In the futures market, the Liffe bund contract fell from its opening of 88.64 to 88.48 by late afternoon.</p>

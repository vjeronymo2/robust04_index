			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No abuse by magistrates Sir, I disagree entirely with Robert Graham's statement ('Curtain rises on the final act', December 16) that the Milan magistrates 'have clearly abused the rights of citizens in interrogations and in leaking documents to discredit individuals'. The existence of any abuse can be excluded as the magistrates' conduct has been upheld in virtually all cases by the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. As regards the leaks, many people have access to investigation documents: magistrates, advocates, policemen and court bureaucrats. Any of them could have passed the documents to the press, and to hold the magistrates responsible for the leaks is a very radical proposition. I suspect Robert Graham based his views on these matters solely on the repeated slogans of Mr Berlusconi's supporters, which is at least a rather unreliable source of information. Andrea Lorenzo Capussela, 26 Hugh Street, London SW1V 1RP</p>

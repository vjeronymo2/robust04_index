			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonard Doyle article: "Ever Closer Union is Looking Less </F> Attractive to Voters"]    [Text] An anti-federalist mood is growing in Europe that  could alter the balance of power in the next European  Parliament. The irony is that the first elections under the  "Citizenship of the Union" provisions of the Maastricht treaty  could end up slowing the moves to "ever closer union."    Euro-sceptic British Tories and the growing ranks of fellow  travellers in Europe are not about to win a numerical majority  in the next Parliament -- far from it. But disillusionment has  set in among a sizeable percentage of the EU's [European Union]  255 million citizens; doubts and uncertainties about the brave  new world of Euro-federalism are gnawing away at the electorate.  Instead of galvanising voters for the challenges ahead,  Maastricht has created a jagged faultline in European politics  and the elections should tell a lot about the way people feel  about the experiment.    The pain involved in ratifying Maastricht revealed how  politicians across Europe were losing touch with voters.  Coupled with the failure of the EU to bring peace to the former  Yugoslavia or end the cycle of recession and unemployment,  scepticism on the merits of Euro-federalism has taken hold. If  voters intend to send any clear message in the elections, the  polls suggest that it will be to dampen the ardour of the  Euro-romantics who want to build a United States of Europe.  More than grandiose plans for a new world power, the electorate  seems to want jobs, economic prosperity and strict limits on  immigration, all without diluting the power of national  governments.    Voters are expected to turn out in small numbers, the most  derisory turn-out of all being in Britain, where in 1979 only  36.2 per cent bothered to vote. Those who do vote generally do  so for national rather than European reasons, but even so the  results will have EU-wide consequences.    In Britain, the election is bound to become a referendum on  John Major's future, but the results could tip the balance for  several parties in Strasbourg.    The Labour Party is due to increase its seats from 49  possibly to 60, ensuring that it dominates even more the largest  EU parliamentary group, the European Socialists. At the same  time, the Liberal Democrats, who have never had a popularly  elected MEP [Member of the European Parliament], are due to win  four or five seats. They will then be an important force in the  European liberal group. At the same time, this group is  expected to lose seats overall as the Portuguese Social  Democrats leave to join the European People's Party (EPP).  Meanwhile the Italian liberals are expected to collapse and the  German liberals, the FDP, may not even make it to the new  Parliament.    In bald terms, the new parliament should have a clear  Socialist majority, with as many as 220 members compared with  the present 197 and an agenda that focuses on unemployment and  the environment. Though still committed to a federal Europe, the  Socialist group dominated by the UK Labour Party has come to  realise that calling for more federalism is not the vote-winner  it once was.    The main opposition, the European People's Party --  predominantly Christian Democratic and Euro-enthusiastic -- is  expected to undergo the greatest change of all and to see its  vision of a "federal government" for Europe watered down as  voter scepticism works its way through the system. Just how  strong a force the centre-right group will be depends on many  factors. How badly the Tories do, for a start. An alliance of  Tories, Gaullists and a new crop of Italians from the ruling  coalition party, Forza Italia, could form an influential group  within or around the EPP. The main objective of this would be  to put a brake on further EU "deepening."    Julie Smith, author of a new study for the Royal Institute  of  International Affairs, "Citizen's Europe, the European Elections  and the Role of the European Parliament," predicts that the  coming elections "stand to alter the party balance in parliament  very significantly".    In Spain, the ruling Socialists -- federalists to the bone  --  are about to be trounced. Corruption scandals in the ruling  Socialist PSOE have given a boost to the opposition Popular  Party (PP) and the EU enlargement has caused anxieties about  Spain's position.    Germany has always embraced the federal agenda but the EU  paymaster is now facing popular doubts about the loss of  national sovereignty and even the disappearance of the mark in a  future monetary union.    In Belgium, important changes are occurring, with people  expressing hostility to more shifts in power to the EU. They  could send a strong message to politicians by voting for the  extreme-right Vlaams Bloc, or for the Greens who resent the  proliferation of EU institutions in their capital.    In France, the polls are expected to be a trial of strength  before the 1995 Presidential election. The ruling centre-right  Gaullists (the RPR) and the UDF [Union for French Democracy]  have put up a joint list and have declared that they will sit  together in Strasbourg in the EPP party.</p>

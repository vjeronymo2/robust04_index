Chairman Cheng Kejie said in  his Government Work Report: In 1993 Guangxi stepped up its  reform and made substantial progress in many important fields.  In rural reform, Guangxi stabilized and improved the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output and the two-tier operational system; developed  the rural socialized service system; gradually expanded the  force of the collective economy; implemented the Central  Committee's instructions on reducing the peasants' burden;  abolished 60 categories of irrational charges; reduced the  peasants' burden by 890 million yuan; and expanded the  trial-implementation of county-level reform, causing the number  of experimental counties to increase from 13 to 22.    In enterprise reform, in accordance with the State Council's  regulations on the transformation of the operational mechanism  of industrial enterprises under ownership by the whole people,  Guangxi formulated implementation methods and sorted out and  abolished a number of documents running counter to these  regulations. Most enterprises reformed the labor employment  system, the personnel system, and the wage distribution system.  More than 2,000 state- owned enterprises in Guangxi, with 1.13  million employees, adopted all kinds of methods to link supply  to marketing, and some enterprises abolished the eight-grade  wage system, which had been in force for many years. All  localities straightened out ownership and management rights,  reformed the ownership and management system, and further  practiced the shareholding system. There were 160 shareholding  companies and 46 enterprise groups in Guangxi. Major efforts  were made to develop township and town collective economic  sectors. The output value of collective industrial economy  increased by 49.5 percent over the previous year. Individual  industrial and commercial households increased to 698,500 up by  10.1 percent over the previous year; and private enterprises  increased to 3,631, up by 73.2 percent.    In price system reform, state-fixed prices now account for  only 1.5 percent of the total agricultural products under state  procurement, 5.4 percent of the total retail sales volume of  social commodities and 7.4 percent of the total sales of  industrial capital goods. A mechanism is gradually taking shape  in which the market determines prices. The circulation field  has been further invigorated. [passage omitted]    The reform of the city and town housing system is proceeding  in an all-round way and 52 cities and counties are putting into  effect their housing system reform programs. Total housing rent  of 1.2 billion yuan has been collected. Social insurance system  reform, with old age pension, job awaiting, and medical care as  the main components, is being further carried out.</p>

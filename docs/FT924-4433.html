			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids advances 7% ALLIED COLLOIDS, the speciality chemicals group, reported a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 22.5m, in the half year to October 3. The group said its lack of dependence on the UK enabled it to sustain volume growth. Sales, up 9 per cent, from Pounds 124.6m to Pounds 136.3m, had increased in all regions. Only 16 per cent of the group's turnover is based in the UK. The company said: 'Although we can as yet discern little favourable change in market conditions around the world, we nevertheless expect to be able to sustain the improvement for the remainder of the year.' Hydrolabs, the US speciality chemicals company supplying the textile industry which was acquired last year for Dollars 18m, broke even after start-up costs. The group is planning to expand this company in order to market its products around the world. The tax charge increased from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 8.2m after an exceptionally low payment at the end of the last financial year. This was because a provision for deferred taxation of Pounds 5m relating to accelerated capital allowances was no longer required. Earnings per share increased to 5.47p (5.17p). The interim dividend is 0.94p (0.88p).</p>

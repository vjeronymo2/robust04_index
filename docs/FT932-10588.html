			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (14): The softly-softly approach has run its course - Privatisation On one point Mr Ustun Sanver is adamant. 'We will never have a fire sale. That I can promise.' Turkey's softly-softly approach to privatisation, however, has almost run its course. The next steps, tackling the large state monopolies, will demand radical measures and will require a political commitment, which has largely been missing under the current programme of disposals. No one will begrudge Mr Sanver his achievement. In the one and a half years since he took over the Public Participation Administration (PPA), the government agency which handles the sale of state assets to the public, Turkey has raised almost as much in revenues as the former Motherland party achieved in the eight years of its administration. Using either block sales of shares, or through sales offerings direct to the public, Turkey is starting to run down its huge inventory of more than 230 equity participations. When JP Morgan, the US bank, first prepared its master plan for the Turkish privatisation programme, back in 1986, the main objective was to make the economy 'more responsive to market forces, thereby increasing industrial efficiency and generating growth in the real economy.' The second impulse was to give a kickstart to Turkey's infant capital markets. Today, with a coalition in office, the main motivation seems to be to raise revenues to close the budget gap, the financing of which is the main cause of the persistently high inflation. Unlike in eastern Europe, few Turkish officials discuss the merits of extending share ownership, although, to appease domestic opposition to the programme, there is still an understanding that the larger state concerns will be offered to the public first. Whenever companies are put up for sale, there are rumblings of discontent among the labour unions, even from the local chambers of commerce, who on several occasions have pooled resources in an effort to buy the state company. As in other countries, politics is never far from the surface in Turkey's privatisation debate. It was, after all, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, who, when in opposition, took legal action to block the sale of five state cement companies to the French concern, Societe Ciment Francais, on the grounds the shares had not first been offered to domestic investors as required under the privatisation code. When he came to power in October 1991, Mr Demirel found himself in the awkward position of assuming the old government's legal brief in defence of the PPA. Earlier, offers of small stakes in Tupras, the state refineries corporation, Petkim, the government's petrochemical concern, and Petrol Ofisi all failed to attract much interest, when shares were sold by public offering. The experience of recent public offerings, all of which have gone off at half-cock, further underlines the problems. The Turkish public appears to have little wish to become share owners. In the recent public offering of Netas, the telecommunications equipment manufacturer now owned 51 per cent by Northern Telecom of Canada, share applications were invited for 20 per cent of the company. In the event, less than half that amount was subscribed. 'We made a mistake by trying to protect the small investors,' Mr Sanver now says. Of the 9 per cent which was sold, one fifth was bought by the company's employees. Mr Sanver's only satisfaction is that, after coming to the market at a sharp discount to the issue price, Netas shares have since shot up - a vindication of the PPA's contention that this was a blue-chip offer. The major features of 1992 were: The Netas sale. The PPA sold a 20 per cent block to the Canadians for USDollars 23.5m. After the public offering, the PPA is left with some 21 per cent of the company. Mr Sanver says the PPA is consulting a foreign bank about the possibilities of placing the remaining stock with foreign institutional investors. Two Mediterranean-based state-owned power utilities, Cukurova and Kepez, attracted considerable domestic interest, with the PPA selling the companies for more than twice the minimum price set by the authorities. Both utilities were sold to Rumeli Holding, owned by the Uzan family. Rumeli paid Dollars 81m for the PPA's 11.25 share of Cukurova, and a further Dollars 33m for a 25 per cent share of Kepez. The Uzan concern then proceeded, in somewhat unconventional fashion, to solicit the proxy voting rights of the remaining shareholders, eventually winning control of the Cukurova board. Cement companies also proved attractive, with the PPA selling shares in six companies, raising Dollars 281m. Two more cement companies - Sanliurfa and Ladik - were sold in block shares in April, agin to the privately owned Rumeli group, which is proving to have a corporate appetite previously undetected. Mr Sanver says the remaining seven cement plants, one in Thrace and the remainder in the east of Turkey, all of which are still owned by the state-run Citosan Holding, would raise around Dollars 200m. In April, the PPA announced the sale of the Turk Automotive Industry (TOE), which used to have the US Harvester farm machinery company franchise. The TOE was sold for TL70bn (Dollars 6m). Gima, the state-owned food and general store chain, was sold for TL201bn to a local hotel concern. A 10 per cent stake in Sekerbank, the sugar bank, was sold to the sugar beet producers association. Turkey's privatisation target for 1993 is TL25,000bn - more than three times the Dollars 570m raised last year. Mr Sanver is confident the target can be met. Planned sales include 12-15 per cent of Usas, the state airline catering company (part owned by SAS, the Scandanavian concern); the PPA's remaining stake in Netas; and 22 per cent of Fiat's local assembly venture Tofas. But, given the current pace of sales, the PPA's portfolio of companies will soon be exhausted. The challenge then is to tackle the main public corporations, like the PTT, the state telephone monopoly, where foreign consultants are already discussing plans to separate the company into its postal and telecom units. The one encouraging sign is that, having relied on homegrown advice from Turkish banks for much of the workload to date, the PPA is now in discussions with a number of foreign banks, including the UK's Morgan Grenfell, to help devise the programme for the next generation of state sell-offs.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / PEPs push unit trusts to record Unit trust sales reached a new record of Pounds 1.37bn last month, more than Pounds 200m above the best previous month, September 1987, when net sales were Pounds 1.16bn. More unit trusts were sold in March than in January and February combined. Strong sales of unit trust Personal Equity Plans were an important factor in the record sales. PEPs, which shield investments from income and capital gains tax, accounted for about three-quarters of total net sales to private investors during the first three months of the year. By the end of March the total value of all unit trust funds was Pounds 95.5bn, up 35 per cent on the comparable figure for the end of March last year. UK equity income funds were the most popular category among private investors. Overall total net sales of growth funds topped the March list at Pounds 313m, followed by equity income funds at Pounds 258m, and Pounds 253m for 'funds of funds' - trusts which invest in other trusts. One of the most popular income PEPs, M&amp;G's Managed Income PEP, counts as a fund of funds. Unit trusts aiming to provide a high income have been extremely popular as interest rates have fallen, particularly among former bank and building society investors. PEP sales have provided a significant boost to overall unit trust sales since the 1992 Budget allowed the whole of a Pounds 6,000 general PEP to be invested in a suitable unit or investment trust. Sales are normally strong before the end of the tax year on April 5. Competition between unit trust groups has tended to focus on the PEP market. On January 4, M&amp;G added a fresh twist to this competition by removing the initial charge from its Managed Income PEP. It then sold Pounds 250m-worth in the first quarter and Pounds 150m-worth in March alone.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / French union threat to widen strike FRENCH unions yesterday threatened to extend their industrial action at Air France to other public sector groups following a show of strength which paralysed the airline's flights to and from Paris. Yesterday's protests, dubbed 'Black Tuesday' by the press, were the broadest action yet in the eight-day strike by Air France groundstaff. Air France pilots and cabin staff, and union members from the national carrier's domestic airline and the Paris airports authority joined the groundstaff in a 24-hour protest in spite of government concessions on a controversial austerity plan for the airline. Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of Force Ouvriere, one of the union groups which has spearheaded the protest at Air France, said the government's decision on Sunday to withdraw an austerity plan for the airline had set a precedent. Protests would be launched against job cutting plans at other public sector companies, he said, citing Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group. Mr Louis Viannet, leader of the Confederation Generale du Travail, the left-wing union federation, said the climbdown at Air France represented a test case for the public sector. The trade unionists' comments, however, came amid signs of division over whether to continue the industrial action at Air France, raising the prospect that the strike may have reached its peak. Force Ouvriere called on its members to suspend the strike from today, although it warned it would not hesitate to call new action if necessary. A spokesman for the CGT, however, said its members would continue their protests until they received government guarantees that members would be fully paid for the period of their strike and a written commitment that there would be no job cuts. The austerity package which was withdrawn by the government at the weekend included 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year and a reduction in overtime pay and bonuses. Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister, has said that the 4,000 job cuts envisaged in the plan are still necessary but that they can be achieved without sackings. Yesterday's disputes forced Air France to cancel all flight to and from Paris, adding to the group's financial problems. The company estimates the strike is costing it FFr70m (Pounds 8m) a day in lost revenues.</p>

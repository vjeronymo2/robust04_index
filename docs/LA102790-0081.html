			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALARMING TREND  </P> <P> As a Costa Mesa resident, I am saddened by the outcry of certain residents and  some of our council members to the production of "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains  It All for You" (at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse).  </P> <P> It reflects an alarming trend throughout our nation to judge and take offense  to the method of presentation (of social commentary), rather than to look at  the issues that commentary is addressing. Troubling and offending art is a  symptom of things awry in social institutions; art is not the cause of the  failure of these institutions.  </P> <P> In reference to the play, some Catholics feel very well served by their church;  others do not. "Sister Mary" is by one such Catholic who does not feel served.  </P> <P> We have residents, council members and, sadly, even the Archdiocese of Orange  feeling attacked and demanding the play not be (supported with) city funding.  </P> <P> Yet, the strength of any society or group comes from being able to acknowledge  what does not work (even when brought to its attention in an uncomfortable and  challenging way), and then to look for solutions. Playwright Durang's work  should be accepted as a warning signal to the church and the community (which  should seek) not to stop his message, but to ask how his disillusionment could  occur.  </P> <P> And let's not disguise this as a "not-with-taxpayer's-dollars" issue.  </P> <P> We learned in the 1930s, from the Nazis, that today's "not with my money" is  tomorrow's "not in my country" censorship and repression. The playhouse has  presented more than 100 plays, only one of which has been considered  controversial. That's less than 1%! To discredit the Playhouse over one  production is irresponsible.  </P> <P> I suggest we take a poll and see, first of all, if anyone wants to contribute  taxes to the arts.  </P> <P> Among those who do, determine the percentage that wants non-controversial and  easy-viewing work, and the percentage that wants probing, challenging works,  and then funds accordingly.  </P> <P> Many of us, though not all, have the sense and maturity to see and hear satire,  humor, beauty, repulsiveness or whatever is presented -- to look at why that  message exists, and to commit ourselves to resolving it.  </P> <P> BRUCE GILLINGS  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

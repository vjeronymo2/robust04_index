			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE  </P> <P> The editorial was an outstanding summation on the culpability of a failed  nomination.  </P> <P> The defense procurement scandal is one of the biggest problems the Pentagon and  the country face. For a President to nominate and senators to vote for an  individual with even an iota of a question as to the individual's involvement  in such activity is real evidence of partisan politics.  </P> <P> The biggest complaint put forth by Tower and his supporters seems to be the  high level of public scrutiny which he was subjected to. I have always been  taught that public scrutiny should be a proud moment. Can the U.S. afford to  have a man, or a party, who adheres to any other train of thought?  </P> <P> There must be an ulterior motive for the President to go out on such a limb. It  would be very interesting to see exactly what Tower and his defense cohorts  funneled to the Bush campaign.  </P> <P> ANDREW D. MILDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

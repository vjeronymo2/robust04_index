			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia flee attacks: The Khmer Rouge is spurring ethnic conflict, and a new tragedy in Indochina FEW places are poorer than Cambodia, but the country's open spaces and fish-filled rivers have long been irresistible attractions for the inhabitants of overcrowded and even poorer villages in neighbouring Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have migrated to Cambodia over the years, although the exact number is disputed. The flow of migrants increased sharply following the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in 1978 and rose again with the arrival of the UN peacekeeping force after the peace accords signed by the various factions in 1991. Vietnamese work as fishermen in the countryside and as prostitutes, artisans or builders in the towns, making the most of their penchant for hard work and the skills which Cambodia lost in the killings and mass emigration of the Khmer Rouge era. Now the Vietnamese settlers, including some who have lived in Cambodia for generations, have started to flee, victims of a Cambodian-style 'ethnic cleansing' campaign conducted by Khmer Rouge guerrillas and more or less openly approved by the intensely nationalistic Cambodian people. After a series of massacres in rural areas - including one this month in a fishing village on the Tonle Sap lake in which at least 34 Vietnamese were killed - guerrillas for the first time targeted Vietnamese residents of the capital Phnom Penh in grenade attacks on Monday night; two people were killed and 14 injured in an attack on a Vietnamese cafe only 50 metres from UN headquarters. Yesterday more than 3,000 ethnic Vietnamese were reported to be fleeing Cambodia, many of them in a convoy of boats heading down the Tonle Sap river. The extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge leadership - while flouting the peace agreements it signed in October 1991 by refusing to disarm its guerrillas, co-operate with the UN or participate in elections scheduled for May - has skilfully exploited the Vietnamese issue to revive its fading influence. Many Cambodians are so anxious to blame their problems on foreigners rather than on their own inadequacies that they seem prepared to overlook the Khmer Rouge's record of killing an estimated 1m Cambodians during its reign of terror between 1975 and 1978 - a bout of amnesia which has astonished UN officials as much as the cruelty of the anti-Vietnamese massacres. It is surprising, too, that Cambodians rarely emphasise the fact that the Khmer Rouge is beholden to Thailand (another traditional enemy of Cambodia), just as the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian administration was once dependent on Hanoi. Indeed, the Khmer Rouge attacks on the Vietnamese, both physical and verbal, have become so popular that other Cambodian factions have enthusiastically adopted anti-Vietnamese rhetoric in their election campaigns and generally refused to criticise the Khmer Rouge on the issue; before France came to the rescue as a colonial power, most Cambodian territory was controlled either by Vietnam or Thailand, and the fertile rice-growing area of Vietnam's Mekong delta is still regarded by Cambodians as part of their ancestral land. The elections may not take place on schedule anyway. Even before the killing of the fishermen and the latest attacks in Phnom Penh, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, had said conditions were not yet suitable for an election. With the security situation deteriorating daily, it is hard to see how he can suddenly turn around and declare that conditions are right for a free and fair election. For Vietnam - aside from the difficulty of absorbing as many as 500,000 returning settlers from Cambodia - the principal danger of the chaos in Cambodia is that the Khmer Rouge will again seize power and again provoke Vietnam as it did in the 1970s by shelling and attacking villages inside Vietnamese territory; when the border violations became intolerable the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia and rapidly seized Phnom Penh. The Vietnamese are unlikely to invade again. Their army is smaller and weaker and they are more concerned with liberalising their economy and catching up with their dynamic south-east Asian rivals. The killing of Vietnamese in Cambodia, however, is an unwelcome setback for what many had hoped would be a period of peaceful development for Indochina.</p>

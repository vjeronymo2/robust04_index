			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning a news briefing was held on Hungarian  Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn's condition at the  hospital's casualty ward in Miskolc. Among other things, it was  said that the politician lost consciousness in the accident last  night and he does not remember what happened. His cervical  vertebra and one of his wrists are broken. His mind is clear,  and neurological changes still cannot be found. Peter Juhasz's  interview follows.    [Begin recording] [Juhasz] Dr. Zoltan Katona, director of  the  county hospital. How is Mr. Horn at the moment?    [Katona] His condition is satisfactory and reassuring, thank  you very much. He spent last night peacefully. The broken bones  were fixed during the night. No complications have occurred.  According to our expectations, he might get up on Wednesday [11  May], or so.    [Juhasz] It means that he might even leave the hospital,  does  not it?    [Katona] Yes. However, the question of whether he will  return straight to his home or, perhaps, to an institute in  Budapest for a few-day observation, has to be discussed with him  and doctors who will carry out the check-ups later.    [Juhasz] How are his two colleagues?    [Katona] His companion had to be operated last night,  because  a part of his skull was crushed, therefore some bits of the  fractured scull had to be removed. The occurance of his  indisposition accompanied by fainting has become less frequent.  His condition is satisfactory.    The car driver has broken his arm, which is currently being  operated on. He and Horn's companion can presumably leave the  hospital by the end of next week. [end recording]</p>

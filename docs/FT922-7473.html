			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Germany expected to pull out of European fighter project GERMANY is expected to announce at the end of this month a recommendation to pull out of the multi-national European Fighter Aircraft project. The government decision would put great pressure on Britain, Italy and Spain  -the remaining partners - to abandon the project. They nevertheless insist they intend to go ahead. Withdrawal by Germany would force Britain, as the other principal partner, to carry out an urgent review of the cost implications of going ahead with a smaller partnership and smaller guaranteed production. In anticipation of such a move, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, has begun contingency work to evaluate savings that could result from concentrating production at fewer assembly plants. Officially, no final decision has yet been taken by the German government over the controversial fighter, whose first prototype is due to fly this autumn. A six-member working group drawn from the three parties in the ruling coalition - Christian Democrats (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free Democrats (FDP) - is supposed to produce a report on the EFA by June 1. Mr Volker Ruhe, newly appointed defence minister, is expected to deliver his recommendation at the same time. Several apparently well-sourced reports in Germany insist his decision will be negative. However, the ultimate decision on a new generation of fighter aircraft beyond 2000 remains unclear. Reports suggest that the EFA, or Jager 90 - as it is known in Germany - could very well still be bought when a final decision is taken in 1998. Welt am Sonntag reported yesterday that General Jorg Schonbohm, the defence ministry official in charge of arms procurement, will fly to London, Rome and Madrid in the next days to discuss possible compensation payable by Germany. A decision to quit the project would be politically popular in Germany as a sign of the government's willingness to sacrifice prestige projects to help pay for the costs of unification. But, the move could also cause severe strains in the coalition, since the Bavaria-based CSU, the smallest partner, is strongly committed to going ahead. Most of the 10,000 defence industry jobs which would be lost in the event of a German pullout are concentrated in Bavaria. Munich-based Deutsche Aerospace is the main German contractor, through its subsidiaries Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm and Motoren- und Turbinen-Union. The irony is that the savings resulting from cancellation of Germany's participation are likely to be modest, particularly in the next 'pre-production' phase. Germany is already committed to paying its full share of development costs, continuing into 1993. The big savings would come only towards the turn of the century, when the Luftwaffe will anyway need a new aircraft, whether German-built or bought off-the-shelf.</p>

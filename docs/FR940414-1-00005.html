			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1647(f) of the Act permits changes in the assessment rate through notice and comment rulemaking. No change to the Plan would be necessary to implement this amendment to the Act because &sect;1210.341 of the Plan states that assessment rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1647(f) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision facilitates the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.202, 1210.321, 1210.363, 1210.368, and 1210.402.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act also provides that all future referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act would now allow referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which would reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.203, 1210.204, and 1210.363.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Act changes the criteria for determining the outcome of referenda. The Act previously provided that the Plan should not be effective unless approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers and handlers voting in the referendum, or producers and handlers of not less than two-thirds of the watermelons produced and handled during the representative period by producers and handlers voting in the referendum, and by not less than a majority of the producers and a majority of the handlers voting in the referendum. The Act now specifies that the determination of the results of a referendum should be on the basis of a simple majority of the producers, handlers, and, if covered by the Plan, importers voting in the referendum. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, &sect;1210.252 would be revised to correct a wording error made during the promulgation of the Plan and &sect;1210.322 would be revised to delete obsolete language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;1210.325 would be changed to reflect a change in the number of Board members that constitute a majority. This revision would reflect the addition of importer members to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1210.505 would be amended to reflect the fact that the Department issues user fee bills to the Board monthly rather than quarterly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, miscellaneous conforming changes would be made to &sect;&sect;1210.201, 1210.251, 1210.302, 1210.328, 1210.340, and 1210.362.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are encouraged to comment on the proposed amendments included in this rule. All written comments received by the date specified herein will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After all comments have been reviewed and any necessary changes made to these proposed amendments to the Plan, the proposals will be published together with a referendum order. The referendum order will set the dates for eligible producers, handlers, and importers to vote on whether or not they favor (1) eliminating the provisions for assessment refunds and (2) implementing assessments on imported watermelons and adding importer members to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

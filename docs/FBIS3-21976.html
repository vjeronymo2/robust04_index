Shevardnadze himself underwent a medical  [examination] too. As might have been expected, no drug addicts  were found in Shevardnadze's apparatus.    Ramaz Sakvarelidze, head of the Georgian leader's press  service, made the following comment on this unusual event: Drug  addiction has penetrated the state's structures of authority.  This is one means of combating it. All officials in ministries  and departments along with the personnel of the parliament and  cabinet of ministers apparatuses will undergo similar checks.    The reason for the checks was the countless statements by  Georgian parliamentarians to the effect that some members of the  cabinet of ministers do drugs and are helping to form a drugs  mafia in Georgia. At the same time the power ministries -- the  Defense Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Affairs --were the  primary targets along with staffers in the apparatus of certain  vice premiers.    We will leave aside the effectiveness of these actions,  since  any sensible person is aware that these checks will have zero  results in practice. The moral aspect is far more important.  And it is hard to disagree with the opinion voiced by  parliament Deputy Ivlian Khaindrav, who says that the enforced  nature of these checks is offensive. As for the propaganda  nature of the action, in the current situation it can only  impress Joe Public.    However, the problem of drug addiction in Georgia has indeed  become menacing. Figures provided by the Georgian Internal  Affairs Ministry Narcotics Administration demonstrate that the  republic is one of the main staging posts for the international  drug business. In the last few years there has been a  considerable increase in drug use in Georgia itself. The  country is now one of the world leaders in the field.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM backs reform of teacher training RADICAL reform of teacher training to switch responsibility away from universities and colleges to schools is being pushed by Mr John Major as part of his strategy to give new momentum to his domestic political agenda. The prime minister is backing a return to proposals which would reduce sharply the role of conventional teacher-training institutes in favour of classroom-based experience in primary schools. The plan is seen in Downing Street as the last piece in an policy jigsaw designed to reverse irrevocably the 'progressive' and theory-based approach to education adopted by successive governments during the 1960s and 1970s. Mr Major considered the proposals at the two-day review at Chequers of his domestic agenda which ended yesterday. Downing Street said afterwards that renewed impetus for the government's education and health reforms were among the key priorities. Whitehall officials said Mr Major favoured the most radical of the options being looked at by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, in a wide-ranging review of the structure of teacher training. It would in effect reverse the present system under which classroom experience plays a relatively small part in an academically driven training structure. Last year Mr Patten appeared to backtrack on plans to shift more training of secondary school teachers into the schools. He dropped plans to impose a ceiling of one fifth on the college-based component of courses for the postgraduate Certificate of Education and substituted instead a limit of one third. But the education secretary is said to be sympathetic to the idea of a complete overhaul of the different system which applies to many primary school teachers. Their training - based on the Bachelor of Education degree  -is tied much more closely to courses at colleges and universities. Such courses have long been a bete noire of those on the right of the Tory party, where they are seen as responsible for the progressive trends in education which have allegedly lowered standards in the nation's schools. Mr Patten, who is expected to complete his review by the spring, is looking at proposals which would switch the basic responsibility for primary school training to individual schools or to groups of schools. Those specially designed schools would then 'buy in' academic training by sending trainees to the existing institutes. Officials acknowledge that the scheme would create a range of problems, not least because many of the country's primary schools, which total almost 20,000, are not large enough to take on training responsibilities. But they insist that the problems are soluble. The screening of potential candidates, for example, could be transferred from the existing institutes to a centralised organisation. Training could then be focused on larger primary schools which would receive extra funding or on groups of schools operating in consortia.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Shake-up in business support: Enterprise agencies' umbrella organisation to scale back direct involvement BUSINESS IN the Community, the umbrella body for Britain's local enterprise agencies, plans to reduce its direct involvement with the agencies. BITC hopes to encourage the 300-plus agencies - which provide advice and training to start-ups and small businesses, with backing from the private sector - to create their own regional and national organisations. If the body's board approves the proposal at a meeting next week, there are plans for a conference of heads of enterprise agencies to launch an agency-run organisation in October. The ending of BITC's special relationship with the enterprise agency movement marks a further significant shift in the business-support network. The body plans to concentrate more of its resources on working with its members - private-sector companies involved in community activities - and to reflect the broader community concerns of these companies. In a recent confidential draft of its proposals the body said: 'BITC has widened its involvement to include such things as education, the environment and general community affairs. It is therefore no longer automatic that BITC and the enterprise agencies will always share the same priorities.' It is also responding to the growing diversity of business-support organisations. This means it is no longer appropriate for it to be linked too closely with just one provider of business support. It will continue to help the enterprise agencies while the national network is set up, but plans to extend its support to chambers of commerce, training and enterprise councils, and the Prince's Youth Business Trust. It also plans to continue to provide help to the enterprise agencies during the change-over period to their own national network. Mr David Grayson, BITC managing director of operations, said: 'We are not walking away from the enterprise agencies.' Preparations for an end to the relationship and discussions with leaders of the enterprise agencies had been under way since 1988. However, reaction to the proposal from the enterprise agencies was mixed. 'We will lose out by not having someone to represent our views to government,' commented one director. Another said: 'Some agencies have wanted to get away from the BITC link but others will be disappointed. I am worried that this will reduce the impact of the work that has been done to encourage big companies to help small businesses. The agencies will have to work out how to put over their message.'</p>

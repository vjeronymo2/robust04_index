			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Shocked unions to press for redundancies to be voluntary THE LOSS of 9,000 jobs at ICI by 1995 as part of the demerger plans came as a shock to trade unions yesterday. Half of the cuts will be coming in the British plants. 'This is a black day in the history of ICI,' said Mr Fred Higgs, chief union negotiator with the company. 'It will never be the same again.' The manpower reductions in the UK plants amount to about 10 per cent of the 44,000-strong labour force. Mr Higgs added that the trade unions intended to 'do everything they could to minimise the likely effect of ICI's demerger on the workforce'. Mr Paul Talbot, national officer for the chemical industry in MSF, the white-collar union, said: 'How can ICI hope to have an industrial future when they are throwing thousands of highly skilled workers on to the dole?' The company announced that 7,000 of the reductions in its global manpower of 114,000 will be in ICI and a further 2,000 in Zeneca. That follows a cut of 21,000 at the combined group during the past two years and comes on top of a 6,000 reduction expected in ICI's payroll this summer when the sale of its nylon fibre business to Du Pont, the US company, is expected to go ahead. The cutback in employment will not just involve actual jobs losses. About 1,000 employees will find themselves working for other companies because of divestments. However, the unions will seek assurances from management that if there are to be redundancies they must be on a voluntary basis. 'We have co-operated for five years with ICI to help it avoid a hostile takeover bid,' said Mr Higgs. 'The unions are not pleased, to put it mildly, at what the company has announced today.' However, he ruled out any suggestion that the trade unions at ICI would call on their members for industrial action. 'Striking would just make the situation worse,' he said. The unions intend to press the company to invest more in the UK during the next few years and to diversify its product range. They remain extremely worried about the likely effects of the proposed demerger, however. Last July, when ICI announced its intention to split the company in two, Mr Higgs denounced the move as 'a betrayal of the workforce' that demonstrated 'a total lack of commitment by ICI's board to maintain the company as Britain's largest manufacturing concern'. 'We still do not think the demerger is in the best interests of our members,' he said yesterday. 'The company is going to become much more vulnerable to a hostile takeover bid when it is no longer a single entity.' Two-thirds of the UK workforce will be in the new ICI which is badly affected by depressed chemical markets.</p>

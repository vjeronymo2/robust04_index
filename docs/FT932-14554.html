			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Queen sweeps the board I HAVEN'T mentioned this before, but I and two friends have embarked on a series of chess lessons so as to prepare ourselves mentally for the Nigel Short-Garry Kasparov world title chess match in London in September. The two friends are: John Major, who is prime minister of Britain, and Queen Elizabeth II, who is head of the House of Windsor and not as glum as she's painted, in fact is rather fun. We meet in great secrecy - no, not at Buckingham Palace - and our lessons last two hours. The reason for the secrecy is that our chess teacher is Nigel Short himself, the 27-year-old prodigy-genius-Dalek who will become Britain's first world chess champion (and earn a great fortune) if he beats the barbarian Kasparov. We had a lesson yesterday. 'Remember,' said Nigel, 'that chess is hard physically and mentally. Grappling with your opponent's psyche can be mentally very bruising. And don't think of it as intellectual. I mean, I'm not even clever, couldn't mend a fuse. Nor does it run in families. Heredity doesn't come into it. Top-class players come from a variety of backgrounds - I used to be working class. But never in chess history have they been fathered or mothered by first-rate parents. In chess terms, I mean.' 'How extremely fascinating,' said the Queen. 'It is just the same with racehorses. Or even with actual dynasties. Top-class racehorses, such as winners of the Derby, almost never produce progeny that match their own exploits. One simply does not hear of it. As for actual dynasties, well there's a sorry tale.' The Queen chimed with laughter, like a pink porcelain bell. 'Most royal children set forth with all life's advantages, but fritter them away. They fall into unsavoury company. Develop a taste for the theatre. Talk to the trees and the sky. It must be in the blood. Such a terrible waste.' 'How remarkably interesting,' said John Major. Chess is quite like cricket, you know, in some of its particulars.' After these pleasantries we knuckled down to a tutorial on the Scotch gambit. 'Remember,' said Nigel, 'with white openings we are trying to gain our share of the centre, best achieved by advancing the d- and e-pawns and developing at least one knight towards the middle. On appropriate occasions we find that a gambit proper, such as the Scotch, is most useful. 'After the opening 1, e4 e5; 2, Nf3 Nc6; 3, d4 exd4; 4, c3, the Scotch gambit continues 4 . . . dxc3; 5, Nxc3. Black often declines with 4 . . . d5, and then play can continue: 5, exd5, Qxd5; 6, cxd4 Bg4; 7, Be2. This gives us some highly active pieces. I expect I shall use it against the barbarian Kasparov.' John Major looked puzzled. 'I must say, Nigel,' he said, 'that I am a bit in the dark on this one. I am not, as it were, illuminated. It sounds more than sufficiently complicated. It reminds me, I suppose, of the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system - remarkably clever on paper but liable to generate bother on a day-to-day basis.' 'Nonsense,' said the Queen. 'It is a perfectly simple gambit. Even a groom could employ it. After 7, Be2, white continues with Nc3, Be3 and 0-0. It is important to castle early, John. It is true that white's queen pawn is isolated on d4, but as Nigel has just told us, there is more than adequate compensation for this in the general deployment of pieces.' 'Absolutely right,' said Nigel, 'absolutely brill.' 'I have to confess,' said the prime minister, 'that I am more than somewhat confused. I do not like gambits. In politics, you know, it pays to keep things simple, even to play a dead bat, to get up on a soapbox and not try to flim-flam. That is how I won the election, you know. I avoided all gambits.' The Queen said: 'How simple life must be for you in No 10 Downing Street. One wishes one were so fortunate. In any case, John, even sharper than the Scotch gambit is the Goring gambit, in which 4 . . .dxc3 is met by 5, Bc4 - and off we jolly well go.' Then we played some games. And then we chatted sociably. The Queen asked Nigel if he would have to pay much income tax if he beat the barbarian Kasparov. 'I hope not,' said Nigel. 'I've got a really brill accountant.' 'So does oneself,' said the Queen. 'It did not, in fact, help one.'</p>

The commander of the UN Protection Force in Macedonia  suggested to a Japanese delegation last week that Japan could  dispatch SDF personnel to the region to serve as unarmed  military observers. The mission, which left Japan on January 7  and returned January 17, investigated possible areas for an  expanded Japanese contribution to the international peacekeeping  efforts under way in the former Yugoslavia.    Takemura told a news conference that mission head Shunji  Yanai reported that the commander told him "in a general manner  of speaking" that "it would be good if he could have (personnel)  dispatched from Japan." Yanai, director general of the Foreign  Ministry's foreign policy bureau, reportedly did not immediately  respond to the request.    Takemura said he had instructed Yanai to "respond with  discretion so as not to cause misunderstanding."    Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese national who heads UN  peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, also asked the  mission to send personnel to the UN mission in the region.  Yanai said Akashi did not specify whether he sought military or  civilian personnel.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AILING QUARTERBACK OUT OF HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, who is battling inoperable stomach and lung  cancer, was released Wednesday from University Hospital in Denver after being  admitted Monday night for treatment of a fever.  </P> <P> Aunese, 21, was "doing fine," according to Dr. Wayne Gersoff, team physician.  Gersoff said Aunese's temperature was near 101. "That's not catastrophically  high, but for someone in his condition, it was high enough (to warrant  hospitalization)," he said.  </P> <P> Although growth of the tumor in Aunese's stomach has apparently slowed, Gersoff  said Aunese's battle continues. He likened Aunese's fight for life to a  three-way skirmish: the tumor versus his body, chemotherapy versus the tumor  and the patient versus chemotherapy.  </P></p>

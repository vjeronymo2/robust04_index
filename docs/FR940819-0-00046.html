			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The unannounced testing based on random selection of employees shall be spread reasonably throughout the 12-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The last collection of specimens for random testing during the year shall be conducted at an annualized rate equal to not less than 50 percent of employees performing a safety-sensitive function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The total number of unannounced tests based on random selection during the 12 months shall be equal to not less than 25 percent of the employees performing a safety-sensitive function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Following the first 12 months, an employer shall achieve and maintain an annualized rate equal to not less than 50 percent of employees performing a safety-sensitive function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Post-accident Testing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for the presence of marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in the employee's system if that employee's performance either contributed to an accident or can not be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The employee shall be tested as soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this section must be based on a determination, using the best information available at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. The employee shall submit to post-accident testing under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Testing Based on Reasonable Cause. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function and who is reasonably suspected of using a prohibited drug. Each employer shall test an employee's specimen for the presence of marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs. An employer may test an employee's specimen for the presence of other prohibited drugs or drug metabolites only in accordance with this appendix and the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR part 40). At least two of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the symptoms of possible drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use; provided, however, that in the case of an employer other than a part 121 certificate holder who employs 50 or fewer employees who perform safety-sensitive functions, one supervisor who is trained in detection of symptoms of possible drug use shall substantiate the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use. The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

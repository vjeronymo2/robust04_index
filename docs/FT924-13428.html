			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Bush deftly breaches China trade wall - Republicans trumpet deal with Beijing as victory for the president's policies FOR President George Bush it was one of the brighter moments in the televised candidates' debate on Sunday night: with his domestic economic policies under attack, the president was at least able to claim a new success for his China trade policy. 'I am the one that said let's keep the MFN (most-favoured-nation trading status) because you see China moving towards a free market economy. But Governor (Bill) Clinton's philosophy is isolate them. He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on MFN and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.' On October 10, the day before the debate, Beijing capitulated to US demands for reforms which would allow greater access to their market for foreign goods. Under threat of nearly Dollars 4bn in retaliatory sanctions by the US on its exports, China agreed to: Publication of all laws, regulations, policies and guidance on the operation of its import/export system. Removal of most quotas, import restrictions, import licensing requirements and import controls according to a strict timetable. 'Significant' tariff reduction on a wide range of products including foods, chemicals, iron and steel products, photographic materials, machinery, cosmetics, confectionery and electrical parts. Publication of all previously inaccessible commercial information on sales and marketing opportunities. A ban on import substitution measures, the requirement of technology transfer or local investment as conditions for investment. Establishment of an expert working group to discuss health and sanitary standards for farm products. Agreement to eliminate within one year any scientifically unjustifiable restrictions that obstruct trade. This was the third US trade triumph over China this year. In January, under pressure of a deadline and threats of sanctions totalling Dollars 750m, Beijing agreed to take action to protect foreign patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. In June, the US and China signed a memorandum of understanding allowing US embassy officials to visit Chinese prisons if they suspected they were producing goods for exports to the US. The new agreement commits China to phase out import barriers in many key sectors beginning on December 31 1992, and continuing until December 31 1997. These openings are expected to increase imports of a range of goods from vehicles, computers, and steel to beer, wine, and mineral water. Governor Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said China's promise to lower its trade barriers was the right thing to do in view of its Dollars 15bn trade surplus with the US. Furthermore, he said the Bush administration had gottough with China only because it was pressured to do so by Democrats in Congress. While there is truth in this charge, the administration's resolve was also stiffened by the soaring trade deficit with China. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, can be credited with deftly executing the policy with an eye to Chinese sensitivities. President Bush's promise to Democrats in 1991 to 'work actively' for Taiwan's admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was never fulfilled. Instead, the US has passed to the EC the negotiating lead on Taiwan's admission to Gatt, while Mrs Hills held out the promise of US support for China's Gatt membership in exchange for co-operation on trade reforms. In an official statement accompanying the agreement on Saturday, she was a graceful winner. 'In bringing its practices into line with international practice, China will help achieve its own goal of becoming a full member of the international trading system. It is a win-win situation.' The market access pact, while widely praised by the US business community, will not entirely dispel the view promoted by Governor Clinton that the president 'coddles' the Chinese leadership. He has promised support for legislation passed this year by the Democratic majority Congress but vetoed by President Bush. It would make China's MFN status (which gives it the lowest tariffs on offer to any US trading partner) conditional on an annual presidential determination that China was improving its human rights performance. To encourage a continuation of China's private sector reforms, MFN status would be lost only for goods produced in the state sector. The Bush administration argues that the plan is unworkable because the goods could come from anywhere. Democrats say origin can be determined and point to the Customs Services' tracking of Chinese goods transhipped through third countries and goods produced by prison labour. 'If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people in China,' he said in the debate, 'and over the long run they will be more reliable partners.'</p>

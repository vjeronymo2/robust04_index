The rights of Michael Fay, the boy in  question in a case of vandalism, had not been violated. This  was acknowledged by the U.S. Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Ralph Boyce.  For the record, President Bill Clinton was not suggesting that,  either. He was careful to confine his protest to the Singapore  Government to the caning portion of the sentence, the part he  found "extreme". He said he hoped this would be "reconsidered"  -- after paying due recognition to Singapore's sovereign right  to exercise the law in its jurisdiction. Indeed it would; an  appeal is pending against the sentence, which was four months'  jail, six lashes and a fine of $3,500. As with all appeals, the  courts will dispose of this one without undue delay and in  strict conformity with the law and the facts of the case. The  verdict will take no account of extraneous influences and  factors, a fact which Americans who are known to cherish the  primacy of the written law should have no difficulty  appreciating.    Incredulity would be the reaction of many a Singaporean who  learns that the world's most powerful politician, upon prompting  from a reporter's question in the White House last Friday, has  taken a personal interest in a case which concerns neither  political hostage-taking nor a breach of national security. The  President must be a busy man. The strain of putting out fires  abroad (Bosnia, Somalia, difficult relations with China and  Japan) and shepherding a controversial health-reform package at  home has now been compounded by a deepening personal crisis as  he and his wife, Hillary, face an investigation into a land deal  they were party to in their early years. But then, incredulity  might turn to approval among some that Mr. Clinton, burdened as  he is had stood up for a fellow American in his belief -- that  privilege he is entitled to -- that the boy had been dealt with  harshly. American politicians have to answer to demanding  constituents, yes. A subject for political enjoinment can be as  big or as trivial as the public chooses to make it. Singaporeans  who find his intervention objectionable need to understand that  heroic gestures go down well with the American public. Though  this case clearly qualifies as interference by the White House,  they gain nothing by overreacting. Better a cool and dignified  response. Singaporeans have no reason to be defensive about the  stringency of the laws they live by and which foreign nationals  domiciled here are subject to. This principle is accepted, it  is non-negotiable.    The Government's response to American pressure has been  proper, firm and clinical. It has set out the facts of past  prosecutions for vandalism and the equal weight of the law  applied, whoever the accused was. Thirteen Singaporeans were  among 15 persons aged between 18 and 21 who received jail and  caning sentences in the last five years. This should end the  argument. The American Chamber of Commerce here, while "shaken"  by the caning order, volunteers that Singapore's aggressive  enforcement of law and order (its words) is one reason this is  an attractive place to live and do business in. Singapore  neither seeks nor gets chuffed by such observations. It is just  one of numerous societal benchmarks it chose to set for itself.  Governments whose nationals have breached these standards must  accept that it is improper to do anything which might influence  the course of justice. An Australian arrested with eight other  foreign students, including Fay, last October jumped bail. He  is thought to have fled the country. Cases against a Malaysian,  a Hongkonger and a second American are pending. The Malaysian  and British authorities have kept clear -- decorously. The U.S.  Government, having monitored the Fay case since his arrest, as  is its convention of helping nationals in distress abroad,  should have known when to back off.</p>

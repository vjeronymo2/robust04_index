			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's risks flight of Names - and insurance giants will fill the void (3) Sir, Lloyd's is one of those marvellous British institutions which works very well if everyone behaves like a gentleman and the bounders are kept out. There is a strong feeling that Lloyd's is interested in preserving its name at the expense of the Names. The report does realise that without the Names there is no Name but does little to put matters right. The Council of Lloyds might be accused of a serious lack of care in allowing an agency to go out of business without the need to renew errors and omissions cover for mistakes that would not be visible for two years after it went out of business. This is exactly the case with Lime Street agencies whose members suffered some of the worst losses (being on both Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates). This agency has now ceased to function and carries no errors and omission policy beyond the date of its ceasing operations. Liability policies were only on a claims made basis and cannot cover claims made later. Apparently this is fully permitted by the Council of Lloyds and would seem to indicate a certain lack of concern for Names. At the very minimum agents should not be allowed to incorporate but should remain personally liable for errors and omissions committed by them. The Name of Lloyd's should not be used to attract Names who then come to feel themselves exploited. Edward de Bono L2 Albany Piccadilly, London W1V 9RR</p>

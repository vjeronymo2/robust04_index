			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Politics ahead of science - The debate surrounding waste disposal around the world, in the first of a series Disposing of mounting piles of waste is one of the hardest environmental problems for governments to get right. Few have yet done so. The issue causes political pitfalls. In many industrialised countries, recycling is one of the few 'green' issues which reliably stirs up public passion even when recession has muted other concerns about the environment. It gives economists headaches: are taxes or regulation the best tools, and how tough should they be? These debates also take place against a backdrop of scientific controversy about which disposal methods harm the environment least, a debate handicapped by a shortage of thorough research. 'Much recycling does not make economic sense - and some of it uses more energy than it saves,' says Steve Webb, policy director of the UK's National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors (NAWDC). Industrialised countries are now grappling with attempts to improve the control of solid waste from every part of their economies, from households and industry to agriculture and mining. The European Union is working on a new directive to insist that a majority of packaging is recycled. More than 70 countries worldwide - with the notable exception of Russia - agreed last month to ban dumping of radioactive material at sea. North Atlantic countries have signed a similar, tighter, treaty restricting many kinds of industrial dumping at sea. Meanwhile, the US Superfund legislation on cleaning up contaminated land, one of the most ambitious pieces of environmental regulation yet passed, is soon due for re-authorisation. Superfund's critics argue that full compliance could cost the private sector Dollars 500bn (Pounds 342bn) and the government's defence and energy departments, and that overhaul of the rules is urgently needed. This legislative effort on solid waste tends to be greatest in developed countries. For these parts of the world, air and water pollution can seem more pressing - a ranking of priorities acknowledged by the Chinese environment ministry, for example. Yet although much regulation has been in the pipeline for years, recession in industrialised countries has made industry more reluctant to pay. It has stimulated questions as to whether the rules will really protect the environment and whether the price being asked is too high. Putting numbers on the size of the world's waste problem is difficult, partly because defining waste is no trivial question. Proponents of waste-to-energy - incineration of rubbish to extract heat - argue that much household rubbish can be regarded as a raw material. What is waste at one time can be re-exploited later - witness the growing practice of washing east European slag heaps to extract more coal. Occasionally problems of definition lead to farce. Polish steel makers have suffered shortages of steel scrap to melt down because Polish scrap has been exported to earn hard currency, but imports of scrap have been restricted because it was defined as waste, steel industry companies say. Nevertheless, OECD figures suggest that municipal waste grew at between 1-2 per cent a year during the 1980s, slightly behind growth in GDP. Recession slowed that growth, but European waste companies expect the rate soon to resume to that of the last decade. Figures also point to a second problem: the growing proportion of plastics, which contain complex chemicals, sometimes toxic, that make them hard to recycle. In the past 15 years, the proportion of municipal waste made up of plastics has risen by several per cent in most OECD countries to between 8 per cent and 15 per cent, largely at the expense of glass. Countries are now weighing up a range of solutions for tackling these trends. One vocal lobby says that waste disposal costs (and energy costs) should rise steeply to encourage companies to use resources more efficiently. Companies acknowledge that this works: ICI, the international chemicals group, says that its paints division has cut its waste by more than half in the past four years because of tighter regulation. But economists, such as Dieter Helm, director of Oxera, the Oxford-based forecasting group, argue that measures like these simply produce a one-off shift in behaviour, and avoid longer term questions of picking the right waste strategy. The main options, once the waste exists, are recycling, incineration, burying it or dumping in rivers and the sea. The tendency of regulation in the past few years has been to encourage each country - sometimes each company or town - to deal with its own waste. In particular, that has cut down the opportunities for dumping at sea, one of the cheapest outlets. But many argue that these strategic decisions have not been taken on the basis of scientific evidence. The UK government, which last month signed the London Convention against dumping radioactive waste at sea because of 'the weight of international pressure', argued that 'scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea under controlled conditions causes no harm to the marine environment'. However, at home, its own enthusiasm for recycling has come under similar attack. NAWDC argues that while recycling aluminium cans saves energy, recycling plastics does not - a conclusion which Dow Chemicals supports. According to Webb: 'Politicians concentrate on household waste because people like to be told to recycle.' But household waste makes up only 20m tonnes - around a seventh - of the total, including industrial and commercial waste. The consequences of shaping complex regulation with too little regard to the underlying science are serious, however: an extra burden on industrial costs that could harm competitiveness. True, the sharp differences in landfill costs between countries (see table) are partly the result of local geography. In the Netherlands, fears of polluting the water table mean that landfills are scarce while in the UK, geology and extensive quarrying for building materials have left a large number of suitable holes to be filled in, and landfill absorbs around 85 per cent of waste. But the disparities are also due to the strictness of regulation. Waste companies this week warned the UK government that its proposed waste management rules could add a third to landfill costs, and proposals for a EU landfill directive would have an even greater impact. Perhaps the best example of the difficulty of judging the impact of waste regulation is the German packaging recycling scheme. The mandatory recycling targets pushed Duales System Deutschland, the scheme operator, into near-bankruptcy and mounds of unwanted paper and plastics were sent across the German borders. Politicians have appeared tolerant of the environmental lobbies, which have gradually ruled out cheap ways of disposing of waste. But the enthusiasm for recycling in particular shows how their impulses can too easily lead to rules which are expensive and even environmentally damaging. David Pearce, a leading environmental economist and former adviser to the UK government, points out adeptly in his recent book, Blueprint 3 - measuring sustainable development, that waste disposal is an area where governments have been particularly poor in weighing up costs and benefits. The risk, he warns, is that their strategies lead to inefficiency and a waste of resources. Some of the legislation in the pipeline - in particular the EU packaging directive - offers a chance to remedy those flaws. But in general, waste management is a case of politics running too far ahead of economics and science. Next week's article focuses on Japan.  --------------------------------------------- LANDFILL PRICING (per tonne)*  --------------------------------------------- Country                        Range                             (Pounds)  --------------------------------------------- France                         20-36 Germany                        40-60 Italy                          40-60 Finland                        14-29 Neths                          26-70 UK                              6-18 Spain                           2-10 Sweden                         10-43 Australia                    3.50-12 New Zealand                    12-18 US                             10-44 Latin America                    2-4 SE Asia                       1.50-5  --------------------------------------------- * Municipal solid waste  ---------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPOSITION OF MUNICIPAL WASTE 1990 (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Paper and   Plastics   Glass   Metals   Food and  Other                paperboard                                 garden  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                     38          8       7        8         25     14 Japan                  38         11       7        6         32      6 France                 31         10      12        6         25     16 Spain                  20          7       8        4         49     12 Sweden                 44          7       8        2         30      9 UK                     37         10       9        7         19     18 Hungary                22          5       6        5          -     61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD/Industry estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

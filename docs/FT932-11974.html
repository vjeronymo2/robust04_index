			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / People: Waste Management International Nigel Wilson, the former chief executive of corporate affairs at GPA, the aircraft leasing company, has been appointed finance director of Waste Management International, the UK-listed overseas arm of Waste Management of the US. Wilson, 36, is a former managing director of Stanhope Property and group commercial director of Dixons. The appointment is part of Waste Management International's desire to be seen as a blue chip stock in the UK. The company, which operates in Europe and Asia, last year offered 20 per cent of its equity to investors. Although Wilson's tenure with GPA only lasted a year, his decision to leave was a blow to the group's hopes to restructure its debts. He was primarily responsible for the company's communication with the outside world and is expected to use his good relationships with investors and bankers to produce a bigger profit for Waste Management International outside the US, particularly in Europe and the Far East. Wilson says he is excited by environmental services which has become a global business. WMI provies a range of solid and hazardous waste management services.</p>

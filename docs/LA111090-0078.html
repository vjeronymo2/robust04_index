			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JANSONS CONDUCTS LENINGRAD PHIHARMONIC  </P> <P> Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, a work heard hereabouts, year in and year out,  more than regularly -- in the last 10 days, one could count at least three  performances in local halls, for instance -- is so familiar we often take it  for granted.  </P> <P> But there was nothing to take for granted Thursday night when the visiting  Leningrad Philharmonic played the second of its four tour programs in the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and ended it with the ubiquitous Fifth.  </P> <P> As was reported after the Leningrad orchestra appeared in Costa Mesa on Sunday  -- with the same program it later performed on Wednesday in the Pavilion -- its  Tchaikovsky playing is revelatory.  </P> <P> This time, associate conductor Mariss Jansons led the orchestra in a program  beginning with a suite from Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet," and the same  composer's First Piano Concerto.  </P> <P> Jansons, who proved his expertise as a Tchaikovskian when he made his debut  with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in March, 1988, again showed his mastery at  the close of this agenda.  </P> <P> The Latvian-born musician's reading of the Fifth had the musical authority and  emotional grasp of his remembered Second, Fourth and Sixth Symphonies with our  own Philharmonic, at those Wiltern Theatre performances.  </P> <P> Fervor, plasticity of line and emotional directness made this a memorable  performance. And the Soviet orchestra played splendidly, giving Jansons all the  sweep and detailing of his well-paced conception. Some of those details will  remain in the memory for a long time to come.  </P> <P> The Prokofiev half of this performance, however, disappointed.  </P> <P> In the "Romeo" suite, Jansons seemed to encourage the band to overplay. He  certainly did not discourage the very loud and unmodulated blasting that  emerged regularly during these five movements. What one heard at the peaks of  loudness was more noise than resonance, and quite unpleasant. Also, the playing  was unbalanced and exhibited quirky tone qualities.  </P> <P> The disappointment in the D-flat Piano Concerto was in not being able to hear  with reasonable clarity what seemed to be a definitive reading by Dmitri  Alexeyev, who had played the Third Concerto at the concerts of Sunday and  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Alexeyev would appear to be as accomplished and charismatic as his reputation.  What one could hear, beneath the sonic storm usually covering his playing, made  the blood rush and the eyebrows raise. And in a work we used to consider more  interesting than cherishable. Obviously, this is a pianist.  </P></p>

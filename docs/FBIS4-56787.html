			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 8 May (EFE) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro  said during an interview with a Barbados television station: "I  get a kick out of all those rumors about my health; they are  constantly killing me." The interview was broadcast in its  entirety today by Cuban television.    Jokingly, Castro remarked: "The day I die, my enemies will  miss me because they will not have anyone to struggle against,  while my friends will not believe I have died because there have  been so many false reports of my death before."    Fidel Castro, responding to a rumor 15 days ago that said he  was ill, asserted that his attendance at the conference in  Barbados on the sustained development of small island states "is  the best demonstration of my good health."    "If one has the capacity to listen to 100 speeches, it is  because one is in good health because if something can kill you  it is 100 speeches," the Cuban leader commented in the same  humorous tone.    In addition, Fidel Castro ruled out, for the time being, his  retirement, "because in difficult times my retirement could  appear to be a desertion and I am not a deserter." Castro noted,  "While the people demand I fulfill specific responsibilities,  regardless of my wishes, I will have to do so, and if I have to  do this until my last day, I will do it. I have the right as  anyone else to do as I please with my life. I would like to have  the right to retire, but one does not retire when one wishes."</p>

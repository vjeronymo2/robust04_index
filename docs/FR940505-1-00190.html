			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Mobile Sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the utilization of technological advances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for mobile sources, such as those discussed above in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.B.5.d.iii., will ultimately allow the South Coast FIP area to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attain the ozone NAAQS by the CAA deadline. Were EPA required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve the standards with mobile source measures that relied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only on the current level of technology, EPA would be forced to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose measures which it believes would bring about severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic hardship to the South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the attainment demonstration discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (section III.H.), ozone attainment in the South Coast requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately a 90 percent reduction in VOC and a 70 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from the 1990 baseline. Mobile source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will need to be reduced by this percentage to yield  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment. The proposed mobile source strategies presented in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.D. will achieve reductions of 66 percent for VOC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 51 percent for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from the 1990 baseline. EPA proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commit to achieving the remaining balance of 24 percent VOC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19 percent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions from future technologies, such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ones discussed in section III.B.5.d.iii.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish these mobile source reductions according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following schedule. New technology rules will be proposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 2001, and promulgated by July 1, 2002. The rules will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for the additional 24 percent VOC and 19 percent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions by the year 2010. Since sufficient lead time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduce any new technology will be needed, EPA proposes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules will begin implementation by January 1, 2006. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation date will allow for four years of fleet turnover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to produce the needed reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Commitment to adopt contingency measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this NPRM, EPA also proposes to commit to issue by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1999, contingency measures sufficient to achieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative percent reduction in VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions assigned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each new technology measure. As the Act requires, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingency measures would go into effect and achieve substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions, if the new technology measures are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed or fail to achieve the specified reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Attainment Demonstrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An attainment demonstration is a key part of a State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Implementation Plan: using air quality modeling, it shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed emission control measures are sufficient for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NAAQS to be attained by the applicable deadline. <FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>  For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone nonattainment areas classified ``Serious'', ``Severe'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Extreme'', section 182(c)(2)(A) requires an attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration based on photochemical grid modeling, for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Urban Airshed Model (UAM) is the EPA-approved model. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix W of 40 CFR part 51.) Under section 187(a)(7), SIPs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CO areas having design values above 12.7 ppm must also have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment demonstration, which EPA has generally interpreted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean a UAM demonstration. As discussed previously in this NPRM,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIPs demonstrating attainment of the ozone NAAQS are required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura, and a FIP carbon monoxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment demonstration is required for South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 101 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For ozone and CO nonattainment areas, the Act provides that SIPs (and FIPs) demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but not later than dates that are specified for each classification. For example, under section 181(a), ``Serious'' ozone nonattainment areas must demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but not later than November 15, 1999. In section III.B., EPA reviews the potential for demonstrating attainment in each of the FIP areas before the deadlines set in section 181(a) for ozone nonattainment areas and in section 186(a) for CO nonattainment areas. The attainment demonstration analyses presented below in this section do not repeat the discussion of alternative attainment dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is a goal of EPA for the FIPs to match as closely as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible the ozone SIPs that California is developing for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 1994 submittal. EPA and the State are coordinating FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and SIP modeling to avoid duplication of effort and divergent FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and SIP modeling conclusions. Projected reduction targets had to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined well in advance of this NPRM in order to choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control strategies and develop regulations to implement them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the State and EPA are continuing to refine the modeling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed FIP attainment demonstrations are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preliminary modeling results for the three areas. Rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using UAM to directly simulate the air quality benefit of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control measures, today's proposal shows attainment by reducing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total emissions to meet UAM-generated reduction targets. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targets were derived from a series of UAM simulations of generic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``across-the-board'' emission reductions that attain the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This method has shortcomings discussed below, but is the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure available at this time, and gives results that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable to a full simulation. If subsequent analysis by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and EPA shows that different target levels and control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies are more technically appropriate, EPA intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate these in the final FIP notice or in subsequent FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An additional issue for attainment demonstrations, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise addressed in the FIP proposal, is the phenomenon of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutant transport between air basins. If one area is causing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment in another area downwind under some meteorological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, then additional controls may need to be applied in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or both areas. Ideally, a single large modeling domain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating both upwind and downwind areas should be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess pollutant transport between them. It is anticipated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the methods California will employ to address transport in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 1994 ozone SIPs might be used in the final FIP. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could eventually result in revisions to the FIP, which may impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater control requirements in the FIP areas than appear in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's proposal if there is, for example, transport from Los  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Angeles to San Diego and Ventura. The transport analysis could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also result in additional FIP controls for areas not covered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed FIPs, such as the San Francisco Bay Area or the San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Joaquin Valley, which are upwind of Sacramento.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Baseline inventories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustments to State's emissions inventories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California provided 1990 base-year annual and peak season  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions inventories for ozone precursors (ROG, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO) by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air basin and county with the emissions inventory SIP submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of November 13, 1992. EPA relied heavily on the November 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory in this NPRM. Revised inventories for the base-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were provided by CARB on November 15, 1993, and these have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially incorporated in this NPRM. In some cases, however, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not have sufficient time to fully evaluate and/or incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the November 1993 data into the FIP modeling. It should be noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that CARB uses ROG almost interchangeably with ROC (reactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic compounds), but both include ethane, which EPA exempts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the definition of VOC under the assumption that ethane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reacts too slowly for significant ozone formation in the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of concern (up to several days). CARB compensates for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between ROG and VOC by providing EPA a listing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fractional ethane emitted from each Source Classification Code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SCC). For purposes of this NPRM, EPA also drew on inventories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared by local air pollution control agencies as discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Basis for projected emission inventories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Base-year (generally 1990) emission inventory estimates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected to change in future years. EPA projects emissions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each emission category to the targeted attainment year (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2010 for South Coast) based on category specific emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors. These factors include, for example, housing starts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment, population, gasoline sales, and sales tax revenues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Stationary Sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Pohl takes Bonn to task over economic policies THE FORMER Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, has stoked up fresh controversy about Chancellor Helmut Kohl's economic policies - just at the time when Germany is under increasing pressure from strikes and rising budget deficits, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. In a book on the Bundesbank written by a German journalist, Mr Pohl is quoted as criticising the Bonn government for allegedly putting the D-Mark at risk over its policies towards east Germany. He also complains that the Chancellor made too many concessions over European monetary union at the Maastricht summit. Mr Pohl's comments in the book were made in conversation with the author, Mr Dieter Balkhausen, a television journalist, rather than in a formal interview. There is no doubt, however, that the remarks ascribed to him reflect his bitterness about Mr Kohl's handling of German unification and European monetary union. In the book, Gutes Geld &amp; schlechte Politik (Good Money and Bad Politics), Mr Pohl is quoted as saying that at a cabinet meeting at the end of 1990 he pleaded for a change of course to prevent state finances and inflation from running out of control. 'But what followed was shameful. Neither were the necessary savings put into motion, nor did the impossibly costly promises diminish.' Instead, 'the amount of the expensive pledges and announcements increased'. Mr Pohl makes clear that dissatisfaction with the government was an important reason for his surprise resignation last July. He is unhappy about the agreement at Maastricht on future economic and currency union in the EC, while political union had still to be agreed. 'This is another crash course a la GDR (East Germany) that only the rich brother can make possible.' He points to the huge costs of adjusting living standards in Europe and says this cannot be done in a decade. (At Maastricht, it was agreed that currency union would be introduced around the turn of the century for countries meeting certain economic criteria.) 'A common currency only makes sense when economic, tax, finance, and social policies are really interlinked,' he says. Mr Pohl charges that Mr Kohl, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, and other politicians agreed to too generous an exchange rate for the old East German Mark for the German currency union of July 1990. The Bundesbank, which had recommended a less favourable rate for the east Germans, agreed to the government's wishes under political pressure despite its reservations, Mr Pohl says. 'The vote of the Bundesbank was misused to stimulate expectations in the GDR and thus improve election chances.'</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Political decisions influence Brussels and Milan bourses POLITICS upset Milan but lifted Brussels yesterday, while holidays kept senior bourses quiet, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was dealt a serious blow by President Francesco Cossiga's refusal to sign a bill to liberalise car insurance premiums. The Comit index fell 3.63 to 532.40. Analysts said that the bill was now unlikely to become law ahead of the general election in April or, because of its unpopularity, to be taken up again by the next government. In any case, the EC is expected to force Italy to liberalise its car insurance market in 1994. They added that Mr Cossiga had shattered the only real investment theme in the Italian stock market. The one glimmer of hope was that the authorities would compensate the insurers with an above-inflation rise in car insurance premiums this year. There was widespread selling of insurers, which had been expected to see a turnround in profits as a result of the reform. Sai and Lloyd Adriatico, both heavily exposed to the car insurance market, fell L400 and L290 respectively to L13,400 and L15,410. But Generali, which fell L260 to L30,690 at the fixing, improved slightly after hours. In banks, Santo Spirito and Banco di Roma continued to weaken after last week's share exchange news. Indifferent 1991 results also weighed on the sector. BRUSSELS rose to a two-year high on weekend news that Belgium's mainstream political parties had reached an accord on forming a new government. Cyclical shares were particularly favoured as the Bel-20 Index rose 18.66 to 1,229.21 in turnover of BFr1.5bn. In the insurance sector, Groupe AG rose BFr90 to BFr2,200 and Royale Belge picked up BFr140 to BFr4,570, on speculation that they would both merge with banks. FRANKFURT had a quiet day as carnival closed Dusseldorf and turnover dropped from DM6bn to DM3.5bn. The DAX index closed 2.74 higher at 1,747.87 after a decline of 0.46 to 709.29 in the FAZ at midsession. Volkswagen, depressed in 1991, closed DM6.50 higher at DM368.10, up 28 per cent from its 1992 low. Allianz, the insurer, strong recently after deeply discounted rights issue terms, put on another DM20 to DM2,420. Among second-liners, Rutgerswerke, the chemicals group, dropped DM20 to DM400 on profit-taking after a 29 per cent rise in the previous four weeks. PARIS had a quiet day, the CAC-40 index ending 3.71 down at 1,979.67 after trading in a 13-point range. Turnover was thin at FFr1.5bn, reflecting school holidays. Leading blue chips were largely unchanged, but there was some activity in smaller stocks. A block of 150,000 shares in TF1 was put through the market at FFr380 and there were rumours that the sellers were the Maxwell group or GMF, an insurance company. But rumours that the buyer was Bouygues were dismissed by analysts because the construction company was limited to its 25 per cent stake. TF1 closed down FFr11 at FFr379 in total volume of 155,687 shares. The television company is known to have an unstable shareholding structure and analysts expect the fight for control to resurface. AMSTERDAM closed slightly lower in dull trade. The CBS Tendency Index slipped back 0.4 to 126.2. Buhrmann Tetterode fell 90 cents to Fl 43.10 before its results, which came out after the close, showed a 25 per cent fall in net profits. The paper and office equipment group also said that the dividend would be cut. Fokker, which announced on Friday that it was paying its first dividend for five years, rose 30 cents to Fl 32.00. Heineken, which reports 1991 results on Thursday, fell Fl 1.20 in early trading but recovered to close down 10 cents at Fl 168.80. OSLO corrected last week's fall and the all-share index closed up 6.60 or 1.6 per cent to close at 418.91 in turnover of NKr252.5m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr4 to NKr141.5 while Saga Petroleum A rose NKr0.50 to Nkr71.50. Den Norske Bank, which was suspended for three hours on Friday, rose NKr0.90 to NKr7.30. COPENHAGEN's CSE index slipped 2.19 to 345.34 in relatively lively trading, writes Hilary Barnes. Speculation that Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister since 1982, may be forced to resign later this year reinforced the market's negative mood. Investors took unkindly to Carlsberg's rights issue, although it was priced at a deeply-discounted DKr200, the B shares falling by DKr22 to DKr318 yesterday. STOCKHOLM said that high liquidity among institutional investors, falling Swedish interest rates and strong foreign interest were behind a rise in the Affarsvarlden General index of 9.5 to 950.9. Volvo B rose SKr4 to SKr382, and Procordia restricted A by SKr7 to SKr200. The rise followed a newspaper report saying that Volvo and the Swedish state might each sell their 42.7 per cent voting stakes in Procordia. MADRID was overshadowed by results from Telefonica which reported a 33 per cent increase in 1991 net profits. However, unease over the group's short-term prospects depressed the stock which closed down Pta30 or 2.5 per cent at Pta1,1175. The general index fell 0.15 to 266.36.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1166.09  1166.43  1166.67  1167.16  1167.43  1167.87  1167.68  1169.17  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1169.42    Day's Low  1163.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 28    Feb 27    Feb 26    Feb 25    Feb 24 1169.95   1167.26   1165.89   1156.42   1163.91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Branson and James seek Dan-Air rescue MR RICHARD Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and Mr David James, chairman of Davies &amp; Newman, are meeting today to try to thrash out a deal to secure the future of the Dan-Air airline. It is nearly two weeks since Davies &amp; Newman's shares were suspended at 23p as talks intensified. The negotiations cover marketing and operational links between the two airlines, the possibility of Mr Branson investing Pounds 10m and the Virgin name being put to a revamped airline. Mr James would then use Branson's involvement to sweeten the pill of another share issue. Last year institutional investors, many new to the company, coughed up Pounds 49.3m. As Mr Branson's advisers have studied Davies &amp; Newman's books, the impression has leaked of figures which seem rather bleaker than was expected initially. One analyst's estimate that this year's pre-tax losses would be Pounds 10m has been described as much too low, with speculation that the figure could be three times as much. As Davies &amp; Newman is due to announce its first-half results shortly, it is refusing to comment. The options emerging from the Branson talks include: For Davies &amp; Newman to stick to its original strategy of building up the Gatwick-based scheduled operation, enhanced by the Branson link. Another injection of institutional cash enables it to trade through the recessionary period. The question is whether Mr Branson believes the present set-up to be viable and whether the banks and investors will be prepared to give further financial support. A salvage operation takes place, with both charter and scheduled operations pruned back to a profitable core. The Virgin name might be put to this and institutional funds sought for the relaunch. Mr Branson walks away and Mr James seeks another partner to help the original plan reach fruition. All plans fail and the company goes into administration or receivership. This is being dismissed by the Davies &amp; Newman camp. Mr Branson, in New York yesterday to launch Virgin's US frequent flier programme, said he expects negotiations with Dan Air to come to a head in the next 24 hours. 'If we were to do anything with Dan Air, it would be entirely separate from Virgin at first' he said.</p>

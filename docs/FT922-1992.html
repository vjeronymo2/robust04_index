			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Letter: More academic specialists needed for antiques fair vetting Sir, I also was saddened by the headline 'United front falls apart' (June 13) on an otherwise completely just report from Susan Moore - the fair at Grosvenor House is doing well, looks very good and is certainly not falling apart. The president and members of the executive of the Grosvenor House Antiques Fair (Letters, June 15) are well aware of my own feelings about the appeal which reversed the earlier ludicrous rejection by the vetting committee since I wrote to them on June 14 as follows: 'As we knew would be the case, you conducted our appeal in the matter of the Burgundian Jewel in an entirely exemplary way and this was in the best tradition of the association.' That, however, is not what it is all about. What I and my colleagues were not pleased about was the wholesale rejection this year of - again I quote - 'so many perfectly good objects from our stand (dramatically more than ever before in our long experience) many of which had been exhibited during previous years . . . I feel it is essential that many more academic and disinterested specialists be brought in as we have been suggesting by letter for the last three years'. I am happy to say that this policy is now being pursued and I hope, as a former president of both the British Antique Dealers' Association and The Antique Dealers' Fair, that it gains momentum, and that the judgment of the vetting committees will in the future be beyond reproach for the benefit of everyone. A Kenneth Snowman, chairman, Wartski, 14 Grafton Street, London W1</p>

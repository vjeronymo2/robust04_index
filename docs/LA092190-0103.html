			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL GAME RESCHEDULED  </P> <P> The high school football game between Beverly Hills and Harvard at Harvard has  been rescheduled for 3:30 p.m. Saturday in observance of Rosh Hashanah.  </P> <P> Harvard Coach Gary Thran, who rescheduled the game, attempted to make the  contest a night game on Saturday but was unable to locate an available field at  short notice.  </P> <P> "Neither one of us have (lighted fields)," Thran said. "We also have a problem  with the game being on Saturday because it's open house at Harvard. Our campus  is really going to be crowded."  </P></p>

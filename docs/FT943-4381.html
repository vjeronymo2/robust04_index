			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Scottish survey figures amended The result of a survey which showed an alarming drop in the value of electronic components which companies in Scotland obtain from local sources has been amended following further analysis. The original survey said the Scottish electronics industry obtained 5 per cent of its material inputs from Scotland in 1994, compared with 12 per cent in 1992, in spite of a 16 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 9bn. Yesterday the Scottish Partnership in Electronics for Effective Distribution, which lobbies for better transport links, said the correct figure for 1994 material inputs from Scotland should have been 10 per cent. The value of Scottish-sourced inputs rose from Pounds 590m in 1992 to Pounds 660m in 1994.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Doubt on upturn in construction Civil engineers are becoming concerned that the construction recovery may be starting to lose pace, says a survey of more than 130 companies published today. The survey by the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors shows that there has been a disturbing decline in invitations to tender for work during the first three months of this year. Mr John Hackett, federation director-general, said the findings were mixed: 'Some of the answers were the best we have received for four years. 'There has been some further improvement in orders actually won and there has been the first sign of an increase in jobs. On the other hand, cost increases are accelerating and threatening to reverse the easing of the squeeze on contractors' margins.' The proportion of companies reporting a fall in invitations to tender compared with 12 months earlier has increased from 18 per cent to 27 per cent since the previous survey published at the beginning of this year. The proportion reporting a rise in tender invitations has fallen from 43 per cent to 27 per cent. Mr Hackett said: 'With our members aware that the Department of Transport will be starting fewer new road schemes in 1994-95 than in 1993-94; that English local authorities' road spending plans have been hit by the savage cut in transport supplementary grants; and that the English and Welsh water industry has been holding back on investment pending the outcome of Ofwat's price limits review, it is hardly surprising we have found members less confident than previously about prospects for the coming 12 months. 'With additional orders already in the book it looks as if the recent slight recovery in employment may hold up through 1994, but once again we have a majority of firms fearing that the flow of new orders will tail off over the coming year.' The federation said that much of the recent rise in new orders had been due to a few large projects such as the extension to London Underground's Jubilee Line. These orders were very welcome but benefited relatively few contractors, it added.</p>

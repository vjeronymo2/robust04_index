			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: REGION;  </P> <P> WATER FUND REVIEW REJECTED  </P> <P> The State Water Resources Control Board has declined to look into concerns  raised by local water agencies upset over changes negotiated privately in a  $20.5-million escrow account involving a controversial Azusa landfill.  </P> <P> Local water officials complained that the changes, quietly granted by the state  to Browning-Ferris Industries and its Azusa landfill subsidiary, could allow  the firms to reclaim the money they pledged toward cleanup of San Gabriel  Valley water pollution.  </P> <P> However, the state water board's attorney has notified the Upper San Gabriel  Valley Municipal Water District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern  California and the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster that they failed "to  raise any substantial issues which merit review."  </P> <P> Under the agreement, BFI's $20.5 million would be returned to the company if it  is able to track down parties believed responsible for the pollution.11/18/90  </P></p>

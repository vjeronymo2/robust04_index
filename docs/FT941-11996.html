			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo lifted by US growth PepsiCo, the US soft drink, snacks and fast-food restaurant group, suffered poor results from its international businesses. However, strong growth in the US helped the group report a 12 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 442.5m for its fourth quarter, excluding unusual items. The comparable quarter's net profit of Dollars 265.6m included a restructuring charge, and PepsiCo said the figure of Dollars 394.1m, excluding the charge, was a better comparison. On that basis, earnings per share rose to 55 cents from 32 cents. Mr Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive, said the strong volume growth in most of PepsiCo's operations indicated the fundamental vitality of its businesses. International beverage profits fell by 65 per cent to Dollars 5.1m, reflecting a combination of expansion costs, seasonal losses at newly-acquired businesses, the strength of the US dollar, and higher concentrate pricing in several countries. Profits from international snack foods rose 7 per cent to Dollars 102.5m, but international restaurant profits fell 41 per cent to Dollars 23.2m because of increases in development spending and poor results from Australia. Domestic beverage profits rose 15 per cent to Dollars 227.7m through a combination of volume growth, lower packaging and ingredient costs, and an favourable adjustment to prior years' acquisition-related reserves. Domestic snack food profits rose 14 per cent to Dollars 283.9m and domestic restaurant profits 20 per cent to Dollars 221.4m. For the year, sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 25bn. Net income was Dollars 1.59bn, compared with Dollars 374.3m last time, but PepsiCo said the increase would have been 16 per cent without the previous year's charges. On that basis, earnings per share rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 2.</p>

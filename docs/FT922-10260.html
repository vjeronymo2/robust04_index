			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Private functions, public concerns - How Lonrho came to strike a deal with Libya MR ADNAN Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian financier, never does things by halves. The venue he chose for the first meeting between Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, and representatives of Libya's Colonel Muammer Gadaffi was Paris' fashionable Restaurant Laurent. On Thursday November 21 1991, Mr Rowland, accompanied by Mr Robin Whitten, a Lonrho director, joined Mr Khashoggi and a group of other businessmen at a table booked for 20 people at the restaurant. The others included: Mr Reda Alaywan, a Lebanese businessmen; a Libyan based in Paris who asked not to be identified; and Mr Mousdafa Zouhde, head of the African operations of the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico), Libya's state-owned overseas investment arm. The Libyans were seeking ways of investing in western companies; Mr Khashoggi thought Lonrho, with its long history of close relations with governments in sub-Saharan Africa, might be the perfect partner. At the lunch, the conversation centred on one thing: how Lafico and Lonrho could 'mutually work for their best interests', according to one participant. Less than five months later, the discussions over that Paris lunch table had led to a Pounds 170m deal to make the Libyans partners in one of Lonrho's hotel chains. There was to be one other consequence: yesterday, the US administration revealed it was investigating the relationship between Libya and Lonrho  - an investigation which might lead to Mr Rowland's company being blacklisted in the US. All that was still in the future when the idea of the lunch was first hatched by Mr Khashoggi and Mr Alaywan in September. That month, the two men signed a joint venture agreement and established a joint company named Kadir, based in the British Virgin Islands, with its registered office at PO Box 3136, Road Town, Tortola, to exploit what they perceived as Lafico's desire to expand in the West. Mr Alaywan and Mr Khashoggi were natural partners. The former had extensive contacts with Lafico - he was already acting as an intermediary between Lafico and the president of a chain of French hotels, for example. Mr Khashoggi had excellent western contacts with potential partners and a formidable reputation as a broker of deals between westerners and Arab governments during the oil boom of the 1970s and early 1980s. In October Mr Khashoggi approached Mr Rowland about possibly doing business with the Libyans. Lonrho had just completed one of its most disappointing financial years. Pre-tax profits had fallen by 24 per cent to Pounds 207m, the final dividend was about be slashed and the balance sheet was looking weak as net debt rose to over Pounds 1bn. On October 18 Mr Rowland wrote to Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, Lafico's chairman, saying how pleased he was to learn from Mr Khashoggi of Lafico's interests in expanding its involvement in hotels. He welcomed the opportunity of discussing how the two could collaborate. Ten days later Mr Ali El Huwej wrote back to Mr Rowland expressing Lafico's 'willingness (for the) highest collaborations in the involvement in your group's activities, namely the hotels chain, agriculture and any other field we find with interest'. Mr Ali El Huwej's letter underlined the importance Lafico attached to signing joint ventures with western companies. He revealed that Lafico had more than 80 joint ventures across five continents. The lunch followed. During the discussions, Lonrho's UK-based Metropole Hotels chain was identified as the first of many Lonrho businesses ripe for Libyan involvement, said one of those present. A further meeting to talk about the details of the deal was fixed for February in Geneva. Last night Lonrho issued a statement through its solicitors saying that there had been no further deals with Libyan institutions. As 1991 drew to a close, Lonrho's internal accountants and lawyers were ordered to produce a report on Lafico's western interests, according to one of the people who worked on the project. He added that Mr Rowland found the report's conclusions satisfactory. The second meeting between Lonrho and Lafico was held in Geneva on February 4 and 5 to hammer out the price for a one third stake in Metropole Hotels. This time Mr Rowland was accompanied by Mr Robert Dunlop, his joint deputy chairman, while Lafico was represented by Mr Ali El Huwej. One of the participants at the Geneva meeting said that the Pounds 177m price for the stake in Metropole was agreed fairly quickly. The money was then transferred to Lonrho the day before the deal was announced on March 26. Although Lonrho had got its cash, the relationship with Libya left investors unhappy. The share price later fell to 65 1/2 p, its lowest level since January 1984 and well below the 250p it reached as recently as last November. It closed yesterday at 106p. Investors were not the only people left unhappy. Mr Alaywan had understood that a commission of 10 per cent, or Pounds 17.6m would be paid to the intermediaries. In the event, he says, Mr Khashoggi said Mr Rowland would only pay 1 per cent. Mr Alaywan wrote to Mr Rowland asking for the commission, but says he has not heard from Lonrho. Relations between Lafico and Lonrho, however, remained smooth. Much time in Geneva was devoted to exploring what other joint deals the two might do in the future. But yesterday's news that Lonrho's Libyan dealings have triggered an investigation of the company by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) shows the price that Mr Rowland might have to pay for dealing with Lafico. There is now a real possibility that Lonrho could be placed on the US government's list of banned companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "C.G.": "Meri Laments `Appeasement' by the West"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 28 Feb -- The concern about developments in  Russia following the release of putschists Rutskoy and  Khasbulatov is reflected in the talks between Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel and the visitors from the Baltic states,  Azerbaijan, and Belarus in Bonn. This Tuesday [1 March], Kinkel  is scheduled to hold talks with Azeri Foreign Minister Hasanov  on relations between the Asian country and Russia, Armenia, and  Turkey. Possibilities of CSCE involvement in the settlement of  regional conflicts should also be discussed. On Thursday, the  Belarusian foreign minister will brief Kinkel on the relations  within the CIS after the election of a new president in Minsk  and the events in Moscow. In January, Kinkel invited the  Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian foreign ministers to Bonn for  joint talks; this meeting will take place next Wednesday. The  invitations to Foreign Ministers Luik (Estonia), Andrejevs  (Latvia), and Gylys (Lithuania) for consultations has to be seen  in connection with the increasing feeling in the Baltic states  of a threat from Russia. Even then, statements by Russian  Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said that Russia had "fundamental  vital interests" in the other successor states to the former  Soviet Union, the CIS, and the Baltics, have caused some fear.  With the foreign ministers of the Baltic countries Kinkel will  also discuss the issue of leading their countries closer to the  European Union [EU]. Since December, Germany has been trying to  extend the negotiating mandate of the Brussels Commission,  which, initially, only provided for talks on a free-trade  agreement. The agreements should now contain at least the  "prospects" for later EU membership, similarly to existing  Europe agreements with other countries.    Estonian President Meri described the Baltics as a  "touchstone for the European idea." In a lecture in Hamburg,  Meri expressed his concern that the West would not realize the  full extent of what was brewing in Russia. The West was  confounding what was desirable with reality. Meri said: "Just  like the West, all of us, including the Estonian people and the  other peoples in Central and East Europe, are interested in an  economically and socially stable Russia; however, if we look at  the events of the past few years, we would actually have to be  overcome by an eerie feeling that we have moved further and  further away from this objective." Meri did not conceal his  astonishment that the West "invited" Russian soldiers and tanks  to Sarajevo. One has to ask oneself whether a country that is  itself struggling with serious unsolved ethnic and ethical  problems, could act as a credible arbiter and peacemaker in  other countries. The ill-feeling was growing when reading one of  the most recent documents issued by the Russian Foreign  Ministry: "Here it says that the problem of the Russian ethnic  groups in the neighboring countries can not be solved by Russia  only through diplomatic means." Meri added that these Russian  ethnic groups often settled there in the wake of the occupiers  and after a massive deportation of the native population. One  can only conclude from the Moscow memorandum that, if necessary,  other means should also be used: "What these other means could  be has been experienced in a bitter way by us, the Estonians,  and other small nations in our recent history."  <H5>  Fear of "Power of Order" </H5>   In Russian foreign policy, the irrational element was  getting  the upper hand again, Meri said. Responsible Russian  politicians were openly speaking of an allegedly "special role"  of Russia, of its function as a "power of order," which the new  Russia had to fulfill on the territory of the entire former  Soviet Union. Yeltsin's adviser Karaganov has claimed for  Russia the role of "first among equals" on the entire territory  of the former Soviet empire. Meri said that one reason for his  fears was that Russia did not admit "that, in 1940, and again in  1944, the Baltic nations were occupied, annexed against their  will and in violation of international law and, subsequently,  Sovietized and Russified to the limit of their national  existence during five decades." Deputy Russian Foreign Minister  Krylov last week officially told the Baltic states that in 1940,  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the Soviet Union  "voluntarily." Meri said: "The next thing they will claim is  that tens of thousands of Estonians -- including my family and  myself -- `voluntarily' agreed to be deported to Siberia by the  Soviets."    Meri complained that the democratic West was tending to  follow a policy of "appeasement" toward Moscow, which, out of  convenience, is presented as realpolitik. "Against its better  knowledge," the West was thus making itself "an accomplice to  Russia's imperialist forces, who think they could solve the  enormous unsolved problems of their country by external  expansion and by threatening their neighbors." It is true that  the West was shocked by the statements of nationalist  Zhirinovskiy: "Still, surprisingly, hardly anybody recognizes  it and nobody protests when Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev  states that the Moscow government regards the continued presence  of Russian Forces in the former Soviet republics as desirable."  The widespread inclination in the West to regard whoever is in  power in Moscow -- from Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Gorbachev, or  Yeltsin -- as irreplaceable, has led to enormous faulty  investments and misjudgements. Meri said: "Those who really  want to help Russia and the Russian people today must  emphatically convince the Russian leadership that there is no  chance for a new imperialist expansion; those who fail to do so  will actually help the enemies of democracy in Russia and the  other postcommunist countries."    The West's, and Germany's, policy was facing the crucial  question of whether one should tolerate and finance a  neoimperialist policy of the superpower in the East and, in the  short term, maybe even benefit from it, or whether one wants to  facilitate the success of democracy, freedom, responsibility,  and peace between the Baltic Sea and the Pacific. The second  objective can be achieved only if the West contributes strongly  to the stability and security of the medium-sized and smaller  countries east of the German border. Meri was referring to the  countries of Central Europe from the Baltics to Ukraine. "If we  manage to integrate thise belt of states into the democratic  world, then these countries will have an exemplary effect on  Russia." The Baltic countries wanted and had to be safely  anchored in the West so that they could have a bridging function  from such a firm position -- and not from a gray zone -- and  could help the democratic forces in Russia. If, however, those  countries, one of which is Estonia, are left to themselves and  remain exposed without protection to Moscow's neoimperialist  appetite, "then the price would be so high that not even all of  Europe could pay it."</p>

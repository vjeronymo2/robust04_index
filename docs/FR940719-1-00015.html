			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter of April 18, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1276), Kentucky submitted a proposed program amendment that replaces a previous proposed program amendment dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260). The amendment consists of proposed new and amended statutes to KRS relating to disposal of coal combustion fly ash, bottom ash, and scrubber sludge under special waste permit-by-rule at KRS chapter 224. The proposed amendment, known as Senate Bill 266, was passed by Kentucky's General Assembly during the 1994 regular session.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed statutes offer surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal combustion waste on the permit area under the special waste permit-by-rule established at KRS Chapter 224. Applicants who obtain a permit from the Cabinet's Department for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement under these proposed revised statutes are deemed to have received a permit from the Cabinet's Department for Environmental Protection, Division of Waste Management, without having applied separately to the Division Of Waste Management. A person who wishes to dispose of coal combustion waste on a surface mining permit area in a manner that is not authorized in Senate Bill 266 may, as at present, apply separately to the Division of Waste Management for a special waste formal permit under KRS Chapter 224.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Senate Bill 266 contains the following changes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amend KRS 350.010 to define coal combustion by-products; create new sections of KRS 350 to allow the Department of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to issue a permit authorizing the disposal of coal combustion by-products at surface coal mining operations; exclude from application of the Act, coal combustion by-products for which a special waste formal permit or registered permit-by-rule is required under Chapter 224, and coal combustion by-products that have been mixed with hazardous or low volume waste; require an application to modify an existing surface mining permit to initially include disposal of coal combustion by-products to be a major amendment; in other cases involving coal combustion by-products, allow for minor revisions unless the cabinet determines otherwise; require removal of other materials from coal combustion by-products before disposal; confine disposal of coal combustion by-products to the pit or extraction area from which coal was removed_except that disposal may be allowed in other places within the permit area if the applicant demonstrates that no adverse environmental impacts will occur; prohibit disposal of any hazardous component of the coal combustion by-products from being disposed of under the permit; require maps showing locations and volumes of by-products disposed; require a lab analysis to characterize the coal combustion by-products; require newspaper advertisements stating that an application proposes disposal of coal combustion by-products; require an application to demonstrate the legal right to dispose to coal combustion by-products on the proposed disposal area; require the application to identify the facility that will generate the coal combustion by-products, a responsible official, components of the by-products, and the coal combustion by-products materials, weight, and volume; require analysis and a demonstration that each component of the coal combustion by-products does not contain any contaminant at a concentration that exceeds cabinet regulations; require the application to include a determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of disposal and measures to minimize disturbances; require a description of measures to be taken to keep the by-products from becoming airborne; require baseline ground and surface water data and monitoring wells; require that performance bond required under Chapter 350 cover disposal of coal combustion by-products when applicable; require the permittee to comply with environmental performance standards, to include placing the by-products at least four feet above the seasonal high water table unless exempted, limiting the volume of by-products disposed of on the permit area to the volume of the marketable coal seams to be removed, limiting the thickness of the disposed by-products to forty feet at any point, and requiring covering the by-products as contemporaneously as practicable with at least four feet of nonacid-forming spoil material; and require water quality monitoring and reporting until final bond release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is now seeking comment on whether the amendment proposed by Kentucky satisfies the applicable approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Kentucky program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Written Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commentor's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or at locations other than the Lexington Field Officer will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the Administrative Record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 6 (CNS) -- Some 300 cities out of  over 570 cities in China are suffering from shortage of water  with 50 in the very serious state of water supply, provoking a  severe restraint to the economic development in the country.    This week is the Water-saving week in China. [sentence as  published] According to the Ministry of Construction, China's  overall volume of water resources ranks sixth in the world while  its per capita water resources is only one fourth of the world  average. With the rapid economic development in the country, the  demand for water will greatly increase and the expansion and  saving of such resources has become an urgent task for the  country.    At a press conference on water-saving in cities in the  country held today, Vice Minister of Construction, Mr. Ye  Rutang, pointed out that management over water-saving should be  strengthened while the water-container leakage problem first of  all needed to be tackled.    The leakage of cisterns in toilets has become a  long-standing  problem for water-saving which has even aroused concern of  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, so that the ministry and the  National Construction Materials Bureau have decided that  fittings for washing vessels used in toilets would only be  allowed to be produced by the ten designated enterprises in some  cities including Guangzhou, Beijing and Tangshan. [sentence as  published]    In addition, the ministry has greatly encouraged the re-use  of processed waste water. China has now seen its annual volume  of drainage of waste water up to 30 billion cubic metres with  much of it being not re-used.    China has in recent years made some achievements in its  water-saving drive with 13.9 billion cubic metres of water being  saved in the past ten years, the repeated utilization rate of  water for industrial purposes in cities across the country has  increased to 60 percent, and the volume of water exhausted in  earning RMB [reminbi] 10 000 output value dropped by 60 percent.  Some cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo, have  effectively controlled their urban surface subsidence through  tightening management over the use of underground water.</p>

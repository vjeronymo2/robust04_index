			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN EMBRYOS CUSTODY CASE  </P> <P> I hope Kate Michelman (executive director of the National Abortions Rights  Action League) rethinks her hasty remark that the decision awarding custody of  frozen embryos to Mary Sue Davis represents a "dangerous implication for  reproductive freedom. . . ." To have supported Junior Davis' position that  these embryos are "property" and that he should not have to father a child  against his will would have had immediate and far-reaching effects on a woman's  right to control her body.  </P> <P> Once conception has taken place a man's biological function in the reproductive  cycle is fulfilled. Since Roe vs. Wade, law has supported the woman's exclusive  right to make all decisions subsequent to conception, including the right to  terminate the pregnancy or bring to term a child.  </P> <P> Junior Davis consented to these conceptions and, until the breakup of his  marriage, consented to full-term planned pregnancies. He changed his mind after  the fact of conception. A decision to support Mr. Davis' right to change his  mind and prevent the birth of an already conceived embryo would seriously  jeopardize the rights of women and subject them to lawsuits from disgruntled  boyfriends or mates demanding to terminate these pregnancies because they "do  not want to be fathers against their will."  </P> <P> DARLEEN MURPHY  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

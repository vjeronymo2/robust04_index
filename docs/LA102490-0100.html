			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANCERS WIN SHOWDOWN WITH ROYAL  </P> <P> As the Thousand Oaks High girls' volleyball team broke from its huddle before  the third game of Tuesday night's Marmonte League showdown at Royal, the  players shook with emotion.  </P> <P> Were the Lancers nervous because they trailed, two games to none? No, actually,  they were feeling a bit giggly.  </P> <P> "We went out (onto the court) laughing," outside hitter Aimee Stone said. "We  do so much better when we're having fun."  </P> <P> Laughter turned out to be the Lancers' best medicine. Thousand Oaks, ranked  fifth in the Southern Section 5-A Division, took the next three games to win  the match, 15-17, 8-15, 15-9, 15-2, 15-11.  </P> <P> Royal, ranked 10th in the 5-A Division, took a 7-1 lead in the fifth game  before Thousand Oaks (14-1, 11-0 in league play) made its second serve.  </P> <P> The Highlanders (11-2, 9-2) served with an 11-9 lead, but Erikka Gulbranson's  spike forced a sideout.  </P> <P> Gulbranson sandwiched two of her game-high five aces around a Cindy McKinnon  kill to give Thousand Oaks a 12-11 lead. A Royal error and two more McKinnon  kills gave Thousand Oaks the match.  </P> <P> Kaili Kimura and Gulbranson each had 17 kills and Stone added 16 for Thousand  Oaks. Royal's Wende Brown had a match-high 20 kills.  </P></p>

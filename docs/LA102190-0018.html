			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROG MAN  </P> <P> I can remember squirming with disgust when an unsuspecting frog lost his way  into our kitchen. I fluttered about the house agonizing over how I was going to  get the slimy intruder outside without making physical contact.  </P> <P> That was years ago, and, I must admit, time only intensified my aversion to  frogs. But after reading of their imminent extinction, I suddenly felt ashamed;  my animosity toward this helpless amphibian was not only unwarranted, it was  blatantly ignorant. Will this be yet another casualty in the name of modern  living? I sincerely hope not. Imagine how feeble our childhood fairy tales  would be without the frog.  </P> <P> I'm afraid the California red-legged is leaping on borrowed time. I only hope  Mark Jennings' census will lead to a solution before the frog is gone forever.  </P> <P> Jennings is right; they are just plain cute.  </P> <P> MARTHA MERCER  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

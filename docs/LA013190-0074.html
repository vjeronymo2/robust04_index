			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FALLETTA COAXES THE RIGHT NOTE FROM S.D. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> JoAnn Falletta, music director of the Long Beach Symphony, made an auspicious  local debut Monday night as guest conductor of the San Diego Chamber Orchestra.  In addition to her poise on the podium and polished baton technique, Falletta  was aided by oboe virtuoso Allan Vogel's wonted elegance in two oboe concertos.  And the unusually eager cadre of orchestra musicians meant it was not business  as usual at Sherwood Auditorium.  </P> <P> Falletta and company made their best case on the program's first half, devoted  to a pair of harmonically untroubled 20th-Century works, Dominick Argento's  "Homage to the Queen of Tonga" and Ralph Vaughan William's A Minor Oboe  Concerto.  </P> <P> The chamber orchestra has played the clever, pictorial Argento suite before,  but not with the tight ensemble Falletta demanded, nor with as much ebullient  good humor. Principal oboe Peggy Michel negotiated her many prickly solos with  stylish bravura; this was a banner evening for double reeds.  </P> <P> Vogel approached the long-winded lyricism of Vaughan Williams' concerto as an  extended soliloquy, which he infused with both ardor and eloquence. Falletta  thoughtfully shaped the composer's nervous invention -- the concerto is not one  of his meandering bucolic reveries -- coaxing a halo of warm string tone to  surround the soloist.  </P> <P> Although Falletta displayed evident authority and finesse, her baton was not a  magic wand. She could not make this group, with its limited rehearsal schedule,  into a supple Mozart orchestra overnight.  </P> <P> In Mozart's effervescent Symphony No. 29 in A Major, she had to settle for  robust enthusiasm cloaked in a strident tone from the violins in their more  extroverted moments. Although it takes a greater measure of discipline to give  Mozart's sunny opus an unforced brilliance, Falletta paced its many contrasts  with the symphony's overall shape clearly in mind. Her sense of Mozartean drama  and architecture could not be faulted.  </P> <P> In Alessandro Marcello's D Minor Oboe Concerto, Vogel's fleet technique gave  the rarely heard Baroque gem its due, even if the orchestra's ragged octaves  provided occasional distractions. The performance overall left but one  lingering question. How soon will Falletta return to a San Diego podium?  </P></p>

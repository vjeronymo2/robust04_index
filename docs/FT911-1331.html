			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Bellway blames cash-call flood for rights failure THE FLOOD of rights issues from property companies has been blamed by Bellway, the Tyneside-based housebuilder, for the disappointing response from shareholders to its own cash call. The shares were offered last month at 220p on a 5-for-11 basis. But there was only 52.3 per cent take-up. Charterhouse Bank placed the rest of the 11.6m shares with institutions at a slight premium. The company said it was disappointing that so many shareholders had decided not to take up their rights. Construction and property groups, including Higgs and Hill, Costain and Berkeley, have called for more than Pounds 700m in 11 rights issues. Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said: 'We have been tarred with the same brush of other property companies tapping the equity market to reduce their debt. Unlike many property companies we had no gearing and did not need to raise the cash.' Last month Bellway announced pre-tax profits for the six months to January 1991 of Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 6.11m). For the full year it is forecasting Pounds 8.75m.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONPARTISAN  </P> <P> Robert Shogan's "Bush's Dilemma in Dealing With a Contrary Hill" (Opinion,  April 16), states that President Bush has two options; confront Democratic  lawmakers for partisan reasons or compromise with them to reach political  objectives. The former could lead to a stalemate in Washington, while the  latter could potentially limit the power of the presidency.  </P> <P> What is truly frustrating is that neither of the options should be  considerations. It is necessary for the President to work with Congress in  order to reach national objectives. Also, Congress must compromise with the  President while not stepping into the shoes of the executive branch.  </P> <P> The American people are tired of partisan politics and are looking for a  nonpartisan government to look after the needs of the country, not simply  Republican or Democratic factions.  </P> <P> J.

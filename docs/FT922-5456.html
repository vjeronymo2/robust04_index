			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Brighton diary - A day at the Festival 9.30 am Festival Exhibition Centre. Joint exhibitions of Sussex-based or Sussex-connected figurative artists. Peter Strausfeld's posters for the defunct Academy Cinema in Oxford Street - one for 1979 re-release of Les Enfants du Paradis brings back much nostalgia. I make a point to look out for further work by 28 year-old Christopher Stevens. 10.15 am Polytechnic Gallery. 'Addressing the Forbidden', a small documentary exhibition about pornography and one of the most controversial item in this year's festival, with the possible exception of Mother Teresa of Calcutta (the Grand Farewell Tour) who gave of her/his all last night at 10.45 as part of the late-night comedy 'Laughing Gas' series. The porn items include one Mapplethorpe black cock. No Jeff Koons, though. The exhibition bombards you with statistics at the entrance, and accompanies each exhibit with polysyllabic ruminations by each artist. This so successfully prevents any sense of titillation that I wonder whether I have lost all erotic sense. But no. As we emerge, there's the Royal Pavilion (aka 'The Madness of George IV'), and all those marvellous domes gleaming in the sunlight look like so many breasts and nipples - like a surrealist vision of the sunbathers in Brighton Beach, in fact. 11 am Brighton Museum. 'Rendezvous a Dieppe3. It is easy to see why 'Dieppe in art' show has acclaimed; it's the best collection of treatments of one place in one period that I've seen since the Hayward's 'I Impressionists in London' 20 years ago. I have never seen so many Sickerts. 11.45 am In a small shop space on the New Road, Red Herring exhibits an absurdist/surrealist array of tactile objects. Down in the basement you can peer through a porthole to see an illuminated, decorated and packed loo. The best and most disconcerting item is in one corner - a real British Rail chair (with that repulsive multi-striped upholstery) beside a window and (behind it) a representation of a view. 12 noon. Brighton beach. 20 minutes swimming. 20 minutes sunbathing. 20 minutes for icecream, coke and hot dog. 1.15 pm Friends Centre. Piano recital by Graham Scott, whose facial expressions are much discussed. Scarlatti, Franck, Granados, Debussy and (encore) Mompou. Quite a range, eloquently and intensely played. There is no doubt that aesthetic response is improved by having recently swum and sunbathed, though not by sand between the toes. 2.30 pm Cumbre Flamenca. This group, then unknown, made its British debut in Brighton, two years before it took London by storm, where it has now returned for three equally successful seasons. There have been deteriorations. Juana Amaya, who used to be exciting in a coarse way, still has the best head-turns of all, but her Solea solo has now become just blousy. Her footwork is the dullest in the company, and she no longer offers the surprising big one-legged steps that used to be her forte. For three years now, the singer Alfonso 'El Veneno' no longer produces the prodigies of long phrasing and coloratura that were once so thrilling. Even the brilliant veteran Cristobal Reyes has grown rather obviously flamboyant in his Cantinas virtuosity. But the newcomer, Juan Fernandez, is a marked improvement in the Farruca to his predecessor (Antonio Canales); he conceives his solo in terms of its musical architecture. And in the Alegrias, Mariquilla confirms the welcome impression she made on joining the company in its last London season - exuberant, stout, joyous and infectious. 5 pm Quick bookshop-combing, then dinner. 7.30 pm Theatre Royal. Music Theatre London/Vienna, straight from their success in Vienna (see Jackie Wullschlager's review in last Friday's paper), in Cinderella, celebrating the Rossini bicentenary. This will reach London later in the summer - another example of Brighton being the early bird. Rossini's touching comedy of good versus bad manners adapts naturally to this updating and free translation. The social-climbing oiks and sneering green-welly brigade in this far-from-classless society are easy targets for Nick Broadhurst's staging. The result - by no means avant-garde - is a properly Rossinian mix of uproarious fun and piercingly true lyric emotion. I usually cry in this opera, but have never been so struck by the unnatural cruelty of Cinders's family. I had somehow expected a more hacked-about version of Rossini's score, but the only real changes are that the secco recitatives are replaced by speech, and that (pantomime fashion) the prince is a soprano (highest voice in the cast) and the two sisters are tenors: one of whom, Clorinda, reinstates her oft-cut aria (she would, wouldn't she). Not all the cast can sing well; Alidoro's aria is a trial. The vocal honours go to Jan Hartley Morris as Cinderella (she was also excellent as Magnolia in Show Boat at the Palladium last year); she is also very touching. Comic honors go to William Relton and Simon Butteriss as the two sisters. They are already the funniest pair since Ashton and Helpmann - and wholly different, brassy and deeply selfish - and, with a tad less outrageousness and more subtlety, become the wittiest. 10.30 pm Old Ship Hotel. Holsten Impro. This quintet keeps up the art of comic improvisation for over two hours (including interval) to a packed house. Half the show is enactments of 'Meanwhille. . .' scenes suggested by the audience. Meanwhile on holiday with Fergie; meanwhile down in the gutter; meanwhile in the sex shop; meanwhile under the microscope. As in Consequences, the more innocent the direction, the more ludicrously suggestive the scene becomes.</p>

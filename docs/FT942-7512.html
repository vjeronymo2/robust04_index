			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Scarce capital chases the swings of the cycle The switch from last year's apparent global abundance of capital to this year's developing scarcity has been sharp, but not at all unusual in terms of past cycles. This week global long-term interest rates have edged up again after a short respite. As for short-term markets, there has already been a flip up in dollar rates and most economists in the UK now appear to believe that sterling rates have bottomed. Worse for sentiment, the comfortable assumption that continental European short-term rates would continue the trend downwards for a considerable period was called into question by remarks made by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, on Monday. Only in Japan do interest rates seem thoroughly subdued - but, even there, the laws of arithmetic state that there is little downside from 2 per cent. The background to all this is economic acceleration. Last year's capital market frolics were conducted in the context of OECD growth of only about 1.2 per cent, and zero outside the US. But this year the OECD growth rate should be fairly close to the long-term average of about 2.4 per cent. Meanwhile the dynamic Asian economies are surging ahead at around 8 per cent; by 1995 the global growth rate may be 4 per cent. From the global investor's point of view the challenge is that the worldwide cycle is a composite of many different national cycles. Although out of phase, they are linked by international capital flows to a degree not seen in recent history. Thus German long-term interest rates have gone up this year even though this move would not yet be justified by the domestic cycle. Financial theory says that in a recession, idle capital drains out of the productive economy and tends to push up the value of financial assets. With recovery, money is sucked back into working capital and eventually into rising fixed investment. Bond yields rise and prices therefore fall, though equity prices are subsequently sustained in a rising trend for a number of months because of the positive pull of rising profits and dividends. Later in the cycle there is a buoyant demand for real assets, including property and commodities. Finally, late cycle inflationary pressures lead to bull markets in inflation hedges and collectables, ranging from gold to old masters. This chronology has been clearly displayed in the dollar markets, with long bonds peaking out last October and the stock market in early February. Now the bull market has shifted to commodities with the CRB Futures Index, for instance, up 12 per cent over the past year. As is characteristic of a cyclical bull market, the rise in prices of many commodities - such as apparently abundant base metals, for instance - is often difficult to justify on fundamentals, but it reflects a combination of inventory building by industry and trend-chasing by speculators. Only some time later may the excitement spread to gold, which is up a bare 3 per cent over the past 12 months. Meanwhile bonds are suffering. Real interest rates on bonds are now becoming very high, because of shifts in the delicate balance of global financial flows. In pressurising the Japanese to stimulate their economy, the Americans are also threatening the major source of global savings. Big public sector deficits are too prevalent. Whether the pressures within the global financial markets produce a serious crunch will depend on whether the borrowing governments can tighten their budgets and neatly withdraw from the capital markets as recovery gathers pace. The immediate message is that the climate has fundamentally changed. We may not be in a fully fledged bear market, but the balance has shifted and securities markets are no longer being buoyed by liquidity surpluses. Instead they are liable to be hit by obscure selling pressures as various market participants (such as the hedge funds last winter) are forced to liquidate or redirect resources. Issues are trickier to launchand flows into mutual funds are moderating. Short-term opportunities may be cyclically scarce, but on the other hand long-term investors are once again finding value - in high real yields, for instance - that will satisfy their realistic funding objectives.</p>

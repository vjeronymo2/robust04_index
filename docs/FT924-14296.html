			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: United score on the rebound - The Bottom Line ONE OF the stranger sights for a fly on the wall at this week's results presentations must have been that of City analysts and fund managers quizzing Manchester United about its plans for spending on football players. Apparently they have noticed some thin goal-scoring patches and are asking about 'a major signing'. With other clubs paying as much as Pounds 3.6m for a striker, forecasts for Manchester United's pre-tax profits this year probably have a net Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m pencilled in for dealings in players. There was a time when transfer fees knocked United into substantial pre-tax losses. But that was before the business was tuned for stock market flotation in June last year. This week's announcement of a Pounds 5.1m pre-tax profit in the year to July 31 contained several contrasts with those pre-flotation days. Turnover, at Pounds 20.1m, had risen by 74 per cent in two years; operating profit was 2 1/2 times higher at Pounds 6.3m; interest received of Pounds 1.4m replaced a Pounds 90,000 bill as the cash pile grew to Pounds 14.8m. But until recently United's share price performance has been a big disappointment. The flotation price of 385p, which the public baulked at, was rapidly undermined as sub-underwriters and the financially strapped Kevin Maxwell sold stock. This summer's sale of a 4 per cent stake, seized by a bank from Nigel Burroughs, a former club director, added a late twist to the shake-out. After bottoming out at 261p in July, the shares have recovered to 293p - with 11p added after this week's results. If you look at the company's performance against the hotels and leisure sector, the turn in sentiment dates back to May - the month when the Premier League signed a Pounds 304m deal with BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster. The conclusion is that the City is beginning to take Manchester United seriously. If this is sustained, it will mark a breakthrough for football clubs on the stock market. Manchester United has joined an anything but elite band of quoted football clubs. The other two are Tottenham Hotspur, which had its shares suspended for 14 months until its future was secured by Alan Sugar, the consumer electronics millionaire, and Terry Venables, the team's former coach; and Millwall Holdings, whose USM-quoted share price is languishing at 3 1/4 p. However, just as the shenanigans at Spurs cast a shadow over United's flotation, the north London club's return to financial soundness has helped to improve sentiment towards football. And while Millwall's case looks dire - it lost money again last year - it is more than 80 per cent of the way towards securing Pounds 15m to build a new stadium. Like Tottenham, which diversified disastrously into clothing, it has returned to its core by selling Tavern Leisure. This confirms the trend towards football clubs making a commercial virtue of their sport. According to the ICC business ratio report on football - used by United to point up its market leadership - an elite group enjoyed a healthy trading profit margin of more than 10 per cent in 1990-91. Another reassuring move by United was to publish an independent Pounds 24m valuation of its players, carried out by accountants Touche Ross. Although this will not go on the balance sheet, Robin Launders, finance director, pointed out that it was worth nearly 200p a share, on top of the 344p of conventional net asset backing. For football fans wishing to invest in their hobby, Manchester United at 293p offers an 8.2 per cent dividend yield, with growth prospects underpinned by a forecast increase in earnings of about 10 per cent. At 85p, Tottenham is trading on a much lower historic price-earnings ratio of 4.2, compared with United's 10.6, but has yet to resume dividend payments. Millwall's shares obviously represent a much higher risk. However, as with a handful of clubs that have bond schemes, discounts on seats can be obtained by paying Pounds 250 for a Lions Card. In most cases, fans can now get a return on a financial investment in their club, either through a dividend or through discounts - in addition, of course, to the emotional bonds.</p>

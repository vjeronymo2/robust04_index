			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, January 11 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat  forces have repulsed a Moslem offensive on the area of Vitez in  central Bosnia-Herzegovina and forced the Moslem troops to  withdraw from the Busovaca-Vitez road, where the two sides on  Monday engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, the Defence Ministry of  the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina said on Tuesday.    Bosnian Croat units (HVO) [Croatian Defense Council] stopped  the Moslem advance on the Novi Travnik-Nova Bila road south of  Vitez, the ministry said.    Over the past two days, eight people were killed and 35  civilians wounded in the region of Vitez. Another 35 people are  missing and the Croat authorities believe that 14 Croat women  have been taken prisoners.    Fighting continued unabated despite talks on Sunday and  Monday between President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of  Croatia Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic in Bonn and efforts of Western leaders to reconcile  the former allies in the war against the Serbs.    Over the past few days, Moslem forces were persistently  opening fire from all weapons on Vitez, Novi Travnik, Novi  Seher, Zepce and Zavidovici in central Bosnia, the strategically  important region because most of former Yugoslavia's military  industry is situated there.    Moslem-controlled Sarajevo Radio, however, claimed on  Tuesday  that HVO troops were shelling the old part of Vitez and using  poisonous gases in attacks on Dubravica.    The situation in the area of Gornji Vakuf is more or less  the  same and the usual 500 shells again on Monday fell on the town  and the nearby Moslem villages, said Sarajevo Radio.    Bosnian Serb Army sources said Moslem forces had continued  persistent attacks on all Serb positions in the area of Doboj in  northern Bosnia, where the re-grouping of Moslem troops for a  possible attack on Brcko was also observed.    During the night, Moslem units in the region of the River  Brka some eight kilometres south-west of Brcko received  reinforcement from Tuzla and Zvornik, the sources said.    The arrival of fresh Moslem troops was accompanied by the  re-grouping of those already on the spot as well as by intensive  reconnaissance of Serb positions south of Brcko with the aim of  preparing a new offensive and cutting off the Bosnian Serb  Republic into two parts.</p>

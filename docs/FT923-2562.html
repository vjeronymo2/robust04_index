			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Prospects bleak for Britain EVEN before yesterday's events in Britain, the UK economic outlook was bleak, according to the International Monetary Fund. Alone of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Britain faced a year of declining output in 1992. The World Economic Outlook forecasts a 0.8 per cent drop in real gross domestic product for 1992 - in line with the latest London consensus forecast - after a 2.2 per cent decline in GDP last year. For 1993, the IMF has forecast 2.1 per cent growth for Britain. This is well below the 2.9 per cent increase forecast for the industrialised countries as a whole. It also takes no account of the effects of the latest sterling crisis on business and consumer confidence. Writing before the big interest rate increases yesterday, the IMF warned that the UK had 'not yet emerged from recession' and that its short-term interest rates were 'relatively high in real terms'. The fund expects UK employment will drop this year by 1.8 per cent, after a 3.1 per cent decline in 1991. Britain's unemployment rate is expected to rise to 10.1 per cent next year from 10 per cent in 1992 and 9.3 per cent last year. About the only encouraging news is the forecast that consumer price inflation will drop to 3 per cent this year from 3.8 per cent in 1992. But the IMF warned that earnings increases in Britain continue to outpace productivity gains.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: China still Taiwan's Gatt hurdle - Taipei's attempt to join the world trade body TAIWAN's progress towards joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) was given a fillip last weekend with the confirmation in Taipei by Mr Martin Bangemann, European industry and internal market commissioner, that the Community supports the island's application. That Taiwan will eventually join Gatt is not in question. It is the world's 14th-largest trading nation, with a trading volume that reached Dollars 130bn in 1991. While the rest of the world wallows in recession, Taiwan's economy is growing at about 7 per cent. So far Taiwan's entry into Gatt has been delayed by political rivalry with Beijing. Both governments, mortal enemies since the communists drove the Kuomintang (nationalists) from the mainland in 1949, claim to be the legitimate rulers of all of China. Although both have agreed that Taiwan is to apply as the Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, Beijing insists that it be admitted first. Political differences might not prove the only obstacle. A range of tariff barriers and outright bans on foreign goods and services remains to trouble Taiwan's main trading partners. Agricultural products are subject to an average import duty of 21.6 per cent, compared with an average of just under 9 per cent of duty on all imported products, and one big sticking point has been a ban on imports of uncured EC meat, ostensibly for fear of foot and mouth disease. Other restrictions include a ban on UHT (long-life) milk from the EC and a 40 per cent duty on British confectionery. Preferential tax-rates on US beef, spirits and cigars have led to complaints of discrimination from Australia and EC countries. Further liberalisation of Taiwan's insurance laws is already under way, but has not as yet been extended to foreign insurance companies. Foreign banks are still limited in the number of their branches, and range of products they can offer. Foreigners are not permitted to be majority shareholders in a Taiwan-registered company, and so far have only managed to make mutual investments or joint ventures in certain key, high-tech industries. But while financial services and investment show a general trend towards liberalisation, a much more closed shop attitude prevails when it comes to tendering for contracts in Taiwan's Dollars 300bn infrastructural development plan, where a lack of personal contacts and knowledge of bureaucratic shortcuts leave all but the most aggressive foreign bidders out in the cold. But these restrictions are insignificant compared with the progress which must be made across the Taiwan Strait before China can accede to Gatt. Waiting for China could still prove the greatest obstacle for Taiwan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol, 28 May -- "For the first time the  negotiating process is proceeding constructively, Vice Admiral  Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, Ukraine's Navy Commander, reported at a  news conference on the results of the latest Russian-Ukrainian  Black Sea Fleet talks, which he conducted on 27 May. The  Russian side has taken up a softer position. The fact that for  the first time we are discussing details in depth and are  working on each facility in detail adds optimism. The Russian  delegation was discussing issues that it had avoided at the  talks in Sevastopol. One feels that Russia's delegation has a  purpose: To resolve the issue," Mr. Bezkorovaynyy emphasized.</p>

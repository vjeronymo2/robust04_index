			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto has extended the  service of General Feisal Tanjung, the current chief of the  Armed Forces (ABRI), past the military's mandatory retirement  age of 55, it was officially announced yesterday. Feisal's  birthday falls next month.    Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said the decision is  contained in a decree signed by the President on May 23.    The announcement put to rest one of the major political  questions of the year, and one that had been frequently asked  since the time Feisal was appointed to the number one post in  ABRI in May of last year.    There had been speculation that Suharto, who as the  commander  in chief has the last word on military appointments, was going  to replace Feisal with General Wismoyo Arismunandar, currently  Army Chief of Staff and two years his junior. This line of  reasoning went that Feisal was simply keeping the seat warm for  Wismoyo.    With the extension of his active service, Feisal is now  widely expected to retain his post, according to political  observers.    In the past, Suharto extended the service of L.B. Murdani  and  Try Sutrisno, two former ABRI chiefs, to allow both to retain  the post. Feisal's immediate predecessor, Edi Sudrajat, only  held the post for three months before he turned 55, after which  he was whisked away to become Minister of Defense and Security.    By law the President can extend the service of any colonel  or  general by one year at a time.    Murdiono said that Feisal was given extended service, which  will take effect on July 1, because the President felt that his  services are still needed.    Feisal, who was born on June 17, 1939, in Tarutung North  Sumatera, graduated from the National Military Academy in 1962.    He rose to prominence when he was assigned by Suharto to  head  a military investigation into the bloody incident in East Timor  in 1991. The investigation subsequently led to the removal of  two top army generals.    Feisal carved his military career in Kopassus [Special  Forces  Command], the army's elite red beret force. His stints included  quashing various separatist insurrections in Maluku and  Kalimantan.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Swedish insurer writes down US holding Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, was forced yesterday to confront the full extent of its disastrous foray into the US market, announcing that it planned to write down the value of its investment in Home Holdings by at least SKr2.8bn (Pounds 238m). It did not rule out a write-down of its entire SKr3.5bn exposure to Home, its troubled US insurance affiliate which has turned into the company's second big investment fiasco in two years. The write-down will be made alongside plans to strengthen Home's balance sheet which has been badly weakened by the need to cover its exposure to environmental and professional liability claims dating back many years. Home wants to raise at least Dollars 250m (Pounds 152m) in new equity or debt. Analysts said Trygg's write-down suggested Home was planning a highly dilutive share issue to new investors, which could reduce Trygg's capital stake in the US group from 64.5 per cent to below 20 per cent. They said it signalled a clear desire by Trygg to extract itself fully from its involvement in the loss-making US group. Mr Bob Yates, insurance analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton in London, said the write-down showed the new investors were forcing 'very generous terms'. Trygg's investment in Home, first made in 1991, cost it SKr1.4bn in losses in the first nine months. It now faces full-year Home-related losses of more than SKr4bn. In 1992 Trygg also suffered SKr5.5bn in losses from its investment in Sweden's Gota AB, the holding company for Gota Bank. Trygg's shares, suspended on Friday following press speculation about Home's recapitalisation, fell SKr2 to SKr76 when trading resumed yesterday. Home has been downgraded by three US rating agencies since it announced a nine-month deficit of Dollars 131m last month. It hopes to get a higher rating after it has been recapitalised, facilitating efforts to win new business. Home, more than twice Trygg's size, had 1993 gross premiums of Dollars 2.42bn. Its difficulties this year have been compounded by high leverage, rising US interest rates, intensifying competitive pressures and earthquake and cold weather losses.</p>

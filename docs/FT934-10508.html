			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Polls put Bolger ahead MR Jim Bolger, the New Zealand prime minister, yesterday wound up the National party's campaign in the New Zealand election, in the knowledge that the latest opinion polls show his party holding a clear lead over the main opposition Labour party among 'decided' voters. A TV3-Gallup poll, released last night, showed National with 42 per cent of the vote, among that segment of the electorate which had made up its mind. Labour trailed at 34 per cent. The two main alternative parties, the Alliance and New Zealand First, registered 13 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. However, most recent polls suggest that the 'undecided' element, although falling, is still in double digits, and Mr Bolger warned supporters that he was 'taking nothing for granted'. The Labour Party also claimed that its own polling indicated waning support for the Alliance - a coalition of five left-leaning, Green and Maori parties  -in key Auckland constituencies.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Observer: Showing off the roller When the Princess of Wales acquired her German-built Mercedes sports car there was such a fuss that she was forced to hand it back and trade down to a Ford. But Japan's new royal couple does not suffer the same insecurities and the word is that they will be flaunting the palace Roller for this week's wedding. Although there could always be a last-minute hitch, the newlyweds plan to ride through Tokyo in a Pounds 160,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche 1V. Given that Japanese carmakers are trying to break in to the luxury end of the market and Rolls-Royce sales in Japan took a dive last year, it would seem a heaven-sent public relations opportunity for the UK car maker. When Miss Masako Owada, Japan's princess-to-be, was shown riding in a Toyota Corolla to work in January, sales of the Japanese model soared. But even in its current straitened circumstances, Rolls-Royce shows no inclination to publicise its coup. 'It's a strictly private affair,' purred the lady at RR's Crewe headquarters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by Robert Kotian and Maria Hluchanova; place  and date not given: "It Seems, for the Moment, That the Present  Coalition Will Continue"]    [Text] [SME] How satisfied are you with the functioning of  the coalition government now that the first half of its term is  over?    [Weiss] The coalition government is a certain experiment in  Slovakia. Our most recent political tradition did not know this  form of government before. From this viewpoint, it is good that  we have made this experience, and not only for reasons of the  development of political culture. It also means an enrichment  for political entities, which are forced to build on what they  have in common and not on what divides them. It requires the  ability to talk and harmonize views. We have been successful in  that so far, even if things were not ideal. When looking back  at the 100 days of this government's work, I admit that, when we  started, my worries were greater.    [SME] Before this coalition was formed, you operated as an  opposition party. By taking control of some important economic  government posts, you have been forced to "show" your cards,  especially in the economic sphere. Do you think this was a  benefit or a loss for the SDL [Party of the Democratic Left]?  Views have appeared to the effect that, in some areas, you are  pushing for overly "socialist" methods....    [Weiss] We decided to join the coalition after considering  all domestic and foreign political factors. Being in power  after spending four years in opposition also brings with it,  apart from the possibility of influencing the course of the  economy, for example, by one's own policy, certain negative  aspects. In particular, we were taking over the heritage of the  economic policy of three governments that we had criticized. It  is possible that shortcomings with their roots in the previous  period will be ascribed to this government. This showing of  cards that you mentioned was, in my opinion, not only of  domestic political significance, but also of foreign political  significance. For example, following the appearances by Deputy  Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova, no one can have any doubts  about the SDL's attitude toward economic transformation. Quite  the contrary, it is clear that we have our own ideas about  transformation. Of course, there are differences of views with  the other [coalition] parties regarding the timing of certain  steps and their scope. For these reasons, being in opposition  was easier.    [SME] You spoke about "accelerating transformation," which  is not a typical SDL term.    [Weiss] I would like to know where you got this. If you  carefully studied our documents at least once, you would never  have been able to make such a statement.    [SME] I know your preelection program, about which we agreed  with [SDL Deputy Chairman] Mr. Fogas that it is not a typical  left-wing program....    [Weiss] I cannot agree with you. Economic realism cannot be  passed off as a right-wing attitude. Our program was realistic.  For example, all of our warnings regarding small-scale  privatization have come true. Employees [of privatized  businesses] have lost motivation, Dutch auctions [during which  the price is bid down, if no buyer can be found for the calling  price] have brought with them negative concomitant phenomena,  privatization has been criminalized, the credit portfolios of  many banks are burdened with credits that they were often forced  to extend for political reasons, and so forth. What is  right-wing about this SDL attitude toward small-scale  privatization? It has simply been proved that we had more  political realism than the then government. Economy is  something objective. We want the inevitable changes to be  carried out in the socially most acceptable manner.    [SME] Let us return to the coalition. What unites you, and  what divides you?    [Weiss] There were several key factors. First of all, it  was necessary to put an end to the protracted political crisis.  We had a minority government for a long time. It was in a  minority position through the fault of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS]  because the parliamentary groups of these parties had broken up,  and the ruling HZDS was unable to find permanent allies. The  second factor that united us was interest in the stability of  the constitutional system. Clear tendencies were making  themselves felt toward a self-serving change of the  constitutional system--away from the parliamentary system toward  a presidential regime. This was to be achieved through the  renewal of the balance of forces after the elections, by means  of a referendum that was being prepared. The third thing that  united us was the essential need to react to the frequently  chaotic and improvised economic policy and to the fact that, in  some areas, the transformation processes slowed down or ground  to a halt. Fourth, it was necessary to change Slovakia's image  abroad because we were drifting, literally, into political  isolation. Of course, it was also inevitable to establish  conditions for a solution to the minority issues and, thereby,  meet the obligations assumed by the previous government on being  admitted into the Council of Europe. Fifth, it was the  perception of politics as politics of cooperation. We rejected  a continuation of the policy of creating the image of an enemy,  the policy of a permanent search for traitors and Judases, which  is a residue of the deeply ingrained neo-Stalinist political  culture or, rather, lack of culture.    What divides us? The very fact that this is a  left-center-right coalition with different ideas on economic and  social policy. There exist two instruments for overcoming these  differences. The first is the government policy statement,  which is a measure of compromise on programmatic issues that is  acceptable to everyone. The second instrument is the Coalition  Council, whose decisions are conditional on everyone's agreement.    [SME] In this context, we could mention the so-called  screening law, [the amendment of] which probably will not pass,  precisely because of this mechanism in the Coalition Council.  Do you consider it normal that members of the government cannot  defend themselves against accusations of cooperation with the  [communist-era secret police] StB only because there is no one  to issue screening certificates?    [Weiss] The screening law must be abolished because  screenings have, from the very beginning, served as an  instrument of dirty political struggle.    [SME] Yet the law exists. It is valid but, in reality, it  is not being enforced. One possibility is to abolish it, the  other to amend it.... The coalition has so far been unable to  sort out this problem.    [Weiss] We were aware of our coalition partners' different  views and were therefore ready to accept a solution that would  not force any political partner to breach his election program.  We proposed an amendment to the screening law, under which only  those sections would remain in force regarding StB collaborators  who were involved in the struggle against the so-called internal  enemy. It is therein that I see the biggest moral burden  requiring a solution. In other words, we proposed that people be  exempted from this law who had to protect state secrets, for  example, and the like. The coalition partners from the center  grouping subscribed to a similar view. The idea of the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] is that the screening law  must be preserved. Each entity is simply bound to its voters,  and, because no solution has been found, we will have to wait  for one until after the elections.    [SME] However, the failure to resolve the situation could be  regarded by voters as the coalition's defeat....    [Weiss] Why should we characterize it as defeat? I was  convinced that we would find a way of amending the law that  would be generally acceptable. The KDH refused to accept an  amendment, and, therefore, it is not within the powers of the  coalition to resolve the issue of screenings.    [SME] What, in your opinion, is the most realistic model of  a political grouping that will form the government after the  elections?    [Weiss] That will be determined by the specific election  results. It is generally true, however, that, when a  continuation of the present coalition will be considered, there  will be more time to prepare the government's programmatic aims  and to deal with problems we have deliberately put aside during  this term of office because of lack of time.    [SME] Apart from the model of the present coalition, is  there any other scenario of government that the SDL would accept?    [Weiss] The government must be founded on a majority that  will be capable of action and will enable laws to pass in  parliament.    [SME] Is there a model that is absolutely unacceptable to  the SDL?    [Weiss] In which sense absolutely unacceptable? There are  at least four or five postelection scenarios....    [SME] Is some political entity unacceptable to you as a  coalition partner?    [Weiss] A coalition alliance with nationalists and  extremists of any kind is unacceptable to us. We realize, of  course, that a certain programmatic proximity and respect are  necessary for a coalition to be formed. Therefore, we can  scarcely imagine coalition cooperation with those who want to  break up their future coalition partner and straighten its  leadership, with those who have a completely different  understanding of politics and of the stability of the  constitutional system.    [SME] Do you think those ideas correspond with the ideas of  SDL members?    [Weiss] Seventy percent of our members have endorsed the  decision of the SDL club of deputies to join the coalition. Our  problem is not the attitude toward the policy of the previously  ruling HZDS. Rather, it is the attitude toward the KDH that  constitutes a problem, owing, on the one hand, to programmatic  differences and, on the other, to the statements made by KDH  representatives about the SDL, which are still vivid in our  sympathizers' memories. Of course, a problem also rests in the  support that this government gets from Coexistence and, more  specifically, Mr. Duray, in view of some of his statements.    [SME] If we understood you correctly, you can scarcely  imagine a coalition with the HZDS, judging from what you said.  Whom are we supposed to understand by the terms "nationalists"  and "extremists"?    [Weiss] As for nationalism, it is quite evident that this  path has been embarked upon by the SNS and by a part of the  Coexistence movement, which is actually the SNS's partner in  this game. Extremists organized in political groupings, such as  exist in Germany, for example, are fortunately nonexistent in  Slovakia for the time being. I can say, however, that we cannot  imagine cooperation with the Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS]  because it is engaged in a policy that we have abandoned, and we  do not want to return to the past. What is interesting in this  context is the unanimity of views on some issues between the KSS  and the HZDS, as presented, for example, in the daily REPUBLIKA.    Regarding the HZDS, I would like to say that it was, is, and  will be differentiated. I do not lump all of the people from  the HZDS together. There are groups in it that I know would  never think of giving the Nazi salute in parliament [allusion to  a recent incident in parliament, during which HZDS deputy Ivan  Luptak greeted Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament,  who has black hair and wears a moustache, with "Heil Hitler"].  We would be able to imagine cooperation with those people.  They regret themselves that the HZDS leadership did not  sincerely try to cooperate [with other parliamentary parties].  Right now, I do not have the feeling, however, that the  currents represented by these people have prevailed in the HZDS,  also on the basis of the general style of HZDS policy and its  ability to cooperate with others as true partners.    It seems, for the moment, that the present coalition will  continue, provided all of the constituent entities get into  parliament. Everything will be determined by the voters. Our  coalition quatrefoil [reference to the "Left Choice," the  SDL-led coalition of four left-wing parties and movements]  naturally seeks to win the largest possible number of votes.</p>

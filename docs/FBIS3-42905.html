			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Smolenskiy, president of the </F> Stolichnyy Commercial Bank, Moscow, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent  Marina Talskaya, under the "Interview of Current Interest"  rubric; place and date not given: "It Is Time To Switch From  Politics to Business"]    [Text] Despite all efforts to obtain information on  interaction with commercial banks in the past year, 1993, from  the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, we have not  succeeded in doing this. Meanwhile, at present this is one of  the most significant problems for commercial banks. We had to  use the services of authors who are directly or indirectly  wrapped up in the issue, and whose opinions we present today.    It is a pity that the press service of the Central Bank  of the Russian Federation does quite a poor job in assisting  trade publications with the organization of interviews and other  materials devoted to the operation of the banks. One gets the  impression that the service was not organized to establish close  relations with the press but, on the contrary, to isolate the  press from interesting interlocutors from the Central Bank of  the Russian Federation. At times, it takes weeks or months to  arrange a particular meeting. As a result, an issue of current  interest takes care of itself: In our fast-paced times, topics  become obsolete by the hour rather than by the day.    On this score, the commercial banks of Moscow and other  Russian cities differ favorably from the Central Bank.    One is only left hoping that the situation here will  change for the better. After all, it is in our common interest.    Aleksandr Smolenskiy, president of the Stolichnyy  Commercial Bank, is known as a consistent critic of Central Bank  operations. It is up to the readers to judge how well his  criticism is substantiated.    [Talskaya] The year has ended. What did it amount to for the  banking system of Russia? How did the commercial banks develop?  How did the policy of the Central Bank influence their  operations?    [Smolenskiy] The Central Bank of Russia has not been  emancipated from political activities, at any rate not before 31  December. It is carried away by such activities, as I see  it--excessively. Besides, the Central Bank is overly  emotional--there are leaps and bounds. So far, a Central  Bank--such as the national bank of a mighty state, such as  Russia, should be--has not been created yet.    On one occasion, I was driving along Pyatnitskaya Street.  There was a building without a sign, and a waiting line. I was  curious what people could be lining up for now. It turned out  that a financial company was accepting deposits from the  population. Fantastic! Deposits of the population involve pure  banking activities. The delineation should be strictly upheld.  After all, it does not occur to me to bake pies or sew boots. It  is the function of precisely the Central Bank to put an end to  the attempts of impostors to engage in banking activities.    In general, the entire Western banking ideology is built on  the protection of individual depositors. In our country, the  overall mentality of the state is such that private individuals  so far mean nothing to it.    The saddest part is that the Central Bank has still failed  to  lay a precise normative foundation regulating the operations of  commercial banks.    [Talskaya] Many bankers complain about this. Nonetheless,  everyone appears to be alive....    [Smolenskiy] I would not be that categorical. According to  my  estimates, more than 50 banks are bankrupt and unable to honor  their obligations (in the absence of proper auditing and review,  we have to proceed solely from our knowledge of our "inner  workings"). As a rule, they have unauthentic balances, which  nobody is in a position to verify.    [Talskaya] Effective in the New Year, commercial banks will  switch to a Western accounts chart. May this partially resolve  the issue of the authenticity of balance sheets?    [Smolenskiy] This will not reverse the situation. That  superfluous statistics will be removed from the balance sheets  is the only improvement associated with the present innovation;  however, balance sheets will still remain a dark jungle.    It appears to me that the Central Bank should work on this  issue very seriously. All bankers are interested in putting  reports in order because at present we operate on the interbank  market blindly. Our partners may provide us with a heap of  documents; however, I will not be completely certain whether  this bank exists in reality or only on paper. Meanwhile, a chain  of bankruptcies will result from any mishap. If banks go under,  we may close down the entire national economy.    [Talskaya] At a press conference on the eve of the new year,  Viktor Gerashchenko mentioned resolving the issue of the  turnaround of payments as one of the definite accomplishments of  the Central Bank last year. Do you agree with his opinion?    [Smolenskiy] No. Funds travel for 72 hours within Moscow.  This is very long. The volume of the Moscow Cash Clearing Center  comes approximately to upwards of 1 trillion rubles [R]. For  three days, this money sinks to the bottom and exists on paper  and as bookkeeping entries.    I also disagree with the view of the Central Bank that  settlements should be effected by "his majesty's" office. I  believe that this should be done by some unit established  jointly with commercial banks.    [Talskaya] During the entire year, there was talk about  converting the Cash Clearing Center to joint-stock operations.    [Smolenskiy] Unfortunately, it was just talk. I believe that  settlement hubs should be converted to joint-stock operations,  with the Central Bank holding the controlling share.    [Talskaya] Throughout last year, the Central Bank kept  postponing auctions to sell centralized resources. Many bankers  believe that unequal access to these funds infringes on the  rights of commercial banks. Are you one of them?    [Smolenskiy] We have never used centralized resources and  apparently will not use them, because the Central Bank restricts  these funds in a number of ways, in particular, with regard to  interbank credit. I do not need an extra headache because of  R100 million-R150 million.    Besides, centralized credit is earmarked for economically  weak enterprises and organizations. As a rule, they are not in a  position to pay back credit, because they hand out one-half of  it as wages right away. So am I to sort this out with the  workers? Or to buy this factory myself?    Thank God, the auctions were not held. The plan was patently  without promise. It appears to me that an arrangement on which  the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank recently agreed is  more acceptable: Contracts will be signed on behalf of the state  directly with commercial banks, which will, in turn, service  state programs. The Central Bank should not and will not engage  in the distribution of centralized resources. It will extend  credit to the state, and let the latter sort things out itself.  This procedure will lighten the load of the Central Bank  considerably.    [Talskaya] Nonetheless, you are the first one from among my  interlocutor-bankers who has no regrets about the auctions.    [Smolenskiy] You see, the receipt of this kind of money  corrupts the personnel. They stop using their heads. Why? The  bosses will go to an auction and win everything. I think that  the banks that do not want to do the homework themselves yearn  for centralized resources.    [Talskaya] How did an increase in the discount rate to 210  percent influence banking activities?    [Smolenskiy] Ideally, it should have made credit resources  contract. However, everything remained as it used to be. The  people creaked, groaned, and calmed down.    A profit margin of no less than 1,000 percent should be  built  in from the beginning in order to start some kind of enterprise  at present. Ultimately, the interest on bank credit is paid by  the consumer; it is included in the price.    [Talskaya] An increase in the minimum size of statutory  capital to R100 million has caused much talk in the banking  community. Many of your colleagues believe that compliance by a  bank with standards for proprietary and attracted funds is the  main point in banking operations, rather than the volume of  statutory capital as such.    [Smolenskiy] I do not agree with them. What does R100  million  amount to at present? It is $90,000. Meanwhile, according to the  Basel international convention, the minimum statutory capital of  a bank should be equivalent to $5 million. This number was not  pulled out of a hat. Depositors must be sure that the bank is  reliable. I believe that the plank of the minimum statutory  capital of banks in Russia should be raised, and raised again. I  am in favor of free competition among banks. However, as I see  it, small, unreliable banks do nothing but discredit the banking  system. What was possible in 1988, during the emergence of  banks, is impermissible in 1993, to say nothing of 1994.    You have mentioned standards. With a statutory capital of  R100 million, a bank may have R2 billion in attracted funds.  Given current prices, this is a whole lot of nothing!    [Talskaya] Effective 1 January, foreign-exchange regulation  will take effect in Russia. How would you comment on this event?    [Smolenskiy] The national currency should be the only tender  in the territory of a country. In our country, the ruble is such  currency.    Certainly, the decision of the Central Bank which  discontinues the parallel circulation of currencies is correct.  However, I am afraid that in this instance we will not do  without excesses, either. I think that the citizens will not  believe the promise that, at any moment, it will be possible to  buy currency on the exchange, and that its exchange rate will  change smoothly, without leaps and flip-flops. There have  already been too many declarations that the state subsequently  repudiated without batting an eye.    [Talskaya] Let us assume that you have an opportunity to  influence the development of the banking system in the country.  Where would you begin?    [Smolenskiy] Communications are the foremost point both for  the national economy in general and banking operations in  particular. If there are no communications, we will be done in.  Information is now becoming more compact. The introduction of an  electronic communications system would fundamentally change the  ideology of interbank relations. Having automated the banking  business, we would have pulled along the rest of the national  economy. At present, close to R1.5 trillion "floats" somewhere  around Russia in postal money orders every day. If we had normal  communications, we could extend credit to someone in Vladivostok  while Moscow is asleep. Except for us, the entire world makes  money on time zone differences. I do not mean specifically our  bank. We have found an opportunity to take advantage of time  differences.    I am not saying that the Central Bank should solve this  problem alone. Commercial banks are prepared to help it.    In the greater scheme of things, I believe that Gerashchenko  lacks a team. For some reason, he is afraid of young people. The  chairman of the Central Bank himself is an international banker,  and all Russian "narrow" issues obviously annoy him. Apparently,  the problems we are struggling to solve have long been solved in  places where he has happened to work: One just plugs the  computer into an outlet and begins to press buttons. At present,  it is very important for us to have bankers on the team who  could get a handle on the domestic Russian situation.    Banking practitioners could work on it themselves, too.  Unfortunately, the helping hand that we are holding out is not  seen from the offices on Neglinnaya Street.</p>

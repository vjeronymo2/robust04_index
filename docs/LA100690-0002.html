Times or does The Times  choose to print only letters from such morons? People in L.A., wake up! Just  try openly flaunting your support of an opposing team in New York, Chicago,  Pittsburgh or any other NFL city (except maybe Anaheim) and security will  remove you quicker than a breakaway run by Bo Jackson.  </P> <P> JEFF FINK, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian fund to raise a further Dollars 150m The Indian Opportunities Fund, a Dollars 100m open-ended investment fund which was launched in the summer, plans to raise a further Dollars 150m of new money to place in Indian securities and investments. The decision to more than double the size of the fund reflects the keen interest among international investors in the Indian market, which is seen as one of the more promising emerging markets. The fund, which is managed by Martin Currie Investment Management (MCIM), was set up in July 1993 and has already invested about 90 per cent of the Dollars 100m originally raised in about 80 different holdings. Mr Joe Scott Plummer, chairman of MCIM, said the new money would be raised using special 'C' class shares: once 90 per cent of the new money has been invested, these shares will be converted to ordinary shares (which are the kind that investors currently hold). Mr Scott Plummer said this would ensure that existing shareholders did not suffer from an dilution effect.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TURNOUT HEAVY, VOTING IS CALM IN NICARAGUA;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: BOTH ORTEGA AND CHAMORRO EXPRESS CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOME.  INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS REPORT FEW VIOLATIONS AT THE POLLING PLACES.  </P> <P> Serious and patient, Nicaraguan voters turned out in large numbers Sunday to  choose between the decade-old Sandinista government and a U.S.-backed coalition  in the most contentious election in their country's history.  </P> <P> The voting, aimed at ending eight years of guerrilla war, was reported  relatively peaceful throughout Nicaragua. However, election officials said  eight of the 4,391 polling stations failed to open and that two others were  hastily transferred because of military activity by U.S.-backed Contras.  </P> <P> Both the Sandinistas and the 14-party National Opposition Union (UNO) reported  what they called insignificant numbers of election law violations and said they  felt buoyed by the big turnout.  </P> <P> "I think things have been going very smoothly," said former U.S. Atty. Gen.  Elliot L. Richardson shortly after the polls closed at 6 p.m. "So far, the  elections look fair." Richardson heads the U.N. observer mission and is one of  more than 2,000 accredited vote monitors.  </P> <P> President Daniel Ortega said after casting his ballot in Managua that he was  certain of winning another six-year term and would invite President Bush to his  inauguration. A notice posted at Sandinista campaign headquarters urged  supporters to gather for a midnight victory rally.  </P> <P> "I expect that the government of the United States will recognize the results  of the elections and work for peace with Nicaragua," Ortega said.  </P> <P> Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the newspaper publisher who is the strongest of  Ortega's nine challengers, expressed her "faith in God and my people that  Nicaraguans will vote for a change."  </P> <P> Voters leaving the polls echoed both predictions with a certainty and emotion  that reflected the highly charged expectations of a bitterly contested -- but  surprisingly peaceful -- six-month campaign.  </P> <P> "God has pity on the Nicaraguan people, and He is going to change things," said  Mercedes Maldonado, 85, of Managua, who voted for the first time in her life.  Bursting into tears, she told of how five of her children had left Nicaragua  and how her sixth is ailing and cannot afford medicine. "My heart told me to  vote for UNO," she added. "We have to free ourselves from this hunger."  </P> <P> Across the capital at a polling station near army headquarters, where scores of  uniformed Sandinista soldiers lined up to cast ballots, Lt. Victor Brenis said  he was voting for Ortega "to show imperialism that we have a democracy here."  </P> <P> Ortega, 44, was first elected in 1984, five years after his Sandinista National  Liberation Front seized power from President Anastasio Somoza to end 43 years  of U.S.-backed dictatorship. Chamorro, 60, served nine months on the first  Sandinista junta, then quit to turn her newspaper, La Prensa, into the  country's leading opposition voice.  </P> <P> For the Sandinistas, the election was an effort to prove the legitimacy of  their revolution, end a decade of U.S. hostility and rebuild the country. UNO,  an electoral alliance embracing both Communists and conservatives, saw the vote  as a timely opportunity to repudiate what it calls a dictatorial system that  has brought this fertile country of 3.5 million people to ruin.  </P> <P> Voters were choosing a president, a vice president, 90 members of a  single-chamber National Assembly and, for the first time, 131 municipal  councils. Two regional councils to govern the eastern part of the country,  populated largely by English-speaking blacks and Miskito Indians, were also  being elected.  </P> <P> About 1.75 million voters, age 16 and older, signed up for the election during  a four-week registration period last October.  </P> <P> Richardson estimated the turnout at near 90%.  </P> <P> Many voters stood in line all night, waiting for polls to open at 7 a.m., only  to find the voting process sluggish.  </P> <P> The Loyola Institute, the largest polling place in Managua, opened 1 hour and  45 minutes late because just two election officials were on hand to start  counting the 6,669 paper ballots.  </P> <P> At the suggestion of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited the school  as an election observer, more officials were brought in. When the iron gate  finally opened, two voters were injured in the stampede.  </P> <P> "The people outside were legitimately concerned (about the delay)," Carter  said. "But it will be done correctly even if it takes a long time."  </P> <P> Voters cast separate ballots in three-sided cardboard booths bearing the  promise "Your Vote Is Secret" in black letters. To prevent multiple voting,  voters' right thumbs were dipped in ink.  </P> <P> "It's very solemn, like a Mass," Carter said after watching election officials  lay out ballots, registration books and ink on a table in one polling station.  </P> <P> UNO's main complaint was that the ink, supposedly indelible, was easily washed  off by many voters. But Richardson said, "I don't think it's a fatal flaw,  because there are too many other checks in the system. It's not probable that  the vote was affected in any significant way."  </P> <P> In a preliminary evaluation, the opposition denounced irregularities at seven  polling stations. It said Sandinista officials padded registration lists,  allowed Sandinista soldiers to go ahead of other voters in line, obliged voters  to show their ballots and annulled those marked for opposition candidates.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders also charged that some of the polling stations affected by  reported Contra activity were really kept closed to prevent voting in rural war  zones in favor of UNO. Witness for Peace, a Washington-based group that  monitors the Contras, said there had been no recent rebel activity near the  polling station at El Toro, in Matagalpa province, where 1,300 people were kept  from voting.  </P> <P> The Sandinistas, in turn, accused UNO supporters of violating the law against  politicking at the polls.  </P> <P> But the complaints were overshadowed by optimism on both sides that the heavy  turnout had favored their candidates.  </P> <P> The government invited observers from 160 foreign groups to monitor the vote,  and they tried to cover most of the polling stations.  </P> <P> Times reporters who visited rural areas of Chontales and Jinotega provinces  recently infiltrated by the Contras encountered few international observers but  saw large peaceful turnouts of eager voters, including unarmed Sandinista  soldiers.  </P> <P> "What has happened in this country is that we Nicaraguans have become strangers  to each other," said Fernando Giacom Gomez, a farmer in the village of El  Ayote, in Chontales. "Whoever wins, what we need is peace."  </P> <P> Carter said that if the election was judged to be fair, it would remove the  rationale for any further American aid to the rebels or remove the government  that the rebels oppose. Either result, he said, would permit the United States  to end a five-year economic embargo and to normalize relations with a  Nicaraguan government enjoying popular support.  </P> <P> The election was the first in Nicaragua to be contested by all political  forces. Amid dying prospects for a resumption of U.S. military aid to the  Contras, which was cut off two years ago, several rebel leaders returned from  exile to help found UNO last May, making it a broad anti-Sandinista coalition.  </P> <P> Just once in Nicaragua's bloody history, in 1928, has power passed from one  party to another through the ballot. Historically, elections were viewed as  rigged instruments to perpetuate the party in power.  </P> <P> The 1984 election, which gave Ortega two-thirds of the vote, was marred by the  pullout of the main U.S.-backed opposition bloc. Its leaders still claim that  unfair campaign conditions made the Sandinistas unbeatable. But many of them,  now in UNO, say their decision was an error that plunged the nation into its  worst years of war.  </P> <P> Anti-Sandinista politicians were thrust to the front of the conflict in  February, 1989, when a peace agreement among Central American presidents moved  Nicaragua's 1990 elections forward by nine months in exchange for a plan, still  unfulfilled, to close the Contra camps in Honduras.  </P> <P> Last September, the 14-party coalition united behind Chamorro and received  pledges of $3.3 million in U.S. government aid.  </P> <P> Chamorro's campaign stressed the sacrifices of her slain husband, Pedro Joaquin  Chamorro, the best-known victim of the struggle against Somoza. She appealed  for reconciliation of a divided nation and called for an end to compulsory  military service.  </P> <P> Focusing on Nicaragua's severe economic decline, which has cut real wages by  more than 90% since 1981 and driven forced large numbers of people into  poverty, Chamorro also promised an economic revival driven by greater freedom  for private capital.  </P> <P> Sandinista candidates, saying the crisis had been stabilized, blamed it on the  Contra war and the U.S. embargo, rather than mismanagement.  </P> <P> And they used their economic battles with the United States to wage a  nationalist campaign against Chamorro's American-financed coalition, calling  her a stalking horse for yanqui imperialism. Sandinistas claimed that some UNO  leaders were closely tied to the Somoza regime and the estimated 3,000 Contras  still fighting inside Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Ortega abandoned his olive-green uniform and stern bearing to stump vigorously  across the country as a youthful populist. He danced the limbo, hugged babies,  tossed baseballs into crowds and handed out land titles by the thousands.  </P> <P> Adapting a U.S.-style campaign, his party outspent UNO, clothed much of the  country with "Daniel for President" T-shirts and dominated the media and the  billboards. It mustered the vast resources of the state to produce campaign  rallies somewhat larger than those greeting Chamorro.  </P> <P> In the closing weeks of the race, Ortega pre-empted one of Chamorro's key  campaign promises by freeing the last 1,190 prisoners condemned for crimes  against the state.  </P> <P> Chamorro's campaign -- hampered in the closing weeks by a broken kneecap, the  delayed arrival of U.S. funds and squabbling within her coalition -- appealed  to voters to overcome their fear of "dictatorship" and believe in the secret  ballot. UNO trained thousands of poll watchers to prevent fraud.  </P> <P> Election officials said UNO was represented at nearly all of the polling  places. But opposition leaders said some of their poll watchers were not  allowed to sign off on all voting procedures.  </P> <P> Given the backdrop of guerrilla war, the campaign was remarkably civil. Four  Sandinista campaign workers were killed by the Contras in January, and a UNO  supporter died in December in the only one of hundreds of campaign rallies that  was marred by a riot.  </P> <P> "The key factor in the campaign that kept it on track was the conviction by  each side that it could win," said Carter, who helped negotiate procedures for  preventing violence after the December riot.  </P> <P> Peace OFFERING: Bush says the U.S. is ready to improve relations.

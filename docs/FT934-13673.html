			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (12): Temperature has cooled markedly  -Regulation EIGHTEEN months ago, the approach of regulators and legislators to the over-the-counter derivatives market was, if not hostile, certainly combative. The blunt warning about derivatives sounded in January 1992 by the then president of the Federal Reserve, Mr Gerald Corrigan, still rang loudly in bankers' ears, and a small army of regulators from the US and overseas (including the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England) were studying the lightly regulated OTC business. At the same time, lawmakers in the US were getting in on the act. Badly burned by the multibillion dollar collapse of the US savings and loan industry and by the meltdown in the junk bond market in the late 1980s, and by the near-collapse of some of the country's biggest banks at the start of the 1990s, Congress did not want to be caught asleep on its financial watch again. Eager to be fully informed of the growth of the over-the-counter derivatives business and its potential impact upon public policy, various key finance and banking committees originated their own inquiries, and several leading members of Congress hinted at the possibility of legislation to control, if not curb, the growth of derivatives. At that time, the creators and users of derivatives were being put on the defensive. Essentially, regulators and US legislators were asking them to prove that the myriad of risks that banks and corporations take on when using derivatives did not threaten the health of an increasingly inter-connected global financial system. Over the past 18 months, the banks and securities houses which create and sell derivatives, with the help of the corporations and institutions which use them, have helped answer some of the many questions surrounding the business. The result: the temperature of the regulatory climate surrounding the derivatives business, so hot 18 months ago, has cooled. Mr Joe Bauman, head of business development for global derivatives at Citibank in New York, and spokesman for the industry in his capacity as chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda), says regulators and legislators are definitely taking a more 'constructive and understanding' approach to the business today. 'They have shown a willingness to take a harder look, to get behind the generalities.' Mr Bauman and other bankers point out that regulators were taking such an interest in derivatives primarily because they did not understand the complexities and intricacies of business. Having failed to track the early development of derivatives, regulators were behind from the start, and struggled to keep up with the hectic pace of innovation. This is a point that the regulators have openly conceded. Last year the then US Treasury secretary Mr Nicholas Brady referred to the 'wide knowledge gap between regulators and regulated', echoing earlier comments from a senior Bank of England figure who said the gap was 'too great for normal communication'. Since then, the knowledge-gap has narrowed. Not only have the regulators started, and in many cases completed, their investigations of derivatives, but banks have gone out of their way to educate regulators about the business. When it comes to the question of whether new risks to banks and the financial system are posed by the growth of derivatives, Isda's message has always been that 'the risks are there already, and what needs to be understood is the ways those risks are managed,' says Mr Bauman. With the help of a series of derivatives seminars hosted by banks for government officials, that message is now getting across. In their mission to educate regulators, bankers have been helped by some of the recent studies on derivatives published around the world. None has been more helpful than this July's report from the Group of Thirty (G30). Although many of its authors were prominent members of the international banking community, and therefore deemed unlikely to criticise a business that was generating billions of dollars of profits for the industry, the G30's pronouncements were still eagerly awaited. In the event, the study generally concurred with earlier reports by the Bank of England and the BIS and gave the derivatives business a clean bill of health, recommending only a series of management and operational reforms banks should undertake to reduce risks. Bankers said they hoped the study and its recommendations would become a blueprint for regulators. The G30, however, steered clear of tackling the one issue that worries regulators most - the possibility that something may go wrong in the over-the-counter derivatives market that prompts a worldwide banking and financial crisis. That this threat still troubles regulators was evident in June when Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the BIS, called for the drawing up of common international standards on banks' disclosures of the risks on their derivatives books. And it was also evident last month, when the International Monetary Fund published its own study about derivatives and warned that growth in derivatives trading may have created unknown risks for banks. Both Mr Lamfalussy and the IMF made the same point. The BIS chief said that banks' participation in the derivatives markets had 'reduced the transparency of their balance sheets', making it harder for regulators to predict 'disturbances' that might pose 'systemic problems' in global finance. The IMF said: 'Participation in derivatives markets can cause firms to become connected through complicated transactions in ways that are not easily understood.' This, the report concluded, made it 'extremely difficult' for regulators to assess the risk of default in the system. Regulatory scrutiny of the derivatives business is by no means over. Three Washington-based bodies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the General Accounting Office, are all conducting studies into derivatives. And in September, the Comptroller of the Currency, a key US bank regulator, announced it was establishing a task force to monitor the market's evolution. The GAO study, which was expected to be released this summer but which probably will not be out until late this year or early 1993, is particularly important because the GAO is the investigative body of Congress, and Congress is where some of the tougher questions about derivatives are being asked. For now, Congressional interest in derivatives remains at an educational level, with banks and end-users helping the legislators learn more about the business. As Joe Bauman of the Isda says: 'We are finding that there is still a fair amount of education to be done, because as a group they have not been singularly looking at financial markets, and certainly not the derivatives market.' Bankers feel this educational process is paying off. Mr Doug Kidd, who is responsible for government relations at Bankers Trust, says: 'Members of Congress originally viewed derivatives as nothing more than new positioning tools for financial institutions to make directional bets on markets. Now that education generally is better, and end-users have participated in seminars and talked about how they use derivatives, there's a new appreciation among members of what derivatives are used for.' Although they may now be better informed, legislators are still keen to learn more about derivatives, and a series of committee hearings on the business will be held this winter, including several by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the senior Congressional banking committee and a regular thorn in the side of US banks. With him, other legislators and many regulators still on the derivatives trail, banks cannot relax.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: Two Tory beats at the heart of Europe Sir, Your headline read 'PM rejects European super state' (April 29). Doesn't any one think it in the least odd that while Mr Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, continue to reject a United States of Europe in the federal mould, Tory members of the European parliament are, apparently, individually joining the Christian Democrats, the European peoples party? The objects of this people's party (EPP) include pursuing 'the process of federal unification and integration in Europe and . . . the realisation of United States of Europe'. Odder still that the EPP expects them to stand as Christian Democrats at the next European elections in 1994. The EPP claims to be 'The Heart of Europe'. That is where Mr Major says he wants to be. Coincidence? Or is the Tory party about to change its name? Anthony Kinch, 36 Greenways, Beckenham, Kent BR3 3NG</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> KRAUS AND VAN DAM SALVAGE MET 'HOFFMANN'  </P> <P> Offenbach's "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" has seen better days at the Metropolitan  Opera.  </P> <P> Otto Schenk's crisply fanciful staging scheme of 1982, now entrusted to Lesley  Koenig, has lost some of its original focus and momentum. Gunther  Schneider-Siemssen's lavish, ultra-clever sets are beginning to show signs of  wear.  </P> <P> Sylvain Cambreling, the new conductor, paces Offenbach's score with momentum  that often exhilarates but sometimes invites frenzy. His quest for dramatic  breadth is hampered, no doubt, by the Met's stubborn preference for the  time-dishonored Choudens edition.  </P> <P> The ultimate impact of the production now depends on who happens to be doing  what to whom on the stage. On Thursday, Alfredo Kraus as Hoffmann happened to  be victimized by the multiple nemesis of Jose van Dam.  </P> <P> Kraus remains one of the bona-fide wonders of the operatic world. He always was  a singer of uncanny intelligence and refinement, a singer who valued poise and  subtle inflection as much as dazzling assaults on the vocal stratosphere. At 62  -- repeat, 62 -- he still can offer object lessons in style, technique and,  yes, freshness of tone.  </P> <P> He never did command the most sensuous sound in the world. It never mattered.  </P> <P> He always knew how to caress a phrase, how to shade a line, how to color a  text. That mattered.  </P> <P> At an age when even his younger rivals and colleagues -- you know who I mean --  avoid the strain and exposure of extreme high notes, Kraus actually  interpolates unexpected Bs and Cs. What's more, he does so with nonchalant  panache.  </P> <P> As Hoffmann, he exuded charm and innocence, elegance and bravado, poetry and  ardor. He never forced, never cheated. True, he may have taken certain rhythmic  liberties. He may occasionally have paused to catch his breath in an odd place.  But an artist of his caliber can write his own rules.  </P> <P> He still sets the standard.  </P> <P> Van Dam refused to turn the challenge of the four villains into a camping trip.  He savored the language and actually underplayed the grotesquerie. Witty and  only mildly sardonic, he recalled the dangerous suavity of a Martial Singher  rather than the elemental evil of a Norman Treigle. The approach proved  eminently valid, ultimately fascinating.  </P> <P> More baritone than bass, Van Dam triumphed in moments of lyrical indulgence. It  is difficult to recall Dappertutto's spurious aria, "Scintille, diamant," sung  with such an insinuating legato, with such sensuous tone and such dynamic  finesse.  </P> <P> If only the others in the cast could have revealed comparable insights  bolstered by comparable resources. Catherine Malfitano came close with her  generally luminous yet febrile Antonia. She was counterbalanced, however, by  Erie Mills as a squeaky-cute Olympia and Tatiana Troyanos as a blowsy-fatale  Giulietta. Brenda Boozer, probably better seen than heard as Nicklausse, seemed  embarrassed by the restoration of the romanza, "Vous sous l'archet fremissant."  </P> <P> Anthony Laciura sketched the four servant roles in relatively broad strokes.  Donald Kaasch, the new Spalanzani, settled for easy buffo convention. Gweneth  Bean intoned the music of Antonia's Mother with amplitude more appropriate to  an Erda.  </P> <P> In general, there are better ways of telling Hoffmann's tales. Nevertheless,  the Met did muster Kraus and Van Dam. One must be grateful for great favors.  </P></p>

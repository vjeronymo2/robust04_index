			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>   [Text] Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, deputy secretary of the  Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat [SECOFI],  estimated that the amount to be invested in the manufacturing  sector during the 1993-94 period will total 60 billion new  pesos. He also indicated that despite events that have occurred  throughout the country since 1 January, the federal government  does not foresee any changes as these relate to [economic]  expectations.    Likewise, Sanchez stated that manufacturing growth during  the  first quarter will be practically "stable" or very small since  it should be kept in mind that the October-November 1993 period  there was a fall in activity. Despite the fact that growth in  manufacturing activity has been minor during the first three  months of the year, there are no plans to prepare any emergency  programs to stimulate this productive sector of the country.    The SECOFI official indicated that what the federal  government is doing is working with competitive programs  designed within the framework of PECE [Stability, Employment and  Competitiveness Pact], of which there are currently 33 such  programs. Through these mechanisms, the federal government is  working with each manufacturing company to solve their most  urgent problems. The most common, pressing problems that have  been identified among these companies include inadequate  financing, tariffs, red tape and public bids, among others.    Interviewed within the framework of the inauguration of the  Expo-Electronic 94, the official denied that investment plans in  the assembly plant industry are being delayed. He stressed that  it is even appropriate to say that this is one of the most  dynamic investment items of the national economy.    In reinvigorating the issue of investments in the national  manufacturing industry, Sanchez pointed out that many companies  are now investing their capital in the sector. The Commerce  Secretariat, he indicated, has detected a significant number of  investments in every manufacturing field which are either  concluding this year or are at a very advanced stage. These  capital investments, he added, include those in the automobile  sector, cement, textiles, electronics, and assembly plants.  Sanchez stressed that there are a significant number of  projects that are in an advanced stage.    On the other hand, in reference to the problems of the  electrical manufacturing industries which consist of purchases  in the public sector -- Federal Electricity Commission -- he  pointed out that they are at a standstill because of problems  caused by Chapter 10 of the free trade agreement, but that it  was already being resolved.    Yesterday during a meeting with several manufacturers, an  agreement was made with respect to what the rules of the game  would be as they relate to national public bids authorized  within the Free Trade Agreement.    During his speech, Sanchez Ugarte said the electronic  manufacturing industry represents a key element in the country's  economic, modernization strategy because the search for greater  levels of productivity has encouraged a more significant use of  electronic products in most sectors.</p>

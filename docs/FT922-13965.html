			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Balancing act may not be so precarious THE COMPLEXITIES of the hung parliament Britain may wake up to tomorrow have been greatly exaggerated. The leader of the largest party will take office and present parliament with a Queen's Speech on May 6. If the speech is voted down, he will resign and the leader of the next biggest party will be summoned by the Queen. Otherwise, the government will stay in power until it is defeated on a motion of no confidence or the prime minister calls another election. A government does not require support from a majority of MPs - it simply needs to avoid being voted down on the Queen's Speech or a confidence motion. Also a sitting prime minister may remain in office even if he or she is not leader of the largest party. Mr Edward Heath did so when the February 1974 election put him four seats behind Labour. Mr Heath offered the Liberals a coalition and resigned only after Liberal leader Mr Jeremy Thorpe refused him. Mr Harold Wilson formed a government and the Tories abstained on his Queen's Speech. He called another election seven months later, having sought no agreement with the Liberals. Three things are clear. Mr Major would find it well-nigh impossible to survive unless the Tories were the largest party; no-one need negotiate with the Liberal Democrats in a hung parliament; and the Queen would almost certainly grant a request for another election, provided the leaders of both main parties had had the opportunity to form a government. If the Conservatives are by some margin the largest party, Mr Major would probably remain in Downing Street with tacit Ulster Unionist support. If the Tory lead over Labour is small, the position is highly uncertain. On precedent, Mr Major would present a Queen's Speech to parliament. Given the likely voting intentions of the Ulster Unionists (anti-Labour) and the Welsh and Scottish nationalists (anti-Tory), Mr Ashdown could hold the key to Tory survival. Internal party pressure would make it difficult for the Liberal Democrats to sustain Mr Major, even by abstaining. But their threat to do so might be enough to push Mr Kinnock some way on electoral reform. Under these circumstances, an early election would be almost unavoidable, since no Majority coalition - or even agreement - would be conceivable. Short of a Tory volte-face on Scotland, PR or Ulster, none of the smaller parties would formally ally with Mr Major while a Kinnock government would very likely require consistent support from Liberals and nationalists simply to outvote the Tories plus Unionists. If Labour is the largest party, Mr Major would be likely to resign immediately. Mr Kinnock would take office and present a Queen's Speech. Were Labour defeated on that speech, an immediate second election is the only plausible sequel. But two back-to-back elections are without precedent in any western democracy, and the pressure to avoid a poll in June would be intense. A sufficient number of minor-party MPs - and perhaps even the Conservatives - could be expected to abstain to avoid an election before the autumn. On past form, an early second election would be inevitable if Labour led in a hung parliament. But there are strong incentives for Labour and/or its potential allies to avoid an early return to the hustings. Neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats would wish to face Scottish voters again without a Scottish parliament on the statute book. Whoever governs next week will be anxious to avoid the electorate until the 'green shoots' of recovery prove more substantial. In July, Britain succeeds Portugal as European Community president for six months - culminating in the Edinburgh summit in December. Labour and the Liberal Democrats thus have a powerful mutual interest in avoiding an early second election. The differences separating them are tiny  -except on electoral reform for Westminster. If the election produces a Labour-led hung parliament, ignore this week's rhetoric and remember Rab Butler's dictum: politics is the art of the possible.</p>

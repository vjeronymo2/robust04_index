			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Road to the Economic and Monetary Union </F> (EMU)"]    [Text] Denmark is two months into the second phase of the  Economic and Monetary Union. Probably few people have noticed  it. However the government has taken the opportunity to issue a  report on Denmark's economic cooperation in the European Union  (EU). According to the preface by the economic affairs minister,  it should also serve as a starting point for the campaign prior  to the European Parliament elections in June.    The report says that adjusting the economy to the strict  requirements in phase two is going well. This phase is the last  before the planned freeze of exchange rates and the introduction  of a common currency. In other words, phrase three, where  Denmark has slammed on the brakes. There is reason to ask why it  is so essential to follow the process to the halfway point. Is  the lesson from the monetary policy events in 1992 and 1993  beginning to sink in or does this indicate distaste for the  prospect of a somewhat higher interest level in this country in  relation to the core of the European and Monetary Union (EMU)?    Phase two, which is now under way, is a transition stage  with  respect to monetary cooperation. Monetary and economic stability  must be ensured before the irrevocable step of freezing exchange  rates and establishing a joint currency is taken. That is the  logical aim of the substance of the transition phase.    Economic policy cooperation is expanded in phase two, among  other things through the so-called convergence programs, which  are updated continually. About 10 days ago the government  delivered the Danish convergence program to the EU Commission.  The convergence programs are intended to demonstrate that the  individual countries are moving their economic policies toward  the goals that are necessary in order to reach phase three, and  this is evaluated primarily on the basis of the degree of price  stability, the public budget deficit, long-term interest rates,  and exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the old European  Monetary System (EMS) margin. In the government's opinion this  will not cause big problems where Denmark is concerned, as long  as a number of economic factors also develop as expected, of  course. Here the assumption of a growth of 0.5 percent in public  consumption starting next year is an especially interesting test  of credibility.    A more basic question, however, is what the government  intends to do if the test is passed. The second phase is meant  to involve a gradual merger with phase three's assurance of  monetary stability and lower interest rates. By the very nature  of the case this outcome will apply only to the participants and  thus not to Denmark. It seems a little strange that a question  was raised a few days ago about reestablishing the old EMS  cooperation when the new report says that returning to the  situation that existed before 2 August 1993 will hardly be  possible.</p>

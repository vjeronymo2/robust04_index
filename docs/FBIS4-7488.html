			<p>BFN     [Text] Szczecin, 31 Mar--The deputy chairman of the  parliamentary floor group of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD],  Marek Borowski, former deputy prime minister and former finance  minister, said on Thursday in Szczecin that he considered the  fact that Lech Walesa had not signed the law replacing the  excess wage tax [neo-popiwek] to be a declaration of war against  the coalition. He also expressed the opinion that this was an  attempt to make mischief within the coalition.    Borowski said that the president would sign the budget law  "because, after all, there are limits to absurdity."    As an element of the war with the coalition, Borowski sees  the refusal of Minister Kolodziejczyk to fill the post of deputy  minister at the Ministry of National Defense [MON] with a  representative of the coalition.    It is Borowski's view that, in this situation, parliamentary  forces should be mobilized to reject the presidential veto. As  far as the situation in MON is concerned, a group of 15 deputies  from the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] should propose a  motion in the Sejm regarding a vote of no confidence in Piotr  Kolodziejczyk. After its acceptance, Kolodziejczyk must resign.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Justice chief says detection is best crime deterrent THE RISK of being caught is a greater deterrent to criminals than the length of the jail sentence, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, said last night. His comment in a Lords debate on the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice comes after criticism by Lord Justice Woolf, a law lord, of government proposals to get tough on crime. Lord Taylor told peers: 'I am strongly of the view that the most important deterrent to criminals is the likelihood of detection rather than the nature or length of sentences. 'Will I get caught' is uppermost in the villain's mind, not 'will I get three years or five'. 'Public interest at present is that the level of detection is low and, even when detected, many offenders are not prosecuted. I hope that in its avowed aim to give law and order high priority, the government will lay emphasis on detecting and preventing crime and that all the resources necessary to that emphasis will be made available.' The Lord Chief Justice repeated his opposition to removal of the right to elect for jury trial in certain cases. Referring to the planned review authority to deal with alleged miscarriages of justice, he said it was important 'we should not proceed too fast'. It was vital that it be properly set up. Royal commission chairman Viscount Runciman of Doxford said: 'I hope that I and others are wrong in expressing fears that some of the recommendations may find favour at the expense of others, when the chances of their success once implemented will to a very large degree depend on their being treated as integrated parts of a coherent whole.'</p>

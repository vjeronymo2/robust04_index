			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unscheduled announcement"] </F>   [Text] The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has denounced the  secessionist crime perpetrated by the misguided group dominating  the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP].    A statement issued by the Yemen Command of the Arab  Socialist  Ba'th Party says: Our people and all their good forces have  always pinned and are still pinning their hopes on the unionist  current in the YSP to do something for the sake of beloved Yemen  in order to entrench the Yemeni unity, adhere to constitutional  legitimacy, confront secession, and to issue a principled reply  to what has been declared by certain leaders dominating the YSP,  and what they have called the separation of the southern and  eastern governorates from the Republic of Yemen.    The statement adds: Remaining silent over this is considered  a historic crime. Our Yemeni people will never forgive those  who are now standing idle and are just watching this crime.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira suffers setback POLITICAL upheaval in Italy sent the lira sharply lower against the D-Mark yesterday, writes Emma Tucker. Rumours that Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, might have to resign prompted a dramatic slide in the currency, from L948.8 per D-Mark at the close on Monday, to L964 at last night's close. Mr Mark Brett, director of bond and currency strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the market had reacted negatively to the fact that Italians were selling the lira heavily. 'The markets think the Italians are in the know,' commented one analyst. The Bank of Italy intervened to prop up the currency as speculation about Mr Amato's future grew. He is in trouble because of a government-proposed decree which he co-authored that would take immediate effect and would allow corruption suspects to avoid jail. Expectations of monetary easing by the Bundesbank dominated the rest of the day's trading. One trader said that forecasts for German growth were being downgraded by the day, as analysts caught up with the extent of corp-orate grief in the country. The dollar struggled in late trading after a lurch upwards in the early afternoon. Analysts said there was nothing significant in the rise, although news that IG Metall, the German metal and engineering workers' union, had called for token strikes in east Germany provided some support for the currency. The US unit finished in London up  1/2 pfennig on the day at DM1.6675. In New York the dollar was finally a shade below the London close at DM1.6663. Sterling weathered the government's defeat over the Maastricht treaty on Monday night relatively well. It slipped a pfennig on the day but dealers reported that overseas investors were quick to buy the pound back from a DM2.3854 low. Mr Brett said fears about the UK's role in Europe were 'overplayed', pointing out that Monday's defeat did not threaten ratification of the treaty, but merely delayed it. Although overseas investors are confused by the UK parliament's machinations over Maastricht, dealers reported that sentiment towards the pound was generally 'more kind'. However, many analysts doubt that the pound will be able to break above DM2.41 before the Budget. Suggestions that the UK chancellor may raise taxes could cause the currency to slip. 'If there is anything too aggressive in the Budget on fiscal policy, the currency might wobble because the market will start to expect further interest rate cuts,' added Mr Brett. Sterling finished at DM2.3925. The franc was marginally lower against the D-Mark. It ended at FFr3.391, compared with the previous close of FFr3.389. The peseta was also slightly weaker, closing at Pta71.12 to the D-Mark.</p>

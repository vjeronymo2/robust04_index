			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Rao government goes for gamble on growth: Admission of soaring borrowings overshadows Indian budget cuts in taxes Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, announced measures to liberalise the economy and promote growth yesterday, improving convertibility of the rupee and cutting interest rates, customs duties and taxes. But the reforms, set out in the annual budget speech, were overshadowed by an admission that government borrowings have soared in the past year far above targets - to levels at which they are prompting some observers to voice fears about the country's economic stability. Mr Singh disclosed that because of lower than expected tax and customs revenues and higher than anticipated spending on subsidies and other items, the fiscal deficit for the year to the end of March would be about 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target of 4.7 per cent. The target for the new year starting in April is to be 6 per cent. While acknowledging the dangers of his policies, Mr Singh was adamant 'that the risks involved in the course of action I have proposed do not cross the limits of prudence.' The budget was widely seen as relying on increased economic activity to bring higher government revenues and so eventually cut public borrowing. Industrialists hailed the steps to encourage growth. Mr Bansi Dhar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said: 'The budget has all the ingredients to take India to the world's front-ranking nations.' However they expressed fears about the fiscal deficit and disappointment at the lack of bold deregulatory initiatives. The Bombay stock exchange 30-share index closed 50.37 points up at 4,287.98. Mr Singh was presenting his fourth budget since the government took office in 1991 and responded to a balance of payments crisis by embarking on India's most extensive reforms since independence. He expressed concern about the fiscal deficit and pledged to 'return to the path of fiscal rectitude'. He also promised to continue with pro-market reform and promoting international trade and investment. Mr Singh said in his speech that borrowings had grown more than expected because revenues had fallen short of target mainly because industry was stagnant. Attempts to cut the deficit sharply 'might well have been counter-productive'. The risks of a big deficit were manageable because food stocks were high and industry had plenty of surplus capacity so the danger of increased inflation (now running at 8.5 per cent a year) was low. The main reason Mr Singh has been able to take this course is the country's external account performance. Because of incentives the government has given to foreign trade and investment since it embarked on reform in mid-1991, exports are soaring. Foreign exchange reserves have leapt to a record Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.8bn) from Dollars 1bn in mid-1991. India no longer feels the need to kow-tow to the International Monetary Fund, which granted emergency loans in 1991 on condition that public borrowings were cut. Mr Singh yesterday announced that India would repay Dollars 1.4bn early to the IMF, a prudent economic move but also a potent political gesture. For foreign companies, the notable points of interest in the budget are the decision to make the rupee fully convertible on the current account, which should make non-trade transactions easier to process, and further reductions in customs duties, which should promote imports into India. But the budget lacks bold deregulatory initiatives. No indication has been given of a willingness to reform labour laws to increase employers' powers to dismiss workers, often cited as a disincentive by potential investors in India. Items in the budget included: Maximum customs duty rates are cut from 85 to 65 per cent, plus reductions in specific categories designed to promote imports of parts and raw materials. Duties on steel are to fall from 75-85 per cent to a maximum of 50 per cent. Maximum corporate tax rate is cut from 50 to 40 per cent, though a 15 per cent surcharge stays. Taxes on foreign companies operating in India are cut from 65 to 55 per cent. An expenditure (sales) tax on hotels is cut from 20 to 10 per cent to boost tourism. A wide-ranging overhaul is to be made of indirect taxes, including reducing exemptions and special cases so that hundreds of rules will be scrapped. Indirect taxes will be extended to services, notably 5 per cent levies on telephone bills, non-life insurance premiums and stockbrokers' commissions. A further Rs57bn (Pounds 1.2bn) is to help recapitalise state-owned banks; and there are promises to increase spending on education, health, defence, technology and agriculture.

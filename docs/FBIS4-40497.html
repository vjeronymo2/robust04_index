			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR" daily), 06/16/94 -- The RMK  [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] military experts believe,  despite several defeats in winter and spring, Azerbaijan still  has a significant attack potential, and keeps expansive  intentions.    Attempting to defeat the RMK at any price, Azerbaijan  violates the international agreements it has signed.  Particularly, based on the agreement on normal [conventional]  armaments in Europe, this country was only allowed to have 220  tanks. Nevertheless, according to the RMK military  reconnaissance, the Azeri army has long exceeded the allowed  limits. In parallel with this, based on Aliyev's special order,  a number of large enterprises in Azerbaijan are producing and  modernizing weaponry.    "All these alarming military preparations, as well as fast  militarization of the economy are originating from the  all-Turkish idea of creating a Great Azerbaijan," declared  Deputy Commander in Chief of the RMK defense army Murad  Petrosyan. "This country has territorial claims to, in fact,  all neighboring countries and particularly for the Bolnisi and  Marneuli districts of Georgia, southern districts of Dagestan,  northern regions of Iran and Zangezur district of Armenia. The  RMK has become the first target of the Azeri hegemonists, who  receive military-political support of Turkey".    On Petrosyan's opinion not only the future of the RMK  people,  but fortunes of a number of countries in Close East and  Transcaucasia depend on the results of the Karabakh-Azerbaijan  war.</p>

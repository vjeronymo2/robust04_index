			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Employee survey results kept secret Companies which use workforce surveys to obtain information from their employees are often reluctant to share all their findings with their staff, a report says today. The increasing popularity of surveys was reflected in the high degree of satisfaction with results reported among the Industrial Society study of 264 organisations which have carried out recent surveys. Three-quarters of those questioned said they would repeat the employee survey in the next two years. The society said employee communications, health and safety, and training were the topics most frequently investigated in the surveys, which cost Pounds 10,000 each on average. In most cases, it said, managers would produce post-survey action plans, although only half of the managers canvassed thought their plans were proving successful. The average response rate among employees was 66 per cent, said the report. The study coincides with a critical report on employee surveys by International Survey Research, a surveying organisation. The report said some employers were using surveys wrongly - introducing them when they were unnecessary, surveying too frequently, spreading them too wide and using poor survey instruments.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall THERE WAS little activity on the UK money markets as the high spirits of Friday, when inflation fell to record lows, wore off. Traders said the market had overreacted and was now absorbing Friday's comments from both Mr Eddie George, governor designate of the Bank of England, and Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, that the authorities do not intend to cut rates in the near future. Although the market has recently been sceptical about statements of intent from the government, one trader said Mr Lamont's apparent desire to safeguard the exchange rate did appear to be 'sinking in'. Short sterling futures drifted lower in the morning with the realisation that Friday's euphoria was 'premature'. The March contract dropped 11 basis points from Friday's close to 94.09, with traders reporting that the market was also concerned about sterling's weakness on the foreign exchange markets. Movement in interbank rates was less pronounced than in the futures market. This was partly because the Bank of England's forecast shortage was much smaller than had been expected. A dealer commented: 'Cash rates would have gone up further if it had not been for the small size of the shortage. In fact, there was no great pressure upwards on rates and that is why futures have reacted worse than cash rates.' The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m in the morning and purchased bills totalling Pounds 300m for resale to the market on March 11 and 12 at a rate of 5 29/32 per cent in the early round. The forecast was revised to a shortage of around Pounds 750m later, following which the Bank bought a further Pounds 244m of bills. The Bank all but cleared the shortfall in the afternoon by buying Pounds 72m of bills and offering late assistance of Pounds 105m. In Germany, a sharper than expected rise in the wholesale prices index pushed Euromark futures down as prospects for early monetary easing receded. Wholesale prices in the former West Germany rose 0.7 per cent in January from the previous month, against market expectations of a 0.1 per cent month-on-month increase. Futures were also depressed by comments late last week from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, suggesting that a rate cut in Germany was unlikely this week. The March Euromark contract slipped about 6 basis points to 91.92. Generally, however, the market was on hold before today's regular Bundesbank repo pact.</p>

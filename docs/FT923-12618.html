			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Recession forces jump in PSBR BRITAIN'S public-sector borrowing requirement jumped to a higher-than-expected Pounds 4.23bn last month as the recession depressed government revenues and boosted spending. The June PSBR was well above average market forecasts of a Pounds 3.5bn Budget deficit and higher than the Pounds 3.15bn PSBR recorded in May and the June 1991 deficit of Pounds 1.36bn. It brought the total borrowing requirement in the first three months of the 1992-93 financial year to Pounds 10.8bn, fuelling fears that the government will not be able to keep within its Pounds 28bn target this year. The April-to-June deficit compares with the Pounds 7bn PSBR recorded in the same period of last year and the total 1991-92 PSBR of Pounds 13.9bn. Although government deficits tend to bunch in the early months of the financial year, the worsening finances will bolster the case of Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, when he presses for public-expenditure cuts in the present spending round. Last month's PSBR incorporated Pounds 446m of privatisation proceeds from the sale of the Northern Ireland electricity companies and receipts from this year's sale of BT shares. Without income from privatisation, the PSBR for the three months to the end of June would have been Pounds 12.7bn, against Pounds 9.2bn the year before. Central government cash receipts fell 0.5 per cent to Pounds 46bn in the three months to June against a 7 per cent increase in cash outlays to Pounds 56.4bn. Inland Revenue receipts were down 3.5 per cent on a year ago, reflecting depressed revenues from corporation and income tax.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Corruption crisis grows for Gonzalez Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, yesterday came under further pressure to regain the political initiative as newspapers published more allegations about corruption cases which yesterday claimed a second ministerial victim in five days. The agriculture minister, Mr Vicente Albero, resigned over his failure to meet his tax obligations. This followed the departure from the government last weekend of the interior minister, Mr Antoni Asuncion, over the case of former Civil Guard chief, Mr Lus Roldan, who is accused of embezzling public funds and is now on the run from police. Mr Gonzalez, who has formally accepted the resignations of both ministers, is expected to disclose the names of replacements today when he holds a news conference. The case of Mr Roldan, combined with allegations of tax fraud against former Bank of Spain governor, Mr Mariano Rubio, has presented the government with one of its worst political crises in almost 12 years in power. Opposition parties have repeatedly called for Mr Gonzalez himself to resign or call new general elections. The Catalan nationalists, on whom Mr Gonzalez depends for support to keep his minority government afloat, have called for concrete steps against corruption if they are to continue backing him. The daily newspaper El Pas yesterday published what it said were secret documents showing that the Civil Guard, under Mr Roldan's direction, held negotiations in 1991 with a French criminal organisation to obtain information on the Basque terrorist group Eta. In return, the French group was to be given assistance in purchasing government-owned property in Madrid at below-market prices. But it later pulled out of the deal. Meanwhile, Mr Rubio, former central bank governor and the other main figure at the centre of the recent controversies, was arrested, along with an investment broker, Mr Manuel de la Concha. The state news agency Efe reported they were being charged with falsifying documents and tax fraud. Mr Rubio, governor from 1986 to 1992, has formally resigned as an adviser to the bank. Mr Rubio is accused of avoiding tax by keeping stock investment gains in a secret account at Ibercorp, a private investment bank run by Mr de la Concha, who is also a former head of the Madrid stock exchange. Mr de la Concha was censured in 1992 by both the National Securities Market Commission and the Bank of Spain for irregular dealings. In his resignation statement, Mr Albero, the agriculture minister, said he was stepping down because of his failure to account for investment earnings on tax declarations. He said Mr de la Concha had handled some of his investments and he wanted to avoid embarassing the government. As the wave of scandals spread, Mr Rubio's successor as Bank of Spain governor, Mr Lus Angel Rojo, yesterday defended himself against allegations of links to the Rubio affair following a report showing that he invested funds through the same agent. Mr Rojo, who was deputy governor under Mr Rubio, said he had opened a stock account with Mr De la Concha in 1987 but had no say in how it was managed. The investment, he said, involved 'a modest sum of money' from an economics prize he had received. He said he gave instructions a year later to cease operating the account, after he found there were 'too many transactions'. There were, however, two transactions in 1989, 'perhaps by error', resulting in a small loss. He closed the account in 1990. Mr Rojo added that he declared all the transactions in his tax returns. Mr Pedro Solbes, economy minister, yesterday vouched for Mr Rojo's 'total honesty'. Political jitters over the corruption crisis hit stock prices in Madrid yesterday, with the general index losing 5.78 points, falling to 311.57. Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalist party (CU), which holds the balance of power in the parliament, warned that it was the Socialist party's responsibility to prevent a snap election over the scandals. Mr Pujol's party, itself a coalition with varying degrees of enthusiasm for remaining in alliance with the Socialists, has promised conditional support for Mr Gonzalez. Its 17 deputies are crucial to the Socialists who, although the largest party, have a minority of 159 seats in the 350-member parliament. While this support remains, Mr Gonzalez is safe from a censure motion which would automatically remove his government. However, the Catalan nationalists have forced Mr Gonzalez to appear in parliament next Wednesday to explain the corruption cases. They are likely to demand a high political price for continued parliamentary backing, in terms of budget concessions and greater home rule powers.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts If yesterday's Pounds 2bn auction of conventional gilts was supposed to set the seal on the market's recovery, it has been a signal failure. Those of a technical bent may draw comfort from the thought that a low cover ratio does not necessarily matter when all the bids are clustered together. It may simply mean that the market found the auction easy to price. But the fact remains that total bids of only Pounds 2.58bn were received for a relatively rare sale of longer-dated paper. Though liquid, domestic institutions are clearly still cautious about committing cash to the market. Many apparently used the auction to switch out of existing holdings rather than increase their investment. Part of the concern lies in the international environment. There is not much retail demand in other European bond markets as the lacklustre response to yesterday's German auction shows. Strong durable goods orders left the markets feeling nervous about tomorrow's US growth figures. International markets remain vulnerable to threats of higher US interest rates. This week's CBI survey is a further reminder that the interest rate turn looms in the UK, too. It is impossible to tell whether there is anything behind yesterday afternoon's rumours that the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England will use their meeting today to agree a pre-emptive rise in base rates. There is no pressing need as yet, but the violent reaction of equities as well as gilts suggests worries about interest rates are becoming a regular feature, whether the authorities act or not.</p>

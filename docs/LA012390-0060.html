			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DOWNEY S&amp;L PLANS TO SELL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE NEWPORT BEACH COMPANY SAYS IT WILL START BEHAVING MORE LIKE A  COMMERCIAL BANK.  </P> <P> Capitulating to new federal rules governing thrift industry investments, Downey  Savings &amp; Loan Assn. said Monday that it will sell nearly $600 million  worth of real estate investments over the next five years.  </P> <P> And as it unloads its real estate holdings, Downey will begin acting "more like  a commercial bank than a thrift," stressing short-term commercial and consumer  loans and downplaying residential mortgage lending, said Maurice L. McAlister,  president and co-founder of the 33-year-old thrift.  </P> <P> Downey, with $4.1 billion in assets, has 47 branches in California. Based in  Newport Beach, the company is the fourth-largest S&amp;L headquartered in  Orange County.  </P> <P> McAlister said Downey continues to meet all three of the new capital  requirements imposed by the S&amp;L bailout measure last year.  </P> <P> He also said the S&amp;L will establish nearly $21 million in additional  reserves for 1990 -- a year in which such a charge won't detract much from  earnings because of tax benefits Downey will realize from its acquisition of  the insolvent Butterfield S&amp;L in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Despite the increased reserves, McAlister said Downey expects 1990 to be a  profitable year, in part because of earnings it will realize from the sale of  "a substantial amount" of its commercial and retail properties.  </P> <P> That property is carried on Downey's books at a gross value of $590 million,  McAlister said, but it has a fair market value of $763 million.  </P> <P> McAlister also said Downey will report a profit for 1989. The thrift posted a  $27-million profit for the first six months, followed by a $3.7-million loss  for the third quarter because of a new accounting requirement that forced it to  write down the value of a block of mortgage-backed securities it was holding  for investment purposes.  </P></p>

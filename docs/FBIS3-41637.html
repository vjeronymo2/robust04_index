Ukraine's Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy  Kostenko  turned to the German Minister of Environmental Protection,  Resources, and Nuclear Safety Dr. Klaus Toepfer with a request  to send German experts to identify these substances and find out  the circumstances under which they were brought from the FRG to  Ukraine.    In accordance with the agreement concluded between the  ministries in summer 1993, a group of German experts headed by  representative of the Federal Ministry of Environmental  Protection, Resources, and Nuclear Safety Andre Radde arrived in  Ukraine on 22 November.    The delegation is composed of both technological experts,  who  have brought along a chemical microlaboratory, and lawyers,  representatives of the land of Saxony-Anhalt, who will study the  legal aspects of the problem. Since July 1993, an investigation  has been under way in that land on the export of the waste, and  lawyers are having to collect evidence for the case.    The delegation members have confirmed the FRG Government's  intention to take measures for putting an end to the illegal  export of waste from the country.    Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection and the FRG  Embassy in Ukraine have agreed to hold a news conference on the  results of the delegation's work,</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan's economic planning  chief Yoshio Terasawa indicated concern Tuesday [10 May] that  recent surges of the yen against the dollar could again hurt the  nation's economy. A morning meeting of economic-related  ministers reflected "an atmosphere that the effect from the  yen's rise is extremely severe," Terasawa, director general of  the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a regular news  conference.    Terasawa declined to confirm that a monthly EPA report,  delivered at the meeting, indicates an official view that the  current economic slump is Japan's longest postwar downturn. The  report repeated the previous month's "generally sluggish"  assessment.    "It's in an extremely severe condition," with the economy  very difficult to predict, he said.    The report, like others from the Finance Ministry and the  Bank of Japan, reported some bright signs in such areas as  personal consumption but noted continuing declines in capital  spending.    The central bank, however, has recently indicated that  Japan's economic decline seems to be halting. But Terasawa said  the EPA has not changed its overall view or its judgment of  major economic factors.    He repeatedly stressed concern over the effects of the  higher  yen, which pummels Japan's export-reliant economy. He said he  told the morning economic ministers' meeting that rapid currency  movements hurt corporate sentiment and "cannot help but have a  minus effect on the economy."    Terasawa quoted Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno as  telling the meeting that rapid exchange rate movements are  "undesirable" and that rates should reflect economic  fundamentals.    Mieno noted the concerted dollar-boosting foreign exchange  market interventions by the U.S., Japanese, German and other  leading central banks in the past two weeks, according to  Terasawa.    Japan will continue to take "approriate steps at the  appropriate time in close contact with" other major industrial  nations, he quoted Mieno as saying.    Terasawa, who has experience on Wall Street with a major  Japanese brokerage, expressed hope that concerted interventions  would have "a large impact" on curbing the soaring yen. But he  cited political uncertainty as a big factor in the "speculative"  movements that he said have characterized recent jittery foreign  exchange trading.    Until problems like Japan-U.S. trade friction are resolved,  such uncertainty will continue to weigh on the market, Terasawa  said.    The recent interventions, especially one led by the U.S.  Federal Reserve last Wednesday, lifted the dollar from within a  whisker of its postwar record low of 100.40 yen, marked in Tokyo  last August.    But currency dealers wondered how effective the  interventions  will be and questioned Washington's commitment to supporting the  dollar.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sharply reversed the  U.S. tolerance for a high yen, saying the government does not  want "an undervalued currency." Last year, U.S. officials  repeatedly said the yen's rise would help curb Japan's trade  surplus.    On the Japanese economy, Terasawa quoted Mieno as noting  that  money supply growth remains slow and that despite recent rises  of longer-term market rates, overall interest rates remain  "extremely low."</p>

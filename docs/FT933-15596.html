			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Observer: Paragon unmasked The mystery is solved. The high-level clearing bank executive who works from dawn on Monday until 8pm on Friday, and gives 110 per cent of his time to the business, has been formally identified. Observer's interest had been aroused when the fax brought an anonymous excerpt from a bank's in-house magazine. It talked of a high-octane executive not only on the way to the office before other commuters got up, but then working so hard that he rarely saw his ballet-dancer wife - let alone his Georgian rectory, swimming pool, gymnasium, and dance studio. Could there really be a clearing banker like that? The answer is yes . . . and no. The paragon turns out to be David Beynon, new boss of Midland Bank Personal Financial Services. But he's not a pukka clearing banker. His main background is life-insurance selling, including 17 years with BAT's pushy Allied Dunbar until he undertook to turn Midland's infant bank assurance business into the market leader. But if it doesn't work out, his previous experience would seem to have given him a rare range of options. He has also been, among other things, a drama teacher, Flamenco guitarist and dustman.</p>

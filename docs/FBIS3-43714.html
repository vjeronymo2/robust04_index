			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The South African Police [SAP] has turned down a PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] request for a joint investigation into  the police raid on a PAC meeting in the Cape last week. A  teenage boy was killed when police opened fire on the crowd  which they say had stoned officers. The PAC had called for a  joint inquiry into police behavior during the raid, but reports  say police have sent a message to the organization's lawyer  saying no legal provision exists for a joint investigation. The  SAP says only peace officers can obtain statements, and that  other factors such as privilege and sub judice rule have to be  considered.</p>

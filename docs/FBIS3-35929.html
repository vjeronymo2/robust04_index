			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Abert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi January 31 TASS--A Georgian daily has for  the first time publicly voiced the idea to turn Georgia into a  federal state which can be assessed as a reconciliation hand  extended to the rebel region of Abkhazia.    "Taking into consideration the experience of other countries  and the current political situation it is necessary to recognise  the necessity of a federal structure of Georgia", the  Tbilisi-based "TEMI" (Assembly) newspaper said.    "Actually we are living today in a federative state without  a  federative constitution", it added.    The daily offered Germany as an example for the independent  federative Georgian state. It added that autonomous republics  had been artificially created in the former Soviet Union and  resulted in bloodshed after the Soviet collapse.    Georgia has three autonomies--Abkhazia, South Ossetia and  Adzharia. Only the latter succeeded to avoid a conflict.    Many Georgian politicians expressed similar ideas in  interviews with TASS. However, every time they asked not to be  named as the idea of federalism is assessed by the opposition as  betrayal of national interests.</p>

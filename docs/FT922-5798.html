			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Kawasaki Heavy slides KAWASAKI Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese shipbuilder, reported a sharp fall in operating profits because of foreign exchange losses and higher costs for construction of liquefied natural gas carriers. For the year to end-March, operating profits fell 21.7 per cent to Y32.8bn (Dollars 254.2m), in spite of a 4.4 per cent rise in sales to a record Y931.3bn. Pre-tax profits rose 0.2 per cent to Y20.5bn. After-tax profits fell 16.4 per cent to Y9.4bn because of a 58.6 per cent increase in tax to Y11.1bn. Kawasaki managed to recoup the fall in operating profits with the sale of securities, which rose by 2.7 times from Y5bn the previous year. For the current year Kawasaki expects shipbuilding growth to buoy revenue, and forecasts a 4.1 per cent increase in sales to Y970bn and a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y22.5bn.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (20): Follow your heart when you buy diamonds - Buy jewels because you want to wear them, not as an investment, and do not be afraid to ask questions A FINE jewel, precious, personal and romantic is likely to be one of the most emotional purchases of your life. Any advice that is purely hard-headed and practical would be a mistake: it may seem simplistic, but buying what you like most, not what you think you should like or what may be a good investment, is most likely to guarantee a 'good buy'. Part of the problem with buying precious jewellery, as opposed to say couture dresses or cars, is the dreaded investment element. To avoid disappointment, give up any thoughts of reselling on at a profit, at least for 100 years or so. On the whole, modern jewellery simply does not hold or increase its value, unless perhaps it is a particularly rare or unique precious stone. Buy for beauty, for indulgence, and buy the best quality you can afford. A little knowledge may be a dangerous thing, but many jewellers like customers to ask questions. They like giving information so that prospective buyers will know quality when they see it. David Morris of Conduit Street likes to explain everything to his clients. Today's buyers, he finds, are more aware and selective. Tiffany, famous but informal, prides itself on its commitment to the customer, and hands out booklets on How to Buy a Diamond and How to Buy a Pearl. The chief decision for the buyer lies between whether to go to a retailer or an individual designer jeweller. The safest route is to put yourself in the hands of professionals by going to a reputable, long-established retailer of fine jewels, who would not risk a hard-earned reputation by selling dubious goods and who will provide a good after-sales service. Daniel Reveyron of Boucheron in London has worked at the top end of the trade for 15 years and says that he cannot remember any genuine complaints about authenticity in the London trade. Long established companies survive for good reasons; a good name is not a licence to print money, it has to be earnt. A reputable retailer can be either your local jeweller, with an individual, up-to-date approach, selling the work of several different makers; an international independent such as David Morris; a single designer shop such as Lalaounis or Elizabeth Gage or one of the international jewel houses such as Cartier, Boucheron, Bulgari. At the sky-high end of the market, the new House of Graff in Bond Street is unique: the home of the world's rarest and most beautiful gemstones, woven into story book jewels for an elite clientele. It is as well to look carefully at as much jewellery as you can, (Harrods Fine Jewellery Room has many jewellers under one roof), find a salesperson you trust, try things on and ask as many questions as you like before making your choice. Consider carefully exactly which jewels suit your tastes, your budget, your clothes and lifestyle. Do you prefer all gold, matt or shiny, or gemstones, cabochons, deep and rich, or light, bright and sparkling? Reveyron finds that men buying jewellery for women often seldom think deeply enough about matching the jewellery to the woman they have in mind. If they have the cash it is almost ridiculously easy to buy. Alongside the formal gem-laden high jewellery, all jewel houses offer more fashionable, wearable ranges and often an even more casual, less expensive boutique range. Bulgari, aiming at a younger market, has recently launched a superbly scaled down versatile and affordable collection which starts at around Pounds 500. Tiffany, the least intimidating jeweller in Bond Street, is an excellent place to look and learn, with the widest possible choice of fine jewels by different designers from Peretti to Schlumberger, from under Pounds 100 to hundreds of thousands of pounds. The other alternative is to search out an individual designer-jeweller whose work you admire. Tracking them down is usually done by word of mouth, although the World Gold Council advises and direct customers with a specific brief. Most designers will happily weave their own style and skills around your ideas and themes, but be sure to see and understand a good working drawing before giving the final go ahead for the work. Since individuality and versatility are the keynotes of the fine jewellery market today, more retailers, such as Asprey and Boodle and Dunthorne, are offering the work of named designers such Leo de Vroomen, who creates classics in rich colours and enamels. It is not a good idea to try to buy your gemstones separately. Most gemstone dealers deal exclusively with the trade. Do not trust any 'bargains' offered on exotic holidays. The exception to this basic rule may be buying gems at auction which is becoming more and more popular. It is of course a case of buyer beware, but there are experts and gemmologists at hand to advise and direct and any expensive gem will have been tested and certificated by a gem laboratory. The stone could then be taken to a favourite jeweller to be incorporated into a design of your choice. This is also a good idea for any gemstone that you already own, perhaps set in a family jewel or in a tired, outdated piece. Most retailers provide a design service and prices for special commissions are not necessarily higher, although of course a one-off hand-made jewel will always cost more than a semi mass-produced line. Jewel fashions tend to move slowly. There is a definite trend away from blatantly cash-flashing jewels to quieter, more personal ornaments with an emphasis on good design and the art of the jeweller. Opulent fantasy is making a come back: look at the vivacious Verdura works of art or the exciting Rene Boivin collection at Garrard. Colour and more colour is the essence of design today: at the top end of the market coloured diamonds, especially the ravishing pink Argyle diamonds from Australia, have become a popular trend. Lower down the price scale all sorts of semi-precious stones, once looked down upon, are opening up wonderful design possibilities: there is a huge vogue for tanzanites, iolites, rubellites, citrine, tourmalines, amethysts and even amber. The fine jewellery market has responded to the recession and the growing popularity of costume jewellery with renewed creativity. It is slowly de-mystifying, conscious of providing value and service for a new, canny clientele and yet preserving all the artistry, romance and magic of the noble art of the jeweller.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice bloc,  has called on the Democratic Russia Movement to set up a  political alliance. Such a party could coordinate actions to  defend civil rights, counter communist and fascist propaganda,  and conduct election campaigns more effectively.    Interfax has learned that Yegor Gaydar notes in a letter  sent  to the leadership of Democratic Russia that the December  elections demonstrated what a broad base the conservatives and  right-wing radicals have in our country. The present wavering  government could kill the beginnings of stabilization and a new  spiral of crisis could open the way to power for forces that  would threaten Russia's very existence, Yegor Gaydar's message  says. He also stresses that given the circumstances, all  democratic forces needed to unite.</p>

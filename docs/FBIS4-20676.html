The conventional technology used for the removal is  consisted of coagulation, sedimentation and filtration systems.  However, when quality of raw water changes, the suspended solids  leak into filtered water, often fouling subsequent RO membrane  modules. If we can substitute conventional pretreatment system  with membrane separation technology, the subsequent RO fouling  will be eliminated and stable operation will become possible. At  the same time, system will also be simplified. However, there  have been no appropriate membrane modules applicable for the  pretreatment system, and very few attempts have been made to  replace the coagulation, sedimentation and filtration process  with membrane system.    We succeeded in developing a new spiral membrane module  which  can directly feed the raw water containing suspended solids. Due  to its construction with through water channels, this module is  applicable to the direct feeding of the raw water containing a  large quantity of suspended solids, promising the possible  development of its new applications. However, the requirement  for the application of this membrane separation technology to  water treatment is the reduction of operational cost, that is,  an increase in the filtration flux of the membrane module.    We studied how to increase the filtration flux from the  three  viewpoints: promotion of turbulent flow in raw water,  coagulation effect and membrane backwashing. As a result, we  found that intermittent membrane backwashing combined with  turbulent flow promotion is an effective means to maintain high  filtration flux of the membrane module.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   In the course of membrane filtration, cake layers or gel  layers are gradually formed on the membrane surface, decreasing  the filtration rate. The major task of our new membrane module  is to reduce the formation of cake layers on the membrane  surface and improve the filtration flux without increasing  energy consumption. Unless this task is achieved, it is  difficult to apply the membrane module despite the good quality  of filtered water. There are two physical solutions available;  one is a hydraulic solution to increase the mass transfer rate  by increasing crossflow velocity, and the other is to remove  cake layers by membrane backwashing. These two solutions have  been already put into industrial applications by improving  configuration and operation of membrane modules.    In the field of water treatment, a combination of individual  pretreatment processes (coagulation, sedimentation and  filtration system) has been employed to remove suspended solids  from raw water. If membrane separation technology can replace  all these processes, it will stabilize the quality of treated  water and minimize the installation area of pretreatment  systems. Using our newly developed membrane module to which raw  water can be fed directly, we studied the methods to obtain a  high filtration flux.    The results of our study on the operating conditions of the  membrane including crossflow velocity, backwashing and raw water  treatment for obtaining a high filtration flux, as well as the  results of experiments on the module using the raw water  containing a large quantity of suspended solids are summarized  below.  <H5>  2. Experiments </H5>   2.1 New Spiral Membrane Module    Spiral membrane module is widely used in the water treatment  system. By designing a unique feed spacer of corrugated  type[.sup]1[/] (Figure 1), we developed a new spiral  module[.sup]2,3[/] (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) to which raw  water containing suspended solids can be fed directly.  Ultrafiltration membrane is applied to remove colloidal matters  as well as suspended solids. Table 1 shows the operating  conditions when raw water is fed to the module.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-23A>      Figure 1.

For the conventional modules, cake  layers formed on the membrane surface can be dissociated by  backwashing, but the cakes are captured in the net spacers and  not discharged from the module. As a result, backwashing does  not work in the conventional membrane modules. Our newly  developed membrane module is equipped with corrugated spacers,  which can swiftly remove dissociated cakes from the module and  achieve favorable backwashing effect.    To verify the effect of corrugated spacer, we inserted the  spacer into a flat channel test cell (Figure 3) to simulate a  practical membrane module and conducted various experiments on  the cell. The test cell is made of transparent acrylic flat  channels (3mmH x 40mmW x 840mmL). Figure 4 is a schematic  drawing of the experimental system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-24A>      Figure 3. Schematic Illustration of Flat Channel Test </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-24B>       Figure 4. Schematic Drawing of the Experimental System </FIG>   <H5>  3. Results </H5>   3.1 Filtration Flux in Raw Water Containing Suspended  Solids    To study the turbulent flow promotion effect of the  corrugated spacer, we provided one section inserted with the  spacer and another without spacer in the test cell, and compared  the filtration flux of these sections in tap water. In addition,  to reproduce the raw water containing suspended solids, we  injected soft particles, KC Flock (W-100, dp = 77 m by  Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp Co., Ltd.) into tap water to make the  concentration of suspended solids to 2,100 mg/liter.    Figure 5 shows the time course change in the filtration  flux.  With or without the spacer, the membrane surface was colored to  light yellow and the filtration flux decreased gradually with  time. We injected KC Flock into the feed water after continuous  operation for 240 hours when the filtration flux decreased to  1.5 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Immediately after the  injection of the particles, filtration flux of the section  inserted with the spacer increased sharply and became stable at  2.2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. On the contrary,  filtration flux of the section without the spacer tended to  further decrease after the addition of particles.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-25A>      Figure 5. Filtration Flux in Raw Water Containing Suspended Solid </FIG>     The light yellow color changed immediately after the  injection of the particles in the section with the spacer, and  the white stripes reflecting the patterns of the spacer appeared  on the membrane surface. Those white stripes are the original  clean surface of the membrane. We assumed that the particles  injected into the feed water collided against the membrane  surface and dissociated the cake layers on the surface.    The corrugated spacer which promotes turbulent flow effect  is  effective to increase the filtration flux in the raw water  containing suspended solids. However, the turbulent flow  promotion effect of the spacer is not sufficient to increase the  filtration flux when tap water almost free of suspended solids  is fed. This is because tap water tends to precipitate metallic  hydroxides and allows formation of rigid cake layers on the  membrane surface.    3.2 Formation of Cake Layer in Tap Water    Figure 6 shows the time course change in the filtration flux  of the flat channel test cell inserted with spacer when tap  water was continuously fed. The filtration flux decreased with  time but became stable when it reached 1  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-25B>      Figure 6. Relationship Between Filtration Flux With Time in Tap Water </FIG>     It was observed that a large quantity of light yellow  gelatinous cakes adhered to the membrane surface. when the  filtration flux was stable, the UF membrane was taken from the  test cell for analysis. As shown in Table 2, the light yellow  gelatinous cakes were composed of inorganic substances whose  major components are iron and aluminum hydroxides and acid  resistant insolubles like silica, and organic substances at the  ratios of 77.5 percent and 22.5 percent respectively. Water  content of the cakes was 96 percent. Assuming the density of the  cakes as 1.0 g/cm[.sup]3[/], the cake layer was 0.56mm thick.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

More than 1  kg/cm[.sup]2[/], the filtration flux is hardly dependent on  the pressure and less affected by the crossflow velocity. In tap  water test, the gelatinous cake layers on the membrane surface  become so rigid and irreversible that hydraulic operation can  hardly dissociate them from the membrane surface.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-26A>      Figure 7. Relationship Between Filtration Flux and Operating Pressure in Tap Water Test </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-26B>      Figure 8. Relationship Between Filtration Flux and Crossflow Velocity in Tap Water Test </FIG>      3.3 Intermittent Operation and Filtration Flux    When the feed pump was stopped during the continuous feeding  and then started again, dissociation of a part of the gelatinous  cake layers from the membrane surface, and an increase in the  filtration flux were observed.    Figure 9 shows the results of filtration flux with time when  tap water was fed intermittently during pump-off period.  Increment of recovered filtration flux gradually diminished with  time, but in comparison with the filtration flux obtained under  continuous water feeding as shown in Figure 6, slightly higher  filtration flux was observed with the intermittent water feeding.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-27A>      Figure 9. Dependence of Filtration Flux on Time With Intermittent Operation </FIG>       Although recovery of the filtration flux was limited in the  intermittent operation alone, the result suggested improved  filtration rate by dissociation of cake layers.    3.4 Feeding Industrial Water to the Membrane Module    Examination of the experimental results discussed above  indicated hydraulic operation and membrane backwashing as the  important factors for obtaining a high filtration flux. To  verify the performance of the membrane module in the actual raw  water containing suspended solids, we fed the industrial water  heavily contaminated with organic substances to the newly  developed spiral module.    Figure 10 is the flow sheet of this experiment. As we  assumed  it was unlikely to obtain a high filtration flux by directly  feeding the industrial water, we injected poly-aluminum chloride  (PAC) into the raw water to coagulate suspended solids. Figure  11 shows the time course change in the filtration flux and the  pressure loss (_D_P: inlet pressure - outlet pressure).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-27B>      Figure 10. Process Flow Diagram for Industrial Water Test </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-28A>      Figure 11. Relationship Between Filtration Flux, Pressure </FIG>     Without pH adjustment, the filtration flux decreased with  time and was never stable. On the other hand, when pH was  adjusted in a range from 6.0 to 6.5, the optimum coagulating  condition for PAC, the flux was stable at 2  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Regardless of pH adjustment,  the pressure loss did not increase, which indicated the limited  growth of gelatinous cake layers on the membrane surface.    With the raw water like tap water containing less suspended  solids, membrane backwashing alone without pretreatment of raw  water was sufficient to obtain a high filtration flux. However,  in the case of industrial water, coagulation of suspended solids  was also required. We assume that PAC injection coagulated the  colloidal matters contained in the industrial water and  transformed them into suspended solids which were easily  filtrated since they did not adhere to the membrane surface.  <H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>   Using raw water such as tap water which hardly contained  suspended solids but tended to precipitate metallic hydroxides  and form rigid cake layers on the membrane surface, we studied  the operating conditions for producing a high filtration flux.  We also evaluated the performance of our newly developed module  using the industrial water heavily contaminated with organic  substances. We obtained the following findings:    (1) In the case of tap water, the cakes formed on the  membrane surface were compounds of inorganic substances mainly  composed of iron and aluminum hydroxides and organic substances.    (2) Membrane backwashing at low pressure hindered compaction  of the cakes, and combined with the hydraulic operation effect  caused by turbulent flow, a high filtration flux was maintained.    (3) Swelling of cakes before compaction was to dissociate  them from the membrane surface, and backwashing the membrane at  high pressure was not necessary.    (4) Even with the flat channels of the test cell and the  spiral membrane module in which corrugated spacers were  inserted, backwashing became possible by increasing the number  of membrane supports and distributing water load over the  surface.    (5) In the case of raw water such as industrial water  containing a large quantity of suspended solids, coagulation of  the colloidal matters to transform them into suspended solids  was required to obtain a high filtration flux.

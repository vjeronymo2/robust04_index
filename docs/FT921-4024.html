			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Adieu to monetary policy Monetary policy is primarily directed at the maintenance of sterling's parity within the exchange rate mechanism.' With 15 of these 16 unexciting words the chancellor yesterday confirmed officially what has been obvious for some time - that the government has largely abandoned monetary policy as a response to domestic conditions. UK interest rates are now set mainly in Europe, and that means Frankfurt. It is true that the chancellor's 16th word, 'primarily', offers a saving clause. So far as they are willing to support sterling from the reserves, the authorities can allow rates to ease to a point which runs mild risks with the exchange markets. Indeed, in recent weeks an average of about Dollars 10m a day has been spent to avoid following German rates up. That, however, is hardly what Mrs Thatcher would have called monetary sovereignty. It is true, too, that 'in common with all the major countries within the ERM', Mr Lamont did set a domestic monetary target; but it seems to have no practical meaning. Mr Nigel Lawson introduced the M0 target mainly because, unlike broader measures of money, it is quite a good short-term indicator, and tends not to misbehave. Indeed, no policy action has ever been taken to bring M0 under control or boost it. Mr Lawson was, in fact, stealthily claiming a free hand in monetary policy. Mr Lamont is using the same device to disguise the fact that he has almost no freedom. Similarly, he said that he would 'closely watch' the more traditional broad measures of money, and the trend of asset prices; but he did not indicate any action that he might take. The record suggests it is purely a spectator sport. This busy tax reformer seems bored with monetary policy. It is as if he had overlooked it until someone muttered the words of the drill sergeant watching his troops heading for oblivion: 'Say something, sir - even if it's only goodbye.'</p>

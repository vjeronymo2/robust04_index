			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President Ejup Ganic and  Foreign Affairs Minister Irfan Ljubijankic met with Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin today. In a statement before the meeting,  Cetin said that Turkey is pleased with the first step taken by  the Bosnians and Croats toward coexistence, the Washington  Agreement.    [Begin Cetin recording] We hope and wish, like Mr. Ganic  said, that the other link of this development is completed soon,  that is, that the Serbs also participate in this multiracial,  multireligious, and multicultural independent Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation. Turkey is continuing to conduct relations both with  the officials of Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the Croats. We are  also continuing to conduct a dialogue with the Serbs. [end  recording]    Ganic said: Without the participation of Turkish diplomacy,  it is impossible to achieve peace and stability in the Balkans.</p>

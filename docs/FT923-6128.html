			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Losses at Saab Auto cut by 20% SAAB Automobile, the car company jointly owned by Saab Scania and General Motors of the US, yesterday announced a 20 per cent reduction in financial losses in the second quarter of the year to SKr507m (Dollars 98m) compared with SKr634m for the same period of 1991. For the first half of the year as a whole the company suffered a loss of SKr800m, compared with SKr1.58bn for the same months of last year. Sales increased by 8 per cent to SKr8.05bn from SKr7.44bn. The figures suggest that the company, which was formed two-and-a-half years ago, is slowly pulling itself into profitability. Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, currently at GM's South African operations, starts work next Tuesday as the new chief executive, replacing Mr David Herman, who took up the top position at Adam Opel in Germany last month.</p>

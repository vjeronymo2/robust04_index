			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Comments by V. Zakharov, chairman of the Economic Committee </F> of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration; place and date not  given: "Oblast Economy Is in Alarming Situation" -- first two  paragraphs are YANTARNYY KRAY introduction published in boldface]    [Text] The results of the social and economic  development of our oblast in the first quarter of 1994 have been  summarized.    We have asked V. Zakharov, chairman of the Economic  Committee of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, to comment  on those results and make a prognosis for the near future.    "Comparing the situation in our oblast with that of the  northwestern region of Russia (Pskov, Novgorod, and Leningrad  Oblasts), it is worth noting that we achieved better results in  the production of consumer goods, in the volume of retail  commodity circulation, in cargo shipments, and in the financial  situation of enterprises. Also, Kaliningrad Oblast, in  comparison with Russia as a whole and with the above-mentioned  region, has a lower inflation rate. True, the situation in our  agricultural sector is worse.    "It should be said straightforwardly -- the social and  economic situation in our oblast is complex, contradictory, and  extremely unstable. In spite of this, we have been able to  reduce the rate of consumer price increases from 15-16 percent,  in the first quarter of 1993, to 10-12 percent in the first  quarter of 1994. The production of sausage, cheese, whole-milk  products, and margarine has also increased. Taking into account  the cost of 19 basic foodstuffs in April, Kaliningrad occupies  69th place among over 120 Russian cities. Over 45,000  apartments were privatized by our residents. We have more than  700 joint ventures with a total capital of 6.5 million Russian  rubles [R].    "Along with this, industrial production, as compared to that  in the corresponding period of 1993, dropped 41 percent. The  slump in the fuel industry amounted to 8 percent; the food  industry -- 17; electricity production -- 22; building materials  -- 47; pulp-and-paper industry -- 48; light industry -- 58; and  machine-building -- 78. The smallest drop was registered in  those branches which satisfy the needs for electricity, fuel,  and food. The other branches of the national economy suffered  an unprecedented drop in production.    "The main problems in industry and other branches of the  national economy, as well as in the entire sphere of material  production, are the following: a crisis in the realization of  products, curtailment of manufacturing or undertaking  activities, nonpayments, a high level of hidden unemployment,  and inflation. The reduction of jobs should be specified  separately. At certain enterprises, jobs were reduced by 22-43  percent. This refers especially to the machine-building sector.  At the same time, the number of jobs increased at  `Kaliningradmorneftegas,' the `Pregol' ship-repair yard,  `AGA-GAS' joint stock companies, and `Yantarenergo.' Employment  also increased at enterprises in the building, butter- and  cheese-processing, milk-processing, and chemical industries.  Thus, a tendency toward transferring labor from one enterprise  to another has begun to show. Still -- and I will repeat myself  -- the general situation in unemployment is very serious. At  the current time, unemployment benefits are being paid to 6,500  people.    "An alarming situation can also be seen in the agricultural  sector. The number of livestock decreased by 12 percent, the  production of meat -- by 22 percent. For example, in  Krasnoznamensk and Chernyakhovsk rayons, the production of meat  dropped by over 40 percent. Last year's level of production was  only preserved in Gusev and Bagrationovsk rayons. The  production of milk in the first quarter of 1994, as compared to  that of the corresponding period last year, dropped by 24  percent. Difficult problems are also facing the 1994 harvest.  As of the middle of April, it was necessary to sow over 100,000  hectares of farmland, including winter crops.    "Briefly about the financial situation of enterprises. The  cost effectiveness in industry amounted only to 17.5 percent.  Notwithstanding the fact that this index is higher than the  average for Russia, enterprises -- due to inflation -- will fail  to reach the break-even point. Their debt liabilities amount to  R130 billion and in credits -- R144 billion (as of 1 April). At  the same time, various financial operations carried out by  enterprises involve over R15 billion, which is not connected  with basic production activities. As of 1 April, the debts of  agricultural enterprises to banks amounted to R13 billion. At  the same time, significant sums are owed to agricultural  producers by the food-processing industry.    "Now, about the prognosis for the next three months and the  half year as a whole. The main problems in the branches of  material production will remain the same as before: sales,  nonpayments, a high level of hidden unemployment, lack of  turnover means, and halts in production at enterprises.  Disruptions in paying wages and a growing tendency toward  barter deals will follow. A fall in industrial production will  continue. If the problem of nonpayments is resolved by some  means, a certain surge in production may be expected. The  volume of agricultural production will be around 10-15 percent  lower than last year.    "The oblast budget will suffer with ever-increasing  expenditures connected with the increase in enrollment of the  housing sector as well as facilities of social and cultural  sphere on the balance sheets of municipalities. Real incomes of  the population, as it seems, will be reduced by 10-15 percent in  comparison with the first quarter of 1994. A share of expenses  for municipal services and foodstuffs will increase in the  structure of consumption. An increase in consumer prices will  continue. The inflation rate at the end of May and in  June-July, in my opinion, will amount to 15-20 percent due to  the lack of state credits and repayments of debts to the state.  However, there is a danger in that. If the experience with the  reckoning of nonpayments and currency emissions is to be  repeated, the inflation rate in the third quarter may reach  45-50 percent.</p>

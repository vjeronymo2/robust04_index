			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICKING WINNERS BETTER THAN A WINNING PICKER  </P> <P> Your improved horse racing coverage is good, and I like Bob Mieszerski, but the  "Betting With Bob" feature has got to go.  </P> <P> As any handicapper can tell you, a $30 win parlay on two odds-on horses is not  artful betting.  </P> <P> I'd sooner invest in a money-market CD. I'd have profits, lower risk, and  probably even more excitement.  </P> <P> BOB HERR, North Hollywood  </P></p>

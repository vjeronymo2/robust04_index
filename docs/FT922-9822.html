			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: Nations in glass houses - On an international yardstick, it is difficult to uphold the charge of racism against the US The predictable effect of last week's riots in Los Angeles has been an outbreak of smug comments on the US in the rest of the world. Early off the mark was President Francois Mitterrand of France. 'It's very nice,' he said in a radio interview on Friday, 'to promote capital, profits and investment in business, but these riots show that the social needs of any country must not be neglected . . . George Bush is a generous man, who embodies an extremely conservative political ideology, and American society is conservative and economically capitalist. Here are some of the results of that.' Well, I suppose that was just too tempting an opportunity for a Socialist president with his back to the wall to pass up. But Americans are not likely to be much impressed by homilies from that quarter. 'We haven't just had a 14 per cent vote for a neo-fascist party,' was one comment I heard from an American conservative analyst. 'You should see the riots they'd have in Paris if 35 per cent of the population belonged to minorities,' was another, from a Francophile middle-of-the-road lawyer. Nor will Americans be unduly worried by the Egyptian newspaper, Al-Ahram, which asked whether the Libyan Lockerbie suspects could expect a fair trial in the US, in the light of the Rodney King verdict. But Mr Roger Wilkins, the distinguished black historian who helped shape the Johnson administration's response to the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965, is happy to endorse the remark of a Japanese official quoted in the Washington Post: 'There are black people who really have no future, who are completely left over . . . The trend of US society was almost to forget about them.' And a thoughtful political analyst like Mr Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute foresees that the image of itself that America has just projected will be seized on by Third World dictators who are the targets of American criticism. 'There are going to be a lot of potshots at the US,' he said, 'and Americans will not take kindly to that.' Two main charges can be levelled at the US on the basis of last week's events. The first is a very specific one of racism, reflected in the unwillingness of a white jury to convict four white policemen whom the entire nation had seen savagely beating and kicking a prostrate black man, in an amateur video repeatedly shown on television. The second is a more general one, of being a callous, socially divisive and violence-prone society, in which such an incident can set a whole city on fire, causing 55 deaths and billions of dollars worth of damage. Both charges are true, but if an international yardstick is used, the charge of racism is the harder of the two to sustain. Most black Americans clearly believe, no doubt with reason, that they are consistently targeted for harassment and maltreatment by the police. But so do most members of racial minorities in western Europe, and no doubt in Japan as well. What is striking to a British visitor is how many of the police, including police chiefs in many of the big cities, are themselves black - as indeed are many of the mayors. Of course the fact that Mayor Tom Bradley is black did not prevent what happened in Los Angeles, but much of the blame has been laid at the door of its white police chief, Mr Daryl Gates, both for the general atmosphere prevailing in the Los Angeles police department, and for the specific failures which occurred last week. Mr Gates had in fact been fired from his job before the acquittals were announced (he is to be replaced by a black from Philadelphia with a liberal reputation), and appears to have been virtually on strike. Perhaps he was as surprised as everyone else by the trial verdict, but surely contingency plans should have been made. Some of the anger might have been blunted if all the accused had been dismissed from the force as soon as the verdict was announced - even if their conduct was not criminal, it has been repeatedly and officially declared a gross violation of proper professional procedures; and prompt deployment of police in the right places might have deterred many of the rioters. Instead, Mr Gates went off to a fund-raising event for a movement to oppose police reform. Anyway, it was striking that the riots did not spread to many other cities, and particularly not to New York and Washington where it might have been expected. Both cities have black mayors who issued firm and clear statements deploring the verdicts but warning against any violence. None of this implies, of course, that racism is not widespread or even endemic in American society. My point is that, unfortunately, this is true of almost all industrialised societies with large ethnic minorities, and that the US since the 1960s has done more than most to combat it. Urban poverty and squalor are not unique to America either. The problems of homelessness, drug addiction and chronic unemployment are all too familiar in Europe's large cities. Where America sadly does lead the industrialised world is in the level of violence, and in the enormous disparity between rich and poor. No doubt the absence of gun control and President Reagan's tax policies respectively go far to explain those two points. 'Most Americans,' writes Prof Mohamed Rabie in a recently published book*, 'claim and honestly believe that they are living today in the most civilised society ever when, in fact, living in the United States probably means living in one of the most violent and least secure societies in modern times.' Part of the explanation is that much of the crime and violence is confined to the inner cities, or to certain districts of them, from which the middle class (including middle-class blacks) has completely removed itself. Mr Rabie recounts the telling case of the director of the budget office of a big city, who not only lived outside the city jurisdiction but in 30 years' service had never even made a telephone call to the district where drugs and crime were most prevalent. What can be done? Liberals urge social programmes to provide jobs, better health care, better schools and pre-school Head Start programmes for disadvantaged children. Conservatives, led by Mr Jack Kemp, the housing and urban development secretary, urge a package of tax breaks and other measures to encourage investment in inner cities and give incentives to the urban poor to take jobs, save money and acquire their own homes. President Bush instinctively distrusts the former approach (held to have been tried and failed in the 1960s and 1970s), and gives only lukewarm support to the latter, which is bogged down in the general wrangle with Congress over the budget. Both remedies are victims of the US's political and fiscal impasse, and last week's shock may not be enough to give either of them high enough priority to make much difference. What can be safely predicted, though, is the reinforcement of the already strong feeling that America needs to look after its own, and that the rest of the world can now look after itself. *The New World Order: a Perspective on the Post-Cold War Era (Vintage, Dollars 16.95).</p>

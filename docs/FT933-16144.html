			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Rome cuts rate after wage accord THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut its discount rate by a full percentage point to 9 per cent, the lowest level since 1976. The cut, effective from today, follows the four-year pact agreed on Saturday between employers and trade unions on wages and working conditions. The agreement also enabled Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, to leave for the Tokyo G7 summit with clear evidence of his government's determination to hold down inflation and tackle the public sector deficit. Mr Ciampi had set Saturday as the deadline for Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, and the three trade union confederations to resolve the issue. The agreement is Mr Ciampi's first important achievement since taking office two months ago. Nevertheless, the outcome still leaves Italy with the most rigid labour system in the EC. The wage element in Italy's high labour costs may now tend downwards but other aspects - such as social security, pensions and job security  - are scarcely affected. However, the deal is a compromise with many unresolved aspects. The most important is how to tackle employers' demands to avoid matching a rise in social security contributions on a wage increase above the national minimum. This issue had been one of the sticking points in the talks and had to be left out of the agreement. As a result the agreement will not be signed until July 22. This will give Mr Ciampi time to produce a proposal, probably based on offering tax concessions against the extra cost of social security contributions. The union leadership will also have time to test the reaction of its members, who could be hostile. Within the framework of a four-year pact, the trade union leadership has accepted that wages cannot match inflation and that increases must be linked to productivity. This endorses the parlous state of Italy's public finances and company profitability. Another union concession has been to drop opposition to the principle of temporary employment and lower starting salaries. Acceptance of lower starting salaries is the first step towards breaking down labour rigidities. In return for union concessions, the government has agreed to speed benefits applied to workers who are temporarily laid off and to extend lay-off payments to small companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary on the Two Sessions" column by staff reporter </F> Pi Shuyi (4122 2855 5030): "Curbing Inflation: The Focal Point  of This Year's Macroregulation and Control"]    [Text] In view of the operations of China's economic  juggernaut, deputies and members of the NPC and CPPCC are filled  with both joys and worries.    They are overjoyed at the 13.4 percent increase in the GNP  last year, which totalled 3 trillion yuan, but are worried about  last year's 13 percent rise in retail prices, which are expected  to go up again in January and February of this year.    While pledging to maintain fairly rapid economic growth, the  encouraging "Report on Government Work" has also urged keeping  this year's price rise below 10 percent. All NPC and CPPCC  deputies and members have agreed during the sessions that  curbing inflation will be the focus of this year's macroeconomic  control and regulation.  <H5>  An Imperative Matter </H5>   Commodity prices are of great importance to the people's  livelihood and to all sectors of our social life.    Shaanxi deputy Pang Jiayu indicated that commodity  prices are a sensitive issue. Liaoning deputy Bo  Xilai believed that commodity prices are one of the major  concerns to the masses. CPPCC member Shi Ningsun  said: Curbing inflation has become a matter of prime importance  in our current effort to maintain social stability and to ensure  healthy national economic development.    Though in different terms, they have all revealed the  urgency  of curbing inflation.    The rapid rise in commodity prices reflects the relatively  tight conditions of economic operation, and also contains a  latent crisis of economic turbulence. CPPCC Member Shi Ningsun  noted: Alarm has been sounded in China's economy, and failure  in imposing macrocontrol and regulation will probably lead to  runaway inflation and economic stagnation.    Runaway inflation is harmful to the interests of the masses  and will also give rise to social conflicts. This year is a  vital year for reform, and there is a great need for a stable  social environment. CPPCC member Zhao Changbai is  correct when he says: No matter how good our system and policies  are, we will find it difficult to push forward reform without a  stable social environment.    The general goal of the government's macroeconomic control  and regulation is to maintain a balanced supply and demand,  optimize the economic structure, guide the economy to attain a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development, and bring about  comprehensive social progress. Under this general goal, the  focus and concrete targets of macroeconomic control and  regulation will be different during each period in light of  different foci of conflicts. We may stress growth during one  period, and emphasize structural readjustment or curbing  inflation during another. It is imperative to focus our efforts  on curbing inflation at present, as the economy has kept growing  for several years and the threats posed by runaway inflation are  more alarming.  <H5>  Meeting Difficulties Head On </H5>   It is no easy task to keep the price rise below 10 percent.    CPPCC member Zhang Shirao considered it a  formidable task. He cited several factors leading to price  rises: Commodity prices began to rise since the end of last  year; a number of new policies have been and will be put  forward, such as readjustments in grain prices; unpredictable  factors, for example rises in grain prices also cause rises in  the prices of over 1,000 commodities; and spontaneous price  rises.    A train running at full speed will produce great inertia.  CPPCC member Wang Shiying pointed out that 1993's  newly added investment, new projects, and newly issued  currencies will continue to cause price rises in 1994.    CPPCC member Zhao Haikuan dwelled on the  difficulty in terms of mechanisms: One, macroeconomically,  credit funds are growing too fast, while microeconomically,  firms are still hobbled by clogged mechanisms. As a result,  everybody is lining up for loans, whether business operations  are sound or not. Two, the change in government functions is  yet to have any real effect. With local governments in charge  of the economy, everybody wants to get ahead as quickly as  possible, creating enormous inflationary pressure. Three,  checks on consumption funds remain too soft, and governments and  enterprises are still spending money as if it were from the  "same big pot."    In a certain sense, checks against inflation are a  double-edged sword. Liaoning deputy Li Shaozhou  said: Inflation comes with economic growth and can be said to  be the price for economic development, and therefore, cannot be  completely eradicated. If inflation is kept artificially low,  economic growth will slow, the market will become weak, and  there will be underemployment and more unemployment, all of  which are equally bad for social stability. At present, one of  the keys to curbing inflation is to identify the point of  critical balance between curbing inflation and maintaining  economic growth.    The "Government Work Report" suggested a 9 percent economic  growth rate for this year, while stabilizing the inflation rate  at 10 percent. Some deputies and members agreed that the two  objectives are reasonable and interconnected. A not-low  economic growth rate and a not-high inflation rate -- it will be  remarkable if the state can achieve that.    A market economy requires macroregulation and control, which  demands a great deal of expertise. It differs completely from  the traditional planned economy and needs to be probed and  tried. An explicit announcement of stabilizing price rises at  the 10 percent level indicates government's confidence and  competence to meet the difficulties head on.  <H5>  Ready With "Two Hands" </H5>   Deputies and members were all confident in achieving the 10  percent target and offered their ideas.    The rapid price increases were mainly caused by excessive  investment and monetary supply. To curb inflation, it is  necessary to plug this fountainhead, which means strict controls  over the scale of investment, monetary supply, and credit scale.  Some deputies and members suggested powerful economic means  with discretionary administrative means with which to keep these  three supplies under control.    Macroregulation and controls for the market economy do not  exclude necessary administrative measures, especially at a time  of "changing rails," when the market mechanism is still unsound  and a new macroregulatory and control system is not in place,  occasioning the need for a larger dose of administrative  measures. Only we must pay attention to the laws of the market  and refrain from institutionalizing administrative measures.  CPPCC member Fei Yuefeng said: The primary thing to do in  curbing inflation is to control the volume of monetary supply,  though the control must work through the laws of the market  economy.    There is no doubt that the present anti-inflationary  measures  still treat only the symptoms. To curb inflation at its root  cause, we still have to rely on deepening reforms. The  deep-seated factors responsible for excessive investment and  monetary supply were caused by irrational investment, finance,  taxation, banking, and firm structures, restraint-free  microeconomic behavior, and unscientific macroeconomic behavior.    Heilongjiang deputy Lin You believed that macroregulation  and  control must be aimed at both symptoms and underlying causes.  The measures must be firm in treating symptoms and active in  tackling underlying causes. The attacks on the symptoms and  underlying causes must reinforce each other. When problems  worsen, firm measures are called for to deal with the symptoms,  which incidentally are creating conditions for solving  underlying causes. We must take on the root causes when the  symptoms diminish. Only thus can we enjoy long-term stability  and prevent relapses.    This year, the central authorities have not only proposed  strengthening macroregulatory and control measures, but also  those for structural reforms in finance, taxation, and banking.  As long as we can insist on combining the treatment of symptoms  with that of underlying causes, and economic means with  administrative measures, there is great hope that we can achieve  the objective of curbing inflation.</p>

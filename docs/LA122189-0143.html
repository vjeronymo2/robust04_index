			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW JUDGE HAS SMOKING HISTORY BUT THAT DOESN'T PUT COUNTY OUT OF JOINT  </P> <P> Mendocino County's first Municipal judge is a lawyer who freely admitted that  he had smoked marijuana in the past.  </P> <P> But then so did the other two finalists for the $82,000-a-year judicial post in  the Northern California county renowned for growing pot.  </P> <P> "I think that the experience will make better judges of them," said Mendocino  County Supervisor Norman de Vall. "I think it brings a sense of reality into  the courtroom."  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors, by a 3-2 vote Tuesday, chose Kirk Gustafson, 45, of  Willits as the new judge over attorneys George Nelson and John Behnke.  </P> <P> The three finalists were selected from a list of 16 applicants to fill the post  created from a consolidation of existing justice courts.  </P> <P> A call-in survey by a local radio station found that residents, by a margin of  3 to 1, did not oppose a judge simply because he had smoked marijuana at one  time.  </P></p>

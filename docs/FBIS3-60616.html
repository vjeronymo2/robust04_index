			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Dec. 3 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors adjourned its meeting  Friday after it had agreed on the need for urgent action to help  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    Unless Pyongyang takes positive measures, including the  acceptance of IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, the  North Korean nuclear issue will cease to be a subject of  negotiations but a target of action by the international  community.    During Friday's session, the United States and France  expressed grave concern over the possibility of the use of  nuclear materials by North Korea for the development of weapons.    They said their countries will have to take strong follow-up  measures, including reference of the issue back to the United  Nations Security Council.    Nelson Sieverling, U.S. [IAEA] governor, said that if North  Korea does not accept IAEA inspection at an early date, there  would not be a third round of high-level U.S.-North Korean  talks. The United States will have no choice but to refer the  issue to the U.N. Security Council, he said.    Sieverling made the remark after expressing grave concern  over a report by IAEA Director-general Hans Blix that the IAEA  could not give a "meaningful assurance" to the governors that  North Korea was using nuclear materials only for peaceful  purposes.    The United States would not only continue its negotiations  with North Korea but also have to refer the question to the U.N.  Security Council if IAEA inspections are not taking place in  North Korea and continuity of nuclear safeguards is maintained,  he said.    But the situation has not yet reached the point where it  could not be turned around, Sieverling said, urging North Korea  to accept the IAEA's routine inspections as soon as possible.    The French Governor urged the IAEA to convene another Board  of Governors meeting before its regularly scheduled one next  year to work out countermeasures if there is no progress in the  issue.    It is necessary, he said, for the international community to  take strong action including sanctions against North Korea by  referring the question to the U.N. Security Council.    The governor from Switzerland criticized the North Korean  argument of "special circumstances" and urged Pyongyang to  immediately and completely implement its nuclear safeguards  agreement.    Governors of other countries also shared their opinion that  time was running out on North Korea for the resolution of its  nuclear issue and all criticized Pyongyang in firm and  unprecedented tones.    Against these remarks, North Korea's ambassador to Vienna,  Yun Ho-chin, repeated his country's old rhetoric that the issue  had been raised by "some officials of the IAEA Secretariat" and  that it was controlled behind-the-scenes by the United States.    Therefore, he said, responsibility in the North Korean  nuclear issue rests entirely on the IAEA and the United States.    The nuclear question would be automatically solved once the  United States and North Korea worked out the so-called package  deal aimed at improving bilateral relations, he said.    Continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea or any  damage  in the IAEA's surveillance mechanism also rested with the IAEA  because the IAEA had refused to conduct inspections, Yun said.    Ronald Walker, chairman of the Board of Governors, in  summary, stated the board's complete support for handling of the  question by the IAEA Secretariat and the director-general.    While urging North Korea to accept IAEA inspections, Walker  expressed concern over proliferation in North Korea's  non-compliance of nuclear safeguards. North Korea's refusal to  accept IAEA inspections has to be regarded as a challenge to the  entire nuclear non-proliferation regime, he added.    Walker asked Blix to report the Board of Governors' position  to the United Nations.</p>

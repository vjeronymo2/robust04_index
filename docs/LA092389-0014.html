			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL AND '22 COWARDLY ACTS'  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "Judgment Day on Firearms," I submit that its  style should be criticized even more than its substance.  </P> <P> Since I'm a gun owner and a life member of the NRA, it's obvious that your  editorial staff is no more going to change my gun views than I'm going to  change its gun views. However, what really galls me is your strong penchant for  name-calling, such as "small band of zealots," "cowards," etc. In this  connection, one thing I learned by taking debating in college is that if your  opponent has no facts or logic at his or her command, he or she will invariably  engage in histrionics, playing to the grandstand, complete fabrications, and  name-calling, and lose the debate decisively.  </P> <P> Finally, with regard to the Second Amendment, how long -- oh, how long -- is it  going to take your editorial staff to learn to read and understand the  following crucial words: " . . . The right of the people to keep and bear arms,  shall not be infringed!" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, The Times' editorial staff  does not corner the market on common sense, as it insinuates.  </P> <P> ROBERT V. VAN de WALLE  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

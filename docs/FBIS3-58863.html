We want to play a  leading role, too, with our own style and standards, and a  loyalty to our origins." The People's Party had been in  existence for a couple of hours -- from 1610 [1510 GMT] on 18  January 1994, to be precise, 75 years after don Sturzo's appeal  "to free and strong men." Mino Martinazzoli, speaking softly,  with head bowed, as though looking within himself, but without  foregoing his recherche vocabulary, explained to the small group  of guests -- the most prominent of whom were the speakers of the  Senate and the lower house, Spadolini and Napolitano -- that the  new PPI [Italian People's Party] is the sole heir to don Sturzo  and De Gasperi and therefore to the DC [Christian Democratic  Party], which no longer exists, as of yesterday afternoon.    Proud and stubborn to the point of standing alone at a time  when those who remain alone are in danger of disappearing from  the political map, Martinazzoli supported his challenge with an  argument that it will be up to the voters to either approve or  disapprove: "Our ideas," he said, "are still fresh and current."    Martinazzoli can see trouble on the political horizon. He  described a scenario "laden more with cynicism than with  civility, full of masks and disguises." A time when there is "a  split between ordinary society, the parties, and the state, the  consequent threat looms of a political vacuum, and of the decay  of our moral unity."    In this grim scenario, Martinazzoli threw down a challenge.  This, without concealing the fact that "we do not have many  chances of being reborn; we have only one." The PPI presents  itself as a center party, "in line with a lofty philosophy of  moderation, which is anything but moderatism, neutrality, or a  conservative spirit." This citing of "moderation" embodied all  Martinazzoli's antipathy for politics understood as a contest  between a right and a left. "We," the People's Party leader  proclaimed, "reject the logic of blocs, the radicalization of  the contest, or the short-cut method of the face-lift. Since we  reject the idea of the closed party, we therefore deny that this  rationale can be transferred now to a broader but equally rigid  ideological juxtaposition or to an artificial contest between  cartels labeled in accordance with some vacuous mannerism. We  are seeking, rather, points of contact consistent with our own  identity and proposals, within the context of the liberal and  democratic tradition."    In fact, the meeting with [Pact for Italy leader] Mario  Segni  took place a while ago, and there will be no more before the  elections -- no accord with the League, no understanding with  Berlusconi, nor, still less, with the band of neocentrists who  formed another party only a matter of hours earlier. The PPI  will face the test of the elections supported only by its  alliance with Segni, because what the League offered "was more  of a death notice than an alliance." Martinazzoli met with  [League ideologue] Maroni, because "I wanted to know what form  this alliance would take in the electoral context. The answer  was that in Lombardy the League would keep all the votes that  they already have and would field their own candidates in every  constituency. It was said -- with something of a smile, to tell  the truth -- that the alliance would be on these terms: the  League in the North and the DC in the South. That seemed to me  like a death notice." Therefore "it is necessary to acknowledge  the impossibility of a dialogue with the League. The offer of  an alliance that it is making would be tantamount -- no more, no  less -- to accepting the PPI's disappearance in the North, and  that is unacceptable."    But Segni is about to meet with Maroni. Is the pact with  Martinazzoli already facing some danger? The People's Party  leader clarified one thing right away: "The rules that apply to  us in our relations with the other political groupings also  apply to the rationale behind our relations with Segni." This  was an explicit warning: If Segni forges agreements with the  League, the agreement with Martinazzoli will be broken.    Having closed the door to the right, is Martinazzoli  perhaps thinking about opening negotiations with the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left], maybe after the elections, with  a view to forming a government? He was very reserved on this  subject. "It is clear," Martinazzoli replied, "that there is no  possibility of an alliance with an interlocutor that is itself  building another alliance. If I read the situation correctly,  they are sending me messages via the newspaper headlines, while  inviting the others to negotiations. That is a very different  matter. In any case, I would have declined an invitation,  because I do not believe that our role is to accede to one side  or the other, as though we were some insignificant entity." But  what will the PPI do after the elections? " We do not know what  kind of parliament we will have after the elections. What we do  afterward will depend on how much strength the voters grant us  in a situation in which I no longer enjoy any consensus from  before. We are contesting the elections for the first time, and  we shall see what our dimensions and our strength prove to be.  On that basis we will determine our political and parliamentary  orientations."    The electoral verdict will say whether Martinazzoli has won  or lost his gamble, and will also say how many votes  [neocentrists] Casini and Mastella have taken away from him.  For the present, there were only a few words for the newly  departed neocentrists: "Farewells, which are themselves painful,  do not need to be combined with rebukes and criticisms. This  will be my attitude, which will also be a wait-and-see  attitude." He will wait and see, but "if they have left because  they do not want to do what we are doing, I would like to know  how I could have them back immediately afterward."    Be that as it may, Martinazzoli will not contest the  elections himself, because he has decided not to stand for  reelection and will remain as People's Party leader "certainly  not beyond the first congress." According to Martinazzoli, it  is indeed "a contradiction in terms, in a parliamentary  democracy, for a party secretary not to be a member of  parliament." The congress will be held after the elections:  "The imminence of the elections, which have implications for us  regarding our very existence, does not permit us to hold a  congress right away. We will do so immediately afterward."    The PPI is newly born. As De Mita left, he was asked if it  was a good day for him, too. After a moment's thought, he  replied: "Yes." Then, after a further pause, he smiled, and  added: "I thought about it before saying so."</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: Coconuts crack tool coating - Worth Watching The coconut could prove to be one of the industrial diamond's best friends. Researchers in Germany have developed a novel way to diamond-coat tools and components based on the hydrogasification of charcoal. The best results have been obtained with charcoal from coconut shells. Unlike conventional hydrogasification processes, the method developed at the Frauhofer-Institute for Surface Engineering and Thin Films uses a closed circuit, preventing the escape of gas. The process is therefore kinder to the environment. Frauhofer-Institute: Germany, 40 5472 1860.</p>

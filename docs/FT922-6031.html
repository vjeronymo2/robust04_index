			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / S&amp;P gloomy on US property losses STANDARD &amp; POOR's, the credit rating service, yesterday offered a gloomy assessment of the likely impact on US banks of loan losses from the depressed US commercial property market. The S&amp;P study warned that notwithstanding improved first-quarter 1992 earnings at a number of US banks, the worst was not yet over. S&amp;P said it believed 'that the problem loan workout period will be protracted and that the losses will have a long tail, reaching substantially higher levels than they have to date'. The report sought to dispel the idea that the effect of the worldwide property depression on the US banking industry was waning. The recent bankruptcy filings by Olympia &amp; York of Canada were cited by S&amp;P as 'a vivid confirmation that real estate (property) markets have not begun to recover or stabilise'. Senior US bank executives have said in recent months they expect the level of bad debt provisions caused by commercial property loans to remain at the same level this year as in 1991. But the S&amp;P report claimed that reserves at many banks are not yet adequate to cover prospective commercial property losses. S&amp;P predicted that 'the overhang of losses will continue to be a significant drain on (banking) industry earnings over the next few years'. The report said that S&amp;P's outlook for bank ratings remains stable, with several banks unlikely to receive a ratings upgrade in the near term. S&amp;P cited the experience of banks in Texas during the late 1980s property slump as a worst-case scenario, and noted that loan write-offs at some Texas institutions reached the level of 30 per cent of commercial property loan portfolios. The ratings service described as 'disturbing' that the level of non-performing property loans at New York City banks was reaching the 40 per cent range. Loan losses would not be as high in other regions as they were in Texas and the southwest, and should represent about 15 per cent of the original loan portfolio value of most banks. The loan losses could, however, reach the level of 25 per cent of outstanding property loans at some banks, S&amp;P said.</p>

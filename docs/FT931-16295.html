			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean miners plan to dig deeper for gold profits - Two big projects are set to reverse the region's output decline of recent years GOLD PRODUCTION in the Caribbean Basin, which has been declining in recent years, is set to increase significantly through two major projects at opposite ends of the region. The government of the Dominican Republic is soon to approve one of three competing bids from foreign companies to construct facilities for mining low-grade transitional gold deposits sandwiched between now exhausted oxide layers and the richer sulphide deposits below. To the south, production has started this month at a major gold mine owned by two Canadian companies and the Guyana government. Production from the new mine will see Guyana's national output increasing four-fold next year. Production in the Dominican Republic has been declining steadily over the past decade as the country's oxide deposits have approached exhaustion. The state-owned producer, Rosario Dominicana, invited bids from the foreign companies for constructing facilities for exploiting transitional deposits at Pueblo Viejo in the country's north. From an original slate of six, the government has short-listed three companies - Davy McKee of the UK, Minproc Engineering of Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrade Gutierrez of Brazil. They have estimated the cost of the project between USDollars 200m and Dollars 248m, and anticipate gold production between 1,100 and 1,200 troy ounces a day. Government officials say that the fall in gold production from 412,991 ounces in 1981 to 110,000 ounces last year, caused by exhaustion of the traditional oxide deposits, has created the need for access to the lower sulphide ores. They say that exploiting the transitional zone, which will be worked for about three years, will allow access to sulphide deposits which will be exploited for the subsequent 25 years. About 5m tonnes of ore will be worked in the transitional zone, and the anticipated yield is put by Rosario representatives at three times that of the traditional oxide zone. These sulphide deposits have recently been estimated to be 100m tonnes. The mining of the transitional deposits is also expected to reverse the decline in the country's silver production. The three companies bidding for the contract estimate that silver production could be between 2,300 and 3,500 ounces a day. In Guyana, production has started at the new mine in Omai District, said by Guyanese officials to be among the larger mines in South America. The mine is expected to produce 1.9m ounces of gold over the next 10 years. Cambior of Montreal owns 60 per cent of the Omai mine, with Golden Star Resources, also of Canada, holding 35 per cent and the Guyana government the remainder. The mine's milling rate will be 13,000 tonnes a day, with gold output next year projected at 280,000 ounces. Annual production in the first three years is expected to average 255,000 ounces a year, with the mine's operating cost averaging Dollars 185 per ounce. Production is projected to fall to 40,090 ounces in 2003, the last operational year of the mine. The capital cost of the project is Dollars 152m, and Cambior reported that Dollars 120m of this was raised by the company through a syndicated 330,000 ounce gold loan. There was apparently concern initially among the Canadian investors about the investment climate in Guyana, although the government in recent years has moved dramatically from a policy of state control of the economy and has invited foreign investors. Cambior said it had obtained foreign investment insurance coverage of Dollars 163m from the Export Development Corporation of Canada. The Omai mine is working the deposits with open pits over a 40 square kilometre (16 square mile) area. The Guyana Geology and Mines Commission is anticipating national gold production this year at 385,000 ounces, which is almost four times last year's output. The commission said the projected increase was based on the start of operations at the Omai mine, and increased output from alluvial deposits in the Madhia District and from 'sustained production' from small and medium scale producers. 'Guyana will then rank fifth in gold production in South America behind Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador,' the commission said. 'It will also rank fifth in gold reserve status in Central and South America and the Caribbean as exploration by foreign mining companies has put current gold reserves in excess of 3.9m ounces.' Cambior is a relative newcomer to the Omai venture, having replaced Placer Dome, also of Canada, which pulled out of the project, arguing that it would not be feasible at the market price for gold. It is not the first time deposits at Omai have been exploited. Just after the turn of the century, German, Dutch and Guyanese gold miners abandoned their works at Omai, after extracting 136,000 ounces over several years.</p>

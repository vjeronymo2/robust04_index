			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CRANK PHONE PUT OUT TO PASTURE IN RUGGED IDAHO  </P> <P> The nation's last known hand-crank party line was disconnected today when  residents of central Idaho's rugged Salmon River canyon received private-line,  touch-tone service.  </P> <P> "It's sure nice," country store owner Garry Pedrow said in answering the first  incoming call.  </P> <P> "I'm not screaming anymore."  </P> <P> Public Utilities Commission President Joe Miller made the first call out from  Pedrow's store to Gary C. Byrne, administrator of the Rural Electrification  Administration, which financed the switch.  </P> <P> The Depression-era system had grown familiar, and Pedrow and his 17 neighbors  greeted the change with mixed emotions.  </P> <P> "I hate to see the historical value of it leave, but as far as being in  business it's hard to communicate on this line!" Pedrow yelled into the  mouthpiece before the change Wednesday.  </P></p>

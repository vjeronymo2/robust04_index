			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAR ON DRUGS YIELDS SPORTY SPOILS FROM CUSTOMERS  </P> <P> Police Chief Daryl F. Gates held an auto show of sorts in MacArthur Park on  Thursday.  </P> <P> There was a spiffy-looking BMW sedan. A sleek Toyota sports car. A flashy  four-wheel-drive pickup. A shiny new Mercedes-Benz convertible, complete with a  personalized, West German license plate that read "Feeling Free." The license  plate holder read "Life is Sweet."  </P> <P> They were the sorts of vehicles that appeal to the yuppie set.  </P> <P> And that, Gates said regretfully, is where a lot of them came from.  </P> <P> The cars and trucks were among 38 vehicles confiscated by undercover Los  Angeles police officers and agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  during a five-day crackdown on buyers and sellers of illegal drugs in the  Pico-Union/Westlake/Rampart area, Gates said.  </P> <P> The chief said drug sales -- often to well-employed, relatively affluent  members of Southern California's diverse community -- had turned the park and  its environs into a "blatant narcotics bazaar."  </P> <P> Among the 35 adults arrested on suspicion of purchasing illegal drugs:  </P> <P> * A 28-year-old secretary at USC, booked on a marijuana count. Her brand-new  Toyota was seized.  </P> <P> * A Hacienda Heights couple, 20 and 21, who brought their 2 1/2-year-old child  with them on a marijuana-buying trip. Their sports truck was seized.  </P> <P> * Two paralegals, 20 and 26, each booked on a marijuana count. "We come here  because it is so convenient," one of the women reportedly told police. "This  area is known everywhere."  </P> <P> * Two Japanese citizens, 27 and 25, who were visiting Los Angeles on their  honeymoon. Police said a tour guide took them to the park area after they asked  him, "Where in Los Angeles do you buy marijuana?" All three were booked on  marijuana counts. The guide's sedan was seized.  </P> <P> Investigators said these and the other purchasers -- most of them white-collar  professionals -- contrast starkly with the army of small-time drug vendors,  most of whom are unemployed, homeless men from the tough neighborhood that  surrounds the park.  </P> <P> In all, 20 suspected sellers were arrested during the crackdown. Gates said  many of them were undocumented aliens from Mexico and El Salvador.  </P> <P> The vehicles were seized under federal forfeiture laws that permit police to  confiscate the assets of those suspected of buying and selling drugs. Gates  said the vehicles will be used by undercover officers or will be sold.  </P> <P> "We are going to show drug dealers and anyone else who would destroy our  neighborhood that they are not welcome," City Councilwoman Gloria Molina said  at a news conference at the park with Gates and John Zenter, special agent in  charge of the DEA's Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> "We will wipe out their graffiti, dump their debris and take this community  back," she said. "We will be totally intolerant of anyone involved in a  criminal activity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police on Horseback  </P> <P> Molina said that at her behest, the Police Department beefed up patrols, adding  mounted police in the park area and deploying a special task force of  undercover officers near the Magnolia Avenue Elementary School, an area  frequented by drug dealers and their clients.  </P> <P> "We brought a cleanup crew in," Gates said. "And we're going to bring in a  maintenance crew of uniformed officers . . . to keep things clean. We're not  going to come in and then just walk away."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sandra Bonsanti: "`The Suspicions Have Put Me in </F> a Mincing Machine'"]    [Text] Francesca: ".... Therefore, Mr. President, we call  on you to resign." The president: "It would have been easy,  and in keeping with my character, which is hotblooded in spite  of my years, to walk out of a job for which I asked no one, for  which I never lifted a finger, for which my name has never  figured in any conceivable political listing, slamming the door  behind me at the first rustlings in the undergrowth! But in my  conscience I felt it my duty not to walk out for so little, as  it would have prevented the dissolution of parliament and  prevented the elections." It would have been easy, but ....  says Scalfaro: "Look, I found myself in a situation where, for  reasons that I cannot go into here, they tried everything, at  the political level, at the personal level, everything to stop  me signing the dissolution of parliament. They tried  everything."    This denunciation of maneuvers against the early elections  is  an unexpected outburst on the president's part in front of the  teaching staff and students of the Third University of Rome. He  is replying to the girl who, departing from the initial script  of an address describing Scalfaro as one of the "role models"  and examples of steadfastness of which youth today is in such  great need, replaced this passage with another in which the  figure of the role model disappears behind that of a president  who ought to resign ...., immediately creating a political  furore. Is the head of state offended, is he angry? The  cabinet, with an excess of zeal bordering on the ridiculous,  "deplores" the "lamentable" episode that has involved Scalfaro,  to whom it reaffirms "its gratitude for his valuable work in  defending our institutions at a sensitive time in the life of  the republic." Will Francesca be "punished" for her outrageous  speech? "There is a thirst for truth," she said, "there are  former state officials, self-confessed criminals, making  allegations against you, Mr. President, incredible allegations."  But reason of state must not have its way, and, "We hope that  you ... will want to see the truth established, as the true  first citizen of Italy."    The audience in the great hall, just officially opened, at  Rome's latest university is taken aback. Scalfaro rises. "I  had intended to hold my peace, but .... I will dwell for a  moment on what Francesca Maresco has so wisely said."    And the president speaks, recounting, in his somewhat  antiquated style, what has been happening over the previous few  days and weeks. "We need ideals, examples to follow." His story  is that he has found himself up against people who did  everything they could to prevent the dissolution of parliament.  But the president's duty is to respect the will of the people.  "And the overwhelming majority of voters in the referendum  imposed a principle that made for a total change in the  electoral system: total! .... But there were too many interests  determined to prevent the dissolution of parliament. I took the  job on," says Scalfaro in vindication of his role, "and I thank  God that he has allowed me to carry it through. It has not been  easy, it has not been pleasant to remain at my post."    It is an account of a dramatic period in his life at the  Quirinale, fighting the temptation to resign, and of the  immunity that seems to be a prerogative that "renders a person  untouchable but puts him into a mincing machine, preventing him  from exercising his rights." "Crazy" allegations, against which  he cannot "yet" defend himself. Not a heroic act, but the  performance of a duty.    The head of state had never before linked the allegations  made against him by the Sisde [secret service] officers so  forcibly with the political will to keep the paliamentary term  going. He had never spoken so directly in public about  resigning. There are those who see this as a sign: Did he mean  that he may resign after the elections? There has been no lack  of maneuvering, even as regards the choice of date. Scalfaro  explains that he had let it be known as early as Sunday morning  that he was willing to sign a government decision permitting  voting on 27 and 28 [March] until 2200. But Rabbi Toaff,  "probably owing to a misunderstanding," said on the television  news that "voting on the Monday was of no interest." And this  issue, too, has been the subject of speculation and protest on  the part of "an unquantified number of politicians, and I must  say that some bishops, too, have taken the Old Testament to  heart with a quite fascinating vehemence."    So Francesca's more or less spontaneous words gave Scalfaro  a  valuable opportunity, which he seized with both hands, only  complaining that there had been an element of "underhandedness":  He would have preferred that the paragraph containing the call  for his resignation had been in the written version. "I assure  you I should have been twice as eager to come. At the present  time, I am surrounded by a small number of straightforward  people and I do not say a large number, I say too many  underhanded people."</p>

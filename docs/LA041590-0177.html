			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Local government may be the only echelon of our national system on which most  of us can exert any direct influence, or with which we can feel any personal  identity.  </P> <P> But what is the cost of citizen participation? For 10 individuals (in Irvine)  who were sued for signing the ballot arguments of Measures B and C, more than  they had hoped.  </P> <P> Certainly, hostility, anger and high levels of emotions can take its toll for  citizens' participation in the political process -- but a lawsuit?  </P> <P> Perhaps these 10 individuals anticipated "lively" interaction between  special-interest groups in hopes of resolution. But a lawsuit?  </P> <P> It has been said that democracy is not a spectator sport. However, we realize  that participating in the democratic process is not without responsibility. But  certainly, it should come without a lawsuit.  </P> <P> CHARLENE M. TURCO  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WALKER LIKELY TO MISS SEASON  </P> <P> Wide receiver Wayne Walker will undergo arthroscopic surgery today to repair  ligament damage in his right knee and likely will be out for the season, Coach  Dan Henning said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Walker injured the knee in practice Tuesday.  </P> <P> The loss is significant for the Chargers, who were counting on Walker to be  among their top three receivers.  </P> <P> "He is a guy that has outstanding speed and quickness, plus he has been a deep  threat for us," Henning said.  </P> <P> Walker made the team last season as a free agent from Texas Tech after similar  surgery on his left knee as a senior. He started four games, catching 24 passes  for 395 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> Henning also said offensive guard Mike Simmonds, a Plan B acquisition from  Tampa Bay, will undergo arthroscopic knee examination today because of an  ongoing problem.

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Impressionist view from Brussels - William Packer admires the work of the Belgian avant-garde To take issue with its title is an easy way of criticising at an exhibition, yet it can also be a useful in clarifying the issue at the outset, dispelling any misapprehension. 'The Belgian Avant-Garde 1880-1900', the sub-title of the show in the Royal Academy's Sackler Galleries, has the virtue of exact description, but even the most pro-Belgian would concede that on its own it sounds a little dull. So what of Impressionism to Symbolism, the main title? One can see all too well why those two big -isms were chosen - everyone has heard of them; together they neatly suggest the period of the show; and the merest mention of Impressionism is sure to draw the punters in. The only trouble is that it is not quite right. Vague in its generality, it gives the unfortunate impression that here is little more than an annexe to the French painting of the time, so dominant still is the Franco-centric reading of the art history of early modernism. And in its particular conjunction, it proposes a narrative sequence, development or shift from the one -ism to the other. This is a pity because the show, in both material and critical content, is so much more interesting than that. Indeed my only complaint is that there is too little shown of a rich and fascinating subject. Between the one and the other would have been the better choice of title. What this exhibition actually gives us is not a sequence at all but rather an over-view, as though looking down into a house with the roof off, and no matter whether the contemporaneous activity revealed is complementary, contradictory or unrelated. It is an admirable exercise for the Academy to have taken on, for one of the most rewarding critical developments in recent years has been the renewal of comparative interest in the national schools in the early modern period. In this, the Academy has often taken the lead, if not always the credit it deserves. What is revealed, and especially in this exhibition, is that while at particular moments certain places - for all sorts of historical, political and cultural reasons - become the place to be, the focus of current interest and activity, it is never the only place where significant creative work is being done. Of course Paris was of first importance in the later 19th century, primus inter pares, but what of Berlin, Copenhagen, Oslo, the Hague, Turin, Barcelona, London, Glasgow, Vienna, Brussels . . . ? It is the premise of this show, with Brussels at its centre, that we ask the same question. What we find is that the Paris relation is evident enough, yet what little of Impressionism there is seems closer in its robust spirit to what was going on Holland and Scandinavia than to Monet or Pissarro. Bartsoen's barges in the snow and Mertens' moonlit fisherman are fine, straight-forward examples. There is, admittedly, a lot of post-Impressionism, in the pointillism of Lemmen, van de Velde, Finch and van Rysselberghe - indeed disproportionately so, though with some splendid examples. A more intriguing French connection lies in the social realism of such as Bastien-Lepage, but then again the ramifications run throughout Europe, from Newlyn to Stockholm, Glasgow to Turin. The Belgian view is notably represented here by the large 'Funeral Wake' of Leon Frederic, the 'First Communion' by Emile Claus and van Leemputten's 'Distribution of Bread in the Village'. More particular is the reference to the social symbolism of Millet and Puvis, which we find in Verstaete's 'Barge Haulier' and Verheden's 'Gleaners'; and to the psychological symbolism of Moreau and Redon, in the dreamlike, haunted drawings of Fernand Knopff, and the dark, mysteriously inhabited interiors of Xavier Mellery. Rops seems included as an afterthought - a missed opportunity. These two aspects of symbolism come together in the angst-ridden sculpture of Meunier and Minne. With Spilliaert's hypnotic self-portrait, the step is forward into psychological expressionism - again we could have done with much more of him. There are cross-references and blurred distinctions everywhere. With James Ensor, still the best known of the early Belgian modernists and central to the show, such shifts are endless - expressionism, symbolism, realism, on their own and all at once, even in the small selection here. The comparison with Munch is inevitable, and proposes what is perhaps the message of this show. For him the view from Brussels stretched east to Berlin and north to Oslo quite as much as south to Paris. The artist is free even to stay where he is. To be local is not always to be provincial.

The 34 major nationally and regionally designated  construction projects had a total planned investment last year  of 6.1 billion yuan (about 700 million U.S. dollars), 49 percent  higher than the previous year.    The actual investment in the projects last year was 5.347  billion yuan (about 666 million U.S. dollars), 66.7 percent more  than in 1992.    With the completion of some of the projects, the region  increased its electric power generating capacity to 563,000 kw  and port handling capacity to 2.7 million tons in 1993.    Some 400 kilometers of highways and five optical fiber cable  lines, with a total length of 2,000 kilometers, were built last  year.    More than 20,000 long-distance telephone lines were added to  the region's telecommunications network.    The financial and banking departments have give full support  to the construction of key projects.    The regional branch of the Construction Bank of China issued  3.3 billion yuan more of loans for the projects.</p>

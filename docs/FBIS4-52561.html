			<p>BFN     [Text] With regard to the civilian industrial technology  cooperation that was discussed as a backbone for "global  bilateral cooperation" between Japan and the United States  during the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the Japanese  Government disclosed on 9 May that both Japan and the United  States have agreed to launch joint research in four areas  including the joint development of ceramics, which is used to  manufacture the semiconductor substrate of the next-generation  high-density integrated circuit. Mary Good [name as published],  U.S. secretary of commerce for technology, will visit Japan in  early June together with American researchers in charge of the  four areas to consult with Hiroshi Kashiwahi, Agency of  Industrial Science and Technology director general, and other  Japanese researchers about specific ways to cooperate.    Japan and the United States originally agreed to promote  civilian industrial technology cooperation in 10 areas during  vice ministerial talks held last December, but the two countries  later agreed to initiate cooperation within four areas. The  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks remain stalled, but there  has been no disagreement between the two countries on promoting  cooperation and pressing ahead in the four areas.    The United States, which plans to convert the military and  aerospace technologies into civilian production, wants to use  Japan's advanced industrial technology. While the United States  is increasingly moving to protect its high-tech industry, Japan  aims to head off future trade friction with the United States by  promoting cooperation in which Japanese private enterprises will  participate.    The four areas include the joint research and development of  ceramics, composite carbon fiber materials used to manufacture  machinery, data collection using a crystal protein system, and  technology to build more environmentally friendly factories.    The semiconductor substrate, which is obtained from the  burned powder of nitriding aluminum, has been used mainly for  military purposes in the United States. Under the joint  research and development arrangement, an attempt will be made to  combine the U.S. manufacturing technology with Japan's  processing technology to raise the thermal conductivity of  semiconductor substrate by about two times for the ultimate  purpose of keeping heat from staying in semiconductors. This  attempt, if successful, would serve to miniaturize the cooling  device of large computers, liquid-crystal television sets, and  personal computers, while prolonging their durability.    Under the joint development arrangement, an attempt will  also  be made to combine U.S. stereo fabric technology, which has been  used by NASA to build space shuttles, with Japan's surface  processing technology, which uses high-powered lasers to develop  composite carbon fiber materials. Japanese and American  researchers will work to develop a technology that costs less in  manufacturing composite carbon fiber materials. Composite  carbon fiber materials will be widely used to manufacture  high-powered engines and high-precision machine tools.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Carlzon takes flight to 'fortress' - Hugh Carnegy and Paul Betts examine the SAS chief's resignation IF there were any doubts about Mr Jan Carlzon's commitment to Alcazar, the ambitious project to merge Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, the charismatic Swede dispelled them yesterday. By announcing his resignation as chief executive of SAS, a position he has held since 1981, in order to concentrate on Alcazar, Mr Carlzon made it clear that for him the project, named after a four-towered Moorish fortress, is a question of all or nothing. 'I have told the board that if Alcazar does not succeed, I will not remain in this position,' he said. What he did not say was whether he intended to lead the merged airline should it happen. His ambition is almost certainly to do so, but he said only that he would join its senior management. The vision of building a fourth force in European airlines - after British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa - out of a handful of the continent's smaller operators is one that Mr Carlzon has pursued since 1985. But it has become a make-or-break issue in a career that rose during the 1980s but faltered as the 1990s brought the airline industry down to earth. Mr Carlzon has been a symbol of far-sighted Swedish management since he came to SAS at the age of 40 having transformed the fortunes of a domestic airline, Linjeflyg, through a low-fares policy. At SAS, his Global Travel Service System strategy of combining businesses such as hotels, aircraft servicing and catering with the core airline service won plaudits. But three and a half years of losses have led SAS to sell much of its hotel and other non-core investments. Throughout, Mr Carlzon has roamed Europe and the Americas looking for partners to give SAS added muscle to battle the US and European groups in an increasingly deregulated industry. Investments in British Midland and Continental Airlines of the US, and the European Quality Alliance with Swissair and Austrian, were among moves which presaged the Alcazar project. Now, Alcazar is portrayed as a lifeline for SAS, which suffered a SKr609m (Dollars 77m) loss in the first six months of this year and has not shown a full-year profit since 1989. A sign that SAS finds it hard to envisage a future without Alcazar was the announcement that Mr Jan Reinas, Mr Carlzon's successor as chief executive, would leave the company in April to take up an appointment at Norske Skog, the Norwegian pulp and paper group. Alcazar is still not a foregone conclusion. The intention to produce by last June a memorandum of understanding outlining how the four airlines will be moulded under one management slipped to September. Mr Carlzon said he hoped the MoU would be completed by October, but would not give guarantees. KLM and Swissair confirmed that the mid-September deadline had been moved into October. For its part, Austrian, the smallest of the gang of four, said it was still considering an alternative option to co-operate with Lufthansa rather than join the Alcazar partnership. From the outset, none of the four airlines expected the negotiations to be straightforward and many in the industry felt the timetable for formal agreement by the end of this year was optimistic. Although the airlines remain convinced that a partnership can significantly strengthen their competitive position, several complex issues still need to be ironed out. These include: The relative financial share of the airlines. One official close to the talks yesterday said progress had been made within the proposed framework of a 30 per cent share each for SAS, KLM and Swissair and 10 per cent for Austrian, but agreement was not complete. The Swiss financial community has expressed concern that this structure would undervalue Swissair. The participation of Austrian Airlines remains uncertain. Indeed, there are strong indications that the Austrian carrier is leaning towards Lufthansa, which has a stake in Lauda Air, the other Austrian airline. Austrian yesterday confirmed that it had yet to make up its mind. But, even if Austrian were to opt for co-operation with Lufthansa, KLM, SAS and Swissair are still expected to continue seeking a merger of the three instead of four airlines. The location of the headquarters is proving another thorny question because of the strategic and national implications of the ultimate decision. The candidates include Amsterdam, Zurich, Copenhagen, or Vienna (if Austrian agrees to join the venture). Amsterdam seems the frontrunner because of its strategic position and the advantages the partners would gain from the 'open skies' agreement between the Netherlands and the US. However, SAS is likely to make a strong pitch for Copenhagen, which it has developed successfully into its main international hub. The management question of who will be first among equals among the four-strong top management team. Even though the partners claim to share a common vision and have co-operated through the so-called European Quality Alliance marketing partnership, the composition of the joint management team remains a problem. Coupled with the management problem is the reaction of the powerful airline unions in each country, which fear job cuts. The selection of a US airline partner. KLM has close links with Northwest; Swissair with Delta, and SAS has had a long association with Continental. Any of these issues could undermine Mr Carlzon's vision of creating a European fortress airline. His decision to resign as SAS chief executive to devote his time to the Alcazar project suggests that the construction of the fortress still remains in the balance.</p>

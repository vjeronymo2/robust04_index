			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Brewin Dolphin tops Pounds 2.5m Brewin Dolphin, the private client stockbroker, pleased the market with a 94 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 2.55m for the 27 weeks to June 17. The shares, which started trading on June 9, rose 5p to 149p, compared with the flotation price of 150p. The profits growth was aided by a full six month contribution from its Bell Lawrie subsidiary, which had provided only two months input in 1993. In addition, the previous figures were affected by a Pounds 330,000 provision, reflecting the cost of the cancellation of Taurus. Total turnover increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 11.5m), helped by strong trading volumes during the first quarter of the year. Mr John Hall, managing director, said the advisory and execution-only business had been adversely affected by the slowdown in the stock market in the second quarter of the year, but profits were still ahead of the previous year. The company is paying a 1p interim dividend, which was half the rate it would have paid if it had been listed for the entire period. It has undertaken, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to pay a final distribution of 4p.</p>

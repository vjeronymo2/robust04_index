			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The eight-day Seventh  Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National  People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, opened here today.    The participants first heard reports on the examination on  the draft laws on foreign trade and state compensation, and a  draft decision on punishing violators in the management of  companies and enterprises.    The reports held that the two draft laws and the draft  decision, after repeated examination and revision, are generally  feasible. They therefore proposed that the drafts be adopted by  the Standing Committee of the NPC.    Tao Siju, minister of public security, read to the  legislators draft supplementary provisions to regulations  governing offenses against public order which, targeted at  newly-emerging problems and phenomena, define 18 new offenses.    Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political Department,  explained the draft amendments to the regulations on active  service and rank of military officers of the People's Liberation  Army.    He said that the revision of the two regulations was meant  to  meet increasing needs of the reform and construction drive of  both the nation and the armed forces.    The revised draft amendment to the regulations on military  rank spell out the disestablishment of first-class (highest  rank) general. It also stipulates that no military rank will be  granted to the chairman of the Central Military Commission, and  the rank for vice chairmen of the commission is that of general.    The draft amendment to the regulations on active service  takes two to three years off the ceiling age for officers of  deputy-army level, officers at the level of deputy  commander-in-chief for the greater military areas and officers  with elementary professional posts.    According to a report on the draft Law on Management of  Urban  Real Estate, delivered by Vice Minister of Construction Ye  Rutang, the development of the real estate industry will on the  one hand provide the basic material foundation for urban  economic growth, and on the other hand help improve the living  standards of urban residents.    The minister said that the position of the real estate  industry in the national economy and its role in social progress  have obliged it to be standardized, guided, promoted and secured  by law.    The draft decision on punishing criminals violating  copyrights stipulates that copyright violators can meet with  punishment ranging from five years in prison to detention and  fines.    The legislators also heard explanations on the draft laws on  judges and prosecutors made respectively by Supreme People's  Court President Ren Jianxin and Procurator-General of the  Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Siqing.    Ren said that for more than four decades China has not had a  law on judges, who are both state functionaries and  professionals. Legislation in the field is very necessary for  the scientific and standardized management of custodians of the  law, he said.    Zhang said the law on prosecutors is aimed at establishing a  mechanism to restrict the behavior of prosecutors.    Today's meeting was presided over by Qiao Shi, chairman of  the NPC Standing Committee.</p>

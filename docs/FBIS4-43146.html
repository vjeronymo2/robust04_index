			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bishop: "Government Rejects New </F> Lockerbie `Confession'"]    [Text] A claim by a member of a Palestinian terror group  that he was responsible for the Lockerbie bombing was discounted  by the Foreign Office yesterday.    Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, who is accused of involvement in the  murder of a Jordanian diplomat, told a Beirut court he blew up  the Pan Am airliner which exploded over Scotland in December  1988 killing 270 people.    Sha'ban is a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the  Palestinian terror organisation led by Abu-Nidal.    But yesterday a Foreign Office spokesman said: "We have  stated many times we believe that there is a case to be answered  in a court in Scotland or the US involving two Libyans."    Mr Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives of the  victims of flight 103, said the claim "should be regarded with  grave suspicion."    He added: "It could be that he is seeking to attract what  terrorists might regard as kudos for the Abu-Nidal organisation."    The belief that Libya is to blame for the bombing was  repeated by Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5,  in the Dimbleby Lecture on Sunday [12 June]. Both Britain and  the United States are demanding that Libya hand over the two  suspects, 'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali al-Migrahi and Lamin Khalifah  Fuhaymah, for trial in either country.    The Abu-Nidal group has close links with Libya, but  officials  say it has not been identified with the Lockerbie atrocity. Nor  is the name of Sha'ban well known to the security sources.    Sha'ban claimed in court he had repeatedly told the  magistrate investigating the assassination that he was the  Lockerbie bomber but his claim had never been recorded.    Yesterday the likeliest explanation for his "confession" was  thought to be a desire to delay a possible death sentence in his  current trial. He and two others are charged with killing Na'ib  'Imran Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January.    Lebanon has recently begun carrying out the death penalty  for  murderers.    Another theory is that Sha'ban was acting on Abu-Nidal's  orders to try to divert attention from his patron Col  Al-Qadhdhafi, whose Libyan regime has suffered two years of  sanctions over his refusal to give up the suspects.</p>

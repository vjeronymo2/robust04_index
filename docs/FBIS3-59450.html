			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mirko Sagolj: "Europe Must Make a Choice"] </F>   [Text] Another Geneva meeting is behind us and the destiny  of Bosnia-Herzegovina is more uncertain than ever. Ministers of  the European Community may think they did something, as the  three negotiating sides signed a 20-day cease-fire and as the  same people are supposed to meet again in the middle of January,  hoping to sign a final agreement -- but that is just another  deception and self-illusion.    If Europe is still not aware of its responsibility for the  events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for consequences of its utterly  incomprehensible and irrational policies, perhaps it will  realize it now.    The Serbs are still defying it and demonstrating the  impotence of its policies, degrading them to the level of the  influence of the United Nations. It is not even capable of  making them agree to or force them to allow the opening of Tuzla  airport for humanitarian purposes, let alone remove their  artillery around Sarajevo or stop them advancing the borders of  "greater Serbia."    German Minister Klaus Kinkel seems to have finally realized  where things are headed or has been the first to say what the  world already knows: That Europe will pay a high price for  their ill-conceived policies toward the events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kinkel was not led to that evaluation only  by the failures of the Geneva and Brussels negotiations, but  probably by a much wider European context of political events.  It is now certain that, for the first time since World War II,  tanks are determining state borders in Europe, and that European  politicians accept that. Now it is difficult to imagine what  such a precedent could mean for the future and destiny of all  Europe. We can perhaps imagine it, but how to face such a  concept when it could prove to be disastrous for the entire  continent?    If that is not a convincing enough argument for Europe --  which persists in removing the hands of the United States from  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- to come to its senses and collectively  start defending freedom and democracy, perhaps the results of  the recent parliamentary elections in Russia, where the "Russian  Seselj" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy won the largest share of the vote,  will help Europe in that. These are first significant political  moves of the Russian right, whose full blast is yet to come.  These elections showed that even Yeltsin does not have a  ready-made answer for that challenge or better than dim  prospects, and that political processes have not even begun in  Russia, and this encourages the events on the territory of  former Yugoslavia, as well as the fact that the world has not  been willing or able to stop Serbian expansionism. If it could  not stop the Serbs, how can it stop the expansionism of Russia?    Zhirinovsky is not a political clown as some naively think.  Many monsters of the world seemed like clowns at the beginning  of their political career, but that did not prevent them from  misleading the masses and dragging them into major political  adventures. And the postcommunist vacuum is ideal for such  leaders.    The new Russian political fact called Zhirinovskiy -- if  that  means anything to Europe at all -- has already come up with a  political slogan that can set the Russian as well as other  orthodox masses into motion to the point where they will form an  unpredictable political deluge. And while, on the one hand,  Kinkel spoke about the high price that Europe will have to pay  for its misguided politics, on the other Zhirinovskiy has  revealed his ultimate political goal: Creating an alliance of  countries stretching, as he said, from the Bering Straits to  Warsaw and Belgrade. Yes, yes, to Warsaw and Belgrade. Does  that mean anything to Europe? And Zhirinovskiy's dream borders  of a greater Russia are too narrow for him, and he wants to  expand them, having said "Where there is as many as one member  of the Orthodox Church, that is Russia."    There is not much time left before the Geneva talks resume.  If the European Community really intends to halt one aggression  before having to deal with another, incomparably more dangerous  one, it will have to present far more radical demands to the  Serbian side at the next Geneva conference, and it must be  prepared to implement them to the full, or, as Kinkel says, one  day it will have to pay a high price for its policies. There is  not much choice.</p>

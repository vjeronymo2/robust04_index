			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / DAF considers sale or joint venture for truck axle plant ALBION, THE truck axle plant near Glasgow, may be sold or hived off into a joint venture. Those are among options being considered by its owner, DAF, the Dutch truck manufacturer that five years ago absorbed Leyland, the former UK state-owned truck builder. The plant, whose workforce has been cut by 220 to 530 over the past two years, produces axles for trucks being built at Leyland and vans at the former Freight Rover plant in Birmingham, and machines components for DAF's axles plant in Belgium. In the past few days Leyland DAF executives have indicated that Albion's prospects of continuing its present role may be fading as full rationalisation of the former DAF and Leyland truck ranges draws closer and the group prepares for a new vans range under a joint venture with Renault in the mid 1990s. The biggest threat to the plant is the launch within the next two years of a range of medium-weight trucks, the components for which have been an Albion mainstay. DAF, which has been plunged into heavy losses, mainly by the collapse of the UK truck market, is restructuring its manufacturing operations this year and next, moving work as close as possible to core activities. Truck development is being centred on the Continent, where there is already extensive axle production. The workforce has been told that there is no immediate threat because the present range of vehicles will require supplies for some time, but employees know that there is uncertainty. The company said several months ago that it had considered closing the plant but that it would be kept open if costs could be further reduced. DAF, which is 16 per cent owned by British Aerospace, has reduced its UK workforce from 7,095 at the end of 1989 to fewer than 6,000. At the end of November, DAF said it would cut another 1,600 jobs worldwide over the following two years. The UK is expected to bear the brunt with 1,200 losses, while 400 are to go in the Netherlands. So far Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary, has yet to indicate where the cuts will fall, but Albion is inevitably among the candidates. Most employees are based at the main truck production centres of Leyland and Chorley, Lancashire, and the Birmingham vans plant, with 300 marketing staff at Thame, Oxfordshire. Leyland DAF considers that Albion is what one executive described as 'fundamentally a facility for the machining of complex parts'. That did not necessarily mean having to stay in the trucks business, he pointed out.</p>

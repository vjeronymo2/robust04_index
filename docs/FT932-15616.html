			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Books: A totem of the Celtic fringe A HISTORY OF WALES by John Davies Allen Lane Pounds 30, 718 pages IT IS A conspicuous phenomenon. The histories of Ireland, Scotland, Ulster and Wales have all now been vigorously established. But writing the history of England is no longer a la mode. No better index of this is the news that the Pelican History of England, staunch vade-mecum of the sixth-form swot, is to be replaced by a Pelican History of Britain and, what is more, that it is to be written largely by transatlantic authorities. To anyone who has ever been in the 'Celtic fringe' long enough to know that it is not a fringe but its own domain of self-defined activity, this comes as no surprise. The English have got their come-uppance. For years, the English have bullishly regarded British history as English history. Never mind 1066 and All That: what do the English know of 1536, 1707 and 1800? These are dates which still rankle with the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish, for they mark the extension of English sovereignty throughout the British Isles; but up until recently, very little English historical attention has been focused on those Acts of Union, and the residual fragility of that nationhood which we call 'British'. The Maastricht debate has been useful in this respect: it has shown just how few of our parliamentarians (especially the 'patriotic' among them) have any understanding of how weak and cosmetic are the bonds which hold 'Britain' together. Against this background, John Davies' History of Wales makes a timely appearance. The value of the book is attested by its own history. Commissioned by Penguin to come out in Welsh, it materialised so large that a paperback was impossible, but Allen Lane issued Hanes Cymru in 1990 never the less. The Welsh original had an almost totemic force, whatever its contents: I well remember with what pride it was displayed in the dingy windows of sub Post Offices in minor mid-Welsh market towns. And now Davies has turned his Welsh text into English, bringing it to the wider readership it much deserves. There is always a danger that these nationalistic histories will be quaint. And indeed, some aspects of Welsh nationalism are quaint: anti-English sentiment is always framed in Welsh as anti-Saxon, and assumes a purity of English culture that really no longer exists (in many 'English' towns Punjabi must be almost as much used as English). It may be that English nationalistic history is no longer possible precisely because England is now much more of a multi-cultural society than Wales, Scotland or Ireland. Although Davies is palpably passionate about Wales as a nation, and a nation with a future as well as a past, he manages to keep his narrative free of whimsy. His agenda is straightforward: he has to show how 'Wales' and 'the Welsh' have survived as significant terms despite the fact that since 1536 (if not earlier, effectively) the country and its people have been treated as a part - or worse, an appendage - of England. The survival is remarkable. So many factors could be hypothetically invoked as reasons for the eclipse of Wales. The lack of its own political institutions; the lack (still felt) of a decent infrastructure; the lack, until 1955, of a capital city; the difficult terrain; and so on. Yet the eclipse never happened. The defiance of Wales is not overtly explained here, but we can see for ourselves how it was nourished. Davies engages with all types of history - economic, social, religious, even archaeology - but wherever he is he has an eye for the prime medium of communication. From the bards who delighted the warlords of the 14th century to the prodigious pamphleteering of evangelist dissenters in the eighteenth, and Radio Cymru in the 20th, the Welsh have communicated to each other in their own language. And it is no exaggeration to say that the language has preserved the nationality of Wales. There may never have been a Wordsworth of the Valleys, but lyrical ballads circulate in Wales as they no longer do elsewhere.( To see a child of six stand before an audience of thousands, take a single note from a harp, and then deliver a song in perfect pitch, is extraordinary to outsiders attending an eisteddfod, but natural to this country). It is clear that the centre of gravity for Wales resides, as it always has done, in the language: and it was Matthew Arnold's big mistake, when he was Inspector of Schools, to suppose that you could keep 'Welsh culture' without its own linguistic base. A cultural centre of gravity does not, of course, imply absolute cohesion. There are two distinct facets to Welsh history: one is the Celtic, the other (to borrow an Arnoldism) the Hebraic - by which I mean the tea-urn culture of Dissent and Nonconformity. Bingeing versus temperance, poets versus preachers, warriors versus pacificists: following the interaction of the Celtic and Hebraic throughout this book is perhaps the most satisfying part of it. But whether it is for hell-fire or lechery, the language has been one and the same: which is why it is entirely right, and an act of enlightenment from Penguin that A History of Wales comes after, not before, Hanes Cymru.</p>

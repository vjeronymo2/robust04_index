			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Not such a lucky fella: Doubts over the UK's economic recovery have narrowed Kenneth Clarke's options for next month's Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke has had a wonderful opening innings as chancellor. Some 4 1/2 months of masterly inactivity at the Treasury, offset by a rather more punishing schedule in television studios, have cemented his position as the cabinet heavy-weight and the bookies' favourite as heir apparent to Mr John Major, the prime minister. But as Mr Clarke's first big test - the unified Budget on November 30 - draws nearer, it is clear that he is no longer quite such a lucky fellow. Successive chancellors have learned that the UK economy has a nasty way of springing unpleasant surprises just when things appear to be going well. Poor figures on production and inflation this week threaten to make Mr Clarke the latest in a line of distinguished victims of this trend. With hindsight, we now know that the economic signals that appeared just after Mr Clarke moved into number 11 Downing Street in late May were too flattering. Looking back it seemed the UK was enjoying a 'near perfect' recovery, led by exports and investment, that held out hopes of sustained non-inflationary growth. The annual rate of inflation - at 1.3 per cent in May and 1.2 per cent in June - reached its lowest level for nearly three decades. Unemployment fell 23,100 in May, after similar falls in February and March. Manufacturing output was rising at an annualised 4 to 5 per cent and exports also showed strong growth. The past week's figures have confirmed doubts about the manufacturing recovery. The Treasury made no attempt to hide its disappointment at the 0.7 per cent decline in manufacturing output in the three months to the end of August against the previous three months. It is easy to be too negative about the latest figures. Exports and industrial production have been depressed by the recession on the European continent. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, has pointed out rightly that recoveries do not 'proceed in a straight line'. The news that unemployment fell a seasonally adjusted 13,600 in September suggests that the economy as a whole is still growing. According to Mr Darren Winder, an economist with SG Warburg Securities, official figures next Friday could show that the economy expanded by about 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, leaving it on track for growth of about 1.7 per cent this year. But the quality of recovery will be different from that signalled in spring. Output will have been rising in the service sector, rather than in manufacturing, and will have been sustained by the British consumer rather than the factory manager or the overseas client. In fact, Britain appears to have settled back into a traditional recovery pattern fueled by household demand. A consumer confidence survey from Gallup and Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, found this week that the recovery in consumer spending is increasingly well established after rising for six consecutive quarters. Low interest rates, low inflation and the stabilisation of unemployment have boosted consumers' confidence compared with a year ago. Recent Central Statistical Office figures for exports and producer prices suggest that recovery is showing other traditional patterns. UK manufacturers have used Sterling's devaluation since the pound's exit from the European Monetary System in September 1992 to push up margins where possible rather than maximise market share. The government and Bank of England thus need to be vigilant on inflation. It is true that headline inflation at 1.8 per cent in September was still low by UK standards. But the upwards creep of the more important underlying rate, excluding mortgages, to 3.3 per cent last month from 3.1 per cent in August and 2.8 per cent in May and June, must disturb the authorities. Not only is the underlying rate fairly near the government's 4 per cent target ceiling, set a year ago, but inflationary pressures are building up. Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget decisions to impose value added tax on domestic fuel and power as well as restrict mortgage interest relief to the lowest 20 per cent tax band will add 0.65 percentage points to the RPI from next April. The government's promise to raise road fuel duties by at least 3 per cent a year in real terms could push up petrol prices as early as December. The deteriorating economic background has implications for Mr Clarke's first Budget. Rising inflation and the changing quality of growth formed the backdrop to yesterday's confidential conclave on Budget strategy attended by the chancellor, Treasury ministers and senior officials at Dorneywood in Buckinghamshire. If there has been a consistent theme to his chancellorship it has been to stress the need to restore the nation's finances and bring down the Budget deficit from the forecast Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 at a faster rate than envisaged in March. While not detailing possible tax measures, Mr Clarke has been unusually talkative for a chancellor about matters of revenue raising and public spending. We know that Mr Clarke sees no opportunity for cutting the deficit by reducing the 'control total' for public spending below its pre-set level of Pounds 254bn for the 1994-95 financial year. This accords with his political beliefs: the chancellor is not one of those Tories who believes public spending is automatically bad. It may also jibe with political realities: reports leaking out of the special EDX cabinet committee that is trying to hold down departmental expenditures suggest the spending round is proceeding 'bloodily'. Ever since his first major interview with this newspaper in July, Mr Clarke has been consistent in suggesting that taxes might have to rise in the Budget. He has made clear that he prefers indirect to direct taxation and has made no secret of his belief that Britain's value added tax net, which zero rates items such as foods, books, newspapers, new dwellings, childrens' clothes and sewerage services, is too narrow. As befits a son of the industrial Midlands, he has spoken of the importance of a tax structure 'which favours enterprise, entrepreneurship and thrift'. He has indicated that he would not turn first to taxing the corporate sector in conditions of weak recovery. But he faces problems turning preferences into policy. It is unlikely he can act boldly to increase VAT or widen its net. VAT rises would feed through into both headline and the underlying retail price indices and increase the risk of underlying inflation exceeding the government's 4 per cent target ceiling. Also will Mr Clarke want to hit consumers with more VAT levies, announced just before Christmas, if they are now the mainstay of recovery? Although the chancellor robustly defended existing plans to levy VAT on domestic fuel and power at the Conservatives' conference nine days ago, party activists in Blackpool's Winter Gardens made clear their dislike of tax rises in general and VAT increases in particular. Other political factors may limit Mr Clarke's options. The 1992 election manifesto pledged to 'maintain' mortgage interest relief, raise child benefits and pensions in line with inflation and increase spending on health in real terms. Mr Clarke is too much a politician to trample on these pledges. Mr Major, keenly interested in the Budget, also wishes to avoid any overt breach of manifesto commitments. Yet the Treasury has been studying ways of further curtailing mortgage interest relief. But the fragile state of the housing market is another argument against too savage an attack on this subsidy, which will cost about Pounds 4.3bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 3.6bn in 1994-95. Monetary policy is an area where Mr Clarke is being constantly urged to take action. While commentators could assert inflation was dead, it was easy to construct a strategy of fiscal tightening, offset by an interest rate cut to support the economy through fiscal consolidation. Mr Clarke has kept base rates unchanged at the 6 per cent level set on January 26 this year. But UK short-term interest rates are the lowest in Europe. It is not clear how far a further cut would help the housing market or mortgage borrowers. Most new mortgages taken out this year have been at fixed rates while many lenders have made clear that they could not pass on the full amount of any base rate cut in lower borrowing costs. Lower interest rates might benefit industry, although industrialists have generally stopped complaining about rates. Without rate cuts on the continent, cheaper money in Britain could undermine the pound and give a new boost to inflation through imported goods prices. There is also a political factor for Mr Clarke to weigh. Savers greatly outnumber borrowers. MPs' post bags are full of complaints from moderately well-off pensioners lamenting the drop in their interest income since September 1992. Local elections are due in May and European elections in June next year. Would Mr Clarke, the politician, want to alienate further a group of voters that is already up in arms over VAT on fuel? With just over six weeks to the Budget, Mr Clarke is walking a fine line. His dilemma should not be over-dramatised because the Treasury is skilled at finding hitherto unsuspected and relatively painless ways of raising revenue, by closing loopholes or altering tax allowances. But too much action to cut the deficit could tip the economy into a new recession. Too little, and the hope of tax cuts before the next election would evaporate. Though it might go against the grain, Micawberism, living in hope that 'something might turn up', might be the best way forward for Mr Clarke. Some Pounds 6.73bn of fiscal tightening has been programmed for 1994-95 as a result of Mr Lamont's March Budget. This strengthens the case for a 'do nothing Budget' that leaves further action on the deficit until recovery on the continent has provided new support for activity in Britain. It is no wonder that his big decisions on taxation will be left as late as possible next month. But as November 30 looms, Mr Clarke, the chancellor, may find that he is having to resolve some difficult conflicts with Mr Clarke, the politician.</p>

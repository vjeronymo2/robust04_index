			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRYANT RECALLED; PASADENA PAY RAISE FAILS;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: FLORES AND O'BRIEN IN RUNOFF TO SUCCEED SCHABARUM. HORCHER WINS  CLOSE RACE FOR ASSEMBLY NOMINATION.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley voters on Tuesday recalled a Pomona councilman, voted down a  pay raise for Pasadena directors and gave key Assembly election victories to  Paul V. Horcher, a Diamond Bar councilman, and Xavier Becerra, a state deputy  attorney general.  </P> <P> Pomona Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant was recalled from office 8,317 to 4,065.  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith, who has been Bryant's longtime opponent, hailed his removal.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of faith in the voters," Smith said. "I believed they wanted good  government in Pomona. I think we'll see the beginning of the healing process."  </P> <P> The recall campaign began more than a year ago after Bryant voted with other  council members to fire A. J. Wilson as city administrator. The effort picked  up steam a few months later when Bryant joined with other council members to  dismiss Richard Tefank as police chief.  </P> <P> Recall supporters accused Bryant of using his office to browbeat city employees  and to make scathing personal attacks. Bryant, who could not be reached for  comment after the election, has defended his strong attacks on others as  truthful and accused his opponents of waging a hate campaign.  </P> <P> A special election to replace Bryant will be scheduled within the next several  months.  </P> <P> In the county supervisor's race Tuesday, Sarah Flores, a former aide to  Supervisor Pete Schabarum, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien  led a field of 10 candidates to qualify for a runoff. However, a federal court  ruling in a redistricting suit earlier this week may force a new election. As  presently drawn, the 1st Supervisorial District takes in most of the San  Gabriel Valley from Arcadia eastward.  </P> <P> At the eastern edge of the San Gabriel Valley, Pomona Councilman Mark A. T.  Nymeyer lost a bid for the Republican nomination in the 65th Assembly District  to Jim Brulte, former aide to Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona).  </P> <P> The closest race was for the Republican nomination in the 52nd Assembly  District where Horcher, a 38-year-old attorney, edged Wil Baca, an  environmental activist from Hacienda Heights, by 64 votes.  </P> <P> Horcher benefited from a last-minute endorsement by state Sen. Frank Hill  (R-Whittier), who gave up the Assembly seat after winning election to the state  Senate earlier this year.  </P> <P> Horcher and Baca, both running as moderate conservatives, finished ahead of  Kenneth Manning, a member of the Hacienda La Puente school board, and Tony  Russo, a political aide, who each claimed to be the most conservative candidate  in the field.  </P> <P> Horcher and Baca were the only candidates who labeled themselves as pro-choice  on abortion, although opponents criticized Horcher for appearing to straddle  the issue by also opposing public funding of abortions and stressing his  personal convictions against abortion.  </P> <P> Baca said the results show that the 52nd District, which stretches from La  Mirada to West Covina, is "not nearly as conservative as people would like to  believe. This isn't Radical Right or Reagan Country."  </P> <P> Another losing candidate, Manning, said: "The conservative movement is losing  ground. This district is becoming more moderate and liberal."  </P> <P> But, Manning said, he thinks the election turned on "all the hit pieces and  junk at the very end." Manning said he was the victim of a phone-bank campaign  in which callers spread misinformation.  </P> <P> Harvey Englander, who managed Horcher's campaign, said Horcher won with a  strong appeal to mainstream Republicans, women and Asians.  </P> <P> Horcher received 4,456 votes to lead Baca, who had 4,392. Manning received  4,290 votes and Russo 3,466. Trailing the leaders were Wayne Grisham, a former  congressman and assemblyman, with 3,424 votes, and Phil Mautino, a Whittier  attorney, with 3,353.  </P> <P> In November, Horcher will face Democrat Gary Neely, a Diamond Bar marketing  consultant, in the runoff in the predominately Republican district.  </P> <P> Becerra's victory in the Democratic primary in the 59th Assembly District,  which includes Monterey Park, Alhambra and Montebello, surprised political  observers who had thought the contest was between Diane Martinez, a Garvey  school board member and daughter of Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park),  and Marta Maestas, who had the backing of state Sen. Charles M. Calderon  (D-Whittier), for whom she had worked as district representative.  </P> <P> But Becerra, who had the support of his former boss, state Sen. Art Torres  (D-Los Angeles), won 8,448 votes, compared to 6,786 for Maestas and 6,249 for  Martinez.  </P> <P> Calderon, who gave up the Assembly seat after winning election to the Senate  earlier this year, said Becerra won because Maestas and Martinez split the vote  and because he ran an aggressive anti-crime campaign and stressed ethics in  government. He noted that Becerra was perceived as an outsider running against  candidates with strong political backing.  </P> <P> "I think the electorate went for the outsider candidate because they are tired  of seeing business as usual," he said. "They want a change."  </P> <P> Because of a strong Democratic advantage in registration, Becerra, 32, of  Monterey Park, will be an overwhelming favorite to win the seat in November  against Republican primary winner Leland Lieberg, an Alhambra businessman, and  Libertarian candidate Steven Pencall.  </P> <P> In the 65th Assembly District, the endorsement of Bader, who is giving up his  Assembly seat to run against state Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino), paid off for  Brulte, his former chief of staff.  </P> <P> Brulte, 34, of Ontario, outpolled Nymeyer nearly 3 to 1, winning 21,121 votes  to Nymeyer's 7,228.  </P> <P> Brulte, who will face Democrat Robert Erwin, a Chino businessman, in November,  said he was "very surprised" that Nymeyer failed to carry his own city. The  margin was as wide in Pomona as it was in the remainder of the district, which  stretches eastward through Ontario and north to the High Desert.  </P> <P> Pomona voters also decided to revamp city government by enlarging the City  Council, and by electing members by district instead of citywide. In place of  the current system of four council members and a mayor, voters will elect six  council members by district and a mayor citywide, starting with the municipal  elections next year.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, a measure to give members of the Board of Directors their first  pay increase in 22 years was soundly defeated. "I thought it was the right time  for this kind of thing to go forward," said Mayor Jess Hughston. "I'm  disappointed at my misreading of the feelings of the people."  </P> <P> Hughston said the measure, which would have increased board members' maximum  monthly pay from $250 to $935, with additional compensation for participation  in community development commission meetings, suffered from lack of  salesmanship. "No effort whatsoever was made to push it," he said.  </P> <P> Ted Brown, an opponent of the measure and the Libertarian Party's candidate for  state insurance commissioner, said the vote "means that the people of Pasadena  are fiscally responsible."  </P> <P> Another Pasadena measure, making minor modifications in the city's growth  management ordinance, was approved.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Tina Griego and Edmund Newton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

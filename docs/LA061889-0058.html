			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA WEEKLY FOUNDERS WIN SINCLAIR AWARD  </P> <P> The Liberty Hill Foundation will present its seventh annual Upton Sinclair  award to the founders of LA Weekly.  </P> <P> Joie Davidow, Jay Levin, Ginger Varney and Michael Ventura, journalists who  started the weekly newspaper a decade ago, will be honored June 21 at a dinner  at the Beverly Hilton hotel.  </P> <P> The Liberty Hill Foundation is a charitable organization based in Santa Monica  that gives seed-money grants to community and social action groups.  </P> <P> The foundation is named for the spot near the harbor in San Pedro where  muckraker and social activist Upton Sinclair was arrested in 1923 after reading  the U.S. Constitution aloud to striking longshoremen.  </P> <P> The annual Upton Sinclair award dinner is the foundation's principal  fund-raising event. Past recipients of the award include performers Mike  Farrell, Ed Asner, Harry Belafonte and Edward James Olmos and director Martin  Ritt.  </P> <P> Foundation Director Michele Prichard said LA Weekly was being honored for its  coverage of the environment and other issues of social concern, and for taking  an active role in the community. Jim Becker, head of the foundation board,  praised the paper for being more than a compendium of advertisements and coming  events and "really going out on a limb to make a statement."  </P> <P> Tickets for the event are $175.  </P></p>

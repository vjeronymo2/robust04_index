"Hekmatyar has always welcomed visitors from Pakistan,"  Mangal Hoseyn said in a statement on the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic  Party of Afghanistan] leader's response to a planned mediation  trip to Kabul by Pakistani Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali.    The foreign minister had to put off a scheduled visit after  fighting broke out in Kabul on New Year's Day.    "We respect Pakistan's concern for peace and stability in  Afghanistan and are always ready to receive any delegation from  the brotherly country," Hoseyn said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The existing approach does not adequately address the compelling public interest in further ensuring seafood safety because sampling the large volume of seafood with FDA's limited resources cannot detect many violative products. Increasing the frequency of sampling and inspections is also unlikely to resolve this problem without significant increases in funding. These options are discussed extensively in the preamble to the proposed regulations and in the PRIA. The third option, voluntary HACCP, has been in existence at NOAA and has very few participants. The forth option, risk-based HACCP, has been evaluated in the PRIA in several forms, including HACCP only for the highest risk products from a historical perspective and HACCP only for those products with the potential for catastrophic risk. For example, one possibility evaluated under this option would be to implement HACCP solely for molluscan shellfish, which NAS and other groups have concluded constitute most of the risk from seafood. The sixth option is more costly than the proposed option and includes more reliance on CGMP's. Finally, the last option involves mandatory HACCP for nearly 1 million establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The options evaluated in the PRIA have both lower and higher costs than the proposed option. However, the benefits of all options are not equal to the proposed option. FDA has quantified net benefits of some of the high risk options and has found them to have been positive net benefits for those costs and benefits which have been quantified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These options are not all equal in terms of costs and benefits. They differ significantly from one another in this regard, as well as from the option that FDA has selected to propose as new part 123. They are also not equal in their ability to meet all the regulatory objectives stated in the preamble, including effective treatment of imports and an appropriate alignment of industry and government responsibilities. FDA seeks comment on the costs and benefits as well as on the general pros and cons of all the stated options and on any options that the agency may have overlooked. It is extremely important that FDA's evaluation of regulatory options be as thorough as possible for purposes of developing a final rule, and that the agency be able to fully articulate the distinctions among them and the significance of those distinctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> B. Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> There is no single source of data that FDA has found to be entirely satisfactory for developing a preliminary estimate of the costs of the proposed regulations. Consequently, FDA has considered two sources of information, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The results provide a range of possibilities, and FDA invites comment on them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first source is U.S. seafood processors that have actually implemented HACCP systems. The number of such firms may exceed 100. Understandably, many firms are reluctant to make public detailed information about the costs of operation; consequently, the information available to FDA from this source is incomplete. On the other hand, there is enough information from which some preliminary conclusions can be drawn that are relevant to an economic assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second source is a study of the costs of implementing a form of HACCP that was developed by the Department of Commerce for the congressionally mandated MSSP. That study was performed by an independent contractor for the National Fisheries Education and Research Foundation, Inc., and commissioned under a grant from NMFS. While these data are the most detailed available, fitting them to the proposed regulations required extensive adjustments and extrapolations. Thus, these data also fail to eliminate the considerable uncertainty of the results as they relate to these proposed regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Costs: Actual Industry Experience <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> FDA has some information relevant to the actual costs of implementing HACCP experienced by a number of seafood firms. While this information is neither detailed nor complete enough to definitively answer the question of how much the proposed regulations will cost the industry, it does provide insight into the costs of the proposed regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information includes responses to a 1991 evaluation questionnaire from four of the eight firms that participated in the FDA/NOAA seafood HACCP pilot in 1990&hyph;1991 (Ref. 40). It also includes information more recently provided to FDA from seven firms through the assistance of NFPA, and from two trade associations. The trade associations, the NFI and the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) provided FDA with summary information about member firms that were implementing HACCP systems. NEFDA has operated a HACCP pilot with member firms through a Federal grant. The two trade associations provided information on 16 firms. The seven firms that provided information about themselves through NFPA operate a total of 44 processing plants, so FDA has information on at least 64 plants (Ref. 129). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The firms represent a good cross section of processing operation types, including canned, fresh, frozen, smoked/salted, and cooked, ready-to-eat products as well as molluscan shellfish. The majority of firms were involved in HACCP as participants in either pilot programs, the NOAA fee-for-service program, or the State of Alaska program, and therefore have been subject to some form of third party verification of their HACCP systems. Virtually all of them developed HACCP plans, and the majority of these included critical control points for quality or economic fraud or both in addition to safety. In this respect, the majority of firms implemented a more extensive form of HACCP than is being proposed by FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

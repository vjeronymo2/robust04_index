			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / French growth grinds to halt in last quarter FRANCE'S economic growth ground to a halt in the final quarter of last year, as a collapse in industrial output brought a pause in the country's fragile recovery. This left the rise in gross domestic product for the year at a mere 1 per cent, said Insee, the state statistics institute. The result, slightly worse than most analysts were expecting, is well below the government's September budget estimate of 1.4 per cent. It represents a sharp fall from 2.8 per cent in 1990 and is the lowest GDP growth figure for eight years. 'This is largely corporate retrenchment, as a result of the perception that order books look low. . . . and that interest rates are too high for companies to manage ambitious expansion plans,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Mr Eric Taze-Bernard, senior economist at Banque Indosuez, said: 'The fall in German demand has hit French exports and the economy is now waiting for a signal from the US.' Manufacturing output fell in all sectors in the final quarter by 1.4 per cent, giving a 1 per cent decline for the year. Cars and transport equipment were worst hit, down 4 per cent in the last three months, reflecting October's three-week strike at Renault, the state-owned car-maker. The rate of stockbuilding also declined in the last quarter. Industrial investment fell by 1 per cent, the fifth consecutive quarterly decline, to end 3.6 per cent down for the year. Consumers' confidence seems unaffected. Household consumption rose by 0.7 per cent in the final quarter, bringing the rise for the year to 1.5 per cent. The morale of French industrialists continues to improve, according to Insee, AP-DJ adds. A survey carried out earlier this month found that optimism among the industrialists had returned to the level at the end of last year. Top executives were starting to anticipate a recovery in production levels that could be led by an upturn in the motor industry. Opinions on order books had improved after having deteriorated for two months, the institute said, and opinions on foreign demand were more favourable, especially in the automobile sector.</p>

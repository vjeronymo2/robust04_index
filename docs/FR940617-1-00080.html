			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In that same final rule, the agency acknowledged that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hexachlorophene containing surgical scrub drug products are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantive in their action and do not produce an initial high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction but with repeated use are effective in reducing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident skin flora and suppressing bacterial growth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> user's glove for up to 6 hours. Based on a lack of available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products capable of producing both an initial high reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resident skin flora and a prolonged microbial suppression  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketed at the time of the agency's action on the ingredient in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1972, the agency agreed with the recommendations of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Antimicrobial I Panel and concluded that the ingredient should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be marketed for use as a surgical scrub and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwashing as part of patient care. The agency stated its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intention to reconsider its criteria for evaluating such products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in light of risk-benefit judgments as new products containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both attributes become available (42 FR 63771).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since that final rule was issued in 1977, data have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the agency demonstrating the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgical hand scrub formulations capable of producing an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1-log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction and a suppression of microbial growth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wearer's glove for up to 6 hours. (See section I.E., comment 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on alcohol and section I.I., comment 17 on povidone-iodine.) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency notes that the persistence of the antimicrobial effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated by an alcohol-containing surgical hand scrub  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation was provided by a preservative agent in the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the new data, the agency has concerns about the risk associated with the initial use of substantive surgical hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrub formulations, and with the use of these formulations after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended lapses in their routine use. Therefore, the agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing that all surgical hand scrub formulations must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate an initial one-log reduction in the bacterial flora.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency invites comment on the use of substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the revised effectiveness criterion for these drug products, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is proposing a revised definition of a surgical hand scrub  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug product in &sect;333.403(c)(3) as follows: ``An antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> micro-organisms on intact skin; it is broad spectrum, fast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acting, and persistent.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that the modified ASTM procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing of health-care or antiseptic handwashes, surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand scrubs, and patient preoperative skin preps being proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for inclusion in the testing requirements provide protocols that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are appropriate for the final formulation testing of these drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. The proposed protocols describe, in detail, study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions and materials to be used and address the concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by the comments. For instance, the proposed protocol for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing of surgical hand scrub products includes a baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion for subject selection of equal to, or greater than, 1.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  bacteria per hand and specifies that a 50 to 100 mL volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sampling is to be used. The proposed protocols also specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for a number of areas not addressed by the testing guidelines proposed in the previous tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, they address statistical aspects of study design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data analysis, and the use of neutralizers. A positive control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is included in the protocols as a means of validating the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure, equipment, and facilities. The agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed protocols for the testing of these products provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a consistent approach to the effectiveness testing of health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel handwashes, surgical hand scrubs, and patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparations. The agency is incorporating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above criteria and testing requirements in proposed &sect;333.470 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this tentative final monograph and invites specific comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them at this time. After reviewing any submitted comments or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, the agency may revise the testing requirements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures prior to establishing a final monograph. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recognizes that the test procedures may need to be revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodically to reflect new information and newer techniques that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are developed and proven adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) National Committee for Clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory Standards, ``Methods for Dilution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bacteria that Grow Aerobically_2d ed.;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approved Standard,'' NCCLS Document M7&hyph;A2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10:8, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

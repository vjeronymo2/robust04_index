			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Tory election campaign hit by political truce The moratorium on campaigning after the death of John Smith, the Labour leader, appears to have done serious damage to the Conservative campaign for the European elections in south-west England. While Liberal Democrat activists campaigned quietly last week in the south-west, where they have their highest hopes of winning seats, the Conservatives restricted themselves to 'housekeeping chores' such as labelling election addresses. The Liberal Democrats avoided high-profile 'media events' or canvassing in strongly Labour areas, but several MPs visited the region. One Conservative official said the campaign 'hiatus' had been difficult to maintain: 'I don't think that people appreciate the extraordinary difficulty in the shutting of a campaign machine. Once it's stopped, it's very difficult to start up.' The Conservatives have not achieved the display of posters they had hoped for, and will mount only two or three more visits to the region by cabinet ministers before the final week of the campaign. Mr John Major, the prime minister, visited Cornwall on Monday, while the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, was in Dorset yesterday, in trips designed to boost local activists' morale and demonstrate that the party is vigorously contesting the region. The campaign is complicated by the south-west's large areas and sparse population covered in each constituency. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader, will visit each south-west constituency at least four times duringthe campaign, while there will be a visit from at least one of the party's MPs each day.</p>

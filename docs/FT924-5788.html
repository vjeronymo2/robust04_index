			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Threat to EFA project alleged THE vital all-party consensus on support for the European Fighter Aircraft project had been 'endangered' by Mr Malcolm Rifkind's 'intemperate' closing speech in this week's exports-to-Iraq debate, Labour warned yesterday, David Owen writes. Mr George Foulkes, a Labour defence spokesman, said the party's support for the EFA stemmed not just from the project's beneficial impact on jobs but from the need to procure the 'best possible' aircraft for the RAF and other air forces in democratic states. His remarks came as the government told MPs in defence questions that prospects for the EFA had 'brightened' very considerably in recent days. Mr Foulkes also urged the government to join Labour in endorsing a sales policy that excluded the sale of arms to military dictatorships.</p>

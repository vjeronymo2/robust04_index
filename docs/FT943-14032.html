			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not much use as defenders Sir, Hugh Dickinson's article on the royal title of defender of the faith reveals a slight misunderstanding of the relevant history (Truth of the Matter, July 9/10). Neither Henry VIII nor the next 10 sovereigns made the slightest use of it. It was resurrected by the politicians in support of George I and the protestant succession. Any continuity which fid def, or its variants, gives to the currency stretches back only to 1714. K M R Price, Shepherds Barn, Shelfield, Alcester, Warwickshire B49 6JW</p>

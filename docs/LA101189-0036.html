			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LONDON BAROQUE IN SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Chamber Music in Historic Sites matched genuine Baroque musical style with a  campy, mock-Baroque interior for the opening of the Nakamichi Brillante series  Monday evening. The site: the Second City Theater (ex Mayfair) in Santa Monica.  The players: London Baroque, an 11-year-old ensemble featuring some recent  personnel changes.  </P> <P> The exuberant performances fit the gaudy showcase -- its hospitable acoustic  compromised by an insistent buzz from the ceiling lights -- with an informal,  almost improvised feeling. The sense of convivial camaraderie -- and the length  of the concert -- were extended in a gracious and game but misplaced effort to  serve everyone coffee and dessert during intermission.  </P> <P> The musical goodies were presented with thorough respect, understanding and  affection for period practices -- original instruments, very low pitch,  ornamental elan, etc. Such attention to detail is no rarity these days for  historically oriented groups, but the bracing vitality, conversational approach  and sheer recreative joy of the playing is.  </P> <P> Violinists Hiro Kurosaki and Richard Gwilt, cellist Charles Medlam and  harpsichordist Lars Mortensen played trio sonatas by Corelli, Handel and Bach  as if the music had just been composed. Ideas were discovered and exchanged  seemingly spontaneously, in elastic tempos and pertinent phrasing. Balances and  textures were clear, and technique secure.  </P> <P> Kurosaki, a flamboyant fiddler and one of the newer members of the group, had  the engaging solo duties in an animal sound extravaganza by Biber, the Sonata  Representativa Avium. Mortensen, also new, gave an almost indolent, then  explosively speedy account of Bach's Prelude, Fugue and Allegro, while ensemble  leader Medlam proved eloquent although occasionally technically troubled in a  sonata by Vivaldi.  </P> <P> Kurosaki and Gwilt completed the printed program with the dazzling interplay of  an unaccompanied duet by Leclair. For their encore, the quartet turned to what  Medlam characterized as modern music -- a Church Sonata in D by Mozart.JOHN  HENKEN  </P></p>

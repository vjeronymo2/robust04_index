			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BALLET HISPANICO AT PLUMMER AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> Performing with great purity, energy, elegance and sensuality, the 12 dancers  of Ballet Hispanico of New York created a strong first impression at  Fullerton's Plummer Auditorium on Saturday. The program showed off their  versatility with a vivid, mural-like depiction of the Spanish conquest of  Mexico, a sultry whorehouse dance-drama and virtuosic solos evoking the  exuberance of Rio de Janeiro carnival revelers.  </P> <P> Talley Beatty's "Tres Cantos" (1975) -- to the music of Carlos Chavez, Lorenzo  Fernandez and Silvestre Revueltas -- evoked the dignity and pride of an Indian  society via tautly upright postures, thrusting arms, pliant torsos and a sober  weightedness reminiscent of the style of Martha Graham. The use of lengths of  fabric to convey the stifling control of the Spanish conquerors also suggested  a homage to the metaphorical use of cloth by Graham.  </P> <P> Among the more striking images was the covey of women in billowing cloaks who  paused, looking skyward with palms up, like a chorus of clairvoyants. As the  Indians' Leader, Pedro Ruiz created a dramatic aura with the keen attack and  sustained intensity of his movements. Swathed in a long cloak in the middle  conquest section, he seemed fatefully under the sway of the unseen  conquistadors, ever-so-slightly cantilevering his upper body while the music  shrilled tensely.  </P> <P> If "Cada Noche . . . Tango" (1988) was a disappointment to those who expected  to see couples doing the tango -- newly popular in the United States. in the  wake of "Tango Argentino" -- the piece did offer an unusually plausible  bordello scene, full of seemingly casual gestures that suddenly erupt into  violence. In Graciela Daniele's choreography, these men and women of the Buenos  Aires underclass are a microcosm of a society with strongly defined sexual  roles and touchy pride.  </P> <P> Amid the cigarette smoke, slouching figures and roaming hands, Ruiz and Jose  Costas pick an elaborately stylized fight. Eventually, as the raspy, sighing  taped accordion music of Astor Piazzola plays on, they form an aggressive  three-way relationship with proud and mysterious Nancy Turano. The pure dance  passages occurred in brief moments -- someone's walk, two women who suddenly  dip their knees twice -- that flashed out of the moody darkness.  </P> <P> "Batucada Fantastica," choreographed by Vincente Nebrada in 1982 to the  percussive music-with-chants of Luciano Perrone, concluded the program by  showcasing eight dancers in ultra-flexible, sometimes appealingly goofy parades  of movements that changed direction and shape with dizzying speed.  </P></p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: BES offers more variety - The tide of university schemes has abated. But others are available AS university business expansion schemes draw to an end because of the requirement that BES companies buy only empty properties, the latest offerings are more varied than the steady diet of university schemes issued over the summer when student accommodation was vacant. Sponsor Close Brothers has launched BESSA Bristol &amp; West, a cash-backed buy-back scheme which will mainly acquire repossessed properties and let them on assured tenancies. The exit price is 120p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to an annual return of 13.8 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. The offer is backed with sterling certificates of deposit. After the five year period, Residential Property Reversions, a private company, will buy back the properties. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Artesian Developer, from the Artesian Group, which has raised Pounds 37m in nine previous issues, aims to buy properties and some land with planning permission to make a profit from capital growth and rental yield after five years. Some properties can be let with minimal refurbishment but most will have the potential for further redevelopment. There is no guaranteed buy-back price but there is also no upper limit on the return. Investment Advice published by the British Taxpayers Association regrets the lack of detail on mangement costs. Best BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge Group, recommends the scheme for its experienced mangement team and low costs, while BESt Investment says that given the emphasis on capital return, much depends on the uplift from planning consents. The British Linen Bank, a subsidiary of Bank of Scotland, is sponsoring The Ettrick Premier Return Companies which aims to raise Pounds 20m to buy residential property in the UK, some from Bank of Scotland for letting under assured tenancy agreements. The contracted exit price is 120p and after four years, the properties will begin to be sold. Bank of Scotland will buy back any remaining at the end of five years. Johnson Fry is manager of the properties and company administrator. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Best BES Advice says: 'This product offers a first class covenant, well constructed exit arrangements and good underlying security. The return is a little light but for those investors for whom risk minimisation is paramount, this scheme should be attractive.' BESt Advice also gives the scheme a top rating but says: 'A high minimum subscription and competing returns make us conclude that there are currently better overall returns available elsewhere.' Turning away from assured tenancies, the Ecological Trading Company which has been in existence since 1989 aims to expand its trade in tropical timber from a number of community forestry projects in Papua New Guinea, Soloman Islands and Latin America. The company says: 'Community members themselves undertake the forestry operations and receive a far greater proportion of the benefits of these activities than would otherwise be the case. The ETC works closely with . . . organisations involved in community development and environmental protection to assist in the development of this type of small scale of small scale forestry operation.' The minimum investment is Pounds 500. Matrix Securities has launched an enterprise zone trust to buy South Quay in London's Docklands for Pounds 95m. The idea is that investors receive an initial cash profit and 80 per cent of any occupational rents or sales proceeds to a third party. The minimum subscription is Pounds 25,000. Analysts' comments will be covered next week.</p>

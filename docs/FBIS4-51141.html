			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China's rural bank  savings amounted to 700.5 billion yuan by the end of May 15,  thanks to a net increase of 90 billion during the January-May  period this year.    Ma Yongwei, president of the Agricultural Bank of China  (ABC)  pledged here today to wipe out "IOU" notes in the state purchase  of farm products in the summer and autumn harvest seasons.    The first four-and-a-half months of 1994 saw the fastest  growth of China's rural savings, a 57.4 billion yuan increase  compared with the same period last year.    The increase reflects a sound economic and financial  situation and improved ABC services, Ma told a press conference  today.    "Moreover, we can expect to have adequate fund resources to  finance grain purchases this year," Ma said, stressing: "We  shouldn't have any excuse to give farmers IOU notes instead of  cash for their harvests."    According to the forecast of relevant departments, output of  summer grain and rapeseed will exceed those of last year, if no  major natural disasters occur during the next couple of weeks.    Though easing funds strains for the ABC, the deposit  increase  adds some pressure to the bank's business operation, some ABC  officials noted.    Personal savings at present account for over 80 percent of  ABC's operational capital, "with high cost of funds and  considerable low-interest-rate policy lending, our bank is  hardly profitable," said Ma.    He revealed that the ABC netted about 2.2 billion yuan in  profits in 1993, the least among the four state specialized  banks. The most profitable bank in China is the Bank of China  which gained a profit of nearly 10 billion yuan last year.    However, a policy-oriented bank to finance agricultural  production will start operation in the near future. "When we  are relieved of policy lending, we have a brighter prospect to  look forward to," said Ma.</p>

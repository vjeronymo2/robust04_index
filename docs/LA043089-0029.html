			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANDING UP TO JAPAN  </P> <P> On the surface, "Standing Up to Japan" seemed a witty, cute picture of  California life in the suburbs. Unfortunately, Fallows missed two important  points in the 1980s relationship between Japanese and American cultures.  </P> <P> First, what America is copying from Japan is not its discipline, rigidity and  diligence, but quite the contrary -- a new, open, collegial, flexible, creative  approach to problem-solving and technological innovation.  </P> <P> The second point reveals that Fallows' Chevy got stalled in the 1950s and was  never recharged: American education has done far more than stratify society by  its SAT scores. Rather than separate "professionals" (doctors, lawyers) from  all the other less prestigious and lucrative workers, American higher education  has historically been the springboard for thousands of people into new,  never-thought-of-before careers -- careers that facilitate and support a  constantly changing technological society. Has Fallows wandered around a  college campus lately?  </P> <P> MONA RIDDALL  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

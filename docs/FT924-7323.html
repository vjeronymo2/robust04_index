			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Paribas sees loss in cement deal PARIBAS, one of France's high prestige banks, will suffer a FFr600m (Dollars 115.3m) loss of profits this year because of its involvement with Ciments Francais, the French cement company scarred by a scandal over its off-balance sheet losses. Ciments Francais, in which Paribas earlier this year agreed to sell a controlling stake to Italcementi of Italy, has been clouded by controversy since the discovery last month of off-balance sheet dealings of FFr1.05bn. The company recently confirmed the dealings had cost it FFr655m in exceptional losses during the first half of this year. This meant Paribas faced a reduction in its capital gains on the sale of its shares to Italcementi, and a fall in its share of Ciments Francais's estimated first half profits. Analysts anticipate net profits of less than FFr1.5bn from Paribas this year, against a loss of FFr184m in 1991.</p>

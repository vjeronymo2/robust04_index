			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: Two old pros let their hair down - Anthony Curtis greatly enjoys the correspondence between authors Flaubert and Sands FLAUBERT-SAND: THE CORRESPONDENCE translated by Francis Steegmuller and Barbara Bray Harvill Pounds 20, 428 pages SOMERSET Maugham said, 'I cannot believe that any English author would submit himself to the excruciating boredom of sitting for hours while a fellow novelist read him his latest work. In France it seem to be an understood thing that he should . . . ' Nowhere do we find the truth of that observation revealed more fully than in the correspondence between Flaubert and George Sand, spanning the decade from 1866 to 1876. Their letters have been well translated by Francis Steegmuller and Barbara Bray - he tackling Flaubert's, she those of George Sand, a division of labour that works perfectly. Brief notes link each letter, elucidating references and the travel movements of the two writers. Throughout Flaubert lived at Croisset near Rouen, his residence for his entire working life. He had his elderly mother to look after, with a niece and her husband to help him. He was always reluctant to leave his study at Croisset but did venture abroad from time to time, to go to Paris to see his publisher or attend one of the fortnightly dinners at the Magny Restaurant in the Latin Quarter with the Goncourts, Sainte-Beuve, Renan, Turgenev, Taine, Gautier and a few other regulars. At the start of the correspondence Flaubert, in his mid-forties, was already famous - or notorious - as the author of Madame Bovary and Salammbo; currently he was in the throes of writing L'Education Sentimentale. George Sand, 17 years older, was an equally well-established literary landmark, having long since passed her romantic youth and liaisons with Chopin and Musset. She lived 175 miles south of Paris, in rural seclusion at Nohant with her son Maurice and his wife and her two small grand-daughters whom she adored and helped to educate. But though she was a doting grand-mere, her career, her literary work, remained the top priority. Her annual output usually consisted of a novel, one or two plays and frequent journalism. The contrast between her amazing facility and Flaubert's hyper-perfectionism - long periods when he published nothing while he undertook interminable research and re-writes - could not be sharper. Yet they had immense respect and affection for each other, two old pros who were prepared to let their hair down in each other's company, giving us today a wonderful series of insights into French literary life. He calls her Chere Maitre - the feminine adjective with the masculine noun says it all. She refers to him, with a nice sense of irony, as her troubadour. There are many letters in which one party urges the other to come to stay for a few days or sends an invitation to a rendezvous in Paris. Occasional meetings did occur and it was then that the readings from work in progress that Maugham finds so bizarre took place. In 1868 Sand stayed at Croisset when Sentimental Education was nearing completion, and she recorded in her Diary: 'We went upstairs at nine o' clock. Flaubert read me three hundred excellent pages, which I think delightful. I went to bed at two. Coughed a lot. The tulip tree is covered with flowers'. Flaubert commented on the visit to another friend: 'Such character] Such strength] And at the same time there is no one whose company is more soothing. Her serenity is courageous'. As the correspondence develops Sand takes on the role of the counsellor and Flaubert the one in need of continual counselling. He complains to her of the obtuseness of reviewers, the rascality of his publisher, the stupidity of people in general. Apart from smoothing his ruffled feathers over such constant sources of rage, she consoles him on the death of his great friend Louis Bouilhet, the poet-librarian at Rouen; and she is there again to steady him when his mother dies and when his niece's husband's timber business suffers a serious financial reverse threatening Flaubert with penury. Even with two such dedicated writers operating from within their respective artistic fortresses, politics and contemporary history do break in on them from time to time. We read of the impact of the Franco-Prussian war and the Commune. When the invasion began Flaubert was deeply into work on the final draft of his fictional treatment of The Temptation of St Anthony and - horror of horrors] - he had Prussian soldiers billeted on him at Croisset. At least - 'My study they respected', he tells Sand choking with fury. She commented: 'We've all suffered in spirit more than ever before in our lives, and shall never cease to feel the wound'. Then, practical as always, adds: 'I wrote down my thoughts and impressions every day during the crisis and the Revue des Deux Mondes is publishing them in the form of a journal'. The correspondence ends with her death in 1876 aged 71. Flaubert's tribute to her indomitable devotion to her work and to humanity was the story he published - Un Coeur Simple - describing the uncomplaining goodness of a peasant woman whose huge capacity for love becomes fixated on her parrot. Before she died Sand, in a particularly explicit letter, defined their attitudes to their profession: 'My ambition has never flown as high as yours', she tells him: 'You want to write for all time: I think I shall be completely forgotten, perhaps severely denigrated, in fifty years' time'. She was right about him but wrong about herself. These two great writers' letters to each other make a deeply rewarding book.</p>

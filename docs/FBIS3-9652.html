Below we publish Arpad Goncz's replies to questions asked of  him by the Budapest correspondent for our newspaper.    [Lubczyk] The political and economic transformations which  the countries of East and Central Europe are going through are a  remarkable process. According to you, Mr. President, what have  we done with the freedom and democracy which have been  reinstated?    [Goncz] The most important matter is that we continue to  exist. That is a big accomplishment, both for the new Poland  and the new Hungary; it is a real achievement by both our  societies, especially when we consider the kind of devastation  the Cold War inflicted on people. Despite that, we established  democratic systems. In Hungary, we are getting ready for the  second free parliamentary elections. Regardless of many  reservations, deficiencies, and inadequacies in different walks  of life, it is my view that it is not just us -- Poles and  Hungarians -- that managed to adapt ourselves to the changes by  gradually getting rid of the mentality which was in effect for  decades. In my view, that process of adaptation to the new  situation, and also of replacing the old way of thinking with a  completely new one, is the essence of democracy. Of course, the  process has not been completed yet and it continues to be very  difficult; it requires constant sacrifices by people even though  they are already very tired of the reforms and of modernization.    Despite that, I think that our two societies have a more  optimistic vision of the future than Western societies; this is  a result of complicated and often tragic history and national  experiences. Perhaps this will sound a bit presumptuous, but  there is nobody that has been -- and still is -- affected more  by every tick of the clock both in the West and in the East than  Poles and Hungarians. That is one of the justifications for why  we should stick together.    [Lubczyk] According to what you are saying, Mr. President,  our two countries continue to go their ways. The elections in  Poland changed the political configuration there, and new forces  have taken over power in the Slovak Republic. How do you  explain this turn to the left?    [Goncz] I would rather not answer this question before the  elections in my country since some political parties could  immediately accuse me of making suggestions. As president, I  cannot deal with fortune telling. I will gladly address the  issue at the end of May.    [Lubczyk] So I will ask you at that point for additional  explanations and supplementary information, but right now I  suggest we just skip Hungary in our discussion.    [Goncz] The turn to the left can be explained relatively  easily. The phenomenon is also visible in the West, although in  slightly different proportions. After the euphoria and some  achievements, there occurred a crisis linked to the recession,  and societies simply hold it against the governing parties that  they are not capable of handling these problems. After all, new  authorities in postcommunist countries started off under tragic  conditions in many cases. What the first democratic governments  attempted to do, can even be compared to ... an attempt to  commit suicide. Often we are waging battles with the  impossible. While being extremely determined, we expect  outright miracles to happen! Of course, there is always a  chance to do something. I am not saying miracles do not happen,  but possibilities and chances must be evaluated realistically.    Under this very complicated social and economic situation of  individual countries, those who are in power right now must  continue to keep in mind that they are the last persons in the  world who could afford to ignore any principle of democracy and  that they must always take the people's will into account, and  to regard what society wants -- and not the authorities -- as  the most important thing. Every government can be replaced, but  societies and people cannot. [passage omitted]    [Lubczyk] After a few years of experience, what is your  evaluation of the president's place and role in establishing  democracy in Hungary?    [Goncz] Hungary's president has very limited powers.  Personally, I often find myself in awkward situations since  people tend to generally believe me and rely on me, whereas in  actual fact there is not a lot I can really do. So I think very  carefully about every word I say. It is a paradox that you are  hearing this from a writer, but only now have I come to really  appreciate the power of words.    [Lubczyk] Do you think that the powers of the "head of  state" should be amended?    [Goncz] I think I have no right to discuss the issue. Let  the political parties and society speak about this if they think  that is the right thing to do. I think that if a debate like  this were to take place, I should not participate in it.  [passage omitted]    [Lubczyk] Mr. President, how do you intend to utilize the  meetings with representatives of Polish authorities?    [Goncz] If I were going to Portugal or to Latin America,  then I could say that I am going there to make a "breakthrough"  with regard to this or that. But when it comes to Poland and  its people, that is a completely different story. I think that  being on the outside, as it were -- and also, I think, having  quite a good knowledge of Poland's historical and contemporary  winding roads -- I view your current problems in a slightly  different way than yourselves. And vice versa. I expect to  find answers to many questions during my talks with President  Walesa and with many other Polish politicians -- and also with  other kinds of people, by the way. Among others, my meeting  with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will be significant to me  since I think that we view some issues differently. I am sure  the current visit will also be helpful to President Lech Walesa  and myself so as to better prepare ourselves for the April  meeting of the "heads" of seven countries.    [Lubczyk] What are politics to you?    [Goncz] Politics is not an isolated term to me. I always  view politics from the perspective of society and through  people's behaviors and responses, among others to reforms being  introduced. Politics is a way to make life better.</p>

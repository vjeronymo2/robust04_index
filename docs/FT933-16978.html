			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / BR rift on profits for InterCity AN EMBARRASSING rift opened between British Rail and its InterCity subsidiary yesterday as the two published widely differing versions of how much profit InterCity made last year. British Rail announced that InterCity's operating profits had dropped from Pounds 90.6m the previous year to Pounds 65.1m because of the effects of recession. However, InterCity simultaneously announced that a combination of vigorous cost-cutting and innovative marketing had enabled it to push operating profits up from Pounds 2m to Pounds 10.9m. The discrepancy arose as British Rail published its annual results for the year to March using new accounting standards that boosted the group's profit-and-loss account by more than Pounds 100m. Under the old accounting system the recession-stricken railway would have reported pre-tax losses going up from Pounds 144.7m the previous year to Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m - the group's worst financial performance since 1985. Under the new system, intended to make BR's results conform more closely with normal commercial practice, group pre-tax losses appear as Pounds 163.9m, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 24.6m the previous year. BR used the new accounting system to calculate InterCity's operating profit. But InterCity separately announced its results under the old accounting system. BR's board disowned InterCity's version of the results. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, said it was pointless wasting time trying to calculate what InterCity's results might have been had the accounting system not changed. Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director, was on holiday. Before leaving, he said the old accounting system gave a more accurate picture of the underlying trends at InterCity. Network SouthEast made operating profits of Pounds 5m, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 19m; Regional Railways made Pounds 700,000 (restated loss of Pounds 3.4m); Trainload Freight made Pounds 103.1m (restated profit of Pounds 102.8m); and Railfreight Distribution lost Pounds 90.1m (restated loss of Pounds 107.5m). In addition, BR suffered a further fall in property profits, the Pounds 120m cost of making 8,000 workers redundant and a higher interest charge because of increased borrowings. The Labour party and unions accused BR and the government of using 'accountant's sleight of hand' to make the results look better as the railways approach privatisation. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour transport spokesman, said changing the accounting system was an attempt by the government to 'convince the money men that rail privatisation is an attractive proposition. I doubt if they are going to buy it.' Observer, Page 23 Lex, Page 24</p>

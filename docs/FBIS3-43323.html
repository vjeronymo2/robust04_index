			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Mobutu Sese Seko in Kinshasa on 4 </F> January on the occasion of Martyrs' Day -- live]    [Text] Very dear compatriots, at the beginning of this new  year, I want to express my best wishes of happiness, health, and  prosperity to the entire Zairian people and the various foreign  communities established in our country. I wish a prompt  recovery to all the hospitalized and ill members of our families  and eternal rest to those we are mourning.    Dear compatriots, according to the tradition, it was on the  night of 31 December 1993 that I should have expressed these  wishes to you, but I opted to do it today, on the anniversary of  our independence martyrs, for I want them to witness this. What  was the purpose of all the sufferings they endured, even to the  point of sacrificing their lives? Actually, it was to make  independent Zaire a stable and prosperous country, where all  citizens enjoy happiness. As one who was personally involved in  their struggle, first as a participant in the January 1960  political roundtable meeting, and second as a member of the  first government of the First Republic, and finally as one who  continues their work, I cannot, in my capacity as head of state,  remain indifferent to the disastrous situation prevailing in the  country. Today's address gives me the opportunity to take stock  of the state of the nation in order to draw a conclusion and the  true consequences of almost four years of hesitation and  confusion.    Dear compatriots, in April, it will be four years since  Zaire  has been mired in an endless transition toward the Third  Republic. Four years -- it is the duration of a presidential  term of office and of a full legislature in certain countries.  The year 1993 began with the (?28) January tragic lootings and  ended in an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis which has become  worse over the last months. I know the considerable sacrifices  this crisis cost us, mainly as a result of the political  instability prevailing in the country. I also know the  humiliation suffered by our ambassadors and diplomats abroad as  a result of many months of salary arrears. The new zaire  currency on which we were supposed to found our most realistic  hopes is already facing regrettably serious difficulties hardly  two months after its creation. The four-figure inflation rate  is an alarming sign of the situation of our national production  and then there is the issue of the skyrocketing prices of  essential commodities.    As a consequence, your country Zaire has lost its good image  while a look of general distress can be seen on the face of our  compatriots. Dear fellow citizens, in all the years I have been  leading the destiny of this country, I have never witnessed such  an acute social crisis that does not spare any social class.  Indeed, it is unacceptable that in this beautiful and rich  country, cassava, rice, peanut, and sugar -- which are local  products -- should go from 250 to 2500 new zaire in only a  month. That is an increase of 500 percent. In the same vein,  it is regrettable that the most elementary drugs should be out  of the reach of modest families; that patients in possession of  a medical prescription should be unable to get the prescribed  drugs. Finally, what about the endless lines at the fuel  stations, and the distressing spectacle of city dwellers walking  from their homes to their place of work?    Zaire is projecting the image of a country where poverty and  confusion prevail to such an extent that prices change following  mere circumstances. It can be in the morning, at noon, or in  the evening. In a word, Zaire appears today as a country  without a state, and its population as a completely disoriented  group of people without leadership; outlaws without any central  authority.    My dear compatriots, if economy is vital for a country, the  prevailing political climate remains the determining factor of  its prosperity. In the face of the current situation of chaos  and misery, only one word comes to our minds: Enough is enough.  From now on, we should strive to make 1994 a year during which  a genuine national policy of redress will be initiated. I will  fully assume my responsibilities in order to make 1994 a year of  stabilization for our institutions and rehabilitation of our  country whose vocation remains to be a rich and powerful country  as well as an important economic and sociocultural focal center  in Africa and in the world.    This policy of national reparation should be considered the  duty of us all; a challenge each of us faces. It is a challenge  for all socioprofessional categories -- politicians, financial  backers, agricultural workers -- in a word, everybody; from the  medical doctor to the medical auxilliary, from the engineer to  the worker, from the managing director and general secretary to  the bailiff, from the general to the soldier, from the  university lecturer to the student, even from the pastor and the  priest to the parishioner. All of us should come to our senses.  Each of us should assume his responsibility in his own field of  activity and resolutely engage on the path of national redress.    Dear compatriots, now that we have conducted this in-depth  analysis, I would like to particulary call on the military and  the politicians. There was a time when the Zairian military was  the object of our pride. I myself shared this legitimate pride  for an army that I created from scratch. The army had at its  disposal for its training, officers of great value, trained in  the best military academies from all over the world: Belgium,  China, Korea, Egypt, the United States of America, France,  Israel, just to name a few. Our military operations in Chad,  Togo and Rwanda, had forced admiration and respect for our Armed  Forces. But our army has lost all this today because of a  campaign of political disinformation that has dangerously  threatened all spirit of discipline, civic-mindedness,  patriotism, all qualities that make an army great.    The sad lootings perpetrated in 1991 and those that  followed,  are a regrettable illustration of this situation. Since these  unfortunate events, observers are attributing all the  misfortunes of Zaire to the military. This is just too bad.  The military should be aware of the fact that its contribution  is essential to the policy of national reparation. Its role is  to ensure order, peace as well as the security of the people and  their possessions. This is essential to the survival of the  nation itself. That is why, I hereby call on the military to be  from now on wary of demagogic and corrupt politicians who are  intent on sowing confusion and who, under the cover of the  night, distribute subversive and seditious leaflets in barracks,  inciting soldiers to rise against the authorities and the  established order. The same politicians -- when the day comes  -- are the ones who denigrate our Armed Forces and call on  foreign troops.    As for the politicians, I am convinced that only one logic  thought should now prevail in our minds: The organization of  elections. Elections that should be scheduled as soon as  possible, elections before anything else. Indeed, I believe  that the Zairian people need, more than ever, to be led by their  own representatives, that is, men and women whom they trust.    Dear fellow citizens, I hereby make an urgent call on the  politicians, in particular on those who negotiated at the  People's Palace, to meet again in order to draw up practical  modalities for the signing of the agreements reached after their  own consultations in order to enable the formation of a new  government before 12 January, a deadline I consider as the only  acceptable one that should not be exceeded. The political  consultation that took place at the People's Palace and that  lasted several weeks, resulted in several agreements. Everybody  agrees in Zaire that this was an honorable compromise that can  serve as an acceptable basis for a constructive, peaceful and a  consensual transition. The documents on the negotiations have  the great advantage of being in line with all the positive  aspects of the previous documents, notably that of the Sovereign  National Conference and the Kinshasa Political Conclave.  Therefore, they constitute an asset for all of us. Each party  has taken into account the concerns of the others; each party  has made concessions and all this in the interest of Zaire and  its people.    The special emissary of the United Nations secretary  general,  Mr. Lakhdar Braimi, has said that these accords were positive.  The French and Belgian ambassadors, as well as the charge  d'affaires of the United States, who came to see me in Gbadolite  on 10 December 1993, expressed on behalf of their governments  their wish to see Zairian politicians sign these accords  quickly. On this point, in order to guarantee a good conclusion  to the implementation of these accords, Monsignor Monsengwo and  the special emissary of the UN general secretary informed me  that the two sides involved in the negotiations had expressed  the wish that I should be more involved in these accords by  signing them also. Without hesitation, I agreed in principle,  but I am still waiting to be told where and when the signing  ceremony will be held. This is why I am calling on politicians  not to look in the the direction of the past that divided us,  but to be involved, without afterthought or veto, in what unites  us henceforth.    On my part, I reconfirm once again and solemnly my  determination to favor the pursuit and the conclusion of the  democratization process which I personally initiated on 24 April  1990. It is for this reason that I declare my preparedness to  sign immediately the accords that were concluded at the People's  Palace.    My dear compatriots, the implementation of the People's  Palace accords should rapidly lead us, as I have just recalled,  to the formation of a government that will rightfully reflect  this new spirit of confidence and cooperation. It will be a  representative government and sufficiently balanced in its  composition where each side will be represented. During the  negotiations, I carefully avoided intervening but I just said  that I will accept unreservedly any prime minister that will  bring back the consensus of the political class. I also said  and reaffirmed more than once that I have no objection that the  future prime minister should come from the opposition and that  it was even my wish that it be so. The new government should be  organized and should function in conformity with the letter and  the spirit of the People's Palace accords, especially the  special arrangement relating to the equal and balanced sharing  of power.    My dear compatriots, I have just defined to you the advanced  stage of the degradation of our country's economic and social  situation as well as the liquefaction of the authority of the  state and the loss of Zaire's international prestige. This  situation is due to the persistence of a confused political  situation. This is why, without hesitating, I had to give  precise guidelines to pull the country out of this impasse.    To conclude this message, I remind everyone that: First, I  have announced to the nation that henceforth Zaire is resolutely  committed to the irreversible logic of elections. Everything  will be done so that these elections are free, democratic, and  fair all levels -- presidential, legislative, municipal, and  local. These elections will be held before 31 December. Steps  are also being taken to assure that international organizations  as well as certain bodies that are specialized in elections can  assist us. Second, I asked the negotiators at the People's  Palace to sign without delay the accords that resulted from  their own discussions. The deadline given to them to conclude  this matter cannot go beyond eight days. Third, after this  deadline, I will assume my responsibilities, all my  responsibilities as head of state and guarantor of the nation.    My dear compatriots, with a deep faith in the future of a  great, prosperous, and worthy Zaire, I will like to express my  wish that the new year brings hope for the happy conclusion of  the democratic process to which we all are strongly committed.  Happy New Year 1994!</p>

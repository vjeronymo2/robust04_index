			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Bids for Continental intensify THE bidding battle for Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier that has been in bankruptcy since late-1990, intensified yesterday, as Aeromexico, Mexico's largest airline, joined in. A few hours later, the Air Canada investment group also increased its offer, by Dollars 25m to Dollars 425m (Pounds 248m). These developments followed news late on Monday that Scandinavian Air Systems, which has written off an earlier Dollars 106m investment in Continental but still holds a 16.8 per cent equity stake, might also become involved again. Aeromexico's involvement comes in conjunction with the investment group put together by a Houston-based financier, Mr Charles Hurwitz. Mr Hurwitz's group opened the auction for Continental in July, offering to infuse Dollars 350m into the bankrupt carrier for a 72 per cent equity stake. However, only Dollars 25m of this would have come in the form of an equity investment, with the rest from the sale of debt securities, backed by Continental assets. Yesterday's revised offer from the Hurwitz group, along with Aeromexico and other Mexican investors, suggests a total investment of Dollars 400m. No sooner had this offer been announced, than the Air Canada investment group raised the total value of its offer by Dollars 25m to Dollars 425m. Houston Air, Lufthansa and a group of former executives. have each declared an interest in Continental. A process for selecting a victorious bid for Continental has been agreed with the bankruptcy court. Firm written offers must be received by November 2.</p>

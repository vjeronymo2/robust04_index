			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 24 (TURAN)--Ibragim Ibragimli, first  deputy of Azerbaijan Popular Front (APF) told at today's  press-conference that a year ago, by transformation of Abulfaz  Elchibey's authorities of President to Head of Supreme Council  Geydar Aliyev, the Milli Mejlis legalized coup d'etat made by  Suret Huseynov on June 4, 1993.    According to Ibragimli, the situation in the country for the  past period became more complicated and the country is on the  edge of social explosion. He noted that the opposition  submitted to leadership a pact of anticrisis proposals, but has  not received an answer yet. "Leadership reinforced repressions  against opposition", said he.    Ali Kerimov, APF deputy for political issues noted that one  of the reasons of coup d'etat in the republic was a fraud of the  public. "An opinion, that if Geydar Aliyev comes to power, all  the problems in the country will be settled, was formed prior to  the coup d'etat, that is why the attitude of public to such  change of power was quite indifferent" said he.    According to Kerimov, over the past year, Azerbaijan on many  positions was trown back, due to that political and economic  life of Azerbaijan was damaged. "Azerbaijan's entering the CIS  and joining the Agreement for collective security was the reason  for location of foreign troops in the counrty, transformed state  border of Azerbaijan into the border of CIS. And involvment of  Russian company "Lucoil" to the unitised project for the  development of offshore oil reserves means the owning by Russia  the treasures, totalling several billion dollars", said Kerimov.    Kerimov noted that inconsistency and contradictoriness of  foreign policy brought to the loss of West's support in peaceful  settlement of Armenian-Azeri conflict. "After the new  leadership came to power, Azerbaijan had lost 20 percent of its  territories and more than million people became refugees", he  noted.    According to Kerimov, loss of professionalism in the  government brought the country to economic chaos; corruption and  bribery increased greately. "Present hard situation is not the  result of economic reforms, they have not begun in Azerbaijan  yet. It is the result of slovenliness and nonprofessionalism",  said Kerimov.    Kerimov said that Azerbaijan will not take part in the  demonstration, scheduled for June 25 by the Alliance of National  and Democratic Forces. According to him, the social and  economic situation in the country is so hard and tensitive that  there are a lot of facts which can drive the population and  separare groups to participate in the demonstration.</p>

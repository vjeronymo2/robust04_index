			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Call for review of new trunk roads FRIENDS of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, has called on the government to review its plans for trunk roads in order to save wildlife sites. The group claims that the decision this week not to go ahead with building a road through 8,000-year-old Oxleas Wood in south-east London should have wider implications. When he announced the decision to look for a new route for the east London river crossing, Mr John McGregor, transport secretary, said the scheme failed to meet 'the high environmental standards we now apply to new road schemes'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--Minister of Interior Hasan  al-Alfi has stressed Egypt's interest in and extreme eagerness  to respect human rights and said that reports on human rights  violations in prisons are false allegations aimed at tarnishing  Egypt's image abroad.    After opening an exhibition of prison agency products last  night, he said that Egypt is an advanced state with an ancient  civilization and respects human rights within the framework of  legitimacy and law. He noted that respect for human rights is  being taught at the Police Academy and at police institutions.    He pointed out that some hardened inmates inflict injuries  and say they were caused by police for revenge and then claim  afterward that they were tortured.    The minister of interior affirmed the security forces'  eagerness to respect human rights and said police victims  outnumbered those of the terrorists during confrontations.    Answering a question on the new security strategy in light  of  the Arab interior ministers conference held in Tunis recently,  he said there is a general agreement on views on security  because crimes of violence and terrorism are now a phenomenon  not only in Arab countries but in the world.    The minister of interior said work is continuously  developing  to curb crime and arrest criminals by modernizing agencies and  training personnel.</p>

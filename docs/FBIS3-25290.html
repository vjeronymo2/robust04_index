Max-Anicet Koumba, who returned to Gabon in January  after 13 years living in exile in France, said he chose the  party's name based on the fact that "our history does not begin  here in Gabon but dates back to our Gallic origin." He said the  Gabonese should "return to their pre- independence origins," and  said the new party attested to Gabon's strong ties with France.    "We are going on the basis that the name Gabon does not  reflect the reality in our country since it derives from a wine  of Portuguese origin, which as proud people we cannot accept,"  Koumba said, adding that he wants to hold a referendum to adopt  a "more serious name" for Gabon.    Koumba, while in exile, became one of the leaders of the  first opposition party MORENA [National Recovery Movement],  along with Paul Mba Abessole, a priest. Abessole was the  opposition's presidential candidate during elections last  December that were carried by Gabon's long-serving President  Omar Bongo.</p>

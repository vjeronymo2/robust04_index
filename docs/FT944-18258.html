			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (8): Digital sound is on the way - Radio The impact of technical change now sweeping through television is also likely to change the world of radio through the arrival of Digital Audio Broadcasting. Already satellites and cable networks are delivering compact disc quality sound to subscribers but digital sound is now on the way for all radio listeners, whether they are on the move with portable transistors or driving at speed along a motorway. Digital radio services, which of course need new receivers with more sophisticated microchips, will offer distortion-free and uninterrupted radio, with eventually the possibility of more efficient use of the radio spectrum and extra services. The BBC will announce formally later this month that it is to begin network transmissions of DAB next September in the London area and move to cover 60 per cent of the UK population within three years, coverage that would include the main urban areas and the country's motorway system. Further expansion would depend on the success of DAB but could in the end reach more than 99 per cent of the population. Though the BBC is believed to be the first broadcaster to commit itself to a full DAB service, experimental or pilot broadcasts already exist or are planned in Germany, Sweden, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and in Canada. As Mr Richard Norman, chairman of Brema, the UK consumer electronics trade organisation, put it recently: 'Digital Audio Broadcasting is the first substantive new system proposal to be put forward for broadcast radio since the introduction of VHF/FM some 40 years ago.' Progress on DAB is the result of nearly 10 years of collaboration between European broadcasters and the European electronics industry under the Eureka programme. Work on developing the system is now complete and a specification has been submitted to the European Telecommunication Standards Institute. The DAB system could have even greater significance for manufacturers and listeners and become the world radio standard for the 21st century. A group of UK companies is already at work on developing a low-cost design for a DAB receiver and the special VLSI (very large scale integration) chips for the receiver should be available this autumn. The BBC as a publicly funded broadcaster is taking on the responsibility of trying to circumvent the impasse that often stands in the way of the introduction of new broadcasting ventures - without a service there is no incentive for manufacturers to mass produce receivers and vice versa. Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, the body that regulates commercial radio in the UK, conceded recently that it would be the BBC rather than the commercial radio sector that would have to drive DAB forward initially. 'The world-at-large should not expect a rush into DAB broadcasting. It is more realistic to envisage a rolling commitment, with one or two independent broadcasters perhaps coming in at or near the leading edge and others joining them later as they see advantage in doing so,' he said. The growing momentum behind DAB in the UK comes at a time of increasing interest in radio generally, with a large number of new commercial stations coming on air. Last month alone, five regional commercial stations were launched, plus a Country and Western station for London. All the signs are that the commercial sector, which now commands 47.4 per cent of total listening in competition with the established networks of the BBC, should win a majority share by the end of this year or early 1995. Because of the number of new stations coming on air, the BBC is reconciled to losing some audience share although BBC Radio still attracts some 29m people every week. Indeed, the BBC deliberately repositioned Radio 1 to give it a more public service emphasis, losing millions of listeners as a result. Radio 5 Live, the combined news and sports network launched this year by the BBC is so far regularly reaching 4.5m adults. The commercial radio opportunities in the British market are also attracting foreign investors. Emmis Broadcasting of Indianapolis and CanWest, the Canadian-owned international broadcaster, are both investors in UK Talk Radio, the third national commercial station due to launch in February. NRJ, the French broadcaster which has taken its 'energy concept' to more than 10 cities in Europe, has joined MTV to apply for one of four new London licences on offer. The company wants to run a 'hot adult contemporary' station in London. Its continental rivals for the licence include CLT of Luxembourg, which also has extensive broadcasting interests across Europe. Apart from the new licences in a significant market where commercial radio has been relatively underdeveloped in the past, they are attracted by the sudden growth of radio in the UK. Commercial radio was once known as 'the 2 per cent medium' because it traditionally took only about 2 per cent of total advertising revenue. In the past 18 months this has grown to 4 per cent and some analysts think radio could hit 5 per cent by the end of the year. Commercial radio's gross advertising revenue for the second quarter of this year was Pounds 52.6m - representing year-on-year growth of 23.1 per cent. Such growth might even help to boost the spread of Digital Audio Broadcasting.</p>

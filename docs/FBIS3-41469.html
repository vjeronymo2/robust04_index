Financial and managing hardships hamper repairs in Latvia's  sole nuclear waste depot in the Radons enterprise while its  exisiting storing capacities are exhausted, Salmins said.    To solve the problem, the ministry will consult the Finance  Ministry's experts to calculate the sum needed to finish the  reconstruction and find a building organization to complete the  works.    The approximate sum is 150,000 lats, but the state budget  earmarked only 50,000 lats for the enterprise's reconstruction.    In addition, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Inspectorate  has until Jan. 24 to draft a program for ecological research in  Radons and its vicinity.    The Riga Radioisotopic Research Institute also nears the  brink of bankruptcy. This institute, like Radons, stores  radioactive waste. The institutes' scientists are commissioned  to forward proposals on the use and storage of radioactive  substances. They should also determine which substances to keep  and which to sell.    The National Environmental and Social Health Center will  compile a resolution on work with radioactive waste and prepare  a program for monitoring the residents' health in Radons'  vicinity.</p>

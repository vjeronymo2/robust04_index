			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Xining, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Qinghai, a  multinational province in northwest China, has worked out a  series of preferential policies to promote education among the  people of minority nationalities.    With 42 percent of its population being of the Tibetan, Hui,  Tu, Salar and Mongolian nationalities, Qinghai has made much  headway in education.    The province now has 1,598 schools for people of minority  nationalities with a total enrollment of 250,000.    The enrollment of school-age children in the province has  reached 85 percent, meeting the target set by the state Eighth  Five-Year Plan (1991-95).    However, the pace of educational development still cannot  meet the needs of local economic and social development,  especially compared with the country's developed areas.    The provincial government has worked out an educational  development program to boost education of people of minority  nationalities.    The program includes concrete measures and policies mainly  for solving existing problems such as low popularization rate of  primary education, slow progress of technical training,  illiteracy among peasants and nomadic herdsmen, poor school  facilities and the lack of teachers.    Governments at several levels will make joint efforts to  place priority on building six key senior middle schools, 30 key  junior middle schools and 191 key primary schools in the  province's six minority nationality autonomous prefectures.    Preferential treatment in funds, facilities and training  teachers will be granted to the six prefectures.    Universities and teacher's schools in the province are urged  to help the six minority nationality autonomous prefectures  train more teachers.    Local governments should work out preferential policies to  raise teachers' salaries and improve their living and working  condition.    Those teachers working in remote areas for over 15 years  will  have more favorable treatment in work, and their children will  be able to take part in university enrollment examinations.    The provincial government has decided to allocate 6 million  yuan for ethnic education each year and provide free textbooks  in minority nationality languages.    A fund for development of ethnic education in Qinghai will  be  established to attract both domestic and overseas funds.    Special concern will be given to education of girls of  minority nationalities, especially students in girls' schools  for Hui and Salar nationalities, most of whom are Muslims.    School fees can be waived for girl students whose families  have financial difficulties. Morning and evening classes will  be given to the girls.    Preferential policies will be given to minority nationality  students to enter institutions of higher learning, in particular  to enter teacher's universities.    Legal and other documents will be published to ensure smooth  progress of minority nationality education.</p>

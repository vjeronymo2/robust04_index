Dulnev: "From Direct Contact"]    [Text] It is important for a commander who is  organizing an offensive against a defending enemy from direct  contact with him to skillfully select the staging area, conduct  the required redeployment, create the combat formation and  precisely plan the battle. That is what is discussed in the  following article.    Quantitative and qualitative changes in weapons, and also  views on the nature of a modern combined arms battle, require a  more rational selection of the methods to transition to the  offensive. An offensive under conditions of direct contact with  the enemy from the position of the defense will be most typical  for subunits at the beginning of a war.    Redeployment of the battalion is conducted to concentrate  the  main personnel and equipment on the axis of the offensive and  the occupation by subunits of a staging area in the designated  areas. It must be simple in concept and be carried out in short  periods of time with accomplishment of measures to deceive the  enemy, as a rule, at night with strict observance of the mode of  activity of the defending subunits. In this case, the battalion  occupies a staging area [iskhodnyy rayon] and the company -- a  jumping-off position [iskhodnaya pozitsiya]. Furthermore, a tank  battalion can occupy an assembly area [vyzhidatelnaya pozitsiya].    First echelon motorized-rifle platoons and companies are  located in the first trench and their armored personnel vehicles  [BMP's] (armored transport vehicles [BTR's]) at fire positions  alongside their subunits or 50 meters behind them. When it is  impossible for armored personnel vehicles (armored transport  vehicles) to reach the leading edge without being detected, they  can be located jointly with the coordinating tank subunit at its  attack or assembly area.    The company's command-observation post is prepared at a  distance of 200 meters from the attack position and the  battalion's command-observation post -- at a distance of up to  300 meters behind the first echelon companies. The grenade  launcher platoon occupies fire positions at that same depth and  the antitank subunit -- at a distance of up to 100 meters.    A staging area is assigned to the battalion with the  calculation of ensuring the concealed disposition of subunits,  their least possible vulnerability from all types of weapons,  and favorable conditions to transition to the offensive. A  staging area is assigned to a first echelon motorized-rifle  battalion in the axis of its impending offensive within the  first position and, to a second echelon battalion -- normally  within the second position.    A motorized-rifle company's attack position consists of a  trench, the connecting trenches adjacent to it, and the fire  positions of BMP's (BTR's) and other weapons that are attached  to the company. In the process, a first echelon motorized-rifle  company is normally located in the first trench and the  battalion's second echelon company (reserve) occupies an attack  position in the second and third trenches. It is advisable to  leave in place the subunits that were in the battalion's second  echelon within the assigned action area from which they advance  to the final coordination line.    Tank subunits' attack positions can be designated at a  distance of 2-4 km from the leading edge of the enemy defense  under conditions that ensure their concealment from visual  surveillance and communications intercept. Otherwise, they are  located at the assembly area (5-7 km). That distance (with the  skillful utilization of terrain) caused the least vulnerability  of tanks from all types of enemy weapons.    The mortar (artillery) battery's fire position is usually  selected at that distance in order to ensure maximum utilization  of its fire capabilities. It can be up to 500 meters from the  first echelon companies' rear boundary.    A battalion that is occupying the defense in direct contact  with the enemy conducts a concealed redeployment. The battalion  commander defines its sequence and time periods in his orders.    A battalion commander issued the following order for  occupying a staging area for an offensive at a Northwestern  Group of Forces exercise (see the diagram).      "The mortar battery and the grenade launcher platoon  should occupy the fire positions indicated from 21:00 to 23:00  on 15.03. At the same time, the antitank platoon should deploy  at the line of fire positions behind the second trench in the  gap between 7th and 8th motorized-rifle companies.    "7th and 8th motorized-rifle companies occupy the  staging area at 23:00 on 15.03. Armored personnel vehicles  occupy fire positions behind their subunits. Driver-mechanics,  gunners and deputy platoon commanders remain in their BMP's. The  remaining personnel complete the engineering works of the  staging area.    "Until the initiation of the attack, 9th  motorized-rifle company remains in the previous defensive  position and advances on its axis after 7th motorized-rifle  company seizes the defensive position at hill 97.3.    "During the redeployment, the tank battalion (less a  tank company) is concentrated at the assembly area northwest of  Serovo. Advance to the final coordination line during the period  from "Ch" -- 0.22 to "Ch" --0.04.    "The 1st tank platoon remains at the positions occupied  and accomplishes fire missions through direct fire during the  period of preparation fire for the assault. With the 2nd  motorized rifle battalion's transition to the attack, the  platoon occupies its place in the 7th motorized-rifle company's  combat formation.    Conclude occupying the staging area by 04:00 on  15.04."    On the night prior to the offensive, the motorized-rifle  companies arrive at the attack positions. Guns and other weapons  that have been assigned to conduct direct fire, occupy prepared  fire positions. They are located in prepared shelters and  advance to conduct fire against assigned targets with the  initiation of preparatory fire for the assault.    At the attack position, subunits are at readiness to repel a  possible enemy offensive and observe the prescribed conduct  regime both on the forward edge and in the depth.    The battalion commander's work procedures to organize the  offensive will depend on the content of the mission received,  the nature of the probable enemy's operations, the availability  of time and other factors. With the occupation of the attack  position, the battalion commander organizes surveillance and  security, assigns the missions of repelling a possible enemy  attack and also strikes of enemy aviation and airmobile teams to  the companies and weapons, issues orders for additional engineer  preparation of positions and lines, while devoting special  attention to painstaking camouflage and accomplishment of  measures for protection of subunits from precision-guided  weapons.    During an offensive from a position of direct contact with  the enemy, the battalion commander conducts a large portion of  the work for the organization of the battle in the field (making  decisions, the commander's reconnaissance, assignment of combat  missions, organization of coordination, and effective engagement  of the enemy). In the process, special attention is devoted to  the commander's reconnaissance -- a distinctive type of  reconnaissance of the enemy and terrain at the attack position.    At the previously mentioned exercise, the battalion  commander  began it from a topographical and tactical orientation after  which he reported the latest data on the enemy to those  assembled. In the process, while utilizing terrain features  (orientation points), he precisely defined the trace of the  forward edge of the enemy defense, the disposition of enemy  defensive positions and weapons, especially antitank weapons --  ATGM's, guns, dug-in tanks, and BMP's, and indicated which  targets are being destroyed by the senior commander.    The terrain and enemy defense were most painstakingly  studied  in the depth of the immediate objective. The battalion commander  directed the attention of his subordinates to the presence and  nature of obstructions and obstacles, hidden accesses, open  flanks and gaps that must be exploited during the transition to  the attack.    At the commander's reconnaissance, he indicated on which  front the battalion is advancing, the first echelon companies,  their attack positions and combat missions and the axis of  concentration of the primary efforts. Officers inscribed on  working maps the revealed weapons, surveillance posts and other  enemy targets that were subjected to destruction by artillery  fire and also guns and tanks assigned for direct fire, ATGM's  and grenade launchers.    In the field, the battalion commander indicated the  positions  of organic and attached weapons, the locations of passages in  obstacles, locations for tanks to pass through, the procedures  for marking them, time for breaching obstacles and their  installation. The leader of the exercise who was present at the  commander's reconnaissance on the whole approved this procedure  of its conduct.    Precise assignment of combat missions to subunits is an  important task in the commander's work for organizing the  battle. They are disseminated to commanders in oral form through  the field order or field instruction, as a rule, immediately  after the commander's reconnaissance. Only that information is  disseminated that subordinates really need to clarify the  mission, assess the situation, make decisions, organize  coordination and prepare subunits for battle.    Under current conditions, especially high demands are made  on  the organization of coordination while preparing an offensive.  The task of the commander and staff consists of precisely  coordinating the combat efforts of a large number of personnel  and equipment. It is important that the orders for coordination  did not duplicate the field order but developed the issued  instructions and made them more specific.    The experience of the examined exercise attests that the  most  effective method of organizing coordination is when the  commander not only issues the required orders but also listens  to the reports of commanders of subordinate and attached  subunits on operating procedures with a subsequent run-through  of the most probable events of the impending battle.    After issuing the field order, the battalion commander  reported the goal and work procedures to the officers and  determined which questions there were on the organization of  coordination and how he should resolve them. Then, the  operations of subunits during the redeployment were coordinated  in detail: Procedures were established for companies (platoons)  to occupy attack positions for the offensive (2nd  motorized-rifle battalion commander's orders were cited above).    By running-through the tactical events, the officer  persistently strived for everyone to precisely master the  procedures for destruction of enemy weapons and personnel at  defensive positions during the period of preparation fire for  the assault. He played out urgent situations in the event the  enemy conducted counter preparation. The operations of tank  crewmen with artillery and combat helicopters on the procedures  for conducting fire during the transition to the attack and with  motorized-riflemen when tanks were passing through the attack  position were especially painstakingly coordinated.    The following were attained as a result of the battalion  commander's orders, a run-through of the tactical events, and  the reports of subordinates: A common understanding of the  missions and the techniques to accomplish them; painstaking  coordination of effective engagement of the enemy (by aviation,  artillery, our own weapons and neighbors' weapons) against  targets, facilities, axes, lines and time. The appropriate  adjustments were made to the operations of the antiaircraft  subunit for the cover of the battalion from enemy air strikes  and issues of flight safety of friendly aircraft during flyovers  in the fire zone, and measures were clarified for the  comprehensive support of the battle of battalion subunits and  communications between them.    After the dissemination of missions, planning of the  offensive battle and organization of coordination, the primary  goal of the battalion commander, his deputies and the battalion  staff -- is practical work in subordinate subunits. It is  carried out by verifying locally the precise accomplishment of  the issued field order, company commanders' knowledge of the  opposing enemy, and also their understanding of their missions.  Assistance was rendered in supplying them with everything  necessary, detected discrepancies were eliminated on the spot  and questions that arose were resolved as a result of monitoring  the timeliness and quality of the accomplishment of measures to  prepare for battle.    Great significance was assigned to the preparation of the  staging area. It was equipped in an engineering sense while  considering the redisposition of the battalion's combat  formation after redeployment and also ensuring reliable  protection of subunits from enemy precision-guided weapons.    An instructive example of the conduct of such measures -- is  the engineer preparation of the staging area for an offensive of  54th Rifle Division subunits in the East Prussian Operation  (January 1945). The position they occupied was prepared with  three trenches that were connected by a thick network of  passageways. One more trench, which was 120-150 meters from the  first, was dug to close with the enemy. Work to remove friendly  minefields was carried out during the five days prior to the  offensive. Preparation of passageways in enemy obstacles and  minefields was conducted during the night prior to the offensive  through the efforts of combat engineer squads and 4-5 automatic  riflemen were assigned to cover each of them.    With the initiation of preparation fire for the assault,  subunits that are in direct contact with the enemy use their  weapons to destroy and suppress enemy weapons and personnel in  defensive positions in the first position. While observing the  results of the fire, the battalion commander assigns missions to  the weapons to destroy the survivors and newly detected enemy  targets and monitors the timeliness of the preparation of  passageways in minefields.    During the course of preparation fire for the assault, tank  subunits advance and deploy in combat formation for the  transition to the attack. Armored personnel vehicles advance  behind them. During the attack, when tanks approach,  motorized-rifle subunit soldiers on foot prepare for it, based  upon the commanders' order, and dart out of their trenches  (foxholes) and, following the tanks, attack the enemy after the  tanks have passed the attack positions. During an attack in  armored personnel vehicles (armored transport vehicles),  motorized-rifle subunits disembark personnel in armored  personnel vehicles (armored transport vehicles) during the  preparation fire for the assault.    The seizure of enemy defensive positions in the first  position and exploitation of the offensive into the depth is  conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Field Manual  and depending on the developing situation.    In conclusion, let us stress that the redeployment of  subunits during an offensive from a position of direct contact  with the enemy is a multi-stage, strictly regulated task and  only comprehensively trained commanders are capable of  successfully carrying it out.

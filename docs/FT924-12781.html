			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Observer: Image problem The cinema-filling triumph of Dances with Wolves may prove to have wrong-footed the marketing plans of British Columbian ranchers. After all, the film made much of Kevin Costner joining Sioux braves in eating certain unmentionable parts of a bison. The ranchers are avid to put the said beast on family menus not just in North America, but throughout Europe. Hence a grand sampling at British Columbia House in London of 'Bison Bites', soon to go into bulk production. Alas, they bear a memorable resemblance to meat balls.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Italian pension cost rises The cost to the Italian state of the constitutional court decision on pensions arrears is still growing, according to the head of the INPS, which manages the country's state pension system. Italian press agencies reported yesterday that Mr Mario Colombo, INPS chairman, had estimated the pensions 'hole' at L32,500bn (Pounds 13.5bn) after capital revaluation and interest charges are taken into account and said it was still growing. Mr Colombo cited the figure at a meeting yesterday of the labour committee of the Italian parliament's upper house. The Italian constitutional court ruled two weeks ago that the government should make up the difference between reduced benefits and full pension entitlements, allegedly denied to as many as 600,000 pensioners since 1983. At the time, following meetings with Mr Colombo, Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, said the hole was at least L30,000bn.</p>

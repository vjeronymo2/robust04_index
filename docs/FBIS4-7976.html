			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "Koc, Zar": "Minister W. Kaczmarek in Szczecin: </F> Privatization of Shipyard a Success"]    [Text] "The privatization of the Szczecin Shipyard is one  of the most successful prototype models of privatization of  Polish enterprises and of the whole process of ownership  transformations," Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said yesterday  during a meeting with the leaders and representatives of the  shipyard's trade unions. "Thanks to it," he added, "the shipyard  returned to life from the condition of clinical death and  entered a phase of development that can legitimately be the envy  of other enterprises."    During yesterday's visit to Szczecin, Wieslaw Kaczmarek,  head  of the Ownership Transformations Ministry, met first with the  Szczecin Voivoda and a group of people representing various  local institutions, including the Treasury Chamber, the Economic  Tribunal, the West Pomeranian Chamber of Industry and Commerce,  an employers union, and the region's sugar-manufacturing plants.  The longest amount of time was devoted to the  sugar-manufacturing industry and the projects to create holding  groups to bring sugar-manufacturing plants together. There is a  proposal stipulating that such holding groups should be set up  before this year's sugar-refining campaign--that is, by August  at the latest. The sugar manufacturers agreed with the proposal  and added that, while they view the questions of ownership  transformations as important, they regard the matter of proper  organization of the sugar market--that is, an efficient sugar  sales system designed to protect them against mounting interest  liabilities on the loans they had taken out--as even more  essential to them now.    There was also discussion on the subject of ownership  transformations in Szczecin Voivodship, backed up by figures and  examples quoted to illustrate the current situation.    During the visit to the Szczecin Shipyard that came next on  his agenda, the minister spoke with approval of the shipyard  management's achievements. However, he also observed that the  tragedy of Polish shipyards consisted in the fact that each of  them had its own, different political sponsor. "It would be  best if these sponsors withdrew from that particular role and  looked at the shipyards from the perspective of economic  interests," Minister Kaczmarek added.    Going back to the questions of privatization and the  distribution of shares, the minister suggested to the trade  union representatives that they abandon the demand that 5  percent of shares be allocated to their unions and, instead,  have them placed in a pension fund as long-term capital  investment against the future pensions of employees who are  currently working at the shipyard.    At the headquarters of the Board of Directors of the Port of  Szczecin and Swinoujscie, where another press conference took  place, the minister spoke in favor of preserving a uniform model  for the port complex of Szczecin and Swinoujscie. He said that  he would support this view in parliament during the coming Sejm  debate on the maritime ports act.    In the afternoon, Minister W. Kaczmarek met with the  employees of the Ownership Transformations Ministry's Szczecin  agency, and later with the directors of three large construction  firms: ESPEBEPE SA [joint-stock company] Holding, Mostostal,  and SPBO Trojka.    Next on the minister's agenda came an open meeting with  political activists representing the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] group. During the debate, the participants voiced an  equal number of reservations about the methods used in the  privatization process and its social and economic effects, and  acknowledgments of the soundness of arguments pointing to the  evident progress in the implementation of the Polish model of  ownership transformations. A large number of questions asked  and points raised concerned matters extending far beyond the  minister's brief in relation to his sector.</p>

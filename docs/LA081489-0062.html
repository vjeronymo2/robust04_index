			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MAYAS' DEMISE: A WAR WITHIN?;  </P> <P> SITE REVEALS HEAVY FORTIFICATIONS  </P> <P> The mystery of the Maya demise has haunted anthropologists for centuries, but  researchers may be on the verge of solving the sudden disappearance of one of  history's most advanced civilizations.  </P> <P> The Maya were "the most sophisticated, literate, complex people in the New  World," according to anthropologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University.  They erected massive pyramids, created a highly accurate calendar, perfected  the art of astronomical observation, produced beautiful multicolored pottery  and intricately carved stone monuments and established widespread trade routes.  </P> <P> But after flourishing throughout much of Central America from the 3rd to the  8th Century, they all but disappeared in the 9th Century, dispersing into small  villages and seemingly losing most of their talents.  </P> <P> Historians and archeologists have long pondered the reasons for this downfall,  arguing at different times that losses of trade routes, changes in climate,  endemic disease and many other related factors contributed to their downfall.  In the past, most of the theories shared the premise that the Mayas were  largely a peace-loving people who engaged in limited warfare only for  ritualistic purposes and who met their demise through little fault of their  own.  </P> <P> But new discoveries made this summer in the lowlands of Guatemala by a team  headed by Demarest present a sharply different picture of the end of the Maya  era. Demarest has discovered a heavily fortified Mayan city, called Punta de  Chimino, that is "more massive than a medieval castle" in Europe.  </P> <P> In the nearby city of Dos Pilas, he has found hastily erected stoneworks that  suggest that the city was under heavy siege. These new discoveries, combined  with previous excavations in the area, indicate that, at the height of the  Mayan hegemony, the Mayan people were involved in ferocious internecine warfare  that sapped their vitality and tore apart the fabric of their civilization.  </P> <P> The researchers have few clues yet about what caused the sudden escalation of  warfare that brought about the end of Mayan civilization -- although some  evidence suggests the haunting possibility that it was triggered by  over-exploitation of the environment, deterioration of the soil and pressure on  food resources.  </P> <P> But even though they do not know why the warfare started, the scientists  believe they know who started it. Stelae (stone pillars with intricate  carvings) from Dos Pilas identify a leader, known only as Ruler 2 because  archeologists have not had time to translate his name, "who appears to be one  of the kings from the beginning of the 8th Century who embarked on a program of  territorial conquest," Demarest said.  </P> <P> Based on many recent discoveries of evidence of warfare, especially this  summer's, Demarest has concluded that, for a period of perhaps 50 to 60 years  beginning about AD 825, warfare spread like a contagion throughout the region.  Eventually, the economic system collapsed under the weight of the strain  imposed by the intense combat and defensive measures and individual states  within the area fell "like dominoes."  </P> <P> By far the most important discovery made this summer is the Punta de Chimino  site, which sits on a peninsula that juts into Lake Petexbatun in northwestern  Guatemala, four days' journey from Guatemala City by plane, Jeep, canoe and  mule. Researchers had known that a village existed on the site but had not  explored it.  </P> <P> "We went there to do a survey for a week," Demarest said by telephone from  Antigua, Guatemala, where he has been recuperating from pneumonia and the  parasitic diseases that are the bane of archeologists. The 36-year-old Demarest  is the leader of a team of several American and Guatemalan archeologists, a  dozen Vanderbilt graduate students and 50 Guatemalan workers that has been  granted an exclusive permit by the Guatemalan government to dig up hundreds of  square miles of the Mayan heartland in the Peten jungle. The $1-million project  is funded by the National Geographic Society, the H. F. Guggenheim Peace  Foundation and the largest archeological grant ever awarded by the National  Endowment for the Humanities.  </P> <P> Punta de Chimino "was not a very important component of our work," Demarest  said. But what they found there made them change their plans instantly.  </P> <P> The Mayas who lived in Punta de Chimino excavated a massive ditch, 450 feet  long and 50 feet deep, that cut the city off from the mainland, making it  completely surrounded by water. In excavating the ditch through bedrock,  Demarest said, the Mayas moved three times as much rock and stone as had been  used to construct the city itself. "It's as if the United States were spending  75% of its budget on defense," he said.  </P> <P> Punta de Chimino also had walls around its sides to protect it from attacks by  canoes, and protected portages through which food could be brought in during a  siege. "One of the reasons people have used to argue that Mayans were not  warlike was the fact that their centers were completely indefensible," he said.  "This is the exact opposite of that."  </P> <P> Inside the walls of Punta de Chimino, Demarest found "a kind of shrunken Mayan  state. It has all the characteristics of a Mayan ceremonial center, but on a  smaller scale." Included were a single ball court (the Mayas played a sort of  hybrid between soccer and basketball with great intensity; losers were  sometimes sacrificed), one temple, one funerary, one set of stairways with  hieroglyphics, and so on.  </P> <P> The fortress also had a large open area within the innermost wall that could  have been used as a refuge for the population from the mainland.  </P> <P> "It would have been almost impossible to take the place. It was really  impregnable," Demarest said. "Those are terms you don't normally use in  discussing Mayan architecture."  </P> <P> Punta de Chimino is "probably one of the few sites where the stereotype of  archeology is accurate," he said. "It's like Indiana Jones and the Temple of  Doom."  </P> <P> At nearby Dos Pilas, evidence of a different kind also suggests a sudden  intensification of warfare. Dos Pilas is the classic, indefensible Mayan city,  in the middle of the jungle with ready access from all sides. But sometime  toward the end of the 8th Century, the inhabitants of Dos Pilas erected two  concentric rings of walls around the center of the city, defacing monuments and  burying important artifacts in their haste.  </P> <P> Debris recovered from inside the walls indicates that large numbers of people  inhabited the area at least briefly, suggesting that the city was under siege.  When and how it fell, however, is still a mystery.  </P> <P> But before it did, Ruler 2 apparently conquered a number of smaller fortresses.  </P> <P> Demarest and his colleagues also discovered, but have only tentatively  explored, an extensive series of caves near Dos Pilas that have not been  entered by humans for more than 1,000 years. He believes that the caves may  also have been used as a place of refuge during a siege.  </P> <P> In one of the caves, they discovered ritual offerings of broken pots and flint  knives, as well as the mummified remains of a boy who had been sacrificed and  painted with red ocher. Exploring the unexpected caves "was one of the first  times I've found myself irrationally exhilarated," Demarest said.  </P> <P> Demarest's discoveries are so recent that few of his colleagues, aside from  those on the expedition itself, are aware of them. One who has been informed is  anthropologist Richard E. W. Adams of the University of Texas at San Antonio,  who thinks Demarest's discoveries are "swell stuff."  </P> <P> The new discoveries, Adams said, "go a long way toward documenting in detail  this whole business of warfare as an element in the collapse of the Mayan  civilization."  </P> <P> Archeologists' picture of the Mayan civilization has been gradually changing  over the last 20 years. Historians of Mayan art, in particular, had begun to  paint a picture of a more warlike population than had been previously believed.  </P> <P> Mayan hieroglyphics show repeated images of warriors clad in jaguar pelts or  bird-like costumes, bearing woven shields and lances, capturing the noble elite  of nearby tribes and bringing them back to their own temples for ritualistic  bloodletting, removal of their hearts and decapitation.  </P> <P> But this war was sharply circumscribed. Mayan art shows no instances of cities  under siege, temples ransacked, or any of the other depredations of large-scale  conflict. Instead, the fighting seems to be representative more of a rite of  passage for prestige than an actual combat for resources or plunder.  </P> <P> But about AD 825, Adams said, "something went terribly wrong" and kings like  Ruler 2 began actual conquest of nearby cities and settlements. By the middle  of that century, Dos Pilas had extended its hegemony to cover an area of nearly  690 square miles -- a huge amount of land in comparison to the areas controlled  by other Mayan cities -- before it ultimately collapsed.  </P> <P> "But if one group changes the rules (of warfare), other groups have to adopt  the new rules and you get a kind of arms race," Demarest said. "Intensification  of warfare spreads by contagion, and the ultimate result can be regional  devastation. In this case, the Dos Pilas hegemony broke up into heavily  fortified sites, small independent states warring rather savagely with each  other. It may not be the principal cause of the collapse of the Mayan  civilization, but it is certainly a principal cause."  </P></p>

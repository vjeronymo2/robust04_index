			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Thousands of ethnic Albanian workers kept factories at a standstill in  Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province. The strikes and sit-ins, fueled by a  Serbian-inspired purge of local Albanian leaders, erupted last week. The unrest  has spread to the biggest industrial plants in the province, where tension has  grown increasingly acute since nationalist riots in 1981. Serbia, the largest  of Yugoslavia's six republics, is waging a campaign to restore its political  control of Kosovo -- a province where ethnic Albanians heavily outnumber Serbs  and other Slavs. It was granted autonomy in 1974.  </P></p>

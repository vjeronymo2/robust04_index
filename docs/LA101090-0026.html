			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow: Jonathan Miller, artistic director of the Old Vic  Theater in London since January, 1988, has resigned after the theater's owner,  David Mirvish, announced last weekend that the last two productions of the  season would be scrapped because of financial difficulties. Miller, who had  planned to leave at the end of the season in March, was quoted in the London  Daily Telegraph as saying, "Now that the two plays have been cancelled I am  leaving right away since there is no point in my staying."

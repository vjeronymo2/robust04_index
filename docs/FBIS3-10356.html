			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Minister of Government German Quiroga stated  that the majority of people support the government and the  success of the strike in La Paz was the result of the scare  provoked by the Civic Committee.    Quiroga had to admit the La Paz Civic Committee's power and  the extent of the strike:    [Begin Quiroga recording] Services have been reduced because  of the pressures and the vehicles that blocked the streets. We  have stated that the strike has thus begun and that it continued  to increase. Approximately 70 percent of the banks opened but  all of them are now closed because of the pressures by the Civic  Committee brigades. The same thing occurred with transportation  in the Achachicala and Vino Tinto areas, where public buses were  stoned and microbus windows broken. The bus owners, obviously,  decided to suspend services.    Markets on Buenos Aires Avenue and even on Bilinquentes  Comunes Street were looted in the name of the Civic Committee.  Such actions by criminals caused fear, and the city of La Paz  probably will be completely paralyzed this afternoon. [end  recording]    Quiroga said the La Paz Civic Committee did not have to  declare this strike:    [Begin Quiroga recording] All the points proposed to the  government by the Civic Committee have been positively answered,  including the budget issue. They asked the government not to  reduce the department's budget. La Paz Department's total budget  was increased more than 8 million bolivianos under a system of  equal participation for the number of people in the department  in order to match the revenues of the cities with those of the  rural areas. This was explained in detail to La Paz Civic  Committee President Freire, but he stated that it was not  possible to suspend the strike at the time this was explained,  that is, at 8 p.m. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Quiroga concluded by saying that no confrontations occurred  in La Paz, and civic strikes were not observed in Beni and Pando  Departments.</p>

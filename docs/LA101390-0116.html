			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS GREETS NORTHROP CEO WITH ANGER  </P> <P> Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa was met with contempt Friday in his first  appearance before Congress since becoming the embattled firm's chief executive.  </P> <P> Kresa announced that Northrop would provide free of charge 110 badly needed  gyroscopes for Marine Corps jet fighters. But the gesture, worth about  $300,000, did little to placate members of the House Government Operations  Committee, which is investigating Northrop.  </P> <P> Kresa said he accepts "responsibility for past failures of individuals and of  management oversight" but portrayed the company as striving "to correct our  weaknesses" and asked that the company's contributions "on behalf of the  defense of this country" be considered.  </P> <P> For the next several hours, however, committee members attacked the firm as a  "corporate criminal" and for having a "culture of deceit."  </P> <P> "We keep hearing about the new Northrop, but I keep seeing the old Northrop,"  committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, witnesses from the Air Force and Boeing told the committee that  1,700 nuclear-armed cruise missiles are still using Northrop gyroscopes that  could freeze in operational use because they don't meet a cold-temperature  requirement.  </P> <P> The gyroscopes, which are used in a stabilization device called a flight data  transmitter, are filled with a fluid that freezes at between minus-40 degrees  and minus-55 degrees Fahrenheit. The flight data transmitter is supposed to  operate at high altitude at minus-65 degrees.  </P> <P> The potential for the fluid -- known as DC-200 -- to freeze was first  identified by Northrop in 1983 in a report written by a vice president, but the  report was not provided to Boeing, the missile's prime contractor, or to the  Air Force.  </P> <P> Two top Northrop executives, Joseph Yamron and Leopold Engler, were indicted on  criminal charges in the matter, but the Justice Department dropped the charges  earlier this year when Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 other felony counts.  </P> <P> Boeing Vice President Arlington Carter said, "It is shocking that (Northrop)  would have a document in 1983 that showed the . . . fluid would not meet the  specification."  </P> <P> Asked why Northrop failed to give the report to Boeing, Kresa said his efforts  to get answers have turned up "various and sundry reasons." The matter was not  viewed as a problem, he added.  </P> <P> It finally became public only after the start of a federal investigation; in  early 1988 Northrop belatedly notified Boeing of the problem.  </P> <P> Jack Jones, the Air Force's civilian supervisor for engineering on the cruise  missile, testified that Northrop's stabilization device for the missile still  does not meet specifications and must be fixed.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Jones said the Air Force is seeking to buy more of the Northrop  gyroscopes, because the Los Angeles-based company is the sole producer and the  Air Force needs about 48 a year for spare parts. Even though the Northrop  division that produces the gyroscopes is under a contract suspension, the Air  Force has sought a waiver of the suspension, Jones said.  </P> <P> Justice Department officials blame Jones, however, for relaxing the cold  temperature standards and undermining the prosecution of the two Northrop  executives.  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Savoy creates committee to find new chairman THE BOARD of the Savoy hotel group has asked a three-man committee to resolve the deadlock over who should take over its chairmanship when Sir Anthony Tuke retires in May next year. The committee members are Sir Oliver Wright, former British ambassador to the US, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of the Forte hotel group, and Mr John Sinclair, who was appointed to the Savoy board earlier this year. Sir Oliver, who was also ambassador to Denmark and Germany, has been on the Savoy board since 1987. The disagreement stems from Forte's attempt to take over Savoy during the 1980s. The acrimonious bid battle ended in 1989 with Forte owning the majority of Savoy shares but short of a majority of voting shares. Two Forte directors, Mr Forte and Mr Donald Main, the finance director, were appointed to the Savoy board. Forte undertook not to increase its shareholding in Savoy, which also owns Claridge's and the Connaught, before November 1994 and then only after giving 12 months' notice. This meant that if Forte wanted to increase its shareholding next November, it would have had to give notice at the beginning of this month. It did not do so, however, and is believed to prefer a negotiated settlement. The need to find a replacement for Sir Anthony has led to a re-emergence of the simmering antagonism between the two sides. The Savoy camp has proposed that either Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at Cazenove, or Mr Giles Shepard, the managing director, should become chairman. Forte has objected to both candidates. Forte's preferred candidate is Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court, but he is being opposed by some of the Savoy partisans on the board. The committee may look for an outside candidate acceptable to both sides.</p>

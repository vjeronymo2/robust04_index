			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 8TH-GRADE SCORES RISE; OTHERS FALL;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE COUNTY'S UP-AND-DOWN SCORES PRETTY WELL PARALLELED THOSE  STATEWIDE. EDUCATION OFFICIALS WERE ANALYZING LOWER SCORES IN THE THIRD AND  SIXTH GRADES.  </P> <P> Orange County eighth-graders showed significant improvement in California  Assessment Program results released Monday, but scores fell for third- and  sixth-graders, according to local educators and the California Department of  Education.  </P> <P> "The scores are kind of a mixed bag," conceded Bruce Givner, the Irvine Unified  School District's deputy superintendent for support services. "In Irvine,  they've remained consistently high for the past several years, but we did see  some slight declines."  </P> <P> Those remarks were echoed countywide, as educators hailed the junior high  school results while at the same time puzzling over the declines by younger  students.  </P> <P> Orange County's mixed results paralleled scores statewide. State Supt. of  Public Instruction Bill Honig, who announced the findings Monday morning,  combined his accolades for junior high school programs with concerns about the  dip in scores by younger children.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get a handle on the reasons for this decline," Honig said of  the statewide third- and sixth-grade results.  </P> <P> In tests administered last spring, eighth-graders made across-the-board  improvements over the scores students at that grade level had achieved the year  before. The statewide average in reading was 256, up four points; in math, the  average went up five points to 269; in history and social studies, it climbed  six points to 259, and in science, the average score rose to 267, a four-point  gain.  </P> <P> For third-graders, the statewide average in reading scores slid to 277, down  five points from last year's 282. Written language scores fell six points to  278, while math scores dipped three points to 278.  </P> <P> Sixth-graders averaged 262 in reading scores, a three-point decline; 269 in  written language, a drop of four points, and 267 in math, down three points.  </P> <P> The state also released Monday the average test scores for eighth-graders in  the state's larger districts. The figures -- which combine all four test areas  -- included changes from last year and the average change over the last three  years. The state average was 263, up five points over last year and up 16 since  1986.  </P> <P> The scores -- used to measure the performance of schools, not that of  individual students -- remained well above the national averages and above  California scores from several years ago, Honig said. The tests have a possible  500 points, but generally range from 100 to 400.  </P> <P> Although the state did not release a county-by-county breakdown for third- and  sixth-grade scores Monday, those figures, as well as the results for individual  schools, will be made public later this week.  </P> <P> Some state and Orange County educators who have already reviewed their schools'  test scores indicated that the county appears to track the statewide returns.  </P> <P> "They almost exactly mirror the state," said Patrick J. McCabe, administrator  of operations for CAP. "They're down three to five points in reading and math,  which is almost exactly the drop in the state figures."  </P> <P> Although cautioning against reading too much into a single year's sample,  several educators said they were in the process of reviewing the numbers to  decide whether curriculum changes are warranted.  </P> <P> Vergil Hettick, director of research and evaluation for Santa Ana Unified  School District, said the scores would "help us target schools that need help.  That's what we're doing."  </P> <P> Santa Ana Unified, the county's largest school district with about 42,000  students, has often finished near the bottom of the pack among Orange County  school districts on the CAP results, mainly because the district has a large  percentage of students with limited proficiency in English. Those students  often struggle with standardized tests in English, particularly the reading and  written-language portions, Hettick said.  </P> <P> Although Santa Ana's latest CAP scores rank the district below others in Orange  County, Santa Ana third-graders and eighth-graders did better than last year,  educators said, earning the district praise from state and county officials.  </P> <P> "Santa Ana is an excellent example of a district that is doing everything it  can with the language-proficiency issue," said Fred Lange, director of  instructional services for the Orange County Education Department.  </P> <P> "Just holding your own under those circumstances has got to be a challenge,  much less gaining," McCabe added. Large numbers of young students with limited  English entered California schools last year, he added, so many that more than  37% of the state's third-graders did not speak English as their native  language, a factor that several officials blamed for holding down test scores  in the lower grades.  </P> <P> The huge Los Angeles Unified School District, which contains 15% of the state's  students, averaged 219, showing a one-year growth of six points and a  three-year growth of nine. While the district remains well below the state  average, its gains are nonetheless substantial, McCabe said.  </P> <P> Honig credited the state's "deliberate, planned 'attack' " on junior high  school deficiencies since 1986 with bringing up statewide scores. A task force  reviewing the state's junior high schools called for sweeping reforms several  years ago, and Honig credited the group with ushering in improvements that are  reflected in the recent test scores.  </P> <P> Honig, who noted that the average Japanese eighth-grader was two years ahead of  an American eighth-grader in 1986, said the improvements have made California  students better-prepared. After three years of intensive state attention to  junior high school education, "we shaved 25% off that gap," he said. "If we  continue progress at this rate for the next decade, we will close the gap."  </P> <P> The performance of U.S. school graduates has been a source of increasing  consternation among many business leaders, who fear that Americans are not  well-prepared to compete in world markets.  </P> <P> The CAP tests have been administered each spring since 1974 to the state's  third-, sixth- and eighth-graders. High school seniors take the tests each  fall, and the results are released in the spring. Educators said that declines  in the third- and sixth-grade scores in part may be due to several peripheral  factors. In particular, they said the fact that the tests used in those grades  are several years old may mean that the tests no longer accurately challenge  what is being taught in the classroom.  </P> <P> Honig also said some teachers may have overreacted to a cheating scandal that  tainted the CAP system two years ago. Some test monitors may have prohibited  students from changing answers, he said, thus preventing them from correcting  their own mistakes.  </P> <P> Several Orange County districts confirmed that their third- and sixth-grade  scores had dipped along with the state average, but those declines were matched  by marked increases in eighth-grade results.  </P> <P> Ocean View Elementary and Orange Unified school districts registered the  county's largest gains in the results released Monday, both increasing by 12  points. Placentia Unified School District and Los Alamitos Unified School  District jumped 10 and nine points, respectively, and Irvine Unified School  District increased by nine points, bringing its average eighth-grade score to  330 points, the highest in the county.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, eighth-graders averaged seven points better on the current tests  compared to last year's.  </P> <P> Only Fullerton Elementary School District showed a lower score among  eighth-graders, and it dipped by only one point.  </P> <P> "There's no statistical significance to that," Assistant Supt. Ron Bennett  said, adding that CAP scores can misrepresent district's educational progress  by placing too much emphasis on a few wayward scores, skewing a small  district's average.  </P> <P> Newton reported from Orange County and Merl reported from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GRADE 8 AVERAGE TEST SCORES FOR LARGE DISTRICTS  </P> <P> California Assessment Program, 1988-89  </P> <TABLE

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Textiles suffer Courtaulds Textiles, one of the UK's leading textiles companies, saw its shares plunge 63p in pre-market trading after the company issued a stark profits warning. The company said poor trading in Europe would ensure that 1993 profits would not improve on last year's figure. Analysts cut their forecasts, with BZW coming down from Pounds 45m to Pounds 37m and SG Warburg now looking for Pounds 38m. Mr Laurence Rubin, Warburg's textiles analyst, said: 'I think the company underestimated the strength of recovery, particularly in France. Another analyst said: 'This was very bad news and a major surprise. I think the stock market has reacted quite correctly.' The shares ended the day 54 lower at 489p. Rival Coats Viyella fell initially, but it has said Courtaulds Textiles' problems are specific to the group rather than the industry and the share price recovered to end a penny firmer at 274p. However, William Baird fell 15 on the day to close at 242p, while Marks and Spencer, one of the leading sellers of Courtaulds Textiles' produce, lost 2 1/2 to 451 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 10m shares.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Tight cost controls and greater efficiency behind Fine Art rise SHARES IN Fine Art Developments rose 15p to 440p on news that the mail order and greetings card company had achieved a 12 per cent rise, to Pounds 29.7m, in pre-tax profits over the year to March 31. The rise from Pounds 26.6m was struck on turnover ahead a more modest 3 per cent to Pounds 287.3m. Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, said there were no indications of recovery in the retail sector - Fine Art's progress was gained through 'tight cost controls and increased efficiency'. The company had to 'really fight for its sales'. However, he acknowledged that, although manufacturers of white goods, for example, might suffer in a recession, the public tended to continue buying greetings cards, even if they traded down. In the same vein, Mr Chapman said Home Farm Hampers - the business where people pay throughout the year for food for a 'decent Christmas' - traditionally did well in hard times. Sales rose 65 per cent with a substantial increase in profits. Overall, the mail order side made operating profits of Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 18.7m) on turnover of Pounds 150m (Pounds 146m), helped by the Pounds 31m capital investment in an automated order fulfilment system at the warehouse at Accrington, Lancashire. However, both Express Gifts and the charities business suffered downturns in the value of average orders, though the overseas side - which serves markets in France, South Africa and Germany - made gains, especially in France. Since the year-end, Fine Art has expanded across the Atlantic with the acquisition of Tom-Wat of Connecticut for Dollars 1m (Pounds 550,000) cash. A provider of charity mail order services, it has annual turnover of Dollars 18m. The educational mail order business lifted profits and market share. Operating profits and turnover in the card and paper products division both rose 3 per cent to Pounds 19.3m and Pounds 137.4m respectively. The success of Hambledon Studios and Gallery Studios was offset by the small loss at Papertree, the retail chain. Mr Chapman said he wanted to cut the number of outlets, from the current 80 and the 115 of 18 months ago, to less than 70. Earnings rose 10 per cent to 25.36p (22.96p) per share and the proposed final dividend is lifted by 1p to 8.3p for a total of 11p (9.8p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Ocosingo, Mexico, 28 Jan (EFE) -- The Mexican  Army anticipates new outbreaks of violence in Chiapas and has  asked the population to take precautions between Saturday and  Monday [29-31 January] even though a cease-fire has been in  force in that area since 12 January.    According to several merchants and civilians in Ocosingo,  several Army members have told them not to leave the  municipality because there might be new confrontations.  Ocosingo was the scene of the bloodiest fighting during the  first 10 days of the conflict.    The reports, which the National Defense Secretariat (SDN)  could not confirm to EFE today, maintain that there is tense  calm in the town and that many residents have traveled to other  towns so they will not be trapped in new fighting.    "So far there are no official communiques, but if there are,  we will release them as soon as possible," a SDN spokesman said.  The SDN has neither confirmed nor denied that soldiers are on  alert in that town in Chiapas. For some days Ocosingo residents  have lacked potable water and telephone services for unexplained  reasons. The residents have asked the insurgents and the  government to begin peace talks as soon as possible so they can  resume their normal activities. [passage omitted]</p>

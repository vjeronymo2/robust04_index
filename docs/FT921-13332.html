			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Kroger issues warning KROGER, the large US supermarket chain which took on a hefty debt load as part of a defensive restructuring in 1988, warned yesterday that operating cash flow in the final quarter had slipped by between 5 and 7 per cent year-on-year. The full-year figures are due in early February, writes Nikki Tait. Kroger said that retail inflation had been negative in the final quarter as falling grocery and perishable prices were only partly offset by higher prices for health and beauty care items, pharmaceuticals and tobacco products.</p>

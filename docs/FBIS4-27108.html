			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Truculent Fascist Dictator Under `Civilian' Mask" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries a by-lined article titled "Truculent Fascist Dictator  Under 'Civilian' Veil."    Though the traitor Kim Yong-sam has paid lip-service to  "democratic politics" and "reformed politics" since he came to  power, he, in actuality, has pursued more cruel repressive  politics than the preceding military fascist dictators', the  article says, and continues:    The puppet beefed up the riot police by 17,000 men in his  first days in power and then by nearly 40,000 men of hundreds of  companies up to now. "Special detective teams" have been  installed at police stations throughout South Korea and more  than 1,500 "patrol cars 112" and other repressive equipment have  been additionally deployed there.    Now the notorious "National Security Law" remains unchanged  and such repressive tools as "the Security Planning Board," "the  secret affairs command" and "the police agency" have been  further expanded and strengthened in South Korea. This proves  that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a truculent fascist dictator  wearing the "civilian" mask.    The fascist clique have defined the South Korean Federation  of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the successor to the  National Council of Student Representatives (Chondaehyop), as "a  pro-North organization" and "an organization benefiting the  enemy." They made abortive by force the talks between students  in the North and the South and the fourth pan-national rally in  Seoul in June and August last year and, worse still, they  arrested hundreds of students on the spot and jailed the  chairman of Hanchongnyon and many other core elements of the  student movement on the charge of violations of the "National  Security Law."    The fascist clique have also suppressed the struggle of the  workers for vital rights and democratic freedom by invoking even  "the emergency arbitration power," which the preceding dictators  had not dared employ.    When peasants and people of other strata and students  demonstrated against agricultural market opening on February 1,  the Kim Yong-sam group mobilized 130 companies of riot police  more than 15,000 strong and let them fire multiple teargas  canisters at the demonstrators, leaving many of them wounded,  and walk off some 400 demonstrators.    There is nothing to be expected from the Kim Yong-sam  fascist  regime. It is only too clear that with this regime left alone,  it is impossible to meet the demand of the people for  independence, ensure their democratic rights and achieve  national reunification.</p>

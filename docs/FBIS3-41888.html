			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow December 29 TASS -- The Russian Central  Machine-Building Research Institute has demonstrated a new  method of destroying chemical weapons today, using conversion  technologies of the missile and space complex. The method was  developed in the framework of the state scientific-technical  programme ``security.''    Member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, A. Panushi,  pointed out in his report that the new method is based on  rendering safe super-toxic substances, including chemical  weapons. This thermal-chemical technology has considerable  advantages over domestic and foreign technologies based on a  conventional low-temperature and plasma combustion. The newly  designed method relies on the principle and instruments used in  rocket engines.    Apart from technologies, the process of the destruction of  main components of chemical weapons was demonstrated using an  experimental installation designed by the Central  Machine-Building Research Institute of the Russian Space Agency.  A mobile model of this installation makes it possible to  destroy chemical weapons and other super-toxic substances  directly in their storage places.    Russian minister for the environment, Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, and vice-president of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Konstantin Frolov, who took part in the discussion of  the new method, pointed out the importance of conducted  experiments and their prospects both for Russia, the CIS and  other countries.</p>

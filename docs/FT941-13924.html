			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Check your pension options - Expert advice is needed to prevent short-term gain becoming long-term expense / Expatriates Foreign assignments are viewed by many employees as a lucrative and exciting perk but the short-term financial gains can be undermined by long-term damage to your pension. It is wise to seek expert advice to check the value and security of pension arrangements because there is no UK standard expatriate pension package. There are several options to consider - remaining in the UK scheme, setting up an offshore arrangement, or joining the local scheme in the country of assignment. Helen Cox, partner with international law firm Clifford Chance, said: 'Whatever arrangement you settle for, it is important to check that you are not losing out in terms of the continuity and level of your pension benefits. In some expatriate contracts, employers guarantee that you will be no worse off as a result of your secondment than if you had stayed in the UK in the main company scheme.' Remain in UK company scheme Under UK law it is possible to remain in the company scheme for up to 10 years provided your employer meets qualifying rules, although you might hit a three-year time limit if your company is a UK subsidiary of a foreign one. Brian Waite, international consultant with actuaries William M Mercer, says: 'Most employees going abroad for a single assignment for, say, three or five years, prefer to stay in their UK company pension scheme if they think they are going to return to the UK at the end of the assignment. All their benefits will then come from one source in one currency, and they do not have to chase around trying to track down benefits from overseas employers when they come to retire in 30 years.' Taxation is the main stumbling block in any expatriate pension package and retention in the UK scheme is no exception. Most schemes in Europe, for example, work on the principle of tax deferment and so, although they allow tax relief on contributions, the pension itself is taxed (with some exceptions such as the tax-free cash lump sum on retirement in the UK). Clearly, employees who claim relief on contributions in one country but pay tax on the pension in another, upset the fiscal balance. As a result many foreign tax authorities will treat an expatriate's pension contributions paid by the UK employer to the UK scheme as extra income and will tax them accordingly. The EU is struggling to create a more equitable and flexible system to allow expatriate workers to remain in their home country scheme and retain all the tax reliefs, but progress is slow and in the meantime exiles should check carefully how their pension contributions will be treated for tax purposes in the country of assignment. Unfunded promise It is not the pension promise that causes difficulties but the funding of that promise. For this reason some employers offer an 'unfunded promise' where the usual pension benefits are provided during the secondment but there is no fund to back that guarantee. In spite of their apparent simplicity, there are significant risks associated with unfunded promises. For example, how safe would your pension be if the company went into liquidation or was taken over by a hostile predator? What would happen if you left to work for a rival company and tried to take a transfer of pension benefits? Where there is no specific fund earmarked for the pension covering the period of secondment this could prove very difficult. Offshore trusts Offshore pension trusts can be an effective and tax-efficient way of providing pension benefits for senior executives, particularly if their career makes it impossible for them to remain within the UK company scheme. The trust, often sited in the Channel Islands, can be designed to provide higher benefits and earlier retirement than the main UK company scheme. Where the employee plans to retire abroad the trust can be set up to pay benefits in different currencies. Offshore trusts are complex and must be arranged by a reputable firm of benefits consultants and legal experts and should be backed by documentation. Other options If the job abroad is for a foreign employer, it is worth looking at the local company pension scheme. In some cases, membership of the company pension scheme may be a condition of employment. If you join a foreign scheme, you should qualify for employer contributions and all the tax reliefs associated with locally-approved pension arrangements. The downside is that because of different minimum qualifying periods, you may have to work for several years before you have the right to any pension at all. Furthermore, it may be difficult to transfer your benefits out of the country if you leave. Other alternatives include a local individual private pension plan, if this type of product is available, or an offshore plan. Beware of offshore plans sold by insurance companies. Charges and commissions may be very high and the contract may lock you into a fixed period of contribution. If your secondment is cut short and you return to the UK you could face punitive early termination penalties. State pensions State pensions are funded through national insurance contributions. Normally, when you work abroad for more than a year, you will leave the UK social security scheme and pay into the local system. While UK pensions are meagre, in most European countries they are more substantial. A pan-European Union system allows you to aggregate the number of years you have paid national insurance contributions in different EU countries in order to meet the various minimum qualifying periods that apply. However, when planning for retirement, it is important to remember that the age at which you can claim the state pension varies from 60 to 67 depending on the country of source.

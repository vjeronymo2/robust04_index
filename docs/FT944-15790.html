			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Danish road/rail link Denmark's Prince Joachim became the first person to walk under the Great Belt strait at the weekend, through a railway tunnel that is Denmark's largest engineering project. The five-mile tunnel is part of a rail and road link across the strait that separates Copenhagen on the main Baltic island of Zealand, from the Jutland peninsula. The last part of the DKr21.6bn (Pounds 2.27bn) project, a road bridge which will connect Zealand to the island of Sprogo, is under construction. Trains are expected to cross the Great Belt in 1996, and road traffic the year after.</p>

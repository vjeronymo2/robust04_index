Gu Jinchi, Wen Shizhen, and Guo  Tingbiao attended and addressed the conference.    Monetary departments in the province made great efforts to  carry out rectification and reform last year. Their year-end  amount of savings deposits totaled 161.6 billion yuan, an  increase of 26.1 billion yuan over the figure calculated at the  beginning of the year; and their year-end amount of loans  totaled 200.7 billion yuan, an increase of 34.7 billion yuan.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  pointed out at the conference: Whether the economy is promoted  is the major criterion to judge whether good results are  achieved in monetary reform. Therefore, monetary departments in  the province should seize the opportunity, boldly emancipate  their mind, exert active efforts to achieve progress, and make a  new step in improving their operating mechanism and ease the  shortage of funds.    Wen Shizhen and Guo Tingbiao said in their speeches:  Shortage of funds remains to be a conspicuous problem in  economic reform in the new year. Therefore, it is hoped that  monetary departments will resolve four issues in the period  prior to and after the Spring Festival. First, they should  ensure the regular expenses on staff members and workers.  Second, they should make sure that no IOU is issued to peasants  during the purchases of farm and sideline products. Third, they  should ensure the commodity supplies during the festival.  Fourth, they should supply funds on a priority basis for the  purchases of raw materials and fuels needed in industrial  production.</p>

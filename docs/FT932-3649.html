			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Books: From pilferer to playwright - The extraordinary life and reputation of Jean Genet GENET by Edmund White Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 25, 820 pages IN THE exhibition Paris Post War: Art and Existentialism 1945-55 that opened earlier this week at the Tate Gallery there is a portrait of Jean Genet painted in 1955 by his friend, the Paris-based, Swiss-born Alberto Giacometti. The painter and the writer had both been adopted as significant manifestations of the spirit of Existentialism by Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. In 1952 Sartre wrote a book about Genet aimed to canonise him as a secular saint of the movement - Saint Genet, comedien et martyr. It was an attempt through a series of paradoxes to justify Genet's criminal way of life as an example of supreme courage. In 1954 Sartre published a major article on Giacometti in which he praised Giacometti's art more soberly than he had Genet's. He pointed especially to the sense of distance between the spectator and the subject Giacometti created in sculpture and in portrait painting. This is noticeable in the Genet portrait in the Tate. Observing this portrait, it is difficult to believe that the strong stoical figure it depicts was once a French borstal boy, a petty thief with convictions running into double figures, a vagrant over much of pre-war Europe and a male prostitute. Like Sartre's tome, the portrait celebrates the transformation of Genet from being all those things in his youth to becoming in his maturity a French writer of international stature, whom several fine critics on both sides of the Channel and the Atlantic think it is appropriate to speak of in the same breath as Proust. How was this transformation effected? And is the claim that Genet's place belongs among the truly great really valid? Edmund White's vast but never otiose biography deals with the first question in the greatest detail, giving us a fascinating answer based on many years of research. As for the second, although he is not concerned to argue the literary critical case for Genet as such, he leaves us in no doubt by his treatment of the works in relation to the life - the early volumes of autobiographical fiction as well as the later and much better known plays - that he regards Genet as being, after Proust, the most important modern French writer. White's task was made the more difficult by Genet's consistent disregard for truth in the ordinary sense of the word. He was a compulsive liar, a fantasist when giving any kind of account of his early life. With infinite patience White has sifted truth from fabrication. Jean Genet was born in 1910 to a father about whom nothing is known beyond his name - Genet - and a 22-year-old unmarried mother who abandoned her child when he was seven months old. He was then fostered to a family in the market town of Alligny-en-Morvan in the Niere. The couple loved Genet as if he were one of their own. They instructed him in the tenets of their faith, made a choirboy of him and sent him to the local primary school. Genet usually came top of the class and on merit should have gone from there right up through the system, but for a boy of Genet's background, a welfare ward, it did not work out quite like that. Instead he was given the option of going to a training centre near Paris offering courses in printing and cabinet-making. After two weeks he had run away and started that pattern of truancy, theft, recapture, rehabilitation and recidivism, that marked his early life from then on. There were periods when he lived as a young tramp, followed by sojourns in various psychiatric clinics for juveniles, and a brief but educative period as assistant to a blind composer of popular music from whom he embezzled money entrusted to him. In the end Genet landed himself in a situation which not even he with all his street-wise cunning could wriggle out of. He was sent to 'the children's prison' of Mettray, an agricultural penitentiary colony. The great theme of Genet's work - domination and submission - in everyday life, in sexual relations, in hierarchical masturbation fantasy, was nurtured at Mettray. The two and a half years Genet spent there, before he joined the army from which he eventually deserted, were later glorified by Genet as the time when he learnt to live entirely on his own resources. Even from his fictional accounts - in Miracle of the Rose and The Thief's Journal - it sounds like hell on earth. The older boys brutalised and raped the younger ones. Yet Genet managed to do an amazing amount of reading under these conditions. Leaving Mettray concludes Act One of his life. In Act Two he emerges as an outsider in society, a writer of poetry and prose pilfering to make ends meet, nicking books from shops and open stalls that he rapidly re-sells. He becomes the passive lover of a number of young men from the criminal class. He impresses the educated people he meets by the range of his reading, the apercus of his conversation and his dandyism. As the second war looms he is excited by the trial of a murderer with whom he sympathises Now Genet starts to lever himself into the Parisian literary world. By the time of the Occupation he has made contact with Cocteau, who was at the height of his passion for Jean Marais. Cocteau befriends Genet and is crucial in the promotion of his early works. If Cocteau was ambivalent in his behaviour towards the German authorities during the Occupation, Genet, in his loathing of the French bourgeoisie, positively sympathised with the Nazis. After Jouvet's production of The Maids in 1947, Genet's gifts as a playwright whose work was balanced on a knife-edge between fantasy and reality took off in The Balcony, The Blacks, The Screens. Though few in number, these plays, with their brilliant use of ritual, put him in the same league as Beckett, Brecht, Pirandello. Genet became the centre of an international post-war cult. He no longer needed the protection of anyone. His blazingly original and frankly obscene prose books were a landmark in the history of gay liberation. Yet while he was granted an official free pardon for his former crimes, he still needed to steal. While in Giacometti's studio, for instance, he took away a drawing the artist had done of Matisse. Bursts of creativity alternated with long periods of isolation and hibernation abroad. Even now, with all the acclaim, Genet remained deeply subversive. He supported the Algerian Arabs against the French colonialists and then became a champion of the Black Panthers and the Palestinians. He witnessed the massacre at Shatila in Lebanon and wrote movingly about it. In his last book, Prisoner of Love, he identified with those peoples searching for a homeland. White gives an interesting account of the later works, film projects and scripts. Unlike Proust, Genet has yet to find a translator into English who will give him the readership outside France that he deserves. This remarkable biography will arouse fresh interest in his work as a whole and make us realise that there is much more to Genet than the plays that are already regarded as modern classics.</p>

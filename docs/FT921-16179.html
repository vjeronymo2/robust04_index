			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Thursday puzzle Why must the next UK general election be held on a Thursday? An election can in law take place on any weekday. In 1924, for instance, the voters of Britain went to the polls on a Wednesday, and in 1931 the date was a Tuesday. But since 1935, general elections have always been held on a Thursday. According to David Butler, the well-known psephologist, Thursday is generally considered to be the least inconvenient day of the week for the purpose of an election. However, others have suggested that it may have something to do with the fact that it is the day before pay-day, and in olden times the lower orders would not have any money to spend on rival distractions to the polling booth. Whatever the reason, the next general election may well be the last to be held on a Thursday. The vast majority of Britain's EC partners hold theirs on a Sunday and no doubt Brussels will soon be arguing for a common electoral policy requiring Britain to hold elections at weekends.</p>

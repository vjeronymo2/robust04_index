			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on  Wednesday voted down a censure motion against Farm Minister  Eijiro Hata over the government's decision last December to open  its rice market to imports.    The motion, submitted last December by the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was rejected at an upper house  plenary session by a vote of 130 against and 106 for.    Some members of ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ]  were expected to support the motion, but they voted against it  or were absent from the vote, resulting in the rejection.    Several SDP members played a key role in voting down  government- proposed political reform bills last Friday,  refusing to obey the party leadership and joining the opposition  in voting against the bills.    A censure motion was last cast in June 1992 against Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in connection with the nation's  cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. That motion was  also voted down.    The LDP cast censure motions against Agriculture, Forestry  and Fisheries Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  last December after the government accepted a proposal to  partially open Japan's markets to foreign-made rice.    The proposal was made as part of final negotiations in the  Uruguay Round of global trade talks under the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    It calls for Japan to open 4 to 8 percent of its domestic  rice market as "minimum access" for imports in exchange for a  six-year moratorium for replacing all import restrictions with  tariffs.    The upper house had delayed deliberation on the motions to  concentrate on political reform bills. It did not take a vote  on the motion against the foreign minister.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Portuguese News Agency LUSA: "Government Will </F> Spend $600 million to Repair Roads"]    [Text] Finance Minister Eneias Comiche said yesterday that,  until 1996, the country will invest $600 million to repair Grade  A and Grade B roads. Speaking at a seminar in Lisbon under the  theme: "Mozambique -- Attractive Investment Opportunities",  sponsored by Ernest Young Company, Eneias Comiche stressed that  Mozambique has a propitious atmosphere for foreign investment,  particularly Portuguese investment. He also said the country  was a "door to southern Africa."    The Mozambican minister who was addressing over 200  entrepreneurs, said the southern African region where Mozambique  is found, has a market of more than 100 million inhabitants.  Eneias Comiche stressed the existing potential for Portuguese  investors in the field of the reorganization of the state  enterprise sector, particularly with regard to privatization.    The minister said the Government gives priority to  agricultural sector (particularly in the fields of cashew nuts,  copra, and cotton) to attract Direct Foreign Investment. Eneias  Comiche said this was an attractive sector because it deals with  exports and other kinds of commodities which reduce imports and  generate foreign exchange. He said other important sectors  include the tourism and hotel industry, services, and the  financial and insurance sectors.    The minister said the banking sector will not be privatized  right away, pointing out that a study will be carried out until  the middle of this year. "Only afterward, will we examine the  possibility of accepting private participation in the sector",  he said.    Comiche said Portuguese investors have expressed interest in  the fields of banking, insurance, infrastructure, and mining.</p>

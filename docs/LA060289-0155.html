			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: SCHULLER IS A BIG HIT AT HAMMER'S BIRTHDAY BASH  </P> <P> Comedian Danny Thomas may have been the emcee for Dr. Armand Hammer's fancy  91st birthday bash Sunday, but it was the Rev. Robert H. Schuller who got the  biggest laugh.  </P> <P> "Oh Lord," the pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove prayed during  his invocation at the Beverly Hilton, "please help our dear friend Armand  Hammer live to be 100. We just have to keep on meeting like this!"  </P> <P> It wasn't the first time Schuller has delivered an invocation for Hammer, the  billionaire philanthropist who is the head of Occidental Petroleum Corp. Last  year, Schuller gave the invocation at Hammer's very fancy Big Nine-O splash at  the Watergate Hotel in Washington, having arrived there with the likes of  Abigail Phillips (Dear Abby), Jane and Jerry Weintraub and Rhonda Fleming on  Hammer's private 737 jet.  </P> <P> Schuller has been hot on the celebrity inspiration circuit for years. He  consoled John Wayne as the Duke was waging his war on cancer. He comforted  Hammer when the industrialist lost his only brother. Last year, he was invited  by Vice President George Bush to inspire the masses before Bush gave his  acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. And recently, good  friend Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucille Ball, invited him to give the sermon at  her mother's funeral.  </P> <P> But although he is often surrounded by worldly glitter and face after adoring  face -- no less than Helen Hayes and Jimmy Stewart were beaming back at him on  Sunday -- Schuller's head doesn't seem to be turned.  </P> <P> "I'm not so great," he said, taking a break from a lively chat with Danny  Thomas and Art Linkletter. "It's just that I'm living longer (than they are)  and meeting more people."  </P> <P> And they adore him.  </P> <P> What's his secret? He moves them, seems to wrap their own thoughts in upbeat  words and does it without trying to bring them to tears. On Sunday, for  example, Schuller beseeched "God to bless Dr. Armand Hammer, the world's first  global entrepreneur . . . the man who knocked the word impossible out of his  dictionary!"  </P> <P> And, at Miss Ball's funeral in Saint Monica's Catholic Church in Santa Monica,  he told the small gathering: "She was God's gift to the whole world, because  she was a gift of humor. And humor is a gift of healing. And a gift of healing  is a gift of hope. When you laugh, you are being set up for having hope."  </P> <P> Celebrating an Annenberg: The numbers were staggering at the tribute to Wallis  Annenberg staged at the Beverly Hilton on Wednesday night: 984 guests paying  $500-per-couple and $650,000 in proceeds. So were the names: Annenberg herself  (daughter of Walter Annenberg), Jimmy Stewart, Ali McGraw, Steve Allen, Joan  Rivers . . .  </P> <P> But big benefit numbers have always been the bottom line for Bob and Beverly  Cohen of Newport Beach, co-chairmen for the past 5 years of the benefit for the  Sephardic Hebrew Academy in Los Angeles. "Money is the only bottom line," said  Beverly, glowing in diamonds and a gown paved with black bugle beads. "And we  give our guests a fabulous party, so we have quite a following."  </P> <P> The dynamic Cohens are newish residents of Newport, having purchased John  Wayne's old bay-front digs in January for $6.5 million.  </P> <P> And since their move here, the question that weighed heavily on the minds of  local movers and shakers: When do they plan to bring their fund-raising moxie  to Orange County?  </P> <P> "We're not sure yet," said Bob, a developer who has half-interest in the Four  Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. "I think Beverly could use a rest for a year or  two."  </P> <P> "But here's what works," Beverly said. "A tribute that is served up before  </P> <P> the main course, so the honoree can sit back and enjoy dinner."  </P> <P> Here's what else worked: the black-tie optional event was a kosher affair, with  stuffed cabbage rolls, potato knishes and smoked salmon proffered on silver  trays during the short-but-sweet cocktail hour. The main course: perfectly  cooked prime rib delivered, steaming hot, on silver trays; and French apple  cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert.  </P> <P> The only hitch: seconds before the brocade curtains parted to allow guests to  stream into the International Ballroom for dinner, Beverly was informed that  the horseradish had been deemed not kosher by a rabbi in attendance.  "Whaaaaaat?" Beverly asked the food service director who delivered the bad  news. "Ask another rabbi," she said. So the director asked another rabbi. He  said horseradish was kosher. But the other rabbi would not hear of it. "Well,"  Beverly said with a tiny sigh. "We just won't have any then. But, can you  imagine not having horseradish with prime rib?" Of course not. But with the  dazzling Cohens oozing their bubbly charm throughout the meal, nobody noticed  the difference.  </P></p>

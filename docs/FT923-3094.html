			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Ashdown warned off pact with Labour: Liberal Democrats open conference in Harrogate Call for independent Bank of England MR PADDY ASHDOWN re-ceived a blunt warning from his party's grassroots activists yesterday not to respond to the Conservatives' fourth general election victory in April by seeking electoral deals with the Labour party. As the Liberal Democrats opened their annual conference in Harrogate with a searching analysis of their election failure, several influential activists blamed fear of a Labour-Liberal coalition. But Mr Ashdown, who responded to the election result with a call for the party to act as the catalyst for a broad anti-Conservative coalition, won some support for his argument that the party should keep open the option of a dialogue with Mr John Smith, Labour leader. Speaking as the conference debate opened, Mr Ashdown emphasised that his aim was to mobilise anti-Tory support from across the opposition spectrum - including from those who had opted out of politics - rather than to strike a 'cosy' deal with Labour. He drew an analogy with the success in the early 1980s of the Social Democratic party in attracting millions of previously uncommitted voters. 'I have not the slightest intention of allying this party with a Labour party that remains unelectable,' he said. However, he also insisted that dialogue with Mr Smith on issues such as electoral reform and in areas where the two parties' policies coincided should not be ruled out along with electoral pacts. Opinion among grassroots activists in yesterday afternoon's four-hour discussion of strategy hardened around a renewed commitment to the community politics which many see as the bedrock of third-party success. Speakers showed little inclination to appeal to those who voted Conservative in the election and spoke repeatedly of the need to end the sequence of Tory governments. But fierce antagonism towards Labour was a marked characteristic of the debate. Ms Liz Lynne, the recently elected MP for Rochdale, said to applause: 'We don't achieve our objectives by making pacts, doing deals or by having massive dialogue with the Labour party.' However, Mr Tom McNally, a former MP, said the priority had to be to get rid of the Conservative government. 'I'm not talking about pacts or deals, I'm talking about keeping options open and having a dialogue,' he said. 'It would be a betrayal of the millions who have suffered under this government if we didn't undertake that dialogue to get rid of this government.'</p>

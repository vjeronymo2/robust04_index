			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Provisions force Five Oaks to Pounds 7.9m loss Provisions amounting to Pounds 8.3m against the value of development properties put Five Oaks Investments into losses of Pounds 7.88m in the first half to December 31, against Pounds 431,000. At the operating level this property investor and developer rose to Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 622,000); but interest payable of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 191,000) reduced profits to Pounds 423,000 before provisions. There is no interim dividend (0.6p), but directors intend to pay a dividend for the full year. The first-half loss worked through at 16p (0.66p earnings) per share.</p>

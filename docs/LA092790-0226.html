			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ SINGER HAILS FROM COUNTRY ROOTS;  </P> <P> PROFILE: DESPITE HER DEVOTED JAZZ-BLUES FOLLOWING, MAXINE WELDON SAYS, "MY  BASIC FEELING IS COUNTRY-WESTERN," WHICH SHE LEARNED TO LOVE FROM HER FATHER.  SHE'S IN LAGUNA NIGUEL TONIGHT.  </P> <P> It's 10 p.m. on a Friday night at Marla's Memory Lane in Los Angeles, and the  crowd is getting impatient. It has heard a nifty five-piece band, led by  trumpeter Bobby Rodriguez, blow through a couple of standards, and it listened  while veteran comedian Renaldo Rey jabbered away on an assortment of colorful  topics ("What are those blues singers talking about? Drink muddy water? Sleep  in a hollow log? You'd have to be nuts!").  </P> <P> But then the band strikes up again, and suddenly Maxine Weldon is there,  singing in hard, clear tones, swaying to a rocking-chair rhythm while her voice  slides from a conspiratorial whisper into a full-blown cry.  </P> <P> Her delivery is so genuine that members of the audience feel compelled to  respond, offering encouragement, or nodding their heads and saying, "That's  exactly how it happened."  </P> <P> Weldon, who appears tonight at Laguna Niguel's Design Center South, offers the  crowd some blues, jazz standards ("My Romance," "When I Fall in Love"), and an  original entitled "Lend Me Your Life." She even does a country tune, Gary  Stewart's "You're Place or Mine." But with a jazz quintet providing the  instrumentals, the song's roots are hardly identifiable, even though her  phrasing, as it is on almost every number, has that in-the-saddle, C &amp; W  swing.  </P> <P> "My basic feeling is country-Western," the singer said recently from her home  in Beverly Hills. "A lot of the songs I do in my show are country-Western. They  may not sound like country-Western songs because we're doing it without the  guitar and we're doing it a little up, at a little faster tempo."  </P> <P> The singer, born in Holdenville, Okla., and reared in Bakersfield, credits her  father for childhood exposure to country. "My father loved country and Western,  he was a great fan of Red Foley and Roy Acuff. I was, too, and I still enjoy  it."  </P> <P> But despite the fact that her father taught music and that she "was always  involved in some music program or another," the kinds of music she heard at  home were limited.  </P> <P> "We couldn't listen to jazz and blues around the house at all because my  parents were very religious. It was considered sinful to listen to it, that it  was the devil's music. So the music that we could hear was picked for us. But  we'd get out to hear other music; you know, go next door to a friend's house  and hear whatever was going on at the time. Mainly it was Fats Domino, Ray  Charles, the Platters, the Coasters."  </P> <P> Weldon began her singing career after moving to Hawaii in 1959. It was there  that she had a chance to work with respected vocalist Helen Humes.  </P> <P> "I learned a lot of stage presence from her, which helped me to become a  performer," Weldon said. "I was really young, about 18, when I worked with her,  and she gave me a lot of direction."  </P> <P> In 1961, the singer began a five-year stay in Japan, appearing at clubs and  concerts in Tokyo as well as in Formosa, Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> It was during this time that she met and performed on bills with fellow  Americans Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole. But not all her  engagements were so glamorous. "I worked a lot of clubs that had no English  bookings at all so I had to learn to speak Japanese. It was quite an experience  being a black woman living in Japan. I'm not surprised about what's happening  there now because it was happening there then. It was very future-conscious and  I was lucky to be a part of it.  </P> <P> Back in the States in 1966, Weldon began making club appearances in Los Angeles  and hit the TV circuit. She released a number of small-company albums in the  1970s, but, despite one single for Columbia in 1975, she's never had a  major-label album contract.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of difficulty with my kind of music at the time. They didn't  really want to hear a black woman record country-Western music. I got a lot of  negative feedback for that."  </P> <P> But Weldon is confident that things will turn her way.  </P> <P> "(Record companies) are a little more liberal now than before. Before they  wanted you to sound like Aretha Franklin or Nancy Wilson. Well, I don't have  that kind of sound, I don't sing like anybody else," she said.  </P> <P> For her Design Center South appearance, Weldon will be backed by her usual  band, which is led by trumpeter Rodriguez and includes saxophonist Louis  Taylor, pianist Phil Wright, bassist Ricky Taylor and drummer Washington  Rucker.  </P> <P> While most singers prefer the quieter support of piano or a bass-piano duo,  Weldon prefers a bigger challenge. "I like the big-band sound. I like working  with horns, because I have a strong voice."  </P> <P> She thinks the kind of music being written today is cause for optimism.  "They're bringing romance back to music now. Before, the men were putting down  women and the women were putting down the men. But now it's all about love and  dancing close and looking together at the sunset. And I like that romantic kind  of music."  </P> <P>  Maxine Weldon appears tonight at Design Center South, 23811 Aliso Creek Road,  Laguna Niguel, 8 p.m. Information: (714) 643-2929.  </P> <P> </P></p>

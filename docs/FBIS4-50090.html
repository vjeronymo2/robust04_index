			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (AFP)--GATT chief Peter Sutherland  all but ruled out Friday the possibility of China's rejoining  the world trade body by the year's end, labelling the schedule  put forward by Beijing "extremely demanding."    While "encouraged" by three days of talks with senior  foreign  trade officials here, Sutherland made it clear that China was  some way from realising its aim to be in at the inception of the  World Trade Organisation (WTO), which replaces the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on January 1. "It is  still going to be extremely difficult, with the best will in the  world, to achieve the timeframe we have spoken of," Sutherland  told a press conference. "The time schedule is extremely  demanding."    The GATT secretary-general also stressed there was "no  practical difference" in whether China joined the international  trading regime on "January 1, April 1 or June 1." "Really what  we should be talking about is the likelihood of a satisfactory  outcome at the end of the day. The end of the day being not too  distant," he said.    China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the  communists came to power in 1949, has repeatedly made it clear  that it attaches great political significance to readmission  before the new year.    Sutherland said he had seen signs of "genuine will and  flexibility" from the Chinese side during his visit, but added  that doubts remained over the transparency of China's foreign  trade regime, especially policies governing import quotas,  licences and standards. "I do not wish to minimise the amount  of additional discussion that has to be undertaken," he said.</p>

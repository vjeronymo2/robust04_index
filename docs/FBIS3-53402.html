			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace and Balanced Development"] </F>   [Text] In his valuable speech at the opening of the  conference on the economies of peace in the Middle East, which  opened in London recently, His Highness Crown Prince Hasan  stressed that if the recent peace arrangements are to succeed,  the disparities and distortions created by the conflict in the  region must be eliminated, particularly the disparity between  the Israeli economy and the economies of the other parties to  the conflict.    An approach similar to the GATT-EU approach could be the  best  way to deal with the economic legacies of the conflict. The  expected partnership requires a balanced economic growth which  means that the excessive disparities in income levels between  potential partners in the region must be reduced. This can be  achieved, at some stage, by freedom of movement for goods,  services, capital and labor. In the end, peace is not in the  hands of governments, but of individuals, and unless peace can  be made attractive to the man on the street, the best efforts of  those seeking to achieve peace will be fruitless, leading to the  conclusion that the gradual achievement of peace for peoples who  have suffered for a long time from the calamities of the  conflict will not be possible.    Such a thorough and clear view by His Highness Prince Hasan  is principally based on the experience of Jordan, which is the  nearest to the core of the conflict, and which shouldered an  enormous human load. Jordan has given shelter to three waves of  displaced Palestinians and endured a vast demographic strain and  an approximately $7 billion in debts.    Thus, the reconstruction of the Middle East could proceed  apace, especially if this region is allowed to play a more  creative role within the context of the world economy. The  climate of conflict, which has been going on for a long time,  has forced the diversion of efforts away from development to  finance the military confrontations. We hope the approaching  age of peace will mark the end of, and the last chapter in that  conflict.</p>

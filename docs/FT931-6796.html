			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Coal industry not dealt a blow by report Sir, Far from dealing a blow to Britain's coal industry ('Regulator deals blow to coal lobby', February 23), Offer's preliminary report in December was roundly criticised by both industry and independent commentators. Its 'further statement' shows that it has failed to address many of these criticisms. Offer has repeated its earlier mistake of comparing contract prices instead of generating costs. Professor Littlechild has stated that he will examine in the future the generators' huge margins on coal-fired electricity. However, any proper assessment of the 'dash for gas' must take account of these now. There is considerable evidence that the cost of coal burn is less than that of gas-fired generation. I am confident that, once the generators pass on reduced coal prices in their contracts to the regional electricity companies, coal will prove to be cheaper than gas. However, until the director-general has conducted his examination of generators' margins, his report will effectively be meaningless. Finally, the report fails to take proper account of the higher gas supply contracts for later CGGT projects, and does not examine the damaging implications of the dash for gas for future gas reserves and gas prices. In conclusion, Offer's misleading 'economic purchasing review' is anything but a 'green light' for the dash for gas. Martin O'Neill, House of Commons, London SWlA OAA</p>

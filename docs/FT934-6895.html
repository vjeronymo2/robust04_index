			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Treasury minister's nice little earner: Faith in the recovery could be bolstered by 'Dorrell's mill' With industrialists lining up to tell Mr Kenneth Clarke about their difficulties, news of a manufacturer which has doubled profits during the recession while keeping its UK workforce constant is guaranteed to put a spring in the chancellor's step. To hear about Faithful, a Worcester-based clothing group, the chancellor has only to consult Treasury colleague Mr Stephen Dorrell, the company's former chairman and one of the few government ministers with direct experience of manufacturing. The minister retains an office at the company which has been owned by the Dorrell family since the 1840s, and has a 20 per cent shareholding. He drops in to the main Worcester factory - known in Whitehall as 'Dorrell's mill' - every few weeks to talk to senior managers. He says this gives him a 'window on the world' of industry. Faithful has just under 10 per cent of the UK's Pounds 100m-a-year workwear business selling clothes worn mainly by men working in factory and service jobs. Among its 500 customers are Harrods, ICI, Nissan, Boots, British Rail, Vickers, Volvo and Smiths Crisps. The spread of contacts, according to Mr Dorrell, gives him 'a broad-based set of anecdotes about the economy'. Mr Dorrell worked for the company full-time as export director prior to entering parliament in 1979 and was non-executive chairman between 1984 and 1987, taking over from his father Philip who is now president. His father also owns a fifth of the company, as do Mr Dorrell's brother and sister, both of whom are directors. His mother is chairman. Mr Peter Warr, Faithful's managing director, joined the company 30 years ago. He says that in the minister's 12-year spell as a director until 1987, he played a full part in formulating Faithful's business strategy, which is partly based on building sales in continental Europe. A third of this year's sales will come from the company's two factories in the Netherlands, which are run by Mr Dorrell's brother Alan and account for 50 of the company's 350 employees. Mr Dorrell, the 41-year-old financial secretary to the Treasury and a rising political star, is using his knowledge of manufacturing to help improve the Treasury's lacklustre image in the business world. Mr Toby Ackroyd, operations director of the Association of Independent Businesses, a lobbying group, says that Mr Dorrell's knowledge of industry comes through in informal discussions. Mr Ackroyd, who met the minister recently to offer his views about the Budget, says: 'He's got a good understanding of the tech-nical aspects of business.' Another fan is Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser at the Engineering Employers Federation, which met Mr Dorrell last month. Mr Thompson says: 'For the first time in 10 years of discussion with the Treasury, I came away with the impression that someone there understood what we were saying (about conditions in industry).' Faithful's recent experience in seeing a gradual pick-up in demand - though with competition still intense in a market which has declined by about a fifth in volume during the recession - has helped to inform Mr Dorrell's view that the recovery is on course with price pressures subdued. The company expects sales of Pounds 15m this year, and turned in a pre-tax profit last year of Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 11.3m. With the Treasury keen to see inflationary pressures minimised, Mr Dorrell is no doubt pleased by the tight cost control at his family company. Faithful's machinists are paid an average of about Pounds 140 a week, roughly half the average gross pay of UK manual workers although close to the going rate for the clothing sector. Costs of the Dutch operation, based in Doetinchem, are also kept down by shipping cloth to factories in Morocco, Tunisia and Poland where much of the unskilled assembly is done by low-paid workers. The incomes of Faithful employees are, however, topped up through a profit-sharing scheme established in the 1950s which last year paid out Pounds 210,000. Faithful has also moved into high-value, specialist products - a field which to some degree shields the company from competition from low-cost importers  -such as the jacket it makes for Shell oil tanker drivers. By being fairly stylish and made from relatively expensive materials it sells for Pounds 22, roughly three times the price of a mass-produced competing product. Faithful has also moved into specialist areas such as static-proof clothes for people making microchips. In 1988, before the recession, Faithful made about 1,500 types of product in fairly large batches. Last year the comparable figure was 2,500, many of them made in short runs to the specification of particular customers. What Budget advice does Mr Warr have for Mr Dorrell and the chancellor? He says: 'I hope taxes won't go up because this would have a negative effect on the the recovery.' Mr Warr is not among those calling for an immediate cut in interest rates because he thinks they might have to go up soon should inflation increase. He worries, however, about the government's presentational skills: 'I've not seen much evidence that it has a business plan.' Mr Warr says the Bank of England should take control of interest rates from government ministers. Although he praises Mr Dorrell as 'perfectly straight, someone you would buy a used car from', this trust does not extend to all members of parliament. Mr Warr says: 'The economy is too important to be left to politicians.'</p>

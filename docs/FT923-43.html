			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE recovers losses in late rally A SOMEWHAT surprising rally in the UK stock market yesterday afternoon was accompanied by a spate of rumours of impending developments, ranging from a bid for a stock in the FT-SE list to cuts in German interest rates. Some traders sounded sceptical, however, pointing out that fund portfolios were being polished up for the close tonight of the third quarter of the year, and that stock index futures had been bid up heavily yesterday. By the close, the Footsie had recovered all and more of its early setback of 28.5 points and the final reading of 2,565.5 showed a net gain on the day of 5.5 points. The strong upswing towards the end of the session was encouraged by a powerful recovery in the pound against the D-mark. In the background, however, uncertainty over the economic policies of the UK government and the outlook for domestic interest rates continued to restrain activity. There was still room for confusion over the near term prospects for a change in UK economic policies. Evidence of further strains over Europe inside Britain's governing Conservative party, together with the progress of the annual conference of the Labour opposition party, added to the general uncertainty. The stock market reacted to a strong warning against taking risks with sterling from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Governor of the Bank of England. The City of London read this as a discouragement for early cuts in base rates. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, reiterated his belief that he can persuade other European leaders to his view on the problems within the ERM. Equity trading volume, lower in the first half of the trading session, turned smartly higher when the market rallied. The day's Seaq total of 533.8m shares compared with 487.6m on Monday, when retail business worth Pounds 1.2bn maintained the significant upturn in business seen since Britain's departure from the European monetary system. The Footsie Index was helped by a recovery in the pharmaceutical stocks which have borne the brunt of London's reaction to comments in the US presidential campaign from Bill Clinton on medical spending. But domestic stocks remained uneasy after this week's heavy brokerage downgradings of ICI cast a cloud over the more optimistic earnings valuation put on the market in the wake of Britain's withdrawal from the ERM and the cut in UK base rates. An indication of more favourable attitudes was shown in a sharp rise in shares in Sears, the leading UK store group and owner of Selfridge's store in London's Oxford Street, despite confirmation of a widely-predicted cut in the dividend payout. However, the rest of the retail sector stocks remained weak yesterday after the Sears board said there was still no sign of any recovery in consumer spending. Renewed worries over the levels of consumer and business debt were also reflected in further selling of bank stocks which are now fast losing the gains achieved in the initial response to the market's hopes of lower interest rates.</p>

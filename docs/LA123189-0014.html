			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROSSING NETWORK IS SIMPLY A STOCK TRADING APPARATUS, NOT A SECRET WALL STREET  SOCIETY  </P> <P> I read with interest Martin Mayer's Viewpoint ("Is the SEC Surrendering Its  Birthright?" Nov. 26) but there are some points of detail that should be  corrected.  </P> <P> Mayer implies that the Crossing Network operates largely "behind the scenes,"  unknown even to Wall Street professionals. The Crossing Network has been  actively marketed and widely publicized during the three years since its  introduction and is well known to a broad spectrum of the securities industry.  </P> <P> Mayer also states that Crossing Network trades "are not reported anywhere." All  Crossing Network trades are reported daily to the National Assn. of Securities  Dealers. Users of the Crossing Network may also request that Instinet report  their Crossing Network transactions to the International Stock Exchange in  London.  </P> <P> Anonymity, in the context of the Crossing Network, means only that a user does  not know the identity of the contra side of a trade. The benefit to the user is  that because all orders are entered and traded anonymously at closing prices,  there is no market impact. No market impact combined with low commissions  results in better performance for Crossing Network participants.  </P> <P> The Crossing Network does not attempt to shut out broker/dealers in favor of  institutional investors. Several of the largest broker/dealers are regular  Crossing Network participants. Instinet and its Crossing Network provide a  neutral, level playing field for all professional equity traders using its  electronic access systems.  </P> <P> Instinet, a registered broker/dealer, is a member of the NASD, the American  Stock Exchange, the London International Stock Exchange and other regional  stock exchanges, and is subject to the same regulations and surveillance that  all members are.  </P> <P> BOB A. CROOKE  </P> <P> New York  </P> <P> The writer is director of media relations for Reuters, which owns the Crossing  Network.  </P></p>

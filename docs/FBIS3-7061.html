"I would like to promote relations between South Korea  and Japan from a forward-looking, future-oriented view," a  senior Imperial Palace official quoted Kim as saying.    Bilateral relations are still overshadowed by Japan's  colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and  anti-Japanese sentiment continues to run high.    Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, had a 25-minute audience  with the imperial couple in an "overall pleasant atmosphere,"  Kiyoshi Sumiya, grand master of ceremonies, said.    "I think it would benefit our friendly neighborly relations  if we could welcome the emperor and the empress in South Korea.  I would like to seize this good opportunity to offer an  invitation," Kim told the imperial couple.    The emperor replied it is the Japanese Government's decision  on whether he goes abroad.    In an interview ahead of the visit, Kim, who was elected  last  year to a single five-year term, said he believes he will be  able to receive the emperor in Seoul during his term in office.    The emperor told Kim it is important that both nations  deepen  their exchange while reflecting on history and respecting each  other's cultures.    During colonization, Koreans were forbidden from speaking  Korean in public and had to adopt Japanese names. In addition,  Japan's forced recruitment of tens of thousands of Korean women  for wartime military brothels has refueled bitter memories.</p>

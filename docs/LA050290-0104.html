			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER NETS $71 MILLION IN QUARTER; COST CUTS CITED  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 U.S. auto maker, said Tuesday that cost cuts  undertaken last year helped it make a $71-million profit in the first quarter  of this year even though car sales plummetted.  </P> <P> The results came as a pleasant surprise to Wall Street, where some industry  analysts had expected the auto maker would barely break even or even post a  small loss.  </P> <P> Chrysler stock closed up 75 cents at $15.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Chrysler posted a profit even as sales fell to $7.56 billion, compared to $9.66  billion in the 1989 first quarter, when the auto maker had net earnings of $351  million.  </P> <P> "It seems the cost-reduction program really is taking effect," said John  Casesa, analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., who had expected Chrysler to  report earnings of about 10 cents a share.  </P> <P> The company said earnings were hurt by high incentive costs and lower  production volume.  </P> <P> "We posted a profit in our automotive operations, despite lower volume and  incentive costs nearly double what they were a year ago," Chairman and Chief  Executive Lee A. Iacocca said in a statement. "Our $1.5-billion cost-cutting  program is certain to become a major competitive advantage to Chrysler."  </P> <P> Industry analysts said Chrysler so far is saving $200 million per quarter  through its cuts. The company last year established a target of cutting $1  billion in annual costs this year and $1.5 billion annually when the program is  fully implemented.  </P> <P> Analysts said that without the cost-cutting program, the quarter would likely  have shown Chrysler deeply in the red.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that factory sales are down and incentives are up," said  Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Charles Brady. "There was no reason for good  news."  </P> <P> Another factor in Chrysler's surprising showing was the improvement in its  per-car profitability.  </P> <P> Analysts credited the increased profit margins to the company's decision to  discontinue its Omni/Horizon line of subcompact cars in February of 1989 and  higher sales of its lucrative minivans.  </P> <P> "Chrysler is cutting down on the lower-priced vehicles, which means the average  value of the cars is going up," said David Healy, analyst with Barclay's BZW.  </P> <P> The company has also reduced its "fleet" sales, or discounted volume sales of  vehicles to a single corporate customer.  </P> <P> Chrysler said that in the first quarter, it sold 211,283 cars and 239,216  trucks and minivans in the United States, giving the company a 9.2% share of  the domestic car market and a 19.5% share of the domestic truck market.  </P> <P> The company said first-quarter sales of its Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and  Chrysler Town and Country model minivans were up 15% over the first quarter of  1989. It said the popular minivans continue to command more than 50% of their  market segments.  </P> <P> Chrysler Financial Corp., the auto maker's finance arm, earned $89 million in  the first quarter, up 37% from the $55 million earned in the first quarter of  1989.  </P> <P> Despite the encouraging news from Chrysler, analysts do not have any plans to  change their first-quarter estimates for Ford Motor Co. and General Motors  Corp., which will report earnings later this week.  </P> <P> They said the Chrysler improvement was due mostly to internal measures that  helped offset negative industry factors such as lower production and rebate  costs.  </P> <P> The profit figure from the first quarter of 1989 included a $13-million gain  from discontinued operations.  </P></p>

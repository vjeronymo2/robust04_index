			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Health, gambling and false teeth Around the country, voters cast ballots on dozens of measures over issues ranging from healthcare to gambling and false teeth. In Oregon, voters were close to allowing doctors to assist in suicides of the terminally ill. In California, voters rejected a taxpayer-funded state healthcare system and a referendum, backed by the tobacco industry, which would reverse local smoking curbs. Limits on the terms officials can serve passed in five states - Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Nebraska and Nevada. A total of 21 states have now approved congressional term limits, but the initiatives are subject to constitutional challenge in the courts. Term limits vary from state to state. Colorado limited congressmen to three consecutive terms. Nebraska imposed limits of three consecutive House terms or two consecutive Senate terms. Nevada voters would limit senators to two six-year terms and House members to three two-year terms. Florida voters defeated a proposal to legalise gambling casinos. In Washington state, dental technicians won permission to fit and install false teeth, a right now limited to dentists.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ROe": "Even FPOe and Greens Supporters `In </F> Favor of EU'"]    [Text] On Monday [14 March] at the Center for Applied  Political Research, Fritz Plasser and Peter Ulram presented the  results of telephone surveys carried out by the Fessel Institute  and the Market Research Organization analyzing the results of  Sunday's provincial elections. The survey shows an atmosphere  "in favor of the European Union [EU]," even among supporters of  the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] and the Greens.    The analysis shows that subjects relevant to the EU and  membership questions have been superimposed on the provincial  elections, Ulram said. Some 54 percent of the 1,500 persons  asked (500 in each province where elections were held), took a  positive view toward EU accession, while 25 declared that they  were against it, and 21 were still undecided. The figures were,  of course, different in the individual provinces: With 62  percent supporters and 19 percent opponents, the mood in favor  of the EU is most marked in Carinthia. In Salzburg 58 percent  were in favor of accession and 22 percent skeptical. Even in  Tirol the EU supporters are slightly ahead of opponents: 41  percent took a positive view, 35 percent said they were  skeptical, and 23 percent were still undecided.    The scientists also drew cautious conclusions for the  nationwide parliamentary election in the fall: The Social  Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] and the Austrian People's  Party [OeVP] are struggling with structural problems. After its  unsuccessful petition drive for a nationwide referendum [on the  immigration issue], the FPOe has overcome its low, and,  according to Plasser, it might climb across the 20-percent  level. Despite the failure in Sunday's election, the chances  for the Liberal Forum to stay in Parliament are still intact,  and the Greens have overcome their structural problems.    The success of the Tirolean OeVP, which managed to retain  its  absolute majority of parliamentary seats and in the government,  is partly the result of its EU strategy. Plasser said that  Governor Wendelin Weingartner managed to do something that is  normally bound to fail, namely to walk a tightrope: He managed  to secure the support for the OeVP of both EU supporters (with  his basically positive attitude) and EU skeptics (by signalling  that he was ready to fight for the best possible results for  Tirol).    Plasser said that one interesting feature was that EU  supporters are not confined to the SPOe, OeVP and the Liberal  Forum but that EU accession is also backed by FPOe and Greens  supporters. FPOe supporters appeared to be polarized in  Sunday's election (with 44 percent for and 39 percent against EU  entry), a phenomenon that has appeared in nationwide surveys  before, while among the Greens there is a clear 59:19 percent  majority against membership. In view of these figures, Plasser  expects FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider to make a tactical change of  course: His policy critical of the EU was probably timed to  last exactly until 13 March, and, Plasser suspects, the FPOe  leader will now quietly wait for the EU referendum and not raise  the EU issue until the parliamentary election campaign -- when  he knows he can benefit from it again.    According to a preliminary analysis of the election result  carried out by the IFES [Institute for Empirical Social  Research] Institute as early as on Sunday night, the result of  the EU negotiations had a strong influence on the election  result in Tirol, Carinthia, and Salzburg. By and large, it  turned out that the FPOe mainly appealed to people who are  worried about their future, while the Greens rather managed to  win the support of Europessimists.    On the other hand, both the FPOe and the Greens lost EU  supporters, which benefitted not only the two coalition parties  but also the Liberal Forum. It was in Tirol and Salzburg, in  particular, where the FPOe lost a significant number of EU  supporters. The election analysis shows that it was possible to  win votes with a clear, pro-EU position.    The analysis carried out by IFES for ORF television shows  that there was strong movement within the Carinthian electorate.  Five percent of former SPOe voters cast their vote in favor of  the OeVP this time, while another 5 percent voted for the FPOe.  Yet, the OeVP not only won votes from the SPOe but also 4  percent from the FPOe. On the other hand, 6 percent of former  OeVP voters abstained, while 1.5 percent wandered off both to  the SPOe and the FPOe. According to this analysis, the FPOe, in  turn, lost 1 percent of its voters to the Liberal Forum. The  FPOe's success was mainly the result of people who abstained in  previous elections and now voted for it.    According to IFES, in Salzburg the movements of voters  between the parties was not quite as dramatic as in Carinthia.  There, the OeVP lost 4 percent to the FPOe and more than 1  percent to the Greens. On the other hand, the OeVP received 1.2  percent of former FPOe voters. The SPOe lost 2 percent each to  the FPOe and the Liberal Forum. One percent of former Greens  voters wandered off to the Liberal Forum. Three percent of  former FPOe voters did not go to the polls this time.</p>

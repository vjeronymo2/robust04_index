			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- The  Pretoria/Witwatersrand /Vereeniging's [PWV] first "law and order  minister" Jessie Duarte says her priority is to reduce crime in  the region. But she also plans to make the police more  responsible to the community. Ms Duarte was speaking to  journalists after being sworn in as PWV Executive Committee  member for public safety and security at Sandton, north of  Johannesburg, on Friday.    Her central philosophy was community policing which involved  locals getting to know policemen in their areas. Complaints  against policemen would be taken seriously, and she further  suggested an independent ombudsman to examine complaints not  handled properly by police.    While insisting police should act against suspects within  clearly defined perameters, she would have little sympathy for  criminals, even those motivated by poverty. "We are not going to  make excuses for criminal activities... We think people ought to  learn how to respect the rights of other people."    On the police's Internal Stability Division [ISD], Ms Duarte  proposed some of its 8,000 members in the region be integrated  into other units. The policing budget, effective until March  1995, did not allow her to increase personnel, so increased  visible policing would be achieved by a reshuffle.    But she ruled out disbanding the ISD at this stage. "We  can't  lose their skills."    Ms Duarte was confident the PWV police force would not be  controlled by Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi. His  proposal for a council of ministers from the nine regions  suggested there would be an integrated police service.    Ms Duarte, who has worked as a special assistant to ANC  leader Nelson Mandela since the unbanning of the African  National Congress in early 1990, agreed she was not a stranger  to law and order. She was restricted in terms of emergency  regulations from 1986 until the ANC's unbanning.    In 1989, Ms Duarte was detained at Johannesburg's "Sun City"  prison for eight months. But she has no ill feelings: "It's all  in the past."</p>

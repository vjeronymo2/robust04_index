Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state for economic and  agricultural affairs, made the call in her talk with Deputy  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama at Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's official residence.    During the 45-minute talk, Spero said she understands well  that Hosokawa has been focusing on political reform but demanded  that Tokyo work to produce favorable results of the bilateral  trade talks once the domestic task is completed, the official  said.    Pinpointing priority fields in the negotiations, including  automobiles and auto parts and the Japanese Government  procurement of U.S. equipment, the U.S. under secretary  reportedly sought Tokyo's efforts to achieve progress in such  fields.    Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to  meet in Washington on February 11 and assess progress in the  framework talks.    Hatoyama voiced hope the bilateral negotiations will be  successful with efforts from both sides, the official said.    Saying the Japan-U.S. trade talks should be two-way talks,  Hatoyama also reportedly told Spero that Tokyo is opposed to the  setting of numerical targets to measure the openness of Japan's  markets.    The deputy chief cabinet secretary also noted that the  Japanese Government cannot promise anything out of its reach in  the talks on the opening of its markets, the official said.    Spero responded that Washington is only insisting on setting  "quantitative and qualitative indicators" to gauge improvement  in U.S. access in Japanese markets, the official said.</p>

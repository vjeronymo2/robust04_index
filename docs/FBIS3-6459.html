			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Police pledged stricter  security at major foreign embassies. "We haven't received calls  for greater protection, but we will keep closer watch on those  which deserve greater attention," said Chaiyasit. A secretary  from the Israeli Embassy, Zosar Suk, visited Lumpini Park and  inspected the truck yesterday. He met Pol Lt Col Aphichat  Chuachet, deputy chief of southern Bangkok police, and asked for  details of the March 11 accident. The diplomat declined to talk  to reporters.    Police sources said that after the Hebron incident, senior  government officials instructed police to tighten security at a  Jewish synagogue in Sukhumwit Soi 22 and at the Israeli Embassy.  Police bomb expert Somkiat Nakhon said if the explosives on the  truck had been detonated, the resulting blast would have spread  over at least a one-kilometre radius.    A police report seen by reporters said the explosives had an  "inestimable destructive power". "I have been involved with  bombs for 10 years," said Sgt Maj Somkiat. "This is the largest  amount I have ever seen. It is the work of real professionals."    Crime Suppression Police said they were joining with Bangkok  police to investigate the case. All "suspicious" Middle East  immigrants in Thailand were having their records checked, said  Crime Suppression Commander Pol Maj Gen Wannarat Kaacharak. A  police source said a number of Arabs had been under the police  surveillance, but law enforcers could not restrict them because  "they have done nothing illegal". He added that it was very  likely the plotters were not on the police blacklist.  "International terrorist groups like to use people who are not  blacklisted in a country to strike in that particular country,"  he said.    The source dismissed the possibility that the  explosive-primed truck was the work of southern Thai  secessionist terrorists. "Southern terrorists have never  operated outside the southernmost provinces. And in this case  it's quite obvious that a foreign facility, not our government  buildings, was the target.    Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said  there was no concrete evidence so far to link the explosives to  international terrorism. "It's sheer luck that the truck owner  sensed something wrong with the water tank," Banyat said.</p>

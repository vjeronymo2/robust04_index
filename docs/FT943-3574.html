			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Lufthansa shares priced at DM160 Lufthansa, the German national airline, yesterday set a subscription price of DM160 each for its 7.64m new ordinary shares, in line with market expectations. Lufthansa's shares closed at DM200 yesterday, up DM3 from Friday. The airline will raise around DM1.2bn by offering shareholders one new share for every four held. The new shares will be provided with full dividend rights for the 1994 business year. Last month Lufthansa said it expected to make an operating profit this year and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would resume dividend payments for the first time since 1989. The German government will not be participating in the rights issue, thereby reducing its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent. The 3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up will be sold to investors at home and abroad, excluding the US, via a syndicate of international banks led by Dresdner Bank. If demand is sufficiently buoyant, the government also intends to sell 2.1m existing shares which would further reduce its stake to around 36 per cent. The price of these shares will be set on September 29. They are expected to be priced at a small discount to the prevailing market price. The subscription period for the new shares will run from September 20 to October 4. As a result of the rights issue, the airline's ordinary share capital will increase by a nominal DM382m to DM1.9bn. At the annual meeting in July, Lufthansa's shareholders authorised the executive board to increase the company's capital by a nominal DM515m. 'With the consent of the supervisory board, the executive board has now made partial use of this authorisation,' Lufthansa said. Another rights issue is expected to take place next year.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead: British Steel results to reflect overcapacity - Results due British Steel's results for the year to the end of March, due to be announced on Monday, are expected to show pre-tax losses of Pounds 170m reflecting recession and overcapacity in Europe. Analysts will be more interested to hear the company's views on whether further price rises are possible this year. The outlook for talks on capacity reduction between the EC and state owned steelmakers is also likely to be raised. Attention will be focused on whether provisions for bad and doubtful debts are starting to ease in the UK banks' sector when TSB Group announces interim results on Thursday. TSB is the first of the banks to report by a month. Pre-tax profit for the half year is expected to fall to about Pounds 50m compared to Pounds 92m the previous year, and bad debt provisions to rise to around Pounds 240m from Pounds 165m. The bank is expected to maintain its interim dividend. The impact of exceptional costs of about Pounds 3m from its photo-processing business will cloud the picture at London International Group, which reports annual results on Friday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 31.5m under FRS 3, compared with last year's figure of Pounds 16.9m, which was also depressed by restructuring costs of Pounds 22.5m. The ColorCare photoprocessing business continues to suffer from lack of demand, but the Durex condom business is growing steadily. First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions group, will be quizzed for signs of a recovery in consumer confidence when it reports interim results on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting a slight increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.7m to about Pounds 12m in the six months to May 3, but the group's results are heavily skewed towards the second half and most attention will surround current market conditions and the trading outlook.

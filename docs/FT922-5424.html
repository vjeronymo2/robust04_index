			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / US growth revised up The US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in the first quarter, rather than 2.0 per cent as initially reported, revised figures from the Commerce Department indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth and the best performance for the US economy since the beginning of 1989. Many analysts, however, had expected a bigger upward revision. The faster growth mainly reflected upward revisions to corporate inventories and fixed investment, partially offset by weaker net exports. The figures showed a sharp improvement in corporate profitability in the first quarter.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Management: From caterpillar to butterfly - Leading computer manufacturer Unisys has come back to life after metamorphosis A piece of seemingly perverse management wisdom is beginning to sink in among the boardrooms of the world's beleaguered computer giants: 'Doing what you do best can destroy you.' More accurately, perhaps, companies can be destroyed by continuing to do what they do best in the face of evidence that their business environment has changed. US manufacturers International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Unisys are examples. They are all masters of the art of big computer design and production, yet their market is in retreat as customers increasingly look to networks of smaller computers for more cost-effective data processing. The falling price of technology, which cut one third off the cost of IBM mainframes last year alone, is a further headache for these companies. The consequences are well known. IBM is struggling to recover from three years of losses and large-scale redundancies while the future of Digital, once second only to IBM, looks uncertain at best. But Unisys, which three years ago looked dead in the water, is different. The product of the 1986 merger of Burroughs and Sperry, it has now been profitable for two successive years after losing almost Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.66bn) between 1989 and 1991. Its first-quarter results this year were encouraging with earnings per share, before special items, of 21 cents a share against 16 cents the year before. The man widely credited with the recovery - chairman and chief executive James Unruh - is not merely content to rescue the company. Unruh, who took over in 1990 from Michael Blumenthal, is intent on re-establishing Unisys as a force in global data processing through a fundamental reorientation of its strategy and management style. For a start, the new Unisys will be smaller. At its peak, the company employed some 120,000 people - now the total is less than 50,000. Once revenues hovered around the Dollars 10bn mark; in 1993 they were Dollars 7.7bn. Unisys will still make and sell computer hardware - 'We are not going to become a computerless computer company,' Unruh says - but it will extend its already catholic attitude to sticking its own logo on other maker's systems. The processor chips in its next generation of systems will be manufactured by its old rival IBM, for example. Unisys aims to become an information management company: in Unruh's words, 'client-driven, technology-based and services-led'. This compares with the company's earlier attitude which amounted to a kind of technological fascism: 'We used to develop the next bigger, faster version of what we were doing and send salespeople out to find customers who could put these things to use.' Unruh stopped Unisys concentrating on what it could do best, making mainframe computers, and shifted the emphasis towards software and services. This is not new in itself. Every big computer maker is looking for increased revenues from services as profit margins on mainframes are squeezed. But Unruh has moved with a speed and conviction which has not been obvious at other companies. Staff numbers were almost halved in 12 months at a cost of more than Dollars 1bn. The company pulled out of semiconductor manufacturing, saving Dollars 100m a year in the process. Payroll and other services were contracted to outside suppliers. Contraction at IBM and Digital has been drawn out and painful, leaving remaining staff anxious and demoralised. Digital is still faced with cutting a further 20 per cent of its workforce. The major challenge for Unruh, however, was to transform Unisys rapidly from hardware manufacturer to services company. It meant a big cultural shift. An important appointment was Victor Millar, formerly with global advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, engaged to head the company's consulting side in November 1992. Millar had earlier been with the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen for 25 years, where he was widely credited with the growth and success of its consulting operations. Earlier this year, Unruh also appointed Malcolm Coster as president of the company's Europe, Middle East and Africa division. Coster, a software specialist and management consultant, had been head of international business development at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Coster bel-ieves Unruh's secret is a realisable vision of the future: 'He sees the butterfly the caterpillar can become, not an improved caterpillar.' The question remains how rapidly to diffuse the knowledge and experience necessary for successful computer consultancy through a hardware-based organisation. Unisys's answer is making the best of what you have and buying in what you lack. Some of that experience, Unruh says, is locked within the company. Unisys's size and global reach gives it an enviable window on the business issues facing its customers. Furthermore, it had a sound technical background in some of the more difficult computing applications - airline reservation systems and global funds transfer, for example. 'We were able to build on that,' says Unruh. 'We did not start from zero, but we are finding our way.' The fact remains that of the company's 6,000 professional services staff around the world, most are skilled in technical areas, such as project mangement and systems integration. 'To a lesser extent, we have people with the ability to go to a client, understand their environment and determine what technology is best for them. That is where we have had to learn more. We have some of that knowledge because historically we used to give it away. We did a lot of that for clients as part of getting their computer business. Part of the learning process was understanding how to charge for these services.' Today, Unruh says, the company is limited in its growth by human resources. 'We could grow faster if we had more people with this kind of knowledge and capability. We do not have the time to retrain everybody.' The evidence that Unruh's strategy is succeeding lies in the financial results. More tellingly, perhaps, the time it takes customers to pay their bills is down from 87 days to 47. 'Only satisfied customers pay you,' Unruh smiles.</p>

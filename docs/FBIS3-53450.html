			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri by </F> an unidentified KEYHAN correspondent in Ankara; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Baqeri] Iran and Turkey have many  characteristics in common. They have a long history, and their  relations have been marked by continuing and numerous changes,  in which extraneous elements have constantly had a negative and,  at times, a destructive effect.    Look at the history of these two countries. In the Ottoman  era, despite both having a religious government and many common  denominators, foreign elements took advantage of the minor  differences between them by pitting one against the other.  [passage omitted]    Westerners know that Turkey's population is 99 percent  Muslim, and the people are devout and follow Islamic traditions.  However, by propagating non-Islamic signs or anti-Islamic  phenomena and fanning nationalism, they are portraying Iran as a  disruptive and dangerous element opposed to Turkey. We perceive  the same scenario being repeated in our relations with Turkey  regarding the newly liberated Central Asian republics.    Intense propaganda is giving the impression that Iran and  Turkey are at loggerheads and that in Turkey a lay government is  in charge, while Iran has an Islamic government. So, foreign  elements seek to play a destructive role. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] How are relations now?    [Baqeri] We have cordial cultural, economic, and political  relations and recently initiated security cooperation. If we  look at Turkey and its neighbors, we see that it has problems  with all of them; that is, with Iraq, Syria, southern Cyprus,  Greece, Bulgaria, and Armenia. I have urged Turkish newspapers  to heed the anti-Iranian material that is disseminated, as it  could give the impression that all the neighbors have strained  relations with Turkey. We believe that relations can be  cordial. Dr. Habibi's visit to Turkey was also very successful  and agreements were reached on bilateral issues. Some transport  problems we had with Turkey were eliminated during this visit.    When it came to the passage of trucks and passengers from  Syria, Turkish officials created problems for pilgrims to holy  sites, so Iran imposed restrictions on the Turkish trucks. The  issue was resolved in a friendly manner and there are no  restrictions on the passage of trucks or Iranian passenger  buses. We asked them not to harass the passengers, as we are  obliged to assist the Iranian passengers.    [Correspondent] How do you appraise the outcome of this  visit?    [Baqeri] Prime Minister Ciller played a very active,  positive, and cordial role in these talks. We have women prime  ministers in our Eastern and Western neighboring countries; that  is, in Turkey and Pakistan, but both fortunately have very  friendly relations with Irand. This indicates that the Islamic  Republic has no problems with female heads of government. We  hope to see extremely positive developments following the visit  by Dr. Habibi.    Two ministers accompanying Dr. Habibi met their Turkish  counterparts and some agreements were reached. Soon, we hope to  witness Demirel's visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran at the  invitation of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    The outlook for our bilateral relations is extremely  positive, but because Turkey and Iran have common enemies and  foreign elements do not favor broadening Iranian-Turkish  relations, the Turkish mass media as well as its officials  should heed this point; that is, our enemies will capitalize on  any difference between Iran and Turkey. We should give them no  such pretext.</p>

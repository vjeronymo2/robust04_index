			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Veteran diamond chief resigns 'because of ill health' MR VALERY Rudakov, the veteran chief of Russia's diamond industry, has resigned citing ill-health, and has been replaced by a senior official from Yakutia, the semi-independent region that produces the country's diamonds. His successor, elected by shareholders including the Yakut government, is Mr Andrei Kirillin, deputy chairman of the Yakut parliament, which has been pushing for ever greater independence from Moscow. But Mr Sergei Ulin, deputy chairman of Almazy-Rossii Sakha the state-dominated corporation responsible for the production and marketing of Russian diamonds, denied that there were any political motives for Mr Rudakov's departure. However, another official, who declined to be identified, said the resignation may have been triggered by conflicts between Mr Rudakov and Yakut authorities increasingly eager to wrest remaining control of the industry from Moscow-based Russian authorities. 'He is a strong-willed man and he is not the kind to give in to demands, especially stupid ones,' the official said. Before heading ARS, Mr Rudakov was in charge of Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet state gold and diamonds monopoly, which was subsequently broken up into separate corporations for diamonds and gold.</p>

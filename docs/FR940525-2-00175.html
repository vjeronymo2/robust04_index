These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and non-Federal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On November 4, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation, under part 150, were in compliance with applicable requirements. On May 3, 1994, the Administrator approved the Hilo International Airport noise compatibility program. Eight of the ten recommendations of the program were approved, one was approved in part, and one had no action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Hilo International Airport noise compatibility program is May 3, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> David J.

The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act and is limited to the following determinations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing incompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional incompatible land uses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas pre-empted by the Federal Government; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

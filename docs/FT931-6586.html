			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Call for end to Budget 'purdah' MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, will today call for an end to the traditional Budget 'purdah' arrangements, as part of a move to bring greater openness to the government's economic decision-making. In a speech to Charter 88, the constitutional reform movement, Mr Smith will also extend the idea of a 'new deal' for the citizen beyond the customary ground of a ministry of justice, a bill of rights and wider eligibility for legal aid.</p>

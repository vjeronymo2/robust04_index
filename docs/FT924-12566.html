			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Arts: French quartet festival - Weekend concerts A small but very interestingly formed string-quartet festival has been unfolding at irregular intervals in the theatre of the London French Institute. Its purpose is to assemble a brightly talented collection of rising quartet groups, mostly (but not all) French, and and to dot into the schedule a handful of British premieres by French composers. The series is well worth sampling, for its own sake - since worthwhile new quartet groups and quartet music are always desperately needed on the London chamber-musical scene - and also as a token of the recent, and considerable, renewal in chamber-musical activity on the other side of the Channel. The day when Pierre Boulez could categorically dismiss the string-quartet medium as hopelessly old-fashioned is apparently long done, and entirely unlamented. On Friday evening, midway through the festival programme, the Quatuor Rosamonde, prizewinners at Evian (1983) and the EBU competition at Salzburg (1986), played Berg (the Quartet, Op. 3) and Beethoven (the C major, Op. 59 no. 3) with sharp-pointed attack and an intellectual energy that informs every musical note and line. The sound is not plush, the style not remotedly influenced by 'Viennese' manners; leanness and clarity are evidently the corporate goals, and vigorously pursued. For these reasons, and because of the innate qualities of the music, the Rosamonde made a lively case for the British premiere of Philippe Hersant's Second Quartet (1988). Its four movements are devoted to various forms of post-Impressionist patterning, light-reflections and lingeringly sensuous plays with texture: cool, elegant, attractively cut. On Saturday evening it was the turn of the Quatuor Parisii, winners at Banff, Evian and Munich (1986 and 1987), and of the new quartet specially written for the occasion by Gilbert Amy, distinguished Boulez pupil and associate. As it happens, only three movements had been completed in time - sufficient, however, to show that Amy's avant-garde affiliations are now tempered by other concerns and pursuits. The music grows out of cell-like repetitions of figures in ways that appear to admit unusual influences (unusual, that is, for a Boulezian): Janacek, even - albeit at arm's length - the '70s minimalists. The effect is at once of tough argument and immediate appeal; even on this incomplete evidence it seems a work written not academically, but from deep inside the medium. The Parisii delivered the music with tremendous authority and, again, intellectual vigour. In Webern (the early Quartet), Milhaud (the deliciously sardonic Fourth Quartet, 1946) and the Beethoven Op. 130, risks were taken, hard edges manifested in the playing, that proved exhilarating in context. Indeed, it was heartening to encounter another young French group so distinct and so committed in approach. French Institute, SW7; series organised with the Association Pro Quartet of Paris; final concerts on Oct 23 and Nov 3</p>

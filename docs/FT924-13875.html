			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (12): Mirror to market growth - Profile of Novell WITH A commanding 60 per cent share of the Dollars 800m worldwide market for local area network software, Novell is the standards setter in the fastest growth segment of the computer systems software market. The company's flagship product, NetWare, had become the de facto standard by the end of 1986 and since then has steadily gained market share. The program is a network operating system that manages and controls the sharing of services, data and applications among personal computers linked to workgroup and departmental networks as well as company-wide information systems. The network operating system market grew by about 40 per cent last year, according to market analysts, and is expected to maintain at least a 30 per cent growth rate over the next several years. Novell's growth has mirrored that of the market it serves. For the first nine months of 1992 the company reported revenues of Dollars 673m, an increase of 49 per cent over the same period last year. Net income rose to Dollars 179.5m for the nine month period, an increase of 60 per cent. The use of local area networks (LANs) has evolved over the past decade to become a primary element of corporate computing systems. While early LANs were used primarily to link PCs so that users could share printers or data storage devices, today many corporations are building 'enterprise-wide' networks that encompass all of a company's computer systems. Such 'internetworks' become, in effect, the backbone of a corporate computing system and the network operating system is a critical element of the software environment. Industry analysts predict that, over time, applications programs will increasingly be written not just for stand-alone computer operating systems but also for network operating system, enabling data to be more easily shared among different types of computers. Novell's expanding role in the software market reflects the growing importance of networking as an alternative to traditional host computer to terminal links. Novell is expected to launch, before the end of the year, a new version of NetWare that will include features designed to implement international enterprise-wide internetworks. The market for enterprise-wide network operating systems is potentially even larger than the current market for LANs operating systems, according to industry analysts, and could reach Dollars 1bn over the next few years. In the low end of the network operating system market for 'peer to peer' LANs Novell is, however, facing a new challenge from Microsoft, the world's largest software company, which is about to launch a new version of its 'Windows' operating system designed for use by 'workgroups'. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, claims Windows for Workgroups will 'subsume' Novell's popular 'NetWare Lite' program, a stripped down version of NetWare designed for small office networks. Novell has not responded to Mr Gates' taunts, but in spite of its dominant role in the PC operating system market, Microsoft has so far failed to unseat the network software leader. The primary focus of Novell's strategy is in any case focused at larger, rather than smaller, networks. Recent product introductions include message handling software, hub software, routing software and network management software aimed at large scale networks. Last month Novell also began shipping NetWare SNA Links, a program designed to enable International Business Machines customers to connect geographically dispersed PC networks via existing mainframe computer links. Meanwhile, Novell is mounting its own challenges to Microsoft in the computer operating systems market. Novell offers DR DOS, an alternative to Microsoft's MS DOS PC operating system. Through Univel, its joint venture company with AT&amp;T's Unix System Laboratory, Novell aims to expand the use of the Unix operating system on PCs, competing with Microsoft's planned Windows NT. Novell owns 55 per cent of Univel. In recent years Novell has bolstered its technology base with a series of acquisitions. The latest is Annatek Systems, a developer of automated software distribution and management systems that allow network managers to keep track of software distribution, installation and updates. Still, large portions of the potential market for Novell's networking software products remain untapped. Currently about 30 to 35 per cent of PCs in the US are linked to networks. The penetration of local area networks is expected to rise to almost 100 per cent over the next decade. Market analysts expect virtually all PCs used in large organisations to be connected to networks. International markets are increasingly important for Novell. For the first six months of fiscal 1992, sales outside the US represented 48 per cent of total revenues, up form 44 per cent in fiscal 1991. Japan represents the company's most promising new market. With an estimated 10 per cent of the world's PCs installed in Japan, fewer than 5 per cent are currently linked to networks, according to industry estimates.</p>

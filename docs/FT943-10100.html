			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: More exposure on photography - Marina Benjamin talks to the new director of the Photographers' Gallery, Paul Wombell The Photographers' Gallery has recently been the subject of a heated dispute conducted principally in the letters pages of The Guardian. Prominent members of Britain's photographic community denounced the gallery as 'old, tired and out-of-date', called for the immediate resignation of its Board of Trustees, another chimed in with 'Why not shut it down? It's a moribund institution.' Without a director at its helm to defend it, the Photographers' Gallery has not been able to reply. But now, the newly-appointed director, Paul Wombell, plans to respond with deeds, not words. He feels that photography is one of the most important forms of communication developed in the last 200 years, and that those working in photography ought to be aware of this and proud of it, and ambitious for the medium. Wombell is in fact hugely ambitious for the medium. 'Photography is absolutely central to visual arts in Britain,' he proclaims, 'some of the most important work in the last 15 years has been photography-based and this trend will continue. The Photographers' Gallery has to play into that central role, defining contemporary photography, raising issues abut photography, and re-inventing ways of looking at historical work. No one else is doing this.' This country has a poor track-record when it comes to photography: photographic projects receive only 14 per cent of the Arts Council visual arts budget; at Pounds 597,000, this is roughly half the amount France invests in the medium. . While the Museum of Modern Art in New York has been collecting a broad range of photographic work for over 60 years, the Tate only began acquiring photographs in the 1970s. The sitution, however, is changing. According to curator Sean Rainbird, the Tate is renewing its commitment to collecting photography; the V&amp;A hopes to open a new photography gallery in 1998 so that the national photographic collection can get a permanent airing; while the Barbican, ICA, and Hayward are all regularly staging large-scale photographic exhibitions. Much of the credit for this current, albeit belated, institutional interest rests with the Photographers' Gallery, founded in 1971 by Sue Davis to give photography a proper footing in the art world. Now that it has fulfilled its original purpose, it can turn itself into an institution as opposed to being a thorn in the side of the arts' establishment. But is there room for another heavy-weight institution? Has not the Barbican for instance taken photographic history on board, and the Hayward provided its cutting edge? Paul Wombell gave this suggestion short shrift. 'The current Hayward exhibition should have been shown five years ago. Its leading ideas are German, but young German photographers' work today is more personal and installation-based. As for the Barbican, I came out of the Bill Brandt show thinking 'I don't like Bill Brandt'. History needs to be made exciting for young audiences, and a dialogue should be created between contemporary photographers and the likes of Brandt.' Wombell plans to develop the gallery less as an institution than a centre with new computer technology, R&amp;D workshops and darkrooms where artists can experiment, forging links with companies to use new equipment, and to join computer networks giving access to photographic libraries around the world. 'Photography has undergone vast changes in terms of technological practice over the last 20 years, and we need to engage with this new mode of photographic practice.' New technology is something of a Wombell speciality. While director of the Impressions Gallery in York he organised the mixed-media show, Photovideo; and The Globe, an exhibition charting representations of earth since the first NASA space photographs. He also nurtured links with Europe; and he succeeded in raising Pounds 250,000, which last year enabled the gallery to relocate to larger premises. With this track-record Wombell seems to hold the right formula to take the Photographers' Gallery into the 21st century. But can he repeat his York achievement in London? Though he would not be drawn on larger premises, saying 'we need to make the case for us to exist first', he did offer this reflection: 'The reason the Photographers' Gallery is this size is that when it opened the only work being shown was 16x20 document work. The medium has changed phenomenally since then and its principal gallery has to accommodate those changes.' This sounds like a very good pitch for a share of the Millennium Fund.</p>

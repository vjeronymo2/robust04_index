He was speaking to 150 top Japanese businessmen at a special  seminar in Nagoya, organised by the Invest in Britain Bureau of  the Department of Trade and Industry, during which he also  announced the future opening of a British Government Office  there.    He Said: [subhead]    "I would like to reaffirm that the British Government  extends  a positively unambiguous welcome to investment from Japan. Our  approach is that all companies based in Britain are treated as  UK enterprises whose interests within the EC we seek to promote  and develop.    "I am particularly proud that over 40 per cent of all  Japanese investment in the EC has come to the UK."    Lord Strathclyde added that it was not just investment in  manufacturing which Britain welcomed, but investment in  research, development and design as well.    "We are confident that our scientific skills and facilities  for scientific research offer Japanese companies the best  possible European base for research, development and design  activities.    "I believe that Britain is the most positive and  forward-looking of all Japan's trading partners.    "We each have something to give the other. We continue to  learn from you about management efficiency and technological  achievement. We appreciate and value the cultural, as well as  the economic, contribution to British life made by Japanese  companies investing in Britain.    "We offer in return a country firmly committed to remaining  at the heart of Europe; we offer political stability; and a  highly skilled and adaptable labour force ready and willing to  learn new skills."    The new British Government office will open in Nagoya to  promote trade and investment between the Chubu region of Japan  and the UK.    During his trip to Japan Lord Strathclyde also visited  several Japanese companies including the Toyota Motor  Corporation, Matsushita Electric Works Ltd, and Koyo Seiko Co.  He will also spend three days in Taiwan where he will meet the  Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance and speak at other  investment seminars.</p>

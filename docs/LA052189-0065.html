			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Why does Los Angeles persist in self-flagellation? The single item that  decreases my quality of life in L.A. is the whining of those who don't  appreciate how fortunate they are. Those who moved here years ago from points  east are the worst offenders. These non-travelers have the impression that  everything "back there" has remained as they left it.  </P> <P> Most people (especially those you interviewed) are unaware that the logarithmic  increase in world population has, and will increasingly have, a degenerative  effect on the quality of all our lives. L.A. is fortunate that it has suffered  the least from this.  </P> <P> F. H. HACK  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

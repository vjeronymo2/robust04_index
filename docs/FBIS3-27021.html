			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by JINGJI RIBAO reporter Li Zhengping (2621 3630 </F> 1627) and XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "Look at  Opening Up From the Country's Door -- Describing the Reform of  the System of Passing Through Customs"]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 10 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's busiest  entry-exit port -- Luohu customs -- has formally opened its new  passenger passageway. In the spacious hall, several passageways  eight to 18 meters wide have replaced the original 72 customs  inspection counters and more than 100 banisters. Passengers  going from the mainland to Hong Kong or going from Hong Kong to  the mainland can now pass through customs -- the "door to the  country" -- swiftly and easily.    This is a profile of Chinese customs' efforts to expedite  passage through customs.    1. In the Huanggang area of Shenzhen, which has the largest  highway port in Asia, a cargo truck can pass through customs in  only 20 seconds. [passage omitted]    At China's Shekou port, which handles the largest number of  ships and boats in China, customs officials no longer go aboard  ships to carry out inspections. Therefore, foreign ships' time  in port has been reduced greatly. [passage omitted]    The speed in passing through customs is an important point  in  judging the extent of opening up to the outside world. An  open-type country will certainly ask its customs officials to  provide the greatest convenience for the legitimate entry and  exit of people, cargo, and means of transportation.    2. To speed up the passage through customs, decreasing  inspections plays an important part. [passage omitted]    Luohu customs head He Tangfa said: We have now adopted the  method of the "selective inspection of key cases." We simply  removed those customs counters which allowed only one person to  pass, and we now allow passengers to pass through freely.  Meanwhile, we have strengthened on-the-spot investigation and  study. When we find doubtful pieces of luggage, we will use  equipment to inspect them. We call it "controlling the key  things and letting the little things pass freely." In this way,  the overwhelming majority of passengers can pass through customs  without being checked. [passage omitted]    3. The speeded-up passage through customs is based on a  decrease in inspections. However, customs' responsibility has  not decreased. Customs officers have not reduced their efforts,  and their achievements have increased.    Shekou customs head Huang Haitao told a reporter that after  implementing the new system for supervising and controlling  international shipping, customs officials can now concentrate  their forces and emphasize the inspection of key areas which  were not handled seriously due to a lack of manpower. In just  over one month, customs officials uncovered several major  smuggling cases involving goods valued at over 80 million yuan.    The situation with Huanggang customs is quite similar.  Outwardly, customs officers do not inspect most vehicles. Cargo  trucks' drivers only have to hand over a list of their goods to  customs officers and then can pass through in less than one  minute. Empty vehicles can pass through using special lanes  without being stopped. Customs officials, however, have not  neglected their duty. They have strengthened on-the-spot  investigation and intelligence work and have placed emphasis on  cracking down on major smuggling cases. During the first 11  months of 1993, they uncovered more than 1,400 smuggling cases  -- a total that was 70 percent higher than in the previous year  -- in which the value of the goods confiscated exceeded 110  million yuan.    The speeding up of passage through customs must also depend  on strong management. Jiulong [Kowloon] customs can open its  door wide because it has paid attention to checking and  controlling the enterprises concerned. The customs office has  established files and knows very well which enterprises have  good reputations and which earlier have engaged in crimes of  smuggling. In this way, the customs office can handle different  cases under different categories.</p>

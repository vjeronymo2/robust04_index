			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Observer: Meaningful dialogue Whatever the contention over who is to be the 1992 European of the Year, there is no doubt about the EC's Word of the Year. 'Subsidiarity' wins by a landslide. A search of the FT database reveals that Britain's broadsheet newspapers have so far employed the dread term 1,437 times since last December. That is quite an achievement, considering - as the article above shows - there is as yet no officially agreed definition. Filling the semantic gap will be one of the tasks for European Community eminences at the coming weekend's dialogue in Edinburgh. Any temptation to feel sorry for them should be resisted, however, because the EC leadership brought the task on itself with its communique on economic and monetary union following the June 1989 Madrid summit. Before 1989 there had only ever been three references to the term - which means, broadly, taking decisions at the appropriate level. But although the Madrid conferrants had the decency to put the word in tentative inverted commas, after them came the deluge of obscurity. So it is right for their successors to have the job of clearing up the confusion. If all else fails, they might at least ban the term entirely from the Edinburgh summit's official emanations.</p>

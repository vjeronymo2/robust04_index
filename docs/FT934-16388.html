			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Conditions soften THE MORE relaxed trend in the UK money markets continued yesterday as a number of operators sat back and waited for clues on impending monetary policy to filter from the Tory party conference, writes Peter John. Short sterling maintained its very tight range and the Bank of England operations were completed by midday. The central bank offered the money market an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 900m. The shortage, slightly less than recent days, was well bid and easily taken out. Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands which were expected to drain Pounds 273m from the system. Bills for repurchase by the market took out Pounds 647m and bankers' balances below target removed Pounds 150m. Partly offsetting these, Exchequer transactions added Pounds 50m and a fall in note circulation injected Pounds 115m. The Bank provided Pounds 750m of early assistance, buying Pounds 750m of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on October 25 and 26 at 5 29/32 per cent. It provided a further Pounds 150m later in the morning, bringing total help to Pounds 900m. This compared with its latest forecast of a Pounds 1bn liquidity shortage. Short sterling moved within a very narrow range with the most actively traded contract, for delivery in December, recording paltry turnover of 10,200 lots and closing only four basis points lower at 94.34. That level discounts a third of a percentage point off base rates and is seen as a reasonable hedge on a half point cut around the time of next month's budget. Also, three-month money which is seen as the crucial indicator of where base rates will be in the short term, held fast at between 5 15/16 per cent and 5 7/8 per cent. One dealer said: 'The money market doesn't expect a cut at the moment but it is watching the conference with half an eye and without getting too upset.' German Euromark futures traded on Liffe held fast around 93.80 with nearly 30,000 lots dealt. The market decided the Bundesbank was unlikely to cut interest rates at tomorrow's council meeting as it comes too soon after the inauguration of Mr Hans Tietmeyer as the German bank's new head.</p>

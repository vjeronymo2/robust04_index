			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG WATCH;  </P> <P> HEARTLESS OR HEARTSICK?  </P> <P> New York is supposed to be the ultimate example of the impersonal, hard-hearted  big city, the place where pedestrians hustle past the homeless, and screams for  help are met with shut windows.  </P> <P> But New York's anguished reaction to a recent spate of shooting deaths of  children is healthier, and more humane, than the numbed -- and some would even  say blase -- reaction Southern California has shown to the relentless drive-by  murders of children here for the past several years.  </P> <P> Various excuses are put forth for Southern California's muted response.  </P> <P> 1. We are geographically separated. Does that assume a commuter who drives 40  miles from Costa Mesa to downtown Los Angeles is supposed to care less about a  child shot a few miles from his job than one killed a few miles from his home?  </P> <P> 2. Southern California lacks the screaming headlines of tabloid newspapers.  True, but what we lack in tabloids we more than make up for in local television  news.  </P> <P> 3. New York had a concentration of four murders in a short time to spark the  city's fury. A roundup of weekend crime stories in Southern California  typically reports at least three gang-related shootings. Quite a few result in  the deaths of children.  </P> <P> Genuine widespread outrage about gang-related violence hit Los Angeles once --  when a young professional woman was the victim of a bullet in Westwood. But  most victims of gang-related violence aren't professionals -- and don't die in  Westwood.  </P> <P> And now it looks as if we're running out of excuses.  </P></p>

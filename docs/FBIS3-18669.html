			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] State Minister Yildirim Aktuna has said it is  incomprehensible that the Western countries that have not  reacted to the massacre of innocent human beings, including  women and children, in the east and the southeast, are now  concerned about human rights.    Aktuna replied to correspondents' questions during a visit  to  the Trabzon Governor's Office. Answering a question on whether  any action will be taken in connection with those who arrived  from France in support of the Democracy Party deputies, Aktuna  said: One cannot tell them not to come; one cannot tell them  they cannot enter Turkey. One should be tolerant within a  democracy. There is, however, a limit to tolerance. One cannot  tolerate a stand directed against the independence of the  country. Aktuna recalled in particular that France and Danielle  Mitterrand remained silent while the most fundamental human  right, namely the right to life, was being violated and while  people were being taken from the mosques and massacred. Aktuna  added: They should have sent representatives to investigate the  incidents of terror. He noted that those who refer to the  noncommissioned officers who were killed in the Tuzla bombing  incident as military targets, those who issue statements  supporting the terror organization instead of opposing it, and  those who dare to insult Ataturk have exceeded the limits.  Pointing out that recent statements have gone beyond the limits  of the freedom of speech and belief, Aktuna added that no  democrat can accept this. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Maculan looks to central Europe  -Ian Rodger on the growth hopes of an Austrian construction group I BELIEVE in central Europe; it will become the most important economic area in the world,' forecasts Mr Alexander Maculan, chairman of the Austrian construction company of the same name. And Maculan, the third largest Austrian construction group, has been acting on its boss's beliefs in a most aggressive way. Over the past two years, it has bet its future on the eastern German market, investing Sch1bn (Dollars 88.6m) in buying six construction companies and a gravel quarry in the old GDR from the Treuhandanstalt. The group's German business, 92 per cent of which is in eastern Germany, accounts for over half of its total turnover, and investment analysts regard Maculan as the purest investment play on the area known as Europe's largest construction site. The big German construction companies, such as Philipp Holzmann and Hochtief, may do more business in eastern Germany than Maculan does, but their revenues from there form a smaller part of their overall business. Maculan's interim report, published yesterday, indicated that the bet still seems to be going the group's way. The company reported a 12 per cent rise in operating profits in the first half of 1993 to Sch126m, and boosted its forecast of net income for the full year to Sch260m from an earlier Sch240m. If the forecast proves correct, it will give Maculan a fourth successive year of double digit profit growth. The group remains unequivocally bullish. 'Eastern Germany looks like remaining the biggest building site in Europe medium-term,' Maculan said in its interim report to shareholders. Alexander Maculan was an unlikely executive to take such a bold initiative. The son of the group's founder, he took control of the company in 1962 when he was only 21, his father having been killed in a small aircraft crash a few years earlier. Until the 1980s, he was known mainly for his prowess on the golf course, but then he suddenly became interested in building the business both inside and outside Austria. A contract in Russia and a small acquisition in Germany gave him both the confidence and the insight to take advantage of the once in a lifetime opportunities that presented themselves when the Iron Curtain collapsed. He has financed his bet by taking the company public in 1990 and raising over Sch2bn in new equity and convertible debt in three operations, reducing his personal stake to 49.7 per cent (68.8 per cent of the votes). The biggest question mark over any company making such a rapid expansion, especially by acquisition, is management capacity. Mr Maculan seems unworried, saying that the group tries to keep the managers in the companies it acquires. 'We are a very attractive company for managers. We have a training programme like no other construction company. Last year, we spent DM20m in training,' he says. He also points to his own unusually long training to be a chairman. 'I have never been involved in the day to day management. Professional managers can do it better than me. My job is to help our people, to find targets for them, to make acquisitions.'</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Failures seem to hit steady rate: Business collapses reach plateau The number of business failures appears to have steadied at about half the level of 1992, says a survey published yesterday by Touche Ross, the chartered accountants. However, the number of receiverships and administrations, which totalled about 2,500 in the last year, is running at well above pre-recession levels. In 1989 there were 1,500 cases. No clear pattern has yet emerged in the monthly receivership figures this year. After two months when the number of receiverships increased, the number of business failures dropped by 35 per cent in April to 171. The average monthly number of failures in the first four months of this year was 211, little lower than the average of 220 of the last 12 months. Touche Ross said the recovery from recession continued to be slow and cautious. Mr Ralph Preece, a partner at the firm, said: 'I remain of the view that we are unlikely to see any dramatic fall in the number of business failures unless and until there is a general resurgence in economic confidence in the country at large.' London and the south-east appeared to fare better in April at the expense of the Midlands. About 40 per cent of all failures were in the manufacturing sector, a substantial increase over 1993 when the sector accounted for less than 30 per cent of failures. Part of this increase was accounted for by the collapse of the Bimec Industries Group in the West Midlands. Failures in the building and construction sector fell to 16 per cent of all failures, compared with 20 per cent in 1993. Touche Ross based its figures on the receivership and administration appointments advertised in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes. The figures, which exclude liquidations, indicate the pressures on larger companies although they are a fraction of the total number of business failures.</p>

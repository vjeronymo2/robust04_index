			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Dealers hit back at the salerooms - Fairs provide new ways to sell NOTHING divides the arts and antiques world more than the question of fairs. Some of the grandest dealers, such as Wildenstein and Partridge, never show at them. Others, like Waddington and Richard Green, travel the world circuit constantly. Some dealers complain there are too many, often speculative ventures by inexperienced operators; others cannot get enough of the unpredictable nature of the events. Undoubtedly, the recession has forced more dealers to attend fairs. It gives them a feeling of activity, of trying new ways of selling. The arguments in favour of fairs are impressive. You meet hundreds of new, or potential, customers compared with the handful of daily visitors to a gallery. Many sales at fairs take place months after the event, when contacts made there walk into the gallery and become valued clients. At fairs, you can take the pulse of the antique market, discover price levels and, before the doors open to the public, pick over the stock of competitors. Dealers tend to develop an eye for what will sell, so a picture specialist will take a chance on some apparently under-priced porcelain or a rug man might see potential in a grimy watercolour. Fairs also offer the chance of good trade gossip. Against these advantages can be set the cost. At the most glitzy fairs, like Grosvenor House, a decent display space can cost a dealer Pounds 15,000, and few cost less than Pounds 5,000. Olympia in June, the biggest with more than 300 exhibitors, charges around Pounds 9,000 for a reasonable stand. Then there are hidden extras such as lighting and telephones, plus transport, setting up and decorative costs, and the expense of getting someone to man the shop while you are away. And there is the worry of inviting your regular customers and watching them being enticed away by other stand-holders, or finding that your stock is over-valued against the competition. Above all, there is the tedium of sitting through a long day being nice to strangers. Fairs are enjoying a boom, though. Quite a few dealers no longer run shops but work from home instead and use fairs to meet new clients and display their wares. New promotion companies have emerged and, as other annual shows disappear off the schedule because of the recession, the larger exhibition halls are keen to open their doors to antique dealers. On the surface there are too many fairs, but they seem to be creating their own demand. When the art market recovers, selling through fairs, and from home, could become the standard marketing approach. One attraction of fairs is that they offer dealers a united, public showcase with which to hit back against the auction houses. In the past three decades, dominance of the art market has moved remorselessly from dealers to the salerooms. Sotheby's and Christie's between them now account globally for around two-thirds of all significant art transactions. Now, though, the salerooms are in trouble and the dealers think they could be set for a comeback. Sotheby's and Christie's pushed the art-as-investment chimera too hard and, in a recession, are reaping the consequences of a sharp decline in turnover by making minimal profits - or, in Sotheby's case, actual trading deficits. Surprisingly, the salerooms have moved to reverse the trend by raising their charges to buyers. Few decent antiques come on to the market these days and, if anyone comes along with a valuable collection, the salerooms compete by offering to sell them for nothing. They can pay for such generosity only by increasing the charges to buyers. So, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips expect a successful bidder this year to pay a 15 per cent premium on the hammer price instead of 10. Bonhams, which was the only major London saleroom to raise sales and profits last year, is holding its charge to buyers at 10 per cent and deserves to prosper from its gamble. The arrival of the 15 per cent premium offers a wonderful opportunity for dealers. At one level it is terrible news, since they are the best customers (both as buyers and sellers) of the salerooms. When the buyers' premium was introduced late in the 1970s, the dealers tried to organise a boycott, but failed. This time, the higher premium has been accepted with little outrage, perhaps because the dealers think privately that it plays into their hands. Their argument is simple. If, say, you inherit a long-case clock valued at around Pounds 3,000 and want to sell it, an auction house will still charge you 10 per cent (because you are a minor seller), plus other expenses such as insurance, transport, catalogue photograph, etc. After a few months, you receive something approaching Pounds 2,500 - that is, if it sells at its estimate in the present depressed market. But why should anyone buy the clock at auction if, on top of the Pounds 3,000 hammer price, you pay 15 per cent (plus VAT on that if you are a dealer), pushing up the cost to more than Pounds 3,500. Might it not be best for the owner to accept an immediate Pounds 2,800 offered by a dealer who would then try to sell it, with a 20 per cent mark-up, for around Pounds 3,350? By-passing the auction houses suddenly seems attractive to both buyers and sellers. The dealers see their window of opportunity, and are fighting back. There is another reason why the dealers think they can win back trade from the salerooms. Along with raising the buyers' premium, the leading auction houses have tried to save money by sacking staff, including experts. There are good grounds for thinking that some objects sold in the salerooms in recent weeks have been catalogued wrongly. Certainly, dealers, especially furniture dealers, are convinced this is so. It might mean that a dealer can pick up a bargain; it could also mean that private collectors, attracted by the ease of buying at auction, have paid over the odds for objects which are much less than the catalogue proclaims them to be. These two factors provide the favourable backdrop to the fair run by the British Antique Dealers' Association at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea in May. Ostensibly, it is to celebrate 75 years of the BADA. Actually, it results from a feeling that the top dealers should offer a united front and mount their own show. That the BADA fair is being held at this time reflects some dissatisfaction with both the exclusive Grosvenor House fair, which has room for only about a quarter of BADA's 300-odd members, and the populist Olympia, which can resemble a cattle market. Both these fairs take place in June, so BADA's timing is provocative. Some dealers will exhibit at all three fairs but, in the main, BADA's is a challenge to Olympia. With BADA, it is cheaper for dealers to take space, the goods come with the association's seal of authenticity, the catering should be much better, and it has a mildly glamorous setting - in a marquee. The 80 or so BADA dealers exhibiting cover the range and will offer works of art priced between Pounds 100 and Pounds 100,000. One fair by itself will not win back all the trade that dealers have lost to the salerooms. But, certainly, while the wisest heads know that both parties can prosper only by co-operation, there is a feeling that the auction houses are pushing their luck. If worries about their level of expertise continue, the best specialist dealers must benefit. The problem is that there are dealers who have been known to cut sharper corners than any auction house.</p>

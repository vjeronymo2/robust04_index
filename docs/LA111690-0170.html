			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDATION GIVES $2.5 MILLION TO ARTISTS' COLONIES  </P> <P> Artists' colonies around the nation, including three in Northern California,  are the latest recipients of the largess of the John D. and Catherine T.  MacArthur Foundation. In an unusual initiative announced Thursday, the  Chicago-based foundation awarded a total of more than $2.5 million to 18  artists' retreats and residences in 10 states.  </P> <P> In a statement, MacArthur Foundation president Adele Simmons said, "Although  these grants are not being made in direct response to the recent controversy  surrounding arts funding, we feel that our support of these artists'  communities comes at a time when it is important to reaffirm the essential  freedom that is necessary for all creative accomplishment."  </P> <P> The one-time grants range from $50,000 to $200,000. Recipients include such  well-known organizations as Capp Street Project in San Francisco and the  MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, N.H., as well as lower-profile facilities  such as the Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., and  Sculpture Space in Utica, N.Y.  </P> <P> All three California colonies, which received $150,000 apiece, are in the Bay  Area. In addition to the Capp Street grant, awards were made to the Djerassi  Foundation, Woodside, and the Headlands Center for the Arts, Sausalito.  </P> <P> Like the celebrated MacArthur Fellowships, which provide no-strings-attached  grants to artists so they might follow their individual muses, artists'  colonies and retreats typically are established to provide living and studio  spaces in which selected artists can pursue their work unimpeded. The new  grants are designed to provide those residences with resources for capital  improvements and expanded programs.  </P> <P> In 1989, the MacArthur Foundation completed a study of the program needs of  artists' colonies. Based on the results, proposals were requested from  traditional rural-retreats, from urban studio spaces, and from collaborative  venues for the performing arts.  </P></p>

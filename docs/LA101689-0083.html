			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LETHARGY COSTS NICKS DEARLY IN COSTA MESA SHOW  </P> <P> Larceny was the big excitement at Stevie Nicks' show Saturday night at the  Pacific Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> While the pop diva was taking her customary concluding promenade along the  stage apron, receiving a tribute of flowers and trinkets, bestowing in return a  hug or a touch, somebody nicked a ring from one of Stevie's bejeweled hands.  </P> <P> But all's well that ends well: Nicks barely had begun pleading for the return  of the keepsake (she said it was a gift from her grandmother) when she was told  that whoever took it had already handed it back.  </P> <P> Too bad, though, about those other valuables that disappeared through most of  Nicks' concert: a commanding voice, an energetic presence and some sense of how  to pace a show.  </P> <P> For someone who sings a lot about the desire to change, Nicks, now 41, has  shown no inclination to remake her music or her persona; both wore awfully thin  at the Pacific. She still plays the role of the gypsy-angel-dove-child, singing  solipsistic songs that are intended to be mystical but end up merely  mystifying.  </P> <P> Nicks does have the virtue of sincerity. Her songs about romantic fears, scars  and yearnings may be fragmented to the point of incomprehensibility, but at  least they seem to spring from real, deep-seated feelings. And, at her best,  Nicks has been able to come up with memorable melodies that compensate for her  opaque lyrics.  </P> <P> But at the Pacific, many of her best songs were missing, while several other  hits were squandered in pallid vocal performances. And Nicks' general lethargy  made it hard to care much about the feelings in her songs.  </P> <P> She sounded tired and brittle during renditions of "Dreams" and "Gold Dust  Woman," songs she originally performed as a member of Fleetwood Mac. On her two  dramatic ballad set-pieces -- "Beauty and the Beast" and "Has Anyone Ever  Written Anything for You?" -- Nicks' voice was quavery and tattered. Too much  of the show -- including a droning first half hour -- was taken at the  meandering mid-tempo that is Nicks' regular rut.  </P> <P> Things got better when Nicks let her sharp, eight-member ensemble rock a little  on such songs as "No Spoken Word," "Stand Back" and an effectively chugging  "Edge of Seventeen." Too bad Nicks was not rocking along: If she strayed at all  from her microphone stand, it was at the slow, shuffling gait of a post-op  patient. Maybe the problem was Nicks' footwear, the sort of high-heeled  platform shoes that nobody else has worn since the heyday of Glam Rock.  </P> <P> As usual, Nicks' wardrobe got a lot of emphasis and got in the way of more  important considerations. It isn't that Nicks didn't look lovely and glamorous  in her feathery blond hair, purple gypsy dress and assorted shawls, cloaks and  hats. The problem was that after almost every song, she left for a minute or  two to change her outer wear or find a new hat. Nicks made 11 such exits in a  show that included just 13 numbers.  </P> <P> Consequently, the connections between songs that can help a concert gather  momentum and cohesiveness were lost. So were opportunities for Nicks to talk to  the audience (and most of her songs could stand a bit of between-songs  explication). The band, highlighted by Carlos Rios' tasteful, concise guitar  work, kept some of the time-killing instrumental work interesting, but at other  times Nicks' departures were covered by dull keyboard flourishes and a  pointless drum solo by the otherwise-sturdy Russ Kunkel.  </P> <P> At the end, after telling the audience how her faith had been shattered, then  restored, by the ring incident, Nicks bade a Faerie Queen's farewell. She told  her fans how much she loved and cared about them and expressed concern about  their well-being for the year to come.  </P> <P> But how about her first obligation to them: the two hours she was on stage?  Nicks could have served her fans better by dispensing with the costume changes,  the pointless vocal vamping that marred several songs and the self-indulgent  promenade at the end -- all of which might have freed up time for more of her  signature songs (among the missing tunes were such hits as "Stop Draggin' My  Heart Around," "Leather and Lace," "Rhiannon," "Seven Wonders," "Sara" and  "Talk to Me").  </P> <P> Most of the people who came to hear Nicks would probably have preferred hearing  a few of those to seeing the extent of her collection of cloaks and shawls.  </P> <P> The Hooters' 55-minute opening set included several songs from their upcoming  album, "Zig Zag." The Philadelphia band plays it too safe with its high-gloss  take on folk and roots music, but it offers catchy songs and strong playing.  </P> <P> Some of the new material found the Hooters jumping on the social-consciousness  bandwagon with songs about the poor and homeless, but the best were "Deliver  Me," a folk-rock love song, and "Mr. Big Baboon," a lively mixture of Cajun  accordion music and sax-honking R&amp;B.  </P> <P> EDITOR'S NOTE: Stevie Nicks' management has refused to allow the press to  photograph her during this tour.  </P></p>

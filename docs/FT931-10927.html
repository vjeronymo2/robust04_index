			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Barbecue gives up smoking As chill winter winds continue, many people might dream of a summer barbecue. For many more, the idea of a barbecue might conjure up ideas of charred food and acrid black smoke. A Swansea inventor, Bill Darby, believes he has overcome the problem of the smoking barbecue with a soft plastic fuel which could be sold in giant toothpaste tubes or plastic containers. The fuel uses a base of charcoal or anthracite mixed with lighting agents, and because it burns efficiently produces no smoke. On lighting, flames appear for up to 12 minutes. Then a hot glowing carbon mass remains. Darby: UK, 0792 472721.</p>

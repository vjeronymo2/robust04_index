			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Austrian construction group to raise Sch850m BAU HOLDING, Austria's largest construction group, is raising around Sch850m (Dollars 75m) in a one-for-six rights issue of ordinary voting shares to ordinary and preferred shareholders. The family controlled group, which has been expanding rapidly in eastern European markets, plans acquisitions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to consolidate its position there. Bau is the second Austrian construction group to seek new equity in recent months, arch-rival Maculan having raised Sch695m in late June, also to finance eastern European expansion. Maculan has tended to concentrate its expansion in eastern Germany while Bau has spread its interests more widely. The Haselsteiner family and a few associates, who hold 73 per cent of the unlisted 3.4m ordinary voting shares, are not taking up their rights, so their position will drop to about 55 per cent following the issue. All other ordinary shareholders, mainly an Austrian bank and a few Bau executives, have also waived their rights. Their shares will be placed by Bank Austria and S. G. Warburg in domestic and international markets. It is agreed that about half of the total issue, that is, 450,000 shares, will be placed internationally. The 1.7m non-voting preferred shares are held widely following a flotation in 1990. Bank Austria is also underwriting the 280,500 new ordinary shares in the rights issue allocated to them. The price of the rights shares is to be fixed on September 22, and is expected to be close to the current Sch1,000 market price of the preferred shares.</p>

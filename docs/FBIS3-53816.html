			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Nabil </F> Zaki; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Zaki] The government has repeatedly affirmed  that terrorism has been eliminated and terrorists have been  liquidated, but citizens were surprised by a serious escalation  of terrorist operations, including an attempt to assassinate the  prime minister. Do the security agencies have enough information  on the terrorist networks, I mean information that indicates the  actual magnitude of the problem?    [Al-Alfi] Currently they are concentrating on gathering the  information. I can affirm that gathering and analyzing  information is not limited to just inside Egypt but has expanded  to include information on terrorist activities abroad. There is  coordination among all police agencies in this regard.    As for statements on eliminating terrorism, I do not imagine  we will eradicate and uproot the crime for good because crime  has existed since man was created, since Cain and Abel.  [passage omitted]    We must be prepared to confront violence and terrorism. The  reason behind the latest escalation is that the terrorist groups  target not only Egypt but also all the Arab and Islamic  countries. It has been noticed that the extremists and deviants  have nothing to do with religion; they use religion as a pretext  and use people with confused thinking in return for money. This  was evident during investigations into recent cases. Besides,  we do not wait for a terrorist act to happen and then react.    [Zaki] Does this mean that the initiative is now in the  hands  of security agencies?    [Al-Alfi] We no longer wait for a terrorist act to happen  and  then react. The initiative is now in our hands. Information is  bound to flow to the security authorities now that the means of  obtaining such information have been modernized. [passage  omitted]    [Zaki] Don't you agree that there is slackness on the part  of  the security officials in protecting a public opposition figure,  such as former Libyan minister Mansur al-Kikhya?    [Al-Alfi] First, Mansur al-Kikhya is a refugee in another  country and not in Egypt. He did not take refuge in Egypt. We  protect the refugees we have. As for al-Kikhya, he holds  several nationalities and came to Egypt on an Algerian passport  to participate in a conference of the Arab Human Rights  Organization in Cairo. After the conference ended, he stayed on  in the Safir Hotel without informing the authorities concerned.    [Zaki] Didn't he tell anyone?    [Al-Alfi] He came to participate in a conference of the Arab  Human Rights Organization. He did not come as a refugee. We  carried out our task to provide full security for the conference  and nothing happened during the conference sessions. Al-Kikhya  went to Alexandria for two days during the first week after the  conference ended and returned to Cairo. During this time, some  people contacted him asking to meet him and from then on he  acted on his own. Intense security investigations are under way  to learn about his movements during the week following the  conference. To be precise, we must say that al-Kikhya did not  come to us as a refugee but to attend a conference whose  sessions were provided with full security. Investigations are  continuing into those persons who met him last and into his  movements and the places he frequented.    [Zaki] When Major General Hasan al-Alfi took responsibility  for the Ministry of Interior, many people, including me,  expected that this would put an end to any torture inside  prisons and detention centers in Egypt. It was noticed that the  government agreed to host the conference of the Arab Human  Rights Organization in Cairo for the first time, which is a  great development. Mr. Minister, is the talk about torture  still existing in Egypt true?    [Al-Alfi] If there are excesses, they must be individual  cases and not a common state practice. If such individual  excesses have occurred, the perpetrators were questioned and  some were actually put on trial. Judicial sentences were also  passed against some and others were acquitted. Those who were  sentenced are still serving their terms and some of them stood  trial before a disciplinary court that punished them. These are  individual acts and not part of the practices of the state,  government, or the agency.    [Zaki] Is that not policy?    [Al-Alfi] Of course not. The recent persistent talk on this  issue falls within the context of collusion between those who  perpetrate acts of violence and terrorism and their defenders to  confuse the situation and frustrate those who pursue and arrest  the terrorists. Their aim is also to tarnish the image of  police to delay them and limit their action. [passage omitted]    [Zaki] It is said that a large number of convicted people  are  at large.    [Al-Alfi] We have established a new department for this  purpose. I believe that the police and judiciary's efforts are  worthless if sentences against wrongdoers and convicts are not  implemented. Hence, I set up a specialized department to  implement the sentences, coordinate with courts, and follow up  on sentences. Its task is also to coordinate with all the  authorities that have fugitive convicts and suspects in pending  court cases. It is a strong agency that has been provided with  all facilities to arrest suspects and convicted fugitives, and  we have achieved good results. [passage omitted]</p>

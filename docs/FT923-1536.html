			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: RAS lifts premium income 13.1% GROUP premiums at Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), the Italian insurance company controlled by Allianz of Germany, rose by 13.1 per cent to L2,590bn (Dollars 2.07bn) in the first half of this year. The improvement contributed to a 15.2 per cent increase in underwriting earnings to L96.2bn from L83.5bn in the first half of last year. RAS predicted the upturn would continue to the end of the year, in spite of the continuing slow recovery in the loss-making motor sector owing to weak premiums. The group shied away from forecasting the trend for overall profits this year because of the extreme volatility of financial markets and the unclear prospects for extraordinary items by year-end. Parent company premiums rose by 11.3 per cent to L1,730bn, while directly-written Italian business grew by 12.7 per cent to L1,467bn. Growth rates for life insurance were faster for private individuals than for groups or companies. Premium growth on the non-life side was 'satisfactory' in spite of steps to weed out non-profitable lines. Alenia, the stock market-listed aerospace and defence company which is part of the state-owned Finmeccanica group, reported a plunge in pre-tax group profits in the first half to just L2.6bn (Dollars 2.07m) from L10bn in the same period last year. Group sales were L2,370bn, against L2,650bn. Earnings have been hit by the worldwide crisis in the civil and military aviation industry and the fall in the value of the dollar. However, Alenia claimed profits had been supported by cost-cutting and exchange-rate hedging, leaving its results in line with expectations. The sharpest falls in production had come on the military side, while output levels on civil aviation projects and sub-contracting work had been maintained. The group said new orders in the first half reached L1,740bn, leaving the order book unchanged at about L11,600bn. Sogefi, the auto components concern controlled by Carlo De Benedetti's CIR group, raised pre-tax profits before minority interests in the first half by almost 119 per cent to L39.5bn (Dollars 31.5m) from L21.4bn in the same period last year. The surge came largely through the L19.9bn in extraordinary earnings from the DM160m sale of Sogefi's stake in Boge, the German car parts group, to Mannesmann earlier this year. The bulk of the proceeds have been used to reduce the group's borrowings, which fell to L86bn at the end of June from L199.2bn at end-December 1991. First-half group sales rose by 11.5 per cent to L344bn.</p>

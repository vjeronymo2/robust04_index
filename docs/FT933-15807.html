			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Personal View: Solutions for a little local difficulty The town crier was in action in the city of York last month, celebrating the prospect of the return of the Ridings - Yorkshire's historic boundaries - and of the city once again having control over a greater part of its own affairs. It has been a similar story in Bristol and on Teesside, while in Lincolnshire there is probably quite quiet (naturally) satisfaction that there need be no change in the present local government arrangements. There is thus a serious risk that the review of the structure of local government in rural England will end up doing some popular things. But popularity is not necessarily a recipe for sound public administration. And the councillors whose futures are threatened have been quick to criticise the Local Government Commission for England's proposals and to hire expensive lobbyists to convince local people to reject them. The commission has clear objectives: to correct any mistakes that were made in the last reorganisation in 1974; to streamline the confusing and wasteful two-tier system of district and county councils - there is considerable overlap of functions and few people know who is responsible for what (or, indeed, who their local councillors are); and, most important, to equip local government to meet the challenges of the early decades of the next century. In the words of a recent FT leading article ('Local counsel', June 17), this will require a system of local government capable of strategic action, and which combines local delivery of services with genuine electoral accountability. In the British way of doing things, we are only looking at the structure and boundaries of local government in rural England, not the way the new authorities are to be managed, nor how they will be financed. But, despite the obvious dangers in such a fragmented approach, useful progress has been made - even if we have not been able to 'reinvent local government', to borrow the fashionable transatlantic phrase. In less than a year, we have examined five different areas with a combined population greater than that of Scotland. The 75 councils now involved spend more than Pounds 6bn a year - some three times the current budget of the Department of Trade and Industry - and they employ some 200,000 people. In each area, we have sought to balance the sometimes conflicting requirements of community identity and interests, convenient and effective local services and costs. Our recommendations are based on people's stated feelings about where they belong. And we have put a range of structural choices to local people, recognising that any new structure must be grounded in popular understanding and support. If our recommendations find favour with local people, the government and parliament, there will be 24 new unitary local authorities replacing 66 county and district councils. There will have been a reduction in indirect costs compared with the present arrangements of some 10-12 per cent, worth some Pounds 80m a year, or around Pounds 35 for every household. The average new authority will have a population of around 250,000, although some will be relatively small with populations of less than 100,000 and a few will be quite large - though still smaller than the county council areas they replace. We have been dangerously open about our method and approach. We think that a unitary structure is generally to be preferred to the existing two-tier system; but we recommended no change where the system seems to work well. We have not invariably chosen the lowest cost structure; but we have not put forward recommendations that will add to the present cost of bureaucracy in the areas in question, since all the evidence suggests that this would be unacceptable to local people. And far from local democracy going out of the window, there will be an improvement in democratic oversight compared with the present county councils, an enhanced consultative role for local (town and parish) councils, and maximum possible devolution of day-to-day management to the community level. As we near the end of the first round of our work, several lessons are clear. People care much more deeply about their local government than is generally believed; we have been receiving as many as a thousand letters a day from a single review area. There are few obviously right answers; in many places, the arguments between the alternatives are finely balanced. This is a time of great potential opportunity for English local government. But it could all too easily be lost in the morass of institutional politics - powerful vested interests are not going to go 'quietly into the night'.

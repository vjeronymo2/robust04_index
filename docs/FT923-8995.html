			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Lloyd's to make more information available to Names THE GOVERNING body of Lloyd's of London yesterday acted to force disclosure of its members' business dealings after widespread criticism about conflicts of interest. For the first time in its 306-year history Lloyd's also plans to compile detailed financial figures for all the syndicates into which Names - the individuals whose wealth backs the insurance market - are grouped. The two measures, announced yesterday, are designed to increase the quality of information available to Names. They also respond to criticisms voiced by 'outside' Names, who have borne the brunt of Lloyd's recent record losses, that insiders who work at the market have benefited at their expense. From next year, members of Lloyd's governing bodies will be obliged to disclose full details of all their business interests. The new register of interests will cover directorships, shareholdings, Lloyd's partnership interests, salary, pension and profit related pay, interests in Lloyd's related contracts and details of participation in individual syndicates. Members of the council, Lloyd's governing body and two new executive bodies will have to disclose relatives' interests. All Names will be able to inspect the register. The first issue of the detailed figures, under the name of Limelight, was published yesterday. Limelight brings Lloyd's into competition with Chatset, an independent company, whose unofficial listings, Lloyd's League Tables, have been published since the early 1980s. In recent months Chatset's editors, Mr Charles Sturge and Mr John Rew, have been highly critical of Lloyd's and pessimistic about its business prospects. The market's losses in 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, were Pounds 2.06bn. Mr Sturge said the new publication was designed to 'stuff' Lloyd's League Tables which sold about 3,000 copies last year. Limelight will have an initial print-run of 3,000 copies. Lloyd's is also cutting the number of council members from 28 to 21 in 1993 and 16 in 1995. This is in line with the recommendations of a committee headed by Sir Jeremy Morse, the chairman of Lloyds Bank. Observer, Page 13</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES TO EDUCATE DOG OWNERS  </P> <P> The City Council stepped carefully around enforcement of a dog-curbing  ordinance this week, vetoing the use of police to enforce the law.  </P> <P> Instead, the council instructed city staff to develop an education program  aimed at making dog owners more responsible for where their pets relieve  themselves.  </P> <P> The council acted on complaints from residents who use Lake Mission Viejo, who  claimed that dog owners are not cleaning up after their pets.  </P> <P> Mayor Christian W. Keena agreed, saying that he has seen similar incidents by  the lake.  </P> <P> Dog owners allow their animals to "just do it, and then they walk away," he  said. "These people have no feeling for their fellow citizens."  </P> <P> Citizens who violate the city dog-curbing law could be fined $100, City Atty.  Scott Field said.  </P> <P> Dan Joseph, assistant city manager, said he would have a program ready by  summer aimed at educating dog owners. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

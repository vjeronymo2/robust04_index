			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television One of the pictures in the television news section of the Museum Of The Moving Image on London's South Bank is the shot of a South Vietnamese army officer firing a pistol at the head of a prisoner. The irony is that this has become memorable, indeed world famous, not as a moving image, but as a still picture. All the truly famous news images - Queen Elizabeth with her pearl earring seen through the raindrops on the window of the Coronation coach, Capa's falling soldier from the Spanish civil war, American Marines raising the stars and stripes at Iwo Jima - are stills, not newsreels. In Stains Of War, part of BBC2's 'War And Peace' series, journalist Charles Glass investigates the impact of 80 years of war photography on the public (9.30). BBC1 continues with its excellent series about the Criminal Investigation Bureau within London's Metropolitan Police force, Between The Lines (9.30). Today it is the drugs squad and the river police which are under suspicion. Having begun 'City Of Strangers' about European emigrants to Hollywood on Sunday, BBC2 screens Fritz Lang's first American film, Fury (11.20).</p>

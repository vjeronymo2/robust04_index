			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LACEY SEEKS BROADER HUNT FOR DUMP SITE  </P> <P> Ventura County should widen its search for a landfill site to include the  central county and the Santa Clara River Valley, Supervisor Susan Lacey said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The county is studying the potential effects on the environment of only two  sites, both north of Ventura.  </P> <P> Those two sites, Weldon Canyon and Hammond Canyon, are both just east of  Highway 33 off Canada Larga Road.  </P> <P> But area environmentalists and the city of Ojai, which is north of the two  sites, strongly oppose the use of either canyon as a landfill. Lacey, whose  district includes western Ventura County, said the county should open its  search to new areas.  </P> <P> "I think we need as many options out there as we can possibly have," Lacey  said.  </P> <P> Since the 1985 Solid Waste Management Plan divided the county into three  so-called "waste sheds," the county has limited its options to the "western  waste shed." That area includes areas surrounding the cities of Ojai, Ventura,  Port Hueneme and Oxnard, which would use the landfill.  </P> <P> The 1985 plan chose Weldon Canyon north of Ventura as the preferred site, with  neighboring Hammond Canyon as the second choice.  </P> <P> Supervisor Maggie Erickson, who represents the Santa Clara River Valley and  areas surrounding the cities of Fillmore and Santa Paula, said she would oppose  sending trash from the west out to the central county.  </P> <P> "They have already provided for themselves out there with the Toland Road  Landfill," Erickson said.  </P> <P> Robert Laughlin, a supervisor in the county Planning Division, said it could  cost too much to haul trash farther east than Weldon Canyon.  </P> <P> But Russ Baggerly, a member of the board of the Environmental Coalition, said  air pollution problems could be reduced by shipping trash by train along the  Southern Pacific Railroad line between Ventura and Fillmore.

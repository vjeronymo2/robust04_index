			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Hizballah on the Palestinian-Israeli agreement </F> signed in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] A new festival of fraudulence is being held in an  Arab capital to obliterate the most luminous cause, the  Palestinian cause.    The so-called self-rule agreement signed by 'Arafat, Rabin,  the U.S. secretary of state, and the Russian foreign minister is  aimed at giving complete legitimacy to the Zionist occupation of  the occupied territories in return for giving the Palestinians  some powers to administer their affairs.    This agreement seeks to make the treacherous and rejected  occupation a legitimate authority acceptable to the Palestinian  people. Therefore, this festival is one of fraudulence attended  by several foreign and Arab false witnesses.    It is a crime committed against the land, man, and history.  They want us to believe this is the long-awaited peace. We  ask: Where is the sovereignty? Where are the rest of the  rights? What is the fate of the detainees? What is the fate of  the rest of the occupied territories? What is the fate of the  millions in the diaspora? What is the fate of Jerusalem? What  is the fate of all Palestine? Where is all this in the agreement?    Nothing, nothing. There is nothing now or even in the  future, because 'Arafat has accepted the bare minimum to enable  the Palestinian people to establish a state on even a part of  their land in the future. It is a new treason with widespread  Arab blessing. The fraudulence in Cairo was preceded by two  ceremonies in Muscat and Doha celebrating peace and cooperation  with the enemy.    We urge the sons of the Palestinian people and the sons of  our nation to realize the dangers of this new plot and to use  all means to undermine the prospects of the plotters and foil  their schemes by rejecting all projects presented under the  banner of a promised peace and future for the Palestinian people  and the region's nations. These represent the worst link in the  chain of moves to destroy and seize the region.    This new plot will not pass, regardless of its potentials  and  supporters and regardless of the extolling headlines. Our  nation will be lying in wait and will not allow some ostracized  people to exploit our nation in order to serve their interests  and threaten our nation's interests.    Certainly, it is a day of mourning and grief for the  Palestinian people and the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation  to see that the Palestinian people have become an isolated  community in a state where the authority of the Jewish usurpers  is being legitimized.</p>

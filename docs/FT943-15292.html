			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / ITC ruling steps up US wheat row with Canada The US International Trade Commission found in a 6-0 decision yesterday that Canadian wheat imports constitute 'a material interference' with domestic wheat price supports and recommended President Bill Clinton impose sanctions against Canadian grain. The ITC investigation, conducted over six months at the request of Mr Clinton, is the first official study to find Canadian wheat had measurably negative effects on US wheat prices. But the commission stopped short of labelling 'unfair' the practices of the Canadian Wheat Board - which controls virtually all wheat exports. That has been the contention of the domestic farm lobby led Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary. Mr Espy contends that Canadian wheat imports depress domestic prices and force the government to pay more in price support programmes to US wheat farmers - a theory confirmed by the ITC investigation. The wheat row is the latest in a series of disputes between the US and Canada over natural resources and government farm programmes. Each of the six ITC members will submit separate recommendations to Mr Clinton next week outlining a range of options he can take, including a tariff of up to 50 per cent of current import values, a quota of no less than 50 per cent of the amount currently imported or a tariff rate quota. Although Mr Clinton has the option of taking no action against Canada, he has previously promised to follow the ITC's recommendations. Most of the ITC members recommended temporarily restricting Canadian wheat imports to 900,000 tonnes a year. Two commission members expressed reservations over the findings. The Canadian embassy called the ITC report a 'narrow examination' and highlighted the 'substantial qualifications' expressed by commission members. The embassy also said it was 'prepared to go back to the table' to negotiate, but emphasised that its position had not changed.</p>

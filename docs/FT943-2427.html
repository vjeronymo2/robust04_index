			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Zurich In a week bereft of statements from leading companies, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector is likely to remain at the centre of attention after last week's war of words between the analysts. Roche, the market's flagship stock, was under pressure on Thursday after Goldman Sachs removed it from its European 'recommended for purchase' list. Goldman said growth in the pharmaceutical industry had slowed in the first half of 1994 as market forces in the US and healthcare cost reforms in Europe took effect. Other factors included a reduction in the long-term growth rates for major divisions, the impact of the Syntex acquisition, disappointing second-quarter sales, the Swiss franc's strength, and a decrease in net cash. The Roche certificates derived little benefit on Friday when Barclays de Zoete Wedd reiterated its 'strong buy' recommendation, citing the company's strong growth. Elsewhere in the sector, UBS has downgraded Sandoz to a 'hold', saying that the 2 per cent growth in first-half net profits was below market expectations. Mercur, the retailer, reports first-half figures on Friday. Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim is forecasting a 5 per cent rise in first-half turnover, the figure depressed by the strength of the Swiss franc, and a 7 per cent increase in net profit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] North Ossetia will cut short any attempt to wreck  its current talks with Ingushetia, said an expert from the North  Ossetian delegation to the negotiations between the two Russian  Republics. In an interview with INTERFAX on Monday, he  expressed the hope that the two sides would ultimately sign a  final accord. "We wish to live in peace and intend to persuade  the Ingush side to take the same position," he said.    North Ossetia believes it is impossible to stabilize the  situation in the zone of the conflict between the two Republics  unless Ingushetia gives up its claim to North Ossetia's  Prigorodny District, the expert said. But he said none of the  documents drawn up by the Ingush side had a provision to that  effect. "In Kislovodsk, we agreed that we would not interfere  into each other's internal affairs, but the Ingushes' claim to  North Ossetian territory is precisely an instance of such  interference," he said.    The expert said that, at the second round of talks, which  ended on Friday, it had been suggested that North Ossetia's  leadership get in direct contact with Ingush refugees wishing to  return to Prigorodny District. "To date we only have 14,000  applications from Ingushes, but, at the same time, we know that  not all of the 40,000 wish to come back," he said.    According to some sources, the third round of talks is  tentatively scheduled to start in a week. Meanwhile, experts on  both sides will be working on the agreements, the sources told  INTERFAX.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Postal sell-off lacked fan mail Only a small fraction of responses to the government's consultation paper on the Post Office were in favour of privatisation, Mr Tim Eggar, industry minister, disclosed yesterday. Mr Eggar said in a parliamentary written answer that about 60 responses  - or less than than 0.4 per cent of the 15,400 received - were 'positively in favour' of full or partial privatisation. He said most replies took the form of 'standard form' letters and postcards issued by organisations campaigning against the government's proposals. Ministers were forced this month to cancel plans to privatise the Royal Mail letters division of the Post Office because of the implacable opposition of a small number of Conservative backbenchers. Mr Eggar was replying to a question by Mr Gordon Prentice, Labour MP for Pendle. Labour has indicated it intends to inflict fresh embarrassment on the government by inviting Tories who opposed a sell-off to back a Commons motion giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom.</p>

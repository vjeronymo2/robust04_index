			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds ahead 35% to Pounds 498m - Outcome boosted by release of Pounds 154m problem country debt provision LLOYDS BANK yesterday disappointed the market with half-year results which showed pressure on retail banking income from slack domestic loan demand. This was despite a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 498m, against Pounds 369m. The pre-tax figure was in line with expectations, but was helped by a higher than expected release of problem country debt provisions of Pounds 154m. This made its problem country debt unit the most profitable of the bank's operating sectors. Lloyds nonetheless covered its dividend 3.5 times after raising it 12 per cent to 6.6p (5.9p), and Mr Brian Pitman, the bank's chief executive, said it was considering ways to redistribute excess capital as earnings grow. Mr Pitman said Reuters' recently announced scheme to spend Pounds 350m buying back 5.8 per cent of its own equity was 'very intriguing' although he had not yet studied it closely. This was one possibility for handing back excess cash. Since Lloyds' failed bid to buy Midland last year, there has been speculation over how it will spend capital. Mr Pitman said it would have to choose when its ratio of equity to total assets rises from the current 4.4 per cent to 6 per cent. The bank was affected by falls in base rates, which reduced earnings on UK interest-free deposits. It lost earnings of Pounds 39.4m on interest-free funds of Pounds 6.4bn as the net interest margin narrowed to 3.97 per cent (4.36 per cent). This squeezed income in UK retail banking, where it made a profit of Pounds 17m (Pounds 3m loss). Operating profits fell by 4 per cent despite a 5 per cent reduction in costs, and provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to Pounds 209m (Pounds 241m). Mr Pitman said this was a 'hopeless' return on equity of about Pounds 1bn, but the bank believed it could raise returns substantially as provisions fell by cutting costs at 1 per cent per year while raising income 5 per cent a year. Some of Lloyds' ratios were affected by the adoption of an EC directive which requires grossing up of assets, and a new Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice. The bank also adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard for the first time. These changes lowered the restated tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets to 6 per cent (6.2 per cent restated from 6.7 per cent). Including unaudited retained profits, the figure would rise to 6.5 per cent. The ratio of costs to income fell to 65.5 per cent (67.1 per cent restated from 63 per cent). The bank's total operating profit before provisions rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 632m (Pounds 577m restated). But costs rose by Pounds 25m (2 per cent) on exchange rate movements despite a 4 per cent reduction in the number of employees to 62,551. Assets grew 7 per cent on the end of 1992 to Pounds 74bn. Holdings of debt securities rose to Pounds 4.7bn (Pounds 3.4bn), and the acquisition of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation added Pounds 1bn. Customer loans rose marginally to Pounds 39.1bn (Pounds 38.8bn). Mr Pitman said the scope for growing domestic loans was limited by the fact that inflation has fallen. He said the bank would try to generate added income by being more imaginative in devising personal savings products. Provisions fell 34 per cent to Pounds 138m (Pounds 209m), as the bank's problem country debt unit made a profit of Pounds 176m. Excluding the problem country debt provision release, the charge of Pounds 292m was 6 per cent down on the first half of 1992. Earnings per share rose 43 per cent to 23.5p (16.4p) and net assets per share rose 13 per cent to 232p (205p). The shares closed 25p down at 557p. See Lex</p>

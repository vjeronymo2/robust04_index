			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol 22 April TASS -- Ukrainian Defence  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy described as a complete surprise the  behaviour of the Russian defence minister who did not return to  negotiations on gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet  problem after the break.    In the opinion of Radetskyy, the negotiations started rather  successfully and the sides reached an essential agreement on the  fleet division under which Russia will get over 600 units and  ukraine -- over 150.    Speaking of basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the  Ukrainian Navy, Radetskyy said the Russian side offered  conditions unacceptable for Ukraine, under which all Crimean  bases shall be kept by Russia.    He said they are ready to discuss compromise variants and  there were no reasons to break the dialogue.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Engineering pay freezes for 1-in-5 MORE THAN one in five engineering workers in South Yorkshire and the north Midlands have accepted pay freezes in the past 12 months, the Sheffield Association of the Engineering Employers' Federation said yesterday. In the year ended May 31, about 22 per cent of the 350 companies in the association negotiated pay freezes. More than 40 per cent settled for pay rises of up to 2 per cent. Although a quarter settled at between 3.1 per cent and 4 per cent, nearly all those were concluded almost a year ago.</p>

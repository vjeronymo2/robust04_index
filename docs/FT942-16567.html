			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Institutions acquire Spring Ram stake sold by US investor Lazard Freres Asset Management, the US investment group, has sold its 6.5 per cent stake in Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, with De Zoete &amp; Bevan, the brokers, buying and placing the shares. The new owners are largely UK institutions. Spring Ram said it was pleased that the shares had been 'placed with long term institutions who know us well'. De Zoete, part of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, bought 34.2m shares, comprising 29.4m old shares and the balance in new shares from January's rights issue, at a price of 55 3/4 p. The old shares were then placed at 56 1/2 p. Because of the difference between the old and new shares, the former being entitled to a 0.1p dividend, De Zoete is understood not to have placed the new shares to avoid confusion. However, it is believed to have hedged its position in the remaining new shares by selling short. Spring Ram old shares fell 2p to 59p with volume recorded at 63.9m shares, reflecting both the purchase and placing. The new shares were down 2p at 61p, with volume of 4.93m shares.</p>

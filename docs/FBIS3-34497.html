			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 7 (INA)--A recent report by a Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) mission has confirmed earlier  conclusions by another FAO/WFP survey that warns of a rapid  deterioration in food supply situation throughout Iraq. The  present mission report, issued in December last year, notes with  deep concerns the prevalence of several commonly recognized  pre-famine indicators. These conclusions, based on observations  and interviews in several areas of the country, confirm the  presence of such indicators as very high food prices, collapse  of private incomes, depletion of personal assets as well as  rapidly increasing numbers of the destitutes. Following is the  fourth part of the FAO mission report:    The shortage in water supply has led to severe problems in  hygiene. According to health authorities outbreaks of lice,  typhoid, and cholera continue to be serious public health  problems in al-Basrah and throughout the country (department in  al-Basrah, personal communication).    Moreover, sanitation has become a common problem in schools  that now have 2-3 shifts a day leading to facilitated  transmission of water-borne diseases amongst the primary age  school children. Care International reported that in 1954 [year  as received] it plans to rehabilitate school lavatories.    Although the extensive vaccination supply system and the  cold  chain broke down completely immediately after the war,  immunization rates are back well above 80 per cent, better than  pre-war levels in certain areas (UNICEF 1993, personal  communication). The Ministry of Health has received substantial  assistance from UNICEF/WHO in maintaining the cold chain and in  the provision of vaccines for immunization. The mission noted  adequate stocks of vaccines in Maysan and Irbil Governorates.  In addition, many mothers when asked, knew about the BCG  vaccination.    Although little is known about the incidence of acute  respiratory factions (ARI), drugs to treat infections in  children remain inadequate. The mission noted that several  cases of ARI in the pediatric wards of Saddam City Hospital in  Baghdad. These cases were receiving antibiotic treatment but  physicians complained of shortages, especially during the later  winter months when ARI is a more frequent occurrence. WHO does  provide drugs and other medical supplies, but the total amount  is insufficient to meet the needs of the population. In July to  March 1993, 780,000 U.S. dollars worth of drugs were provided  under the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Programme. However,  drugs to treat chronic diseases, anesthesia to perform basic  surgical procedures, nitrous oxide for birthing facilities as  well as antibiotics to control infection after surgery are  virtually unavailable as reported by several hospitals and the  minister of health. This was offered as the explanation of why  hospitals are now functioning at 40-50 per cent of their  original capacity in spite of the reported increase in  infectious disease and severe malnutrition.    Only severely ill cases are now being treated. Even when  drugs are available, their price on the free market may be 200  times greater than the government rationed price, thus making  them virtually unobtainable for the poor.    In summary, food insecurity at the household level,  inadequate water and sanitary system, and the shortage of drugs  to treat infections are likely to result in more serious  malnutrition.    A small scale study was conducted in collaboration with the  Nutrition Research Institute in one of the least privileged  areas of Baghdad Saddam City.    The objective of the study was to observe first hand the  household food security situation in a disadvantaged subsample  of the urban population and to assess their nutritional status  using simple anthropometric measures. All members of the family  present at the time of the home visit were measured and their  age ascertained utilizing whenever possible the subjects health  cards, eight of the 13 clusters in Saddam City canvassed during  the 1991 international team survey were selected for the study  to permit a comparison.    Although the study was carried out by five teams, results  from only 4 teams are reported. These teams were supervised by  mission members. Each team included two technicians and one  professional supervisor from the Nutrition Research Institute  and one member of the mission. One hundred and twenty one  households were visited and a total of 506 subjects were  measured; 194 were children under 5 years of age, 136 children  between 5 and 15 years of age, and 172 persons 15 years of age  and older.    Mission member observed that a number of households had sold  most of their family assets: Furniture, refrigerators,  television, jewelry, and other items. Some of the children and  adults wore tattered clothes but most households appeared to  have access to kerosene for heating, tap water, and electricity.    The study had a number of limitations. The sample was not  representative of Baghdad as a whole; it was purposely chosen to  assess the situation among an underprivileged urban group but  results cannot be extrapolated to a defined sector of the Iraqi  population. The study had other limitations; the bathroom  scales to weigh the preschool children were designed to weigh  adults and therefore lacked precision when used to measure  children. It should be noted, however, that although these  scales were not calibrated and standardized because of lack of  time, they were SECA manufactured and used for the first time.  They were provided by UNICEF for use in anthropometric  measurements. Baby balances (SECA) were used in weighing very  young infants below 10 kg weight. The height boards and tapes  were all new and perfectly suitable for the purpose. The  enumerators included persons with variable degrees of experience  in taking anthropometric measurements and there was no time to  train them or to standardize their techniques.</p>

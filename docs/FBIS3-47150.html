Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, and other congressmen told Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu that they expect positive progress in ongoing  negotiations, according to Chang Chai-ryong, director-general of  the Foreign Ministry's American Affairs Bureau.    The U.S. visitors agreed that dialogue, at least for now, is  the best way of solving the problem, Jang said.    The group came to Seoul last week after a field trip to  Russia and Japan.    Nunn was quoted as telling Han that Moscow officials  explained to him that they opposed North Korea's acquiring  nuclear weapons.    The U.S. senator mainly asked questions, mostly about South  Korea's evaluation of North Korea-U.S. dialogue, the degree of  Seoul-Washington cooperation in countering the situation, and  China's possible contribution to solving the problem.    He also is said to have asked about South Korea's position  on  possible relations improvement between North Korea and the  United States once the nuclear question is resolved.    When Nunn inquired about the possibility of sanctions if  dialogue fails, Han said that he hopes to clear up the problem  before it goes that far, Jang said.</p>

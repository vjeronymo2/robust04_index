			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: France's new bull-fighter Will Francis Lorentz, deposed chairman of France's state-owned Groupe Bull, be remembered for presiding over one of the biggest losses in computer industry history, or turning round a showcase of French technology? A year after he took over the helm, Bull lost FFr6.7bn. To be fair, most computer companies were caught by the speed of the recession which forced a sudden downturn in capital spending. But critics argue that his strategy to revive Bull's flagging fortunes - including staff cuts, a move to 'open' or industry standard systems, and the purchase of the US computer manufacturer Zenith Data Systems - came too little and too late. Lorentz was constrained by the need to present a public face acceptable to his major shareholder, the government, which continues to promote Bull as the national computer champion. Clearly, disagreements with Madame Cresson, the former French prime minister, did not help. On balance, Lorentz has done a good job although it's a shame he wasn't given longer to prove himself. But even he would admit that he was luckier than his successor - Bernard Pache. At least Lorentz learned the computer trade from the doyen of the European industry, Jacques Stern. Pache has no such tutor and his main claim to fame so far is that he has wielded the axe to France's coal mining industry without causing a revolution.</p>

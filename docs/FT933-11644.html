			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Reichmanns end up with control of O&amp;Y unit THE REICHMANN family has ended up controlling O&amp;Y Properties, a Toronto property management and leasing company that survived the collapse of their Olympia &amp; York Developments, writes Robert Gibbens. The Reichmanns lost control of O&amp;Y Developments early this year when it was restructured and taken over by creditors. The management and leasing operation was spun off into O&amp;Y Properties. Mr Philip Reichmann, Albert Reichmann's 35-year-old son, and Frank Hauer, his 34-year-old son-in-law are buying 90 per cent of O&amp;Y Properties from the O&amp;Y Developments administrator. The remaining 10 per cent was already held by the family.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Japanese cars and the EC CLAIMS BY some members of the European Commission that its recent outline proposals for limiting Japanese car sales are a victory for free-trade principles indicate how far its deliberations have descended into double-think. The most likely outcome will be to cushion inefficient European carmakers and ensure windfall profits for Japanese producers at the expense of EC consumers. In the name of unifying the EC market, Brussels proposes to negotiate 'transitional' restraints on the growth of Japanese car sales in the five countries where imports are currently subject to national curbs. The planned controls, intended to last until 1998 or 1999, would be enforced by Japanese 'monitoring' of deliveries. It is hardly surprising that the Japanese see benefits in such arrangements. EC controls would enable them to set higher prices and earn fatter margins than if there were free competition. That is what happened after Japanese carmakers agreed to voluntary restraints on exports to the US in 1981. If the EC wants to give its car industry time to adjust to competition, it would be more sensible to negotiate a temporary increase in tariffs on car imports, as it would be entitled to do by international trade rules. That would, at least, ensure that the benefits of high prices went to the Community rather than to the Japanese. It would also establish a formal institutional mechanism - lacking from Brussels' proposals - for ending the period of protection. Implicit control Why did Brussels not choose that option? Partly because the controls it is contemplating will extend beyond imports to output from Japanese-owned assembly 'transplants' inside the Community. That has not been made explicit, if only because it would violate the Rome Treaty. Yet in practice Brussels aims to include both sources of supply when it comes to fixing precise limits on sales. If growth of shipments from one source threatened to breach the overall ceiling, the Japanese would be expected to adjust by reducing supplies from the other. In short, the EC is out to create a cartel. Some defenders of EC policy claim no great harm will be done, because the eventual limits will reflect the 'natural' sales growth which the Japanese would have achieved if the EC market were fully open. Apart from the difficulty of second-guessing sales trends for the rest of the decade, the argument begs the question of why the restrictions are needed at all. Arbitrary proposals The arbitrary nature of the proposals also invites other distortions and uncertainties. Suppose Honda acquired full control of Rover, with which it already collaborates on model development: would Rover's output then count as 'Japanese' or as 'European'? How would the EC treat output from 50/50 joint ventures owned by Japanese and European partners? It may be argued that, unsatisfactory as the EC's means are, they are justified by its ends - a completely open car market before the end of the decade. However, that pre-supposes either that the Commission will have the courage to resist political pressure to extend the restrictions when they are due to lapse; or that European carmakers will have improved their competitive position so dramatically that they no longer require protection. Events to date do not inspire great confidence in either assumption. Independent analyses suggest that the efficiency of the European car industry lags so far behind the Japanese that it will need many years of effort to draw even. Furthermore, few European carmakers have built a broad international sales base, rendering them exceptionally vulnerable to keener Japanese competition in their home markets. Japanese cars sell well because customers want to buy them. Continued restrictions not only deny consumers choice and distort the allocation of economic resources; all the evidence suggests that they would deprive European producers of the most powerful incentive to take the painful measures essential to their long-term survival.</p>

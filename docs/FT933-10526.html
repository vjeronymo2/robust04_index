			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Decision on air strikes papers over Nato split THE Nato council's declaration yesterday that it was prepared to use air strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was being digested by diplomats who warned that divisions remained among the allies and the United Nations about the nature and scale of such action. 'Everyone here is wanting consensus, and this morning's agreement is a step forward. But it is not at all cut and dried yet,' admitted a diplomatic official in Brussels. The agreement, hammered out after a long meeting of the Nato council in Brussels, proposes two separate scenarios under which allied air strikes might be used in Bosnia. The first proposal, which received the broad backing of the allies last week, is to use Nato's air power to defend the ground troops stationed in Bosnia. The second and more radical US-led proposal would use air strikes to attack Serbian artillery positions around Sarajevo, to break the siege of the city and let humanitarian convoys through. UN officials admitted that the logistics for the defensive air strikes were unlikely to be in place for another couple of days. 'We are ready to act, but it is a question of the ground controls,' a Nato spokesman said, adding that the air strikes were likely to involve the 60 or so French, British, Dutch and US aircraft currently stationed at Italian air bases. Nato officials also stressed that air strikes against the Serbian positions could not take place until the Nato council had held another meeting, widely expected to take place at the beginning of next week. Although most of the allies appear to have overcome their earlier fears that air strikes could lead to retaliation against UN ground troops, some allied delegations, including Canada, are known to remain nervous about full-scale air strikes. Some French officials have indicated that they would prefer the allied action to go even further to establish and guard safe havens in the region. Meanwhile, uncertainty emerged on whether air strikes would require a fresh UN mandate. Some Nato officials have insisted that attacks against Serb positions could be carried out within the current mandate. But international mediators in Geneva, piqued by earlier US proposals for unilateral air strikes, have insisted that any fresh decision could only be authorised by the UN secretary general. With the Geneva negotiations on a partition of Bosnia appearing increasingly fragile, defence experts yesterday warned that air strikes were unlikely to provide a simple solution to the conflict. Although most believe the allies could destroy the Serbian artillery that rings Sarajevo, given the relatively unsophisticated nature of the Bosnian Serb forces, they question whether they could do this before the Serbs inflicted a politically embarrassing degree of damage on the city or sought to retaliate against the UN troops elsewhere in Bosnia. Mr James Gow, lecturer in defence studies at King's College, London, said: 'Taking out the Serbian gun positions is not straightforward but they can do it. 'The problem is, though, that that might not be enough. Their best hope is that this would force the Serbs back to the negotiations.'</p>

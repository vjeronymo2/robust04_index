			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Bill Stacy, the president of Southeast Missouri State University, has been  named by the trustees of the California State University system to head its  20th campus -- a new university in San Marcos in northern San Diego County.  Stacy's appointment surprised and disappointed many people involved in the  four-month-long search process because he was not the first choice of either  community leaders, faculty, staff or students. But CSU Chancellor W. Ann  Reynolds said Stacy, 50, was the first choice of the trustees. Stacy, who will  be paid between $100,000 and $110,000 in his new post, was asked to report for  duty by the end of July. The new university will accept its first few hundred  students in the fall of 1990 in buildings now leased by San Diego State  University, which now offers upper-division courses in San Marcos. The San  Marcos campus will be constructed on a 300-acre site, once a chicken ranch,  with the first academic buildings opening for upper-division students in the  fall of 1992.  </P></p>

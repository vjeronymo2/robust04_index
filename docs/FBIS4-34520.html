			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu AIko Otta] </F>   [Excerpts] Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] President  Enrique Iglesias yesterday said that over the next four years,  Brazil will receive financial resources worth $5 billion. The  announcement was made after a meeting with Planning Minister  Beni Veras, with whom he discussed a timetable for releasing  financial resources in 1994 and in 1995.    No priority project for the 1996/97 period was selected at  yesterday's meeting. According to Iglesias, the Franco  government preferred to leave the decision in the hands of the  next administration, which will take power in January. [passage  omitted]    Iglesias said the lack of Brazilian matching funds for the  projects has caused no difficulties between the IDB and the  federal government. According to Agencia Brasil, Iglesias and  Planning Minister Beni Veras said that the only difficulties  have to do with project management.    Iglesias said that projects worth $1.2 billion should be  approved this year. This figure is higher than the $1 billion  mark the government was expecting for this period. "This shows  our confidence in the country," Iglesias said, praising the fact  that the Real Plan was preceded by fiscal control measures. Says  an IDB source: "They [not further identified] do not know much  about the plan, but they have great expectations about  stabilization; and wherever Brazil goes, Latin America will go."    Projects amounting to $1.4 billion are listed for 1995.  Iglesias said that it is their intention to earmark 50 percent  of these resources for social undertakings including improved  health, sanitation, education, transportation, and  infrastructure facilities. There are, however, other projects  intended for strengthening the institutions such as one  concerning the restructuring of the Federal Revenue Secretariat,  which is expected to receive between $78 million and $80 million  in 1995.    Iglesias also announced that the IDB will donate $20 million  for projects involving assistance to street children in six  cities: Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Teresina,  Salvador, and Recife. The money will be handed over to  nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) operating in those cities.  The donation will be approved by the IDB "board" on 29 June. He  said: "This will be a pioneer project in Latin America and shows  the direction the IDB is taking." [passage omitted]</p>

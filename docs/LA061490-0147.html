			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;  </P> <P> EXTENDING BUILDING BAN  </P> <P> The City Council found itself caught in a deadline squeeze Tuesday when it  discovered that a 45-day emergency moratorium on hillside construction expires  June 22 unless the council meets the day before to extend it.  </P> <P> But a problem exists.  </P> <P> The extension requires four votes of the five-member body, and two of the  council members will be out of town that Friday. To keep the moratorium in  place, the council decided to meet at 8 a.m. June 25.  </P> <P> Since City Hall is closed over the weekend, the council hopes that the  early-morning passage of the extension will thwart developers who might take  advantage of the moratorium's expiration. The council was unable to vote on an  extension Tuesday because it had not met a 10-day notice requirement.  </P> <P> It was the second time this year that a deadline on the hillside matter had  caught the city unaware. On Jan. 4, the council held a special meeting after  city officials discovered that a previous moratorium had expired and that a  developer had applied for a subdivision permit.  </P> <P> A city-appointed task force is working on a permanent ordinance.  </P></p>

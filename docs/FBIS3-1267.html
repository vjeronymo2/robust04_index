			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Paul Biya in Yaounde on 23 March -- </F> live or recorded]    [Excerpts] My dear compatriots: The IMF board of directors  has just endorsed our economic recovery program and decided to  back it. It is an important event that deserves our fullest  attention. It is important because it has a bearing on our  country's future. It is important because, henceforth, it will  determine our multilateral and bilateral relations with our  foreign partners to a certain extent. [passage omitted]    The international finance community's attitude clearly shows  the confidence it places in our country and its acknowledgement  of your efforts. I solemnly wish to thank the IMF on your  behalf.    My dear compatriots I wish to salute the courage you have  shown in accepting and enduring the sacrifices imposed on you.  You have shown a high sense of responsibility in difficult  circumstances. As you can see today, those sacrifices were not  in vain. We are therefore on the right path but we should not  relent in our efforts. I expect the administration to further  mobilize its efforts to implement the reforms which still seem  necessary. [passage omitted]    If we keep inflation -- which was inevitable following the  CFA franc devaluation -- at a reasonable level, there is a good  chance that we will get out of the crisis and that our future  will be promising. I must point out that no matter how much aid  we receive from our friends and foreign partners, the success of  our recovery program will depend mainly on ourselves. Let us  look around us. All countries -- big or small, rich or poor --  are facing problems and are quite naturally giving priority to  their own needs.    The time-honored development strategies that have been used  since independence are out of date. We must henceforth  concentrate more than ever on the task of national  reconstruction, relying first on our own strengths. There is  therefore no denying that Cameroon cannot be tempted by external  adventurism. Although there is no question of giving up our  sovereignty over the least portion of our territory, our  attitude remains that of moderation and conciliation. Can  Africa, which is already torn by several conflicts, really  accommodate new disputes between sister countries? Our  continent needs peace in order to achieve development and that  also holds for Cameroon. We will do everything in our power to  ensure that the gains achieved in all sectors over the past  years will not be jeopardized.    Of course, a lot more remains to be done to achieve our  goals, but we are about to see the light at the end of the  tunnel. Let us put our energies together. Let us be  imaginative and work harder. By so doing, I am sure we will  overcome our current difficulties and strengthen our people's  hope for a better future. Long live Cameroon.</p>

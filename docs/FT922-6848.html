			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / The Finance Bill: MPs ready to enact Budget THE FINANCE Bill, published yesterday, enacts most of the Budget announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in March. The bill is likely to survive its parliamentary stages intact, although, since the government majority is now just 21, there is scope for Tory backbenchers to push their hobbyhorses, possibly winning some concessions. It is difficult to predict where controversy might arise, but building societies were already reacting angrily yesterday to the fact that the government has not changed its stance on the societies' claim that they were taxed twice during the introduction of composite-rate tax in the late 1980s. Leeds Building Society said Clause 52 might spell the end of its attempts in the UK courts to recover what it claims is Pounds 57m of overpaid tax. Mr Mike Blackburn, Leeds chief executive, said: 'No single word adequately describes the action the government is proposing. It is outrageous and offensive to the rule of law. It makes a mockery of the Citizen's Charter and shows the Inland Revenue's Taxpayer's Charter is not worth the paper it is written on.' Last year's Finance Bill contained retrospective legislation preventing Leeds and others from following in the footsteps of the Woolwich, which had won a similar action. This year's retrospective legislation might close the door for good on action in the UK courts. If so, Leeds said it was prepared to take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights. The dispute stems from efforts by the government to bring building societies' tax payments, previously made annually, into line with the banks, which make their returns on a quarterly basis. About seven sessions are expected to see it through to a third-reading debate beginning in early July. It should pass into legislation around the middle of July. The new bill follows the Finance Act, which was given Royal Assent on March 16 and enacted the Budget's more controversial elements, including the new 20 per cent income tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income and excise duty changes. The bill is due to be debated in the Commons on June 2. Finance Bill. HMSO. Pounds 13.10. LABOUR is likely to raise the issue of stamp duty on house sales during discussion of the Finance Bill, Andrew Taylor and Alison Smith write. The move comes amid concern from housebuilders and estate agents that reintroducing stamp duty may halt a fragile recovery in the housing market when the concession ends in August. Industry leaders have been lobbying the government to try to get the concession on properties priced between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 250,000 extended. The concession was introduced at the end of last year to encourage the housing market. Some Tory backbenchers have said that the government would find it difficult to re-impose the duty unless the housing market was showing clear signs of recovery. Treasury ministers have made clear that there is no question of extending the holiday.</p>

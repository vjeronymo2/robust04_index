			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15-YEAR-OLD CHANGES PLEA TO GUILTY TO STRANGLING GIRL, 7, IN SEX ATTACK  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Newhall boy pleaded guilty Thursday to sexually assaulting and  killing a 7-year-old neighbor girl whose body was found stuffed behind his bed  three days after she disappeared.  </P> <P> Curtis Cooper changed his plea from not guilty on what was to have been the  first day of his trial in Sylmar Juvenile Court for the first-degree murder of  Sara Nan Hodges, who was strangled last March.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Rosenblatt said she will ask the court to impose  the maximum sentence when Cooper returns to court Nov. 22. The maximum penalty  is 25 years to life in prison, but because he is a juvenile, he would be sent  to the California Youth Authority first, where he would be held until he is 25.  At that time, Cooper could be transfered to a prison, but Rosenblatt said that  was unlikely because he was only 14 at the time he committed the crime.  </P> <P> However, Public Defender Barbara Duey, Cooper's attorney, said she will seek an  alternate facility for the youth. Cooper, she said, needs the type of  psychiatric counseling unavailable in the CYA.  </P> <P> "This kid's got real problems," she said, adding that Cooper has been "very  depressed" since his arrest.  </P> <P> When asked in court Thursday if he understood the charges against him and the  consequences of his guilty plea, the slender youth answered softly that he did.  His mother, Crystal Cooper, kissed her son on the cheek before the court  proceeding began and remained by his side as he admitted his guilt.  </P> <P> Cooper, then 14, moved to Newhall in February from Florida where he had been  arrested for a string of petty thefts and burglaries, authorities said. He  lived with his mother on Alderbrook Drive five doors away from his victim.  </P> <P> He sometimes went horseback riding with his blonde, blue-eyed victim,  authorities said, and was one of the first to volunteer to help search for her  after she was reported missing March 23.  </P> <P> "He was the first person here, saying what a nice little girl Sara was and  asking if there was anything he could do to help," said Sara's 16-year-old  sister, Tisha, shortly after her disappearance.  </P> <P> The girl's decomposing body was found three days later by the boy's landlady,  who made the grisly discovery when trying to locate the source of an odor. The  body was stuffed between a bedroom wall and the headboard of the boy's water  bed, authorities said.  </P> <P> He had set up a fan to blow the odor out an open window and had been sleeping  in the room before the body was found, investigators said.  </P> <P> Rosenblatt said the girl was strangled in the bedroom with a dog leash as the  youth was sexually molesting her. Authorities did not reveal any further motive  for the killing.  </P> <P> Four months after Sara's death, the girl's father, Walter Scott Mann, 36, of  Ojai shot and killed himself, falling dead on his daughter's grave in Newhall's  Eternal Valley Memorial Park after an all-day vigil. He left a suicide note  expressing his love for his daughter.  </P> <P> At the sentencing, Duey said she will show that Cooper has "some sort of brain  damage, very mild brain damage." She said several psychiatrists who have  evaluated the youth will testify at the hearing.  </P> <P> Duey added that the brain damage was not severe enough to warrant a plea of not  guilty by reason of insanity.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Rosenblatt said she was pleased with the outcome of Thursday's  proceedings.  </P> <P> "We were seeking the maximum and that's what we got," she said. "There was no  plea bargain."  </P> <P> The victim's mother, Linda Hodges, said she hopes that her daughter's killer  can be rehabilitated. She blamed Sara's death "on the way society treats the  mentally ill."  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: FTC takes a second look at Merck's purchase of Medco Merck, the biggest drugs maker in the US, confirmed yesterday that its Dollars 6.7bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services was being reviewed by anti-trust regulators, more than 10 months after the deal was completed. The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into the Dollars 2.3bn acquisition earlier this year of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, another pharmacy benefits management company, by the Anglo-US drugs group SmithKline Beecham. The reviews mark a new interest by regulators in the way some drug manufacturers in the US have bought control of distribution companies. Both companies said they believed they had already satisfied any concerns that the regulators may have. 'We are confident that this review, as was the case with the FTC's review performed last year, will demonstrate the pro-competitive effects' of the Medco acquisition, Merck said. The Dollars 4bn takeover by Eli Lilly of PCS, another distributor, was given FTC clearance two weeks ago, but only after a consent agreement with the regulators which laid down several conditions. This agreement was seen at the time as an indication of the FTC's renewed interest in the area, in spite of the fact that it had earlier cleared the Merck and SmithKline deals. In a statement on the Lilly decision, the two FTC commissioners who backed the deal in a 2-1 majority decision warned: 'We remain concerned about the overall competitive impact of vertical integration by drug companies into the pharmacy benefits management market.' In spite of its earlier approval for the deals, the FTC has the power to review Merck and SmithKline's activities to see if they have led to any breach of anti-trust laws. The agreement with Lilly has been seen in the drugs industry as a blueprint for the sort of conditions that the regulators may try to impose on the other companies. The main elements of this were a 'firewall', to prevent pricing information about other drugs sold through the distributors being leaked to Lilly, and a requirement for Lilly to maintain an 'open formulary' under which customers can continue to receive any pharmaceuticals through PCS's drug plans. Both Merck and SmithKline said they already met both of these requirements. 'We believe any agency concerns are already addressed by the manner in which Medco conducts its business,' Merck added.</p>

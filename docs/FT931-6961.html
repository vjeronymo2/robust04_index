			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: SKF passes payout after posting SKr1.8bn deficit SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, has passed its dividend after slumping to a SKr1.8bn (Dollars 229m) loss in 1992. The result was in line with the group's December forecast and reflects the impact of depressed markets, restructuring, and heavy losses within Ovako Steel. In 1991, when the group paid a SKr4.25 dividend, its loss amounted to SKr221m. This is the first time the group has not paid a dividend since 1923. Sales rose to SKr26.65bn from SKr26.30bn, thanks to the consolidation of Ovako Steel which had previously been reported as an associate company. Excluding Ovako, sales were 7 per cent lower at SKr24.37bn. The group said demand in the European market, which accounts for 60 per cent of its sales, declined steadily, and the trend accelerated towards the end of the year. The group has been particularly badly hit by the drop in European car production and Germany has become a particularly difficult market. By contrast, conditions improved in the US and the group increased its sales and earnings there for the second year running. In 1993, the group expects to make another loss because of continuing poor conditions in its key European markets but it has not given a specific forecast. 'Last year we finished weakly, and this year we have started weakly,' said a spokesman. The group's 1992 result includes a SKr1.1bn provision to cover the cost of further restructuring in 1993 and 1994 when the group expects to shed another 5,000 jobs. This will bring staff levels down to 42,000 by 1995. The group's core business, rolling bearings and seals, saw 1992 sales fall to SKr22.69bn from SKr24.35bn, while the loss after financial items increased to SKr1.26bn from SKr135m. Its second largest business, Ovako Steel, reported a SKr442m loss because of the drop in European special steel demand. It is expected to remain in the red again this year. SKF has been increasing its focus on its rolling bearings and seals operations, leading to the sale of its tools business, CTT Tools, to Sandvik from the start of this year. Last year the tools business made a SKr117m loss on sales of SKr1.73bn. The group says it has benefited from a fall in inventories and the impact of restructuring. The loss per share before extraordinary items amounted to SKr13.20, compared with SKr10.40 a year ago.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: A conversion to sculpture - Colin Amery visits the new Henry Moore Institute in Leeds On Thursday the Henry Moore Institute opens in Leeds. The opening event is an important occasion for two reasons. Firstly, the new institute is the headquarters of the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust, which has the exciting remit to encourage the appreciation of sculpture of all periods; secondly, the inauguration will unveil to the public an intriguing and original new building by the architects Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones. 'New building' is not quite an accurate description of the centre, which is a conversion of three 19th-century wool merchants' office buildings at the end of Cookridge Street, next door to the Leeds City Art Gallery. Leeds has some marvellous architectural set pieces from the last century, especially the proud, bombastic Town Hall by Cuthbert Broderick (1858). Its great tower rising out of the vast columned base is grander than Greenwich and redolent of Halicarnassus, despite being in the Corinthian mode. Broderick's oval Corn Exchange in Duncan Street is also a remarkable structure and has been well adapted to its new retail uses. The City Square demonstrates the pride the city fathers of Leeds had in their urban improvements, and the statuary - particularly the equestrian statue of the Black Prince and the rows of bronze maidens holding their lamps - are effective sculptural elements in the townscape. Sculpture is a growth industry in Yorkshire, largely because of the activities of the Henry Moore Foundation. Henry Moore was born in 1898 in Castleford near Leeds, the son of a Yorkshire coal miner. He went as a student to the Leeds art college after his demobilisation in 1919, and later to the Royal College of Art in London. At the Royal College he was to meet Barbara Hepworth as a fellow student - she had been born in Wakefield and was a scholar supported by the West Riding County Council. Coincidentally, their joint creative careers are both marked this year by the opening of this centre in Leeds and by the opening of the Tate Gallery in St. Ives, Cornwall, where Hepworth worked. All this Yorkshire creativity has come home to roost in Leeds, where the Henry Moore Foundation has spent Pounds 5m on the new centre. It has one of the very few new galleries in Europe designed specifically for the display of sculpture. Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones are clearly inspired by their frequent visits to the US. They seem to have absorbed that particularly American art gallery 'feel': in their conversion, the immaculate, minimally detailed white rooms gently smooths away the past of the old houses. It is a feeling I like for its neutrality and coolness, which demands great care from the architects and the project builders, depending as it does on precision. The major shock is the facade that greets you as you arrive on The Headrow. The long square from the Town Hall to the war memorial is a recent creation. Many of the buildings that face onto it were not designed with any civic presence. The new entrance facade of Moore Institute was originally the naked cut-off gable end of a partly demolished row of houses. The architects' bold decision to make this wall the entrance to the Institute demanded some architectural imagination to create a suitably civic facade. Not surprisingly they opted for a sculptural solution, but of the most minimalist kind. The architects have designed flights of steps mounting up towards the shiny blank black granite, where an asymmetrically placed slot marks the narrow entrance. The large black wall is totally abstract and could as easily represent a Yorkshire coalface or an ancient Egyptian tomb. It is to my eye reminiscent of the great black granite wall that forms the Vietnam war memorial in Washington DC. Or is it perhaps inspired by those 'vest pocket parks' that utilise the end-walls of partly demolished buildings in New York City and turn them into walls of water? Perhaps it is none of these things, but just a suggestion of a huge block of granite awaiting the hand of the sculptor. It is a radical and unusual solution to the planning problem. It certainly does not look inviting; my feeling is that it looks more like a tomb for Henry Moore than anything else. Inside, things are decidedly more cheerful. Light breaks out in a splendid way in the new main sculpture gallery, which has one entire wall of bronze framed obscured glass. The opening exhibition, Romanesque Stone Sculpture from Medieval England looks very good in this space despite the rather heavy-handed, but presumably necessary, metal mounts and stands. There is an opportunity to look at recently restored work from York Minster and Lincoln cathedrals. The good level of natural light and the total absence of any architectural detail make it possible for sculpture of all periods to be shown here with ease. The upper floors house the archive and study centre and the top floor has handsome administrative offices and a board room. The whole institute is linked to the main art gallery by an elegant new bridge. There is a lot to admire in the timber, glass and painted plaster interior of this new institute, and pleasure to be had in the atmosphere of calmness and contemplation that the architects have successfully created. The black facade shows how hard it is to move beyond the vacancies of abstraction to a convincing language for the faces of new public buildings.</p>

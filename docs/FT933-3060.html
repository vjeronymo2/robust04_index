			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais to float third of insurance unit CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French banking group, plans to float one-third of Union des Assurances Federales, its insurance subsidiary, on the Paris second market, the company announced yesterday. A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais said that the decision to sell a stake in UAF was part of the group's strategy of raising capital through the listing of subsidiaries. UAF is valued at about FFr1.6bn (Dollars 285m) in Credit Lyonnais' accounts. A sale of one-third of the group would raise between FFr500m and FFr700m in capital, according to analysts' estimates. Following its listing, expected by the end of the year, UAF will be one of the biggest companies on the Paris second market. One of France's 20 largest insurance groups, it had turnover in 1992 of FFr8.49bn in life assurance and FFr955m in general insurance. Last year it posted net profits of FFr368m. A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais said that he expected UAF to increase profits by 10 per cent this year.</p>

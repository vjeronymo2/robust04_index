			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Observer: Banking on it When it comes to working the old boy networks, retired central bankers are in a league of their own. An ex-chairman of the Fed, or former Governor of the Bank of England, is an asset to any company letterhead. Take Karl Otto Pohl, who surprised everybody by stepping down from the Bundesbank presidency last year. A partner in the respected Cologne private bank of Sal Oppenheim and a member of JP Morgan's International Council, he's collected an impressive portfolio of non-executive directorships such as Unilever, Robeco, Royal Dutch Shell, Bertelsmann, Zurich Insurance, etc, etc. His latest job is deputy chairman of the curiously-named Corange, a Bermuda-based holding company for the successful German health care concern, Boehringer Mannheim. Corange is French for Engelhorn (angel horn), the name of the German family which owns the group. And guess which consultancy thought up the idea for the new independent board? Why the Zurich-based Leutwiler &amp; Partners headed by Fritz Leutwiler, former head of the Swiss National Bank and the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

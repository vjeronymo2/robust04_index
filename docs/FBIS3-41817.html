Scientists fear the plague may prove as devastating as that  which wiped out most of England's elm trees 20 years ago and is  now killing the new elms that sprung from the root systems of  the old.    Fungi is believed to be attacking the alders' roots and  causing the branches to die back, but experts disagree over the  seriousness of the disease. The most alarming case is at the  National Grid Company's environmental education centre near  Canterbury, Kent, which includes a 20-acre nature reserve built  around a water filled former gravel quarry.    Tony Harman, the centre's manager, began noticing two years  ago that the tips of alder branches were dying, particularly at  the top of trees. "Since then it has got a lot worse," he said.  "We reckon we have now lost about 40 percent of our alders."    Some of the trees, their roots weakened, toppled over into  the water and others have been turned into leafless skeletons.  Some had to be cut down because falling branches endangered  school children visiting the reserve.    Alders account for up to 30 percent of tree cover on  riverbanks. Georges Dusart, a senior lecturer in ecology at  Christ Church College in Canterbury, said: "Alders not only look  attractive; they are also important for fish life by providing  river shade and food in the form of insects that fall from their  leaves.    "I have been walking along riverbanks for 25 years and I  have  never seen so many alder deaths before."    In an article in Farmers Weekly earlier this  summer, Dr. Dussart asked farmers with diseased alders to  telephone him. He soon received calls from all parts of England.    The Forestry Commission is more cautious about the extent of  the disease. David Rose, a tree pathologist at the commission's  Alice Holt research station near Farnham, Surrey, said: "There  does appear to be a recurring fungal problem with alders. It is  locally serious, but there is nothing yet to indicate we are  facing a national epidemic on the scale of Dutch elm disease."  The preliminary results of analysis of tree samples from the  Canterbury site suggest that the fungus attacking the roots of  the alders belongs to the phytophthora family, which  also cause potato blight, Mr. Rose said. The fungus may have  migrated northwards from sub-tropical climes.    Dutch elm disease destroyed 25 million elms, including 90  percent of those in southern England in the 1970's. The fungus  which attacked them was spread by bark beetles. The fungus is  still present in the roots of the destroyed trees and new elms  that have grown from the remains of the old are now mature  enough to sustain populations of the beetles which renew the  attack.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Aty-Baty" program] </F>   [Text] Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian  Federation Air Force, has reported that no mutually acceptable  agreement on delivery of the strategic bombers deployed on  Ukrainian territory to Russia has yet been achieved. He  remarked that there are currently 42 strategic missile planes,  of which 19 are TU-160 and 23 TU-95-MS. According to him, the  stumbling block is the astronomical sum demanded by Ukraine for  transferring the bombers. Ukraine wants 700 billion rubles of  its debt to Russia deducted for its delivering the planes.  According to Russia, this sum amounts to about 200 billion  rubles.</p>

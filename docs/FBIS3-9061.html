			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, by Attila Zsoldos; place and date not given: "The  MDF Intimidates and Threatens the Voters, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan  Peto Said"]    [Text] According to Ivan Peto, the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] has still not understood that a party is one of the  elements of political life and is not identical to the  population. He also thinks that the biggest governing party  builds its campaign on four major elements: the propaganda of  success, separating the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and  the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the intimidation of  the electors, and the open threat that chaos would ensue in the  country if the opposition parties came to government after the  elections. In his interview with NEPSZABADSAG, Peto emphasized  that the lasting consequences of a campaign based on the  incitement of emotions will have a decisive effect on the period  after the elections. However, a forced situation might arise in  which the major parliamentary parties have to form closer ties  than they have been used to. At the same time, Peto did not see  much chance of this forced situation arising. We first asked  Peto about his view on the latest campaign statements of the  MDF's leading politicians.    [Peto] I can see four major elements in the MDF's campaign.  One of these is the propaganda of success, which has been  mentioned many times. I do not see any problem in the fact that  a party or a government in power tries to convince the people  that what they feel is not true and reality is different.  However, it is worth analyzing what means they use in the  interest of the propaganda of success. I see the fact that the  government attributes everything that has happened in this  country in the past four years that was not something negative  to its own merit as more of a joke than a serious statement.  The frequently heard declaration that Hungarian democracy was  created by the MDF is more interesting. Although 15 March 1988,  when the MDF thought that the commemoration should not be held  in the streets, was not very long ago. It was not long ago,  either, when precisely the MDF's leaders expressed their  disapproval about the politicians of the SZDSZ and the Fidesz  having a more outspoken attitude.    However, the propaganda of success also has a more  problematic side. The MDF's politicians have a liking for  saying that people who dare question that the success propaganda  is well founded are in fact questioning the population's  successes. In other words, they try to depict those who  criticize them in some kind of anti-people light. It is typical  of the MDF's self-image that it cannot process or understand the  fact that a party is only an element of political life and is  not identical to the people.    [Zsoldos] MDF Chairman Lajos Fur recently said that their  period of being defensive had ended. What do you think this  means?    [Peto] It was obvious that the "fortress under siege"  mentality that has always been discerned in the MDF will  increase with the approach of the elections. They have always  refused criticism whether it came from the press or the  opposition, so I do not see any new developments in the MDF's  attitude. They only made an exception with the Fidesz because  they have reacted to criticism coming from the Fidesz more  tolerantly.    [Zsoldos] I do not believe you mention this unintentionally.    [Peto] Interestingly, the MDF has a chosen party among the  opposition, namely the Fidesz. It has also been typical of the  past four years that -- on a political level and not in  individual statements -- the MDF's views on the Fidesz have  always been very different from those on the SZDSZ. This  distinction was particularly strange in those cases when the  concepts of the two opposition parties were virtually identical.  This is obviously a dual-purpose tactic on the MDF's part. It  is trying to divide the Fidesz and the SZDSZ in such a way as to  turn the Fidesz into a possible coalition partner for itself.    [Zsoldos] It seems that the Fidesz is an opposition party  that is similar to the governmental Christian Democratic  People's Party because all significant political forces see it  as a potential partner.    [Peto] We can put it this way, but this "positive  discrimination" is usually applied to the weak parties. If the  Fidesz's election hopes come true, this role will be too narrow  for it. The Fidesz would visibly like to get into a position  where it is acceptable for everyone. The MDF is making use of  this intention when, as the second marked element of its  campaign, it is trying to get the Fidesz to break the unity of  the liberal parties.    [Zsoldos] You are probably unmoved by this attempt. The  Fidesz signed the cooperation agreement of the liberal parties  and [Fidesz Chairman] Viktor Orban often emphasized that he  considers the contents of this agreement as the norm when  forming their policies. In other words, you have no reason to  worry, or do you?    [Peto] I am not particularly concerned about this tactic of  the MDF's.    [Zsoldos] Nevertheless, you mentioned it.    [Peto] The Fidesz's coalition possibilities will not be  determined by the MDF's intentions. After the elections, the  MDF will not be in a position to select coalition partners for  itself. It might be able to accept offers, at the most.    [Zsoldos] Are you sure about this?    [Peto] I am. I believe that the MDF's parliamentary  candidates have now also come to realize this.    [Zsoldos] Why?    [Peto] It is rumored that the citizens are not fighting to  shower the MDF with candidate nomination slips.    [Zsoldos] In the interview we mentioned Fur also said that  he does not know whether the SZDSZ is actually a left-wing  party. In his view, it appears to be one because it is getting  increasingly closer to the idea of a coalition with the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP].    [Peto] I do not like these kinds of messages. These  issues could be discussed with Fur in a public television  debate, for example, if such things existed. As a matter of  fact, the interview indicated that Fur does not have a realistic  knowledge of the program the SZDSZ represents at the elections.    [Zsoldos] A week ago, you said that people in the provinces  still feel that registers are kept on them. Why did you say  this?    [Peto] On the basis of my experience. It happens with  increasing frequency that people do not like to give candidate  nomination slips to opposition parties because they feel that  this can have consequences. They are worried that they will be  identified on the basis of the personal identification number.  In my view, the MDF is responsible for this atmosphere. I  believe that intimidation is the third main element of their  campaign.    [Zsoldos] But why do you blame the MDF for the worries?    [Peto] Because these people think that if the MDF government  had the courage to fire Akos Mester [former chief editor of "168  Ora" program] from the Radio, then it can also destroy the  defenseless citizens if they give the nomination slips to  opposition parties. If I also add that very many people have  received government propaganda material sent to them with their  name, address, and personal identification number on it, then it  is even clearer why many people feel that they are on registers.  From this point of view, the dismissal of the radio workers was  a consciously timed and very effective action.    [Zsoldos] What do you think about the views of certain  government politicians according to whom chaos will ensue in the  country if the opposition comes to government? Is this also  part of the intimidation?    [Peto] No, this belongs to the category of threats. I see  this as the fourth determining element of the MDF's campaign,  and as a proof of what I have said about the MDF's self-image.  The foreign political consequences of the "we are the nation  and if we are not in power then the nation's power does not  prevail" attitude are also rather serious. It is ill-advised to  suggest to the world that the democratic elections in Hungary  could have some terrible outcome. Naturally, this threat is  mainly meant for the Hungarian citizens.    [Zsoldos] To the extent that these statements were made in  Hungary, rather than abroad.    [Peto] Unfortunately, not only in Hungary. I was in  Transylvania on 15 March and I was told that the Hungarian  Foreign Ministry state secretary had been alarming the  Hungarians living there that if the SZDSZ came to power, it  would seek the favor of the Romanians rather than the  Hungarians. However, these kinds of statements have serious  consequences even when they are made within the country. With  the approach of the elections, even more foreign journalists are  coming to Hungary. They and their embassies are watching the  media.    [Zsoldos] Do you have any concrete indications that these  statements have a negative influence on Hungary's image?    [Peto] There is tangible evidence that foreign political  forces that are not close to the MDF consider these campaign  measures, how shall I put it, peculiar. The foreign liberal and  socialist parties are offended by the fact that a group speaks  of parties that represent other political views as an extreme  national peril.    [Zsoldos] Do you believe that these campaign elements can  significantly influence the outcome of the elections?    [Peto] Naturally, they have an effect on the elections but  not a significant one. They are important in the sense that the  further consequences of politics based on the incitement of  emotions will determine the period after the elections. A  campaign that includes these unfair means does not improve  relations between the parties. What has happened has happened  and cannot be undone.    [Zsoldos] Are you suggesting that the MDF's ability to form  a coalition will decrease to the minimum in the SZDSZ's view if  it continues the criticized campaign?    [Peto] I am. It also means that the relationship that is  formed during the campaign can lastingly determine ties between  the two parties even if one is in opposition and the other in  government.    [Zsoldos] Relations between the MDF and the SZDSZ have never  been good.    [Peto] This is true. However, all cases that further  deteriorate the current relationship or reduce the possibility  of changing this relationship can have a lasting effect on  events.    [Zsoldos] The MDF has verbally excluded the possibility of  forming a coalition with the SZDSZ. On the other hand, the  SZDSZ has not distanced itself from the MDF in this way. It  emphasized that it is open to all democratic forces. Have your  views changed?    [Peto] We continue to see the replacement of the current  government coalition as one of the most important stakes at the  elections. Our most important goal is that the liberal forces  -- and the SZDSZ within this -- achieve the best possible  results. There is no point in discussing now what kind of forced  situation might arise after the elections.    [Zsoldos] Is it possible for a forced situation to arise in  which the MDF and the SZDSZ have to join in a coalition?    [Peto] A forced situation might arise in which the  possibility of this kind of coalition is raised. However, this  is not a goal for the SZDSZ, in fact, it is absolutely  undesirable.    [Zsoldos] Were you thinking of this forced situation when  you said that it would be desirable for relations between the  two parties not to deteriorate any further?    [Peto] There might be a situation when the two parties have  to rise above their own points of view in the country's  interest. It is possible that in this situation, the major  parliamentary parties have to have a closer than usual  relationship. However, this is only one possibility out of the  many and I do not see much chance of this happening.</p>

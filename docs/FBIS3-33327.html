			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmiento following a news conference </F> by EZLN leader Subcommander Marcos in San Cristobal de las Casas  on 22 February -- the second day of peace talks between the EZLN  and the Mexican Government; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Excerpt] The second meeting between EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] delegates and Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis with media representatives began at 1845 on  the second day of negotiations. The talks are part of the peace  and reconciliation negotiation process taking place at the  Cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is now being  called the Cathedral of Peace.    Yesterday, Subcommander Marcos, who heads a group of 19 EZLN  delegates, said his group will present to Peace Commissioner  Camacho Solis its list of demands. Today, Subcommander Marcos  affirmed that the dialogue for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas is on the right track.    [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] We want to tell the  people of Mexico, as well as tell the peoples and governments of  the world -- and we want to tell you, representatives of the  national and international media -- that the dialogue is on the  right track. We have found people are listening to us, and we  have seen a real determination toward achieving a solution.    Here, I want to address the concern that has been expressed  over our masked faces and our weapons. We do not understand the  concern with our faces, because before 1 January [the start of  the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas] our faces did not exist for you.  The faces of Ramona, Felipe, David, Eduardo, and Ana Maria did  not exist for this country on 1 January. Nevertheless, if you  want to know whose faces are behind the ski masks, it is very  easy -- simply pick up a mirror and look into it.    We want to tell you -- and we want to tell those who have  told the truth, not those who have followed the path of lies --  that if the killing has indeed stopped, it is thanks to you and  the people behind you. We ask, as brothers, that you continue  to tell the truth, and, if possible, we ask those of you who  have been telling lies to please stop lying.    We want you to support this ongoing dialogue. We want you to  report plainly what we are saying. What we are saying is the  truth. It is not good to seek two interpretations when only one  exists. This could bring about more problems in the future.    As I explained to you before, we are not carrying weapons  out  of mistrust for the government but, rather, for fear of those  forces whose interests have been affected by our movement. We  think that on this second day, after our main demands have been  listed -- yes, they have been pondered by the peace commissioner  -- we are moving toward seeking avenues that might allow us to  reach specific accords. Also, the committee asked me to clearly  state the following: It is ready to seek another alternative, if  this is possible, and to seek your advice and support in this  search for peace -- a peace with dignity -- for which we are  hoping.

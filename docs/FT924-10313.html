			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / City finds Lamont speech 'lame' ECONOMISTS in the City showed little enthusiasm yesterday for what the chancellor had said in his keenly awaited Mansion House speech. Mr Norman Lamont promised a new commitment to growth, lower interest rates, and no risks to inflation in the long term. 'Rather lame' seemed to be the London financial community's general view of a speech traditionally used to outline the government's monetary policy. Indeed, by yesterday morning few analysts felt much wiser about the government's intentions. 'The speech had more hands than a Hindu goddess,' said Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, the securities house. 'On the one hand he is going for growth, on the other hand he will control inflation; on the one hand he wants rates lower, on the other hand he will not ignore the sterling exchange rate. It was pretty Delphic stuff.' Yesterday, Mr Lamont said he had not intended to set out the government's strategy. The chancellor also made clear that he was ready to raise interest rates to defend the pound or if inflation threatened to breach the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range he announced at this month's Tory party conference. The City's unexcited to the speech response was reflected in the markets. The pound continued to drift downwards to close in London a pfennig lower at DM2.41. Share prices were lifted a little on hopes of an early interest rate cut. The FT-SE 100 share index closed 16 up at 2,658.3. A particular grievance among economists was that Mr Lamont did not deliver a coherent monetary strategy. 'It just leaves us with the same old flabby policy,' said Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the securities house, 'which means: cut interest rates now, get the economy going, then head off any inflation by putting interest rates up. 'We are left feeling very uncertain about whether or not a future chancellor would be prepared to raise rates if necessary.' His thoughts were echoed by Professor Tim Congdon, head of Lombard Street Research, an economics consultancy, who described Mr Lamont's speech as 'a dud'. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, was more charitable, if only because the speech was a departure from its usual form. 'It was quite an interesting Mansion House speech because it wasn't about monetary policy. It was about getting the economy moving.' The announcement that the Bank of England will make a regular report on inflation was greeted sceptically. 'The Bank has published quarterly bulletins for years but you have to read them very, very closely to find any criticism of the government,' Mr Saunders said. Or, as Mr Stephen Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank, said: 'Published minutes on the government's reasoning behind monetary policy changes could make very interesting reading. But if they want to make them meaningless, they will make them meaningless.'</p>

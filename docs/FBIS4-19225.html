			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Deficit in Trade With China"] </F>   [Text] Although exports to China increased even more  massively than imports from this country, Austria's trade  deficit with China amounted to 4.1 billion schillings.    Exports of 3.7 billion schillings (plus 41.4 percent) were  faced with imports of Chinese products of 7.8 billion schillings  (plus 30.6 percent), it was stated during the presentation of a  study of the Economic Research Institute on Tuesday [12 April].    "Machines and plants amount to almost 70 percent of  Austria's  exports to China," Ernst Laschan, Austrian trade delegate to  Beijing, said. With an export share of only 0.5 percent, China  is the 25th of target countries for domestic exports. In the  field of engines and road vehicles, Austria has already worked  out a good position on the Chinese market, he said.    According to Laschan, Austria can protect future sales with  products and know-how in the fields of agricultural technology,  the securing of fresh water, energy, transportation systems, and  telecommunications.</p>

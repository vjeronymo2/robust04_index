			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Profits fall at Pioneer and Sony SONY and Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese consumer electronics groups, each reported a steep decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which ended in June. The poor performance of both companies reflected weak demand throughout the world economy and the overcapacity in the consumer electronics industry that has led to a sharp inventory build-up and severe price competition. The industry is also suffering from a lack of new products with mass appeal. However, the declines in profits fell short of the worst fears in the market, where rumours on Monday that Sony had lost money at the operating level prompted a steep decline in share prices. Sony's pre-tax earnings were off 52 per cent to Y27.04bn (Pounds 110m), compared with the same period last year, while sales increased by 4.2 per cent to Y900bn. Pioneer saw its pre-tax profits fall by 38.5 per cent to Y9.87bn. Sales grew by 2.3 per cent to Y144.5bn. For Sony, which is a bellwether for the whole industry, the good news was that the company climbed back into profitability following a consolidated operating loss in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year amounting to about Y18bn. Sony's traditional electronic equipment business saw a year-on-year decline in profits of 46.7 per cent to Y27.3bn, while on the entertainment side of the business, which includes films and recorded music, profits grew by 26.3 per cent to Y9.45bn. The entertainment business, where Sony has enjoyed a string of hit records and films, has recently provided the only significant growth for Sony's business. However, analysts, and the company, say it is too early to tell whether Sony's expensive purchase of Columbia Pictures entertainment two and a half years ago has proved to be a success. Neither Pioneer nor Sony revised profits projections for the fiscal year ending next March; an indication that both companies are confident their businesses have stabilised, in spite of the deteriorating economic environment at home. For both companies, strong sales in the US helped to compensate for weakness in Japan. Results in full, Page 21</p>

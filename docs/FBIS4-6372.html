			<p>BFN     [Text] The Statistics General Department reveals that the  industrial production output countrywide in the first quarter of  1994 increased by over 11 percent compared with that in the  first quarter of 1993. The centrally managed industry recorded  an increase of nearly 13 percent, and the local industry nearly  10 percent.    The main reason for the sizeable increase in industrial  output in the last few months is that more and more business  establishments of all economic sectors now are adjusting  themselves better to the new economic management structure, thus  helping their production activities to settle and develop  quickly.    The sectors that achieved a healthy development rate are:  the  electricity sector with an increase rate of 9 percent, coal  production with an increase rate of 7 percent, crude oil with 17  percent, and cement with 12 percent.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Textile changes given impetus - Textiles A successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round is likely to add impetus to the structural changes that have swept textiles and clothing industries in the post-war years. International trade in the sector is worth Dollars 240bn (Pounds 160bn) a year. With some exceptions, cheap and mid-priced goods, and commodities such as thread, are today produced in south and east Asia, the fringes of Europe, and Latin America. Developed countries run trade deficits in clothing and textiles because trade barriers and production costs limit both domestic and export markets for their own goods. Under the Gatt pact, tariffs will come down and quotas on clothing and textiles will be abandoned over 10 years after 1995. Its central feature is the phasing out of a set of bilateral quotas called the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA). This system, established in 1974, imposes ceilings on, for example, the number of knitted garments exported from Hong Kong to Germany. These quotas will gradually be eliminated after 1995 and be abandoned in 2005. Textile exporters have complained that most cuts will come at the end of the 10-year period. Tariffs too will be reduced over the period. They will not disappear entirely, however, and countries with high tariff regimes such as the US and Australia will still have higher tax barriers than most of Europe and east Asia. The Textiles Monitoring Body will police the rules. While the changes are the most important for almost 20 years, and are likely to boost developing country exports, the impact on trade balances and employment in developed countries may not be drastic. Some quotas and tariffs have already changed. Since the creation of the single European market Asian exporters have been able to sell more to countries such as Germany and France by taking advantage of unused MFA quotas with countries such as Greece. Within Europe the effect will vary. The UK is in a relatively good position. Many of its manufacturers have learned to live with high imports from Asia, which are usually cheaper and of higher quality than those from east European suppliers to Germany and from North African exporters to France.</p>

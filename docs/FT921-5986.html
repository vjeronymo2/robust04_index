			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Books: A treat for the senses - The breadth of Calvino's work UNDER THE JAGUAR SUN by Italo Calvino Jonathan Cape Pounds 10.95, 86 pages SIX MEMOS FOR THE MILLENNIUM by Italo Calvino Jonathan Cape Pounds 5.99, 124 pages WE MAY have joined the European Monetary Union but we British still have to join the European Literary Union. Reading Calvino, the great Italian writer who died in 1985, makes one realise just how isolated we are. That ceaseless effort to impose a rejuvenating literary discipline upon imaginative writing, comparable to the monetary discipline of the ERM, through a continuous examination of the nature of fiction and its relation to life, is something that has largely passed us by in Britain. Calvino was a tireless experimenter as well as being a master of narrative. His experiments benefited from the work of earlier moderns like Borges and Calvino's compatriot Pirandello, who began in the theatre the radical work of re-drawing the boundaries between life and the representation of life. The most widely read fiction of Calvino's to show a similar concern was called in English If on a Winter's Night a Traveller. Somerset Maugham is supposed to have insisted that a story should always have a beginning, a middle and an end. In this book Calvino took that traditional view apart. He gives the reader a bewildering series of separate beginnings but no middles and no endings. Each narrative breaks off tantalisingly just at the point where our involvement in it has become total. Each aborted story was linked to the last by a further narrative concerning an employee of an Italian publishing house. His sets of proofs of the novels whose beginnings we read are continually getting muddled. That narrative too ended inconclusively. It is diabolically clever, yes; but it causes one to re-think one's reasons for reading fiction. The same kind of structure of disparate narratives inter-reacting within a single frame was the intention in Under the Jaguar Sun, which was left unfinished at the time of Calvino's death and now appears here in its incomplete form translated by William Weaver. Calvino's widow Esther quotes a note on the manuscript by her husband underlining the importance of the frame both in painting and in fiction: 'It allows the picture to exist, isolating it from the rest; but at the same time it recalls - and somehow stands for - everything that remains outside of the picture.' In this case a frame was never fitted. Lacking such a frame we have three different stories, each exemplifying one of the five senses, that would have been complemented by two more stories. The title story about a couple's holiday tour in Mexico is centred on taste and has the reader salivating greedily thanks to the author's evocation of piquant Mexican dishes - but then in typical Calvino fashion the tale twists into a sinister register; the reader, to his horror, realises that what these appetisers are leading to is the eating of human flesh, the persistence in civilised society of vulturism and even of cannibalism, its significance for religion. Calvino's delight in analogies between the senses is given free rein, especially in 'The Name, The Nose', dedicated to the sense of smell, as he rhapsodises about '. . . . the phials, the ampules, the jars with their spire-like or cut-glass stoppers' that weave 'their network of harmonies, assonances, dissonances, counterpoints, modulations, cadenzas . . .' But here again Calvino moves from the arousal of olfactory pleasure to the ominous chill of mortality in the pungent odours of decay. The third tale, 'A King Listens', where the advance of the narrative is restricted to the description of sounds, extraneous noises heard by a monarch isolated from the outside world on his throne, has previously made an impression in London via Luciano Berio's opera Un re in ascolto. This was memorably performed in 1989 at the Royal Opera House. In acknowledging the opera's debt to Calvino, Berio unveiled an example of the way the European Literary Union works in practice. It was a passage from Kafka's Diaries, quoted by Roland Barthes, that inspired Calvino that inspired Berio. Add WH Auden speculating poetically on The Tempest and Shakespeare and you have the complete list of of the work's progenitors. It is a similarly vast casting of the net across several major language barriers in the European complex that distinguishes Calvino's last work, Six Memos for the Next Millennium, translated by Patrick Creagh. These are the texts of what would have been Calvino's Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard in 1985. Only five of the Memos had been written at the time of his death; no doubt he would have revised them further before publication but the substance of them is eloquently present here and they make a fitting coda to his career. They affirm his passionate belief that literature will survive and flourish into the next millennium because of its superior powers of communication over all other media. Calvino expounds some of the unique powers of literature under the headings Lightness, Quickness, Exactitude, Visibility, Multiplicity. Explaining the last of these, Multiplicity, Calvino cites the Milanese novelist Carlo Gadda, in whom a work of fiction became a repository of encyclopedic knowledge; from there Calvino leaps to the Austrian Robert Musil's Man Without Qualities, to Flaubert's Bouvard et Pecuchet, to Perec's Life A User's Manual, a modern work demonstrating multiplicity for which Calvino had the highest regard. Taken together these Memos are a delightfully stimulating holiday from more mundane reading; they represent the literary equivalent of a leisurely cruise down one of the main European waterways with an erudite, enthusiastic guide aboard communicating his passionate enthusiasms as the ship glides by some of the more curious edifices of past and present.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Welfare cuts versus an increase in taxes Your leader of June 1 ('Mr Major's next steps') calls for public debate on where cuts in the welfare state should fall. Yet surely intellectual consistency also demands some discussion as to whether such cuts are preferable to tax increases? To deny this is to cling to the oft-disproved supply-side myth, revived with such enthusiasm in the 1980s, that tax cutting and deregulation tend to promote sustained economic prosperity. Now that has been exploded yet again, honesty requires us to recognise that, since cutting taxes (or more accurately shifting the burden from the rich to the poor) has not generated the promised economic miracle, there is no justification for not reversing the process. The obscenity of expecting the less well-off to pay the price of Thatcherite folly - and thus prospectively join the ranks of the 6m or so already on income support - is regularly illustrated in your own columns. Witness the spectacle (highlighted by Lex, 'In at the deep end', May 27) of the privatised water industry - having been allowed to levy its own tax on captive consumers and being largely absolved of paying taxes itself for years - pouring its super-profits into overseas investments that are both highly speculative and quite irrelevant to the well-being of our domestic economy. Is it not an insult to the moral sense as well as the intelligence of the public to suggest that a nation which can afford such waste cannot also afford the welfare state?

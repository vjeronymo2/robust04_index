			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Firefighters near to deal around 1.5% A SETTLEMENT of the threatened dispute in Britain's fire services is likely today when local-authority employers are expected to agree to honour the firefighters' pay formula in full. 'We are on the verge of a deal', Mr Ken Cameron, Fire Brigades union general secretary, said yesterday. The pay increase that firefighters can expect next month may turn out to be less than the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit for this year, but Mr Cameron insisted that the union's fight was to preserve the formula. An official for local-authority employers said the firefighters' pay rise would amount to between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. The firefighters' 15-year-old pay formula links their earnings to that of the upper quartile of male manual workers, based on the government's annual New Earnings Survey, which was published yesterday. The survey, a snapshot of the change in earnings for the year to April, showed a 2.3 per cent rise for the upper quartile of male manual workers. The average pay increase for all employees was 4 per cent and average gross weekly earnings for full-time employees Pounds 317. Non-manual pay was rising nearly twice as fast as manual pay and women's pay was rising faster than men's. The firefighters' pay formula requires that the April figure should be adjusted to take into account earnings movements in the subsequent seven months to November, as well as an annual survey of firefighters' earnings. An official for the employers said yesterday it was 'good news' that the relevant official earnings figure was so close to the government's 1.5 per cent public-service pay limit. The pay survey also shows that in the year to April 1993, public-sector pay rose at 4.3 per cent compared with 4 per cent in the private sector. Average gross weekly pay in the public sector was Pounds 321, compared with Pounds 315.30 in the private sector. That is partly because there is a higher proportion of managers and professionals in the public sector. Medical practitioners averaging Pounds 736 a week were displaced from the top of the earnings table by treasurers and company financial managers on Pounds 746. The median level of earnings was Pounds 273 a week and the bottom 10 per cent of employees earned less than Pounds 153 a week. The top 10 per cent earned more than Pounds 510.

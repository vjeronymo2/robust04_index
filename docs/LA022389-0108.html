			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Officials in San Joaquin County and the Santa Clara Valley are taking steps to  reduce water use in the face of continuing drought conditions that have lowered  reservoir levels. In San Joaquin County, a local water emergency has been  declared, and officials say rationing may be ordered later if voluntary  conservation fails. In the Santa Clara Valley, water district officials warn  that they may reduce or suspend pumping ground water if water customers do not  cut back their use by 45%. The threat -- immediately criticized as too drastic  -- was issued in an unprecedented drought response plan adopted by the Santa  Clara Valley Water District. "What (the water district) is recommending sounds  as dangerous as the drought," San Jose Vice Mayor Blanca Alvarado said. About a  dozen cities and private water companies in the Santa Clara Valley get part or  all of their water from ground water sold by the Santa Clara Valley Water  District.  </P></p>

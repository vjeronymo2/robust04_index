			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Schneider investigation will look at the role of banks The Frankfurt state prosecutor's office is examining the role of the banks in the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property group last week. Mr Hans-Hermann Eckert, a spokesman for the prosecuting authorities of the state of Hesse, said he could not rule out the possibility that banks would be suspected of 'involvement in fraudulent activity' or 'abetment to fraudulent activity' in the case. The group went bankrupt with debts of DM5bn (Pounds 2bn). Mr Eckert made it clear the role of the banks would be examined in the investigation into the affairs of Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur whose disappearance two weeks ago triggered the crisis at the group which bears his name. Deutsche Bank, the German bank which is the largest creditor to the Schneider group with outstanding loans of DM1.2bn, said it welcomed the state prosecutor's investigations as a means to clear up the Schneider fraud case. It said it was confident the investigations would not yield any basis for prosecution against the bank. The bank has already faced complaints from prosecuting authorities that it withheld information after finding out about Mr Schneider's departure on April 7, four days before the group's problems were made public. This has been vigorously denied. Separately yesterday, tenants of the prestigious Madler-Passage development in the heart of the eastern German city of Leipzig, launched a legal action against Mr Schneider. The tenants, who rented from CIP, Mr Schneider's property agency, said they had unknowingly made their monthly rental payments into an anonymous account since 1992. An estimated DM3m was paid in each year, but none of the payments can be traced, the tenants allege. The claim follows Deutsche Bank's own legal action in which the bank alleged that Mr Schneider had presented it with fraudulent information when making an application for credit to finance the Zeilgalerie shopping development in the Frankfurt city centre. Mr Schneider's whereabouts were still unclear yesterday despite claims by Die Welt newspaper that he was on a small island near Sarasota on the coast of Florida.</p>

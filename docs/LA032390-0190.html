			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EX-FOOTBALL COACH JARDINE DIES  </P> <P> Former Wisconsin football Coach John Jardine, who underwent a heart transplant  last year, died this morning of heart failure.  </P> <P> Jardine, 53, who coached the Badgers from 1970 to 1977, was admitted to  University of Wisconsin Hospital on Wednesday after complaining of shortness of  breath, hospital spokeswoman Lisa Brunette said.  </P> <P> Jardine's doctor determined that he was in heart failure, but said it wasn't a  rejection of his transplanted heart, Brunette said. Jardine had a heart  transplant last June 16 at the hospital after it was determined he suffered  from cardiomyopathy, a weakening of the heart muscle. He had been on a waiting  list for a donor heart since December, 1988.  </P> <P> An autopsy will be performed, the hospital announced.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WELFARE RECIPIENTS LOSERS IN GOVERNOR'S NEW BUDGET;  </P> <P> $47-BILLION FISCAL PLAN UNVEILED  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian today unveiled a $47.75-billion state budget that denies  cost-of-living increases to welfare recipients while boosting spending on  prisons by 12.8% and schools by 8%.  </P> <P> Deukmejian conceded in a written statement that the budget bill "does not  adequately provide for all state government services despite the vigorous  health of California's economy." He put most of the blame on Proposition 98, an  initiative approved by voters two months ago which mandates that all state  revenues in excess of the so-called "Gann limit" cap must go to schools.  </P> <P> The Republican governor said in a speech today that both Proposition 98 and the  10-year-old Gann limit should be reviewed and possibly repealed because of the  unrealistic restraints they have put on budgeting.  </P> <P> "I don't wish to have to make any of these reductions," Deukmejian said of his  health, welfare and other cuts during a breakfast speech to the Sacramento  Comstock Club. "But if the Legislature doesn't support such actions, I fear  that the alternative will be much worse."  </P> <P> Deukmejian said that an alternative would include staff cutbacks at state  mental hospitals, a $200-million cut in local mental health services and  reduced funding for alcohol and drug treatment programs, Alzheimers research  and senior nutrition programs.  </P> <P> The 1,355-page spending plan which the Republican governor formally submitted  to the Democratic-controlled Legislature this morning proposes a total of  $47.753 billion in state spending for the next fiscal year, up 5.9% from the  current level.  </P> <P> The budget act also distributes to state agencies and local governments  throughout California an additional $18.48 billion in federal funds, for a  total spending package of $66.239 billion, an overall 5.1% increase.  </P> <P> On a percentage basis, prisons, which have doubled in inmate population during  Deukmejian's governorship, would get the biggest increase among major state  programs, up by $210 million, to $1.86 billion.  </P> <P> But in total dollars, by far the biggest increase in the spending bill is the  budgeted $1.171 billion hike in the state support budget for schools, to $18.86  billion.  </P> <P> Community colleges would get a 7.2% increase, to $2.42 billion in state aid;  state colleges would increase by 8.4%, to $2.02 billion, and the University of  California by 4.7%, to $2.50 billion.  </P> <P> In addition to the welfare grant freeze -- which cannot be imposed without a  majority vote of the Legislature to waive automatic cost-of-living adjustments  in current law -- Deukmejian also proposed a freeze on funding for in-home  supportive services and cuts in some locally administered programs.  </P> <P> The proposed state transportation budget, including all highway construction  and maintenance and mass transit subsidies, is $3.31 billion, down $101 million  from the current year.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's proposed overall increase in state spending on welfare, Medi-Cal  and other health programs is only $42 million, or 0.4% of the $11.6-billion  state health and welfare budget.  </P> <P> The health and welfare budget also includes $103 million to fight AIDS  (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), an allocation Deukmejian described as  "more than any other state."  </P></p>

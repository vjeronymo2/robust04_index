			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: One-for-one bonus issue from Singapore Airlines SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), the flag carrier, proposed a one-for-one bonus issue at its annual meeting on Saturday, Reuter reports from Singapore. The airline hopes the move will help its shares climb out of the narrow range of SDollars 12 to SDollars 13 each, which they have traded at since the end of the Gulf war in February 1991. SIA's shareholding structure restricts trading: about 100 shareholders control 91.6 per cent of the airline. Local analysts said a bonus issue would make SIA shares more liquid. With more shares available for trading, prices could be expected to rise. With a market capitalisation of SDollars 9.13bn (USDollars 5.6bn), SIA is Singapore's biggest listed company. It is also among the world's most profitable airlines. However, analysts said the move was unlikely to make much difference to the price of foreign held shares. Trading in these is restricted by a ceiling on foreign ownership and the annual meeting made no decision to raise this limit. Foreign shareholders account for 27.1 per cent of SIA's capital. SIA's management had earlier opposed the bonus issue, saying it was not in the best interests of long-term investors. It reversed its stand on Saturday after the annual meeting unanimously passed a resolution proposing the issue.</p>

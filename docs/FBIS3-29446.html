			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]  disclosed on 16 February details of the U.S. demand for access  to the Japanese market for car telephones and cellular  telephones made by U.S. firms. The main points of the demand  are: 1) Japan Ido Tsushin [Mobile Communication] Company (IDO)  should increase the rate of using the U.S. Motorola system to  "the same level" as that for Nihon Telegram and Telephone  Company's (NTT) system by increasing the number of base stations  before the end of 1994; 2) the MPT should guarantee that Ido  carry out its plan, and should transfer Ido's license on running  the Motorola system to a different company which is more willing  to do business in case Ido fails to do so; 3) part of the  frequencies used by the NTT system should be reassigned to the  Motorola system to prevent Ido from further expanding the use of  the NTT system.    The MPT rejects the U.S. demand for increasing the number of  base stations for the Motorola system, saying "Ido will have to  make facility investment beyond its financial capability" to do  that. Regarding the compulsory transfer of a license to a third  party, the MPT insists "it goes beyond the government's  jurisdiction under the current law," and adds "they are demands  that can never be met." The MPT has so far taken the stand that  "we cannot talk about the details of the negotiations in  progress," but has decided to make the details public now that  the United States has ruled Japan violated the 1989 agreement.  These demands were supposed to have been received on 10 January.    The Japan-U.S. agreement concluded in 1989 gave new  frequencies to the Motorola system so that Motorola-system  equipment can be used in the Tokyo or Nagoya area. Ido, which  had new frequencies assigned to it pursuant to the accord,  started providing service by the Motorola system since the fall  of 1991 in addition to the existing service by the NTT system.  But, right now, while the number of the NTT system telephones  number about 310,000 units, that of the Motorola system  telephones is only about 10,000 units. This is the reason for  the U.S. dissatisfaction.</p>

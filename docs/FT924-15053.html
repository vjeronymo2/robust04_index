			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Trafalgar plans strategy changes TRAFALGAR House, the property, con-struction and engineering group, fighting a tender offer by Hongkong Land, yesterday signalled changes in strategy and management in an attempt to stay independent. Hongkong Land, which bought 14.99 per cent of the group last Thursday, has until Friday afternoon to secure another 15 per cent by tender. Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman, in a circular to shareholders said Hongkong Land's offer of 85p a share is 'inadequate and seriously undervalues your company'. The letter says the group has been 'considering for some time management succession plans for senior positions in the company'. This would be in addition to the appointment of extra non-executive directors. The performance of Sir Nigel and Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, has recently been criticised by some of the group's institutional shareholders. Sir Nigel confirmed yesterday that the group is trying to sell its UK hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford, and has signed conditional contracts for the sale of Cunard's two Caribbean resort hotels. Trafalgar said it was also looking to get better value for its fleet of seven ships, which includes the QE2, by merging the business with another shipping operator. The group's document reveals that three of the group's four main divisions produced lower profits or a loss during the 12 months to the end of September. Only the John Brown and Davy engineering companies increased profits. In the 'absence of unforeseen circumstances' the group says it will pay a final dividend of 1.6p compared with a 9.6p final last year. This is higher than some analysts had expected before Hongkong Land's approach. The document reveals that the group's total borrowings at the end of September were significantly lower than the group had previously indicated. According to Sir Nigel, net debt including off-balance sheet borrowings was Pounds 475m. This is equivalent to gearing of 67 per cent based on shareholders' funds of Pounds 704.6m at the beginning of the year. Shareholders' funds, however, are likely to have fallen as a result of write-downs on commercial and residential property. Lex, Page 20</p>

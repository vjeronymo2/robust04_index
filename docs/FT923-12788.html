			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / EC export proposal for dual-use arms BRUSSELS yesterday put forward its long-awaited plan for EC states to tighten controls on militarily useful exports crossing the Community's external frontier, to let them dispense with such checks along internal borders. The European Commission's draft regulation, covering the tricky category of dual-use and nuclear goods which have a military as well as civil application, is designed to remove another pretext for keeping customs officers busy at internal EC borders after January 1, when the single EC market is due to take effect. If approved by EC governments, it would mean, for example, that a UK security export licence granted to a British company would be valid in the rest of the Community. Delays in producing the plan, caused by the Commission's hesitancy in intruding into a quasi-military field of unquestioned national competence, means there is little chance of member states arriving at sufficient mutual trust to do away with all checks between them in the next five months. So, for a transitional period in 1993, EC officials envisage a certain administrative 'paper chase' to check up on dual-use goods circulating in the single market.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: US warns of more raids if Iraq transgresses LAST NIGHT'S air raids against Iraq targeted only missile batteries and associated infrastructure. But, said the White House, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the US stood ready to take 'additional forceful actions' with its allies if Iraq continued to flout 'the will of the international community.' Some officials within the Bush administration had advocated a more violent response, possibly extending to the annihilation of an entire army division. Yesterday's operation was 'a spanking, not a full beating' they said. A US general last night expressed cautious optimism about the results of the raid. General Joseph Hoar, commander in chief of US Central Command, which supervises the Middle East region, said the attack, involving 80 strike aircraft and 30 support planes, had targeted either mobile surface to air missile batteries or stationary air defence facilities in the regions of Telil, Samawah, Najaf and al-Amarah. He said the aircraft had taken off from a number of sites in the Arabian peninsula, as well as from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, but declined to say which other countries, besides the US, UK and France, had participated in the raid. Coalition planes had encountered a small amount of anti-aircraft artillery fire, but no missiles, he said, adding that it would take several hours to analyse film and assess the results of the raid. At the RAF Command Centre in High Wycombe, Air Chief Marshal Sir John Thomson, chief of RAF Strike Command, said the operation appeared to have been 'commendably successful'. It was very similar to many undertaken in the 1991 Gulf campaign although on a relatively limited scale. The attacks had been calculated to create a minimum chance of 'collateral damage' - meaning civilian casualties. Four RAF Tornado GR1 bombers took part in the attack on the al-Amarah base just south of the 32nd parallel. They dropped six 1,000lb laser-guided bombs from medium level on two parts of the site. All the crews returned safely. US administration officials over the last few days have been at pains to portray Iraq's actions as forming a pattern of provocation: attacks on United Nations relief operations; flights in the no-fly zone in southern Iraq; threatening missile movements; unauthorised incursions across the Kuwaiti border; and impermissible restrictions on UN weapons inspectors. The air strikes however, made it clear that there are two types of provocation: those which threaten allied pilots, and those which do not. Mr Fitzwater said yesterday that the raid came in response to Iraq's failure to comply with the 48-hour ultimatum issued on January 6 by the three allies, in conjunction with Russia, demanding the withdrawal of missiles from the southern no-fly zone. Although US officials claimed over the weekend that Iraq had, indeed, removed these anti-aircraft missiles, that ultimatum was subsequently breached. 'The coalition is acting to restore an environment which poses no threat to coalition aircraft,' Mr Fitzwater said. Mr Fitzwater mentioned only in passing Iraq's repeated flouting of Monday's Security Council warning against incursions into Kuwait; indeed, he made it clear that President George Bush's decision to bomb Iraq had been taken on Monday, before the Security Council issued its statement. However, the dispatch of a battalion-strength US task force to Kuwait may provide some more forceful backing to the unarmed UN observer mission manning the Iraq-Kuwait border. General Hoar said, however, that the battalion, from the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Worth, Texas, would not enter the demilitarised zone along the border, but would conduct exercises with Kuwaiti forces in an area northwest of Kuwait City.</p>

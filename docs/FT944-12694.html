			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Bank says Italy may miss debt servicing target The Bank of Italy yesterday warned that continued high interest rates risked pushing the cost of servicing the country's huge debt stock well beyond the figure envisaged in the 1995 budget. The warning, issued in the bank's quarterly economic bulletin, is the most authoritative statement so far suggesting a fundamental element in the budget calculations may be faulted. It comes at a time when the right-wing coalition government and the opposition are struggling to hammer out a parliamentary agreement on the budget. The budget is seeking to find L50,000bn (Pounds 20bn) in fresh revenues and, through spending cuts, to hold down the deficit to L138,000bn  -equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP. The report also confirms the strength of the recovery now taking place in the Italian economy and claims inflationary pressures exist. However, the bank says these should have been checked by the half percentage point rise in the discount rate in mid-August. It is this interest rate rise, interrupting a steady fall since late October 1992, that has undermined the budget calculations. The report points out that short-dated government bonds are now 2.1 percentage points above the 8 per cent ceiling targeted for the year-end, and due to be sustained throughout 1995. Similar considerations apply to medium-term treasury paper. According to the bank, a one percentage point increase in interest rates over the next 12 months implies an extra debt service cost of L6,000bn, rising to an additional L14,000bn in the third year. The budget forecasts debt service payments in 1995 at L176,250bn. In the light of the recent tensions between the Bank of Italy and the government, over the appointment of a new director-general at the bank, the report uses even more cautious language than usual. However, between the lines the bank is telling the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi that the budget may well have to be toughened. 'Only rigorous pursuit of the budget objectives - eventually toughened because of exceeding the ceilings placed on interest payments - can reduce the risks by altering the perceptions of the financial markets,' the report comments. The bank estimates that this year's inflation will be around 4 per cent against the 3.5 per cent target, making the 2.5 per cent objective for 1995 harder to achieve. As domestic demand picks up, pushing GDP growth this year to at least 2 per cent (against the 1.6 per cent expected), inflationary pressures have begun to emerge. As a result, the bank has reaffirmed its determination to keep a tight control of monetary policy.</p>

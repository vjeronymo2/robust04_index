Using their large-caliber artillery, as of 1915 they shelled  the city of Sidon with violent and concentrated fire. The  NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent there reported that the  shelling concentrated on Dalla'ah Street, the area around the  town hall, and the eastern boulevard of the city. This led to  various injuries among the people. A large fire also started as  a result of the shelling near the Ghassan Hammud Hospital. In  addition, al-Qurn al-'Arabi square and the Hayy al-Khabbaz areas  came under violent and concentrated shelling at around 1930. We  have received reports about many dead and injured. Among the  dead are 'Adnan al-Susi and among the injured Ibrahim al-Susi.  There were also some members from the al-Buji and al-Naquzi  families among the injured.

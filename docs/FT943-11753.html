			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Improved volumes spark 53% surge at Du Pont Volume growth drove a 53 per cent jump in earnings at Du Pont, the US chemicals group, in the second quarter, comfortably ahead of market forecasts. The advance was achieved despite lower prices than a year ago. Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said the company expected earnings to continue to outperform 1993 for the rest of the year. The quarterly sales of Dollars 10.2bn were 6 per cent up on a year before, even though prices in most areas of business were 3 per cent or more lower. All of Du Pont's business segments recorded improvements over a year before: The chemicals segment saw net income of Dollars 101m, up 11 per cent on the year, despite a 5 per cent fall in selling prices. A 61 per cent improvement in earnings from the fibres business, to Dollars 177m, was due largely to the acquisition of ICI's nylon business, which pushed up sales by 13 per cent. Without this, sales were up 3 per cent. The polymers business reported a 71 per cent earnings advance, to Dollars 183m, due to the divestment of some businesses over the year. Excluding the effect of these, sales were up 13 per cent year-on-year. After a further Dollars 47m charge to settle claims relating to the fungicide Benlate, earnings in the diversified businesses segment rose 72 per cent to Dollars 208m. Underlying earnings in the petroleum operations rose only marginally, to Dollars 210m. This still marked a better experience than most other big oil groups during the period. Net income for the quarter of Dollars 792m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, compared with Dollars 516m, or 76 cents the year before. First-half net income of Dollars 1.4bn was up from Dollars 1bn.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / PIA orders its first suspension The new watchdog to protect the private investor drew its first blood yesterday when it suspended the investment business of Bayliss &amp; Co, an independent financial adviser. The Personal Investment Authority, which became operational in July, said it made its first intervention after discovering inaccuracies in the company's application to be regulated by it. These related to information in the management accounts. The PIA does not suggest that investors have been wrongly advised. Mr Clive Rosier, who runs Bayliss, said yesterday that he had lodged an appeal against the suspension. Suspensions, which resulted either in a termination of membership or a reinstatement, were common under the previous regulatory arrangements in which Fimbra was the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers and Lautro was the self-regulating organisation for life insurers. Mr Rosier denied that the information he had given the PIA had been materially misleading and said he was confident that he could meet the membership requirements. He also expressed concern that the suspension notice had been issued without giving him more opportunity to deal with the regulator's questions. The company is based in Oxfordshire and has about 400 clients. It deals mainly in individuals' endowments and pensions but also has some small corporate clients. One of the PIA's tasks in bringing about a 'step change' in investor protection was to introduce greater consistency to the different regulatory approaches across the retail financial services sector.</p>

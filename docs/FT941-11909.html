			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Labour council proposes tax cut Birmingham's Labour-controlled city council, the largest metropolitan authority in Britain, yesterday proposed a cut in the council tax for 1994-95 and contrasted its revenue demands with the government's introduction of VAT increases. The cut, of Pounds 17 to Pounds 421 a year in the lowest property valuation bandand of Pounds 50 to Pounds 1264 a year in the highest band, comes despite an unsuccessfulattempt by the council to win extra government funding and before May electionswhere if Labour loses four seats, it loses control. The council's total budget for 1994-95 is provisionally set at Pounds 938.86m, compared with the 1992-93 budget of Pounds 901.47m. In response to criticism that too much has been spent on prestige projects like the International Convention Centre and not enough on education, the council is lifting the education budget by Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 448.3m. Of this total, Pounds 9.6m would be on the capital account - more than double the 1992-93 budget. On the revenue side there would be an increase of Pounds 30.5m.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARLES LLOYD TAKES THE COMEBACK ROAD LESS TRAVELED;  </P> <P> JAZZ: THE RECLUSIVE SAX GREAT HAS EMERGED AGAIN FROM HIS BIG SUR HIDE-OUT WITH  A NEW BAND, A NEW ALBUM AND A RARE LOS ANGELES APPEARANCE TODAY.  </P> <P> At the Montreal Jazz Festival last July, sax player Charles Lloyd strolled into  the lobby of the festival's central hotel, beaming despite the jet lag. Lloyd  was looking forward to the next night's concert and a brief European tour that  would culminate in a recording session.  </P> <P> A year later, the normally shy Lloyd is out in support of the finished product,  "Fish Out of Water," his best-received album in perhaps 20 years.  </P> <P> Today at noon, Lloyd will play a special concert as a kickoff to the Arco  "Concerts in the Sky" series at the Bonaventure hotel in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> According to manager Steve Cloud, this will be Lloyd's first official L.A.  performance in about 15 years. He follows it up with a concert at Santa  Barbara's Lobero Theater on June 29. Joining Lloyd will be his "Swedish Rhythm  Kings" -- drummer Ralph Penland, bassist Tony Dumas and pianists Tad Weed (in  Los Angeles) and Theo Saunders (in Santa Barbara).  </P> <P> The Lloyd story circa 1990 has all the makings of a comeback saga, except that  he never went away, exactly.  </P> <P> "We have to live in the now," an incurably philosophical Lloyd reasoned during  a recent interview in Santa Barbara (he has split his time between homes in  Montecito and Big Sur for several years). "It's important for us to live in  this moment and live fully to do our best today. We can't change a note of the  past, and to worry about the future is some other stuff.  </P> <P> "Here I am at 51 and I feel as young as the springtime. That we must keep alive  in ourselves -- that spirit of eternal youth."  </P> <P> The Memphis-born saxman first spent time in Los Angeles during the late '50s  while attending USC. He went on to play with Chico Hamilton, then began leading  his own groups, including one with pianist Keith Jarrett, drummer Jack  DeJohnette and bassist Cecil McBee. The '60s Lloyd Quartet found itself  crossing over into the lucrative rock market, achieving a level of fame  atypical in jazz.  </P> <P> For several years during the '70s, however, Lloyd retreated from the music  world, delving into Eastern religion and an introspective, reclusive lifestyle,  making only a few albums. Then, in the '80s, French pianist Michel Pettruciani  coaxed Lloyd out from his Big Sur enclave and the two recorded and toured  together.  </P> <P> A couple of years ago, Manfred Eicher, owner of the German jazz and new-music  label ECM, expressed interest in recording Lloyd, and manager Cloud lobbied for  the deal.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I was resistant at first," Lloyd recalled. "I thought that, because  my music is very warm and his concept is Nordic, maybe he wouldn't be able to  capture what is in my music.  </P> <P> "After the first take, this guy was jumping up in the air. When I went in to  hear the first playback, I was bowled over. . . . My deeper soul and essence  came through. Man, it wasn't cold. It was warm."  </P> <P> When Lloyd speaks, he does so with an inimitable style and in tangential  circles, much like a jazz soloist in flight. A complex persona emerges: He is  at once a mystic, a shrewd businessman and a music historian.  </P> <P> "My song is not about straight-on, staccato bullets," he explained. "I'm more a  painter than a machine gun sergeant. I'm about the adoration of the spirit and  the spiritual.  </P> <P> "I've got an intuition that people are hungry for the beauty of the music  again. Although this rock 'n' roll stuff has been promoted heavily, it actually  comes from Robert Johnson and the Delta. It all comes from deep sources --  Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, Johnny Ace, Bobby Blue Bland, B.B.  King. These (modern groups) put a little silk dress on it and spin it around  two or three times and then somebody can merchandise it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORMAN KAPLAN; BEGAN GROUP FOR BLIND YOUTHS  </P> <P> Norman Kaplan, who 36 years ago founded a nonprofit foundation seeking to  integrate blind children into a seeing society, died Wednesday night of heart  failure at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center.  </P> <P> The founder and executive director emeritus of the Foundation for the Junior  Blind was 65 and had retired in 1985 while remaining a spokesman and adviser.  </P> <P> Kaplan had entered the public relations business after Navy service in World  War II and through a client became aware of a lack of recreational facilities  for blind children in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Using a $5,000 grant, he began a nonprofit foundation that in its initial year  of existence served 15 children.  </P> <P> Today that effort involves 400 to 500 children a year in a variety of special  education classes, outdoor trips and the foundation's best-known activity --  Camp Bloomfield -- a summer program for blind individuals of all ages in the  Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu.  </P> <P> As Kaplan's foundation grew to its present 5.5-acre facility near Los Angeles  International Airport, its founder kept pace by attending special education  classes. In 1976 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of  Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Over the years, his foundation -- which today also serves blind adults --  sponsored river-rafting trips to the Colorado River, day journeys to farms  where blind children helped harvest crops and outings to the San Bernardino  Mountains.  </P> <P> "Blind people are normal people," Kaplan once said. "Blindness is a nuisance,  not a handicap."  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Nadia, two daughters, two grandchildren and two  sisters.  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m Sunday at the foundation, 5300 Angeles  Vista Blvd. In lieu of flowers, the family is asking donations to the  foundation.  </P></p>

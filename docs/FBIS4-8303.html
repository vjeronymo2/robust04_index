			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  is considering the postponement of local elections, Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik said at the 4th congress of the  Association of Slovak Towns and Villages (ZMOS) today.    Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic supported the stance,  explaining that the parliament would not probably be capable of  discussing a bill on changes in the organization of local and  state administration. The local elections are scheduled to take  place in the autumn.    President Michal Kovac pointed out that no essential  progress  in the reform of state administration had been made since the  past local elections held in 1990, when the system of national  committees was abolished.    ZMOS Chairman Michal Sykora, delivering a report on the ZMOS  activity, stressed the need to ratify the European Charter of  local administration.    He added the previous government could not ratify it because  of legislation differences. But the parliament has recommended  to the new government to prepare necessary documents for the  ratification of the Charter which has been signed by the three  other Visegrad Four countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and  Poland.</p>

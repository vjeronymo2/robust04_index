			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A man for all reasons - Bethan Hutton on the insurance ombudsman's annual report Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, does not have an easy job. On his desk - and those of his many assistants - land the cases of the most tenacious complainants and the most intransigent insurance companies. More and more arrive every year. The task for Farrand and his staff is to look at the cases objectively and try to work out a common-sense solution which is fair to everyone involved. On average, one-third of cases result in at least partial success for the complainant. This impartial approach means he is plagued by both sides. In his annual report, published this week, Farrand makes a heartfelt plea for people not to be abusive over the telephone or write every week repeating the same arguments. But he also asks insurance companies not to react negatively when facing an investigation. Of the 63,000 calls and letters received by the bureau last year, almost 90 per cent concerned matters outside its scope. It can take on only cases involving companies that belong to the scheme - and then only when the customer has exhausted a company's own complaints procedure. Farrand's jurisdiction covers the whole range of insurance, from a one-week travel policy to long-term life cover. The highest award made last year was Pounds 230,000 and the smallest Pounds 3.88. Occasionally, claimants are seeking merely a moral victory or, perhaps, an apology. Some cases handled by the bureau are disturbing. One involved a joint life insurance policy, taken out by a married couple, where the husband murdered his wife in front of their three children before killing himself. A compromise was reached, under which half the policy's value was paid to the wife's estate. Some are comic, such as a policyholder's claim that the devastation caused by two young puppies with very sharp teeth left alone at home came under the definition of 'animals colliding with the house.' His case was rejected. The bulk of the bureau's time, however, is taken up with much more mundane matters of home income plans, administrative incompetence, policy churning, subsidence claims and so on. Once a case has been given to a worker, the average resolution time is 3 1/2 months. But patience is necessary: the longest-running case - a complicated matter of subsidence - has taken about seven years. Life assurance continues to draw more complaints than any other single category. But 39 per cent of these are resolved in the customer's favour compared with 29 per cent for general insurance cases. The most common complaints about life assurance are poor communication, administrative failure, bad service, and mis-selling. The level of fraud and excessive claims is worrying the insurance industry. Fraud is said to cost honest policyholders Pounds 1m a day, while there is widespread acceptance of the attitude: 'It doesn't matter, I'm insured.' But measures taken to clamp down on this can penalise honest, responsible claimants. Insurers are tending to apply more strictly the 'reasonable care' provisions of many policies. Complaints frequently involve travel insurance, and belongings left on beaches. In one case, where Pounds 4,000-worth of jewellery had been left unattended in a bag for 10 minutes, the ombudsman decided reasonable care had not been taken. But in another, where the policyholder had taken his bag to the beach because his room was not ready, and was robbed after falling asleep, the complaint was upheld. Sometimes, it can be difficult to determine the issue of good faith. The report tells of a man who took out several personal accident insurance policies to the value of Pounds 500,000 - then chopped off a finger and part of his thumb with a meat cleaver while making a chicken curry. Just one of his claims was rejected, for essentially technical reasons, but the others were met. The issue of intent was not raised, however, and Farrand wonders if the man was extremely clever, or merely careless, with his cleaver. Issues arising from a particular case sometimes lead the ombudsman to make general recommendations. This year, Farrand urges life companies who know they are going to cut bonus rates to warn customers asking for a quote before the cuts are announced or implemented. In the past, however, companies' response to general recommendations often has been to tighten the wording of their policies, usually to the detriment of the customer. This is what happened with claims for matching items, such as furniture covers, when part of a set has been damaged. The ombudsman's general view was that half the non-damaged items should be paid for. But many insurers responded by excluding matching items altogether.

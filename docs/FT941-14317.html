			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (42): Number one in the UK directory - BT has regained its position as Britain's biggest company. Bernard Gray outlines the technological forces which are driving the UK giant's growth / Profile of British Telecom the US long-distance telephone company which is allied to BT - announced on January 4 that it has strategic plans to invest Dollars 20bn along with partners in the US telecoms market over the next decade. Developments will include a fibre-optic telecoms super-highway running from New York to Los Angeles to compete with regional US phone companies for domestic users. The scale of the investment required shows just how high the stakes are for global telecommunications companies. Technological turmoil is bringing together computer technology with traditional phone operations. It is creating the possibility of new services such as home shopping, consumers selecting video films to be sent down telephone lines, and the handling of huge volumes of data at very low cost. Yet to keep up with the rapidly developing market phone companies are going to have to invest huge sums and form complex alliances over the next decade. At the same time as creating the possibility of multimedia ventures, technological change is also encouraging real competition in telecoms for the first time. From cellular phones to cable TV, consumers now have a choice of competing telephone networks. So the requirement for high capital expenditure comes at the same time as phone companies are going to have to become more efficient to offset the lower prices which competition is likely to bring. It is going to be a dramatic decade for phone companies. The revolution is most advanced in the US, but is rapidly spreading to other markets, and BT seems determined to be at the forefront of European telecoms companies. After a couple of false starts, including an investment in McCaw cellular, BT's international strategy is now centred on its alliance with MCI, the second largest US long-distance phone carrier. The two companies intend to set up an operation to cater for the complex requirements of large multinational companies. Sophisticated computer programmes developed for these needs may also have spin-offs in more mundane domestic services. For example, customers may be able to have a single telephone number which follows them wherever they go. BT is tackling the US and international markets first because they are the most open to competition. Yet even here the company is restricted in what it can do. US regulations severely limit foreign ownership of telecoms companies. And while services to multinational companies may provide high-margin business, the market is strictly limited. In Europe, telecoms are highly protected and the main voice communications market is unlikely to be opened up before 1998. Even then, if previous deregulation is any guide, progress in implementing open markets may be slow. In its domestic market BT is also hedged about. Since it already has such a large market share it has been prevented from competing directly with the growing cable TV companies which are providing a full range of TV channels as well as telephone services. BT is thus caught in something of a bind. The market is changing rapidly, yet the company can only gain limited access to most interesting areas. At the same time BT, in common with many other telecoms companies, is having to make the transition from a vast state-owned public-service bureaucracy to a flexible and responsive high-technology company. The challenge of transforming an organisation, which by rumour used to have more vehicles than the Red Army, is huge. Not only do work practices have to be changed, but the culture has to be shifted so that the staff are focused on providing services demanded by customers, rather than the structure suiting itself. At the same time the company has to cope with the strains involved in a huge reduction in staff numbers. According the chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, much progress has already been made. Several initiatives have been launched to transform the company. Most significant of which was the Project Sovereign which was visible to the outside world as the change in corporate logo and identity, but which involved adopting total quality management values and encouraging employees to focus on customers needs. Many of those employees who did not like the new ethos or found it difficult to adapt have left over the years in one or other of companies redundancy programmes. Beside, as Sir Iain points out, 'it is now almost exactly 10 years since BT was privatised, so the natural turnover of staff means that many staff have never worked in the public sector. We now have the younger more responsive workforce that this industry needs.' The company is also encouraging new attitudes by ring-fencing growth areas such as cellular communications and international services to try to prevent old-style bureaucracy from strangling innovation. If BT can inculcate a genuinely entrepreneurial and innovative service culture among its staff, and overcome the barriers to competing in Europe and the US, it could be one of the telecom companies to do well in the new world. It is at least well ahead of those continental European PTT's which still luxuriate in state control.</p>

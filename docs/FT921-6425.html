			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Tiny Rowland sets the City a puzzle: What Lonrho's annual report says about its profits fall In the past four months, Lonrho's share price has halved. Part of the drop stems, perhaps unfairly, from the prominence of Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, at a time when tycoons are out of fashion. Part of the shares' weakness, however, can be traced to the poor preliminary results announced in late January. There was more bad news in the company's annual report, published yesterday. It showed that the group's pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 1991  -which fell to Pounds 207m from the Pounds 273m recorded a year before - would have been lower still without the Pounds 33m gained from disposals of property. Without these gains Lonrho's overall pre-tax profits would have fallen to Pounds 174m instead of Pounds 207m. In 1990, pre-tax profits included just Pounds 4m of property disposals. Profits in 1991 were also boosted by Pounds 27m (Pounds 13m) of interest capitalised primarily from its hotel building programme. Lonrho's shares fell against the market trend yesterday, to close at 121p, down 9p. The drop in the share price was also influenced by what the annual report did not say. There seemed, to analysts and shareholders poring over the pages yesterday, to be no clear, easy-to-grasp answers to the questions they have been asking since the preliminary results were published: what caused the fall in pre-tax profits; and why did the group slash its dividend, when there was no pressure on it to do so from the banks? Lonrho is surprised that the questions are asked at all. Is it remarkable, say its directors, that its profits were hit by one of the worst recessions since the 1930s? And why the attention given to its decision to cut the final dividend by 3p to 5p per share? After all, last year Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said companies should not pay dividends that they could not afford. In short, Lonrho cannot understand what all the fuss is about. For its part, the City does not understand Mr Rowland's explanation of the poor 1991 performance. In the annual report he says the fall in precious metals accounted for nearly half the reduction in profits in the second half of the financial year. During the 1991 financial year as a whole, the average price of gold and platinum fell from Dollars 386 per ounce to Dollars 365 and from Dollars 492 per ounce to Dollars 391 respectively. But this was more than offset by the increase in the average price of rhodium, which rose from Dollars 2,857 per ounce to Dollars 4,486. Mining also increased. Output of platinum metals rose from 486,000 oz to 625,000 oz; gold from 693,000 oz to 841,000 oz; and rhodium from 30,000 oz to 38,000 oz. Mr Mike Smith, conglomerate analyst at Fleming Securities, says: 'On the basis of these figures I would have expected Lonrho to have maintained its pre-tax profits if not increased them; something is very strange.' The annual report simply shows mineral extraction and refining profits before interest and taxation fell from Pounds 123m to Pounds 106m. But when pressed, Lonrho points out that it takes nine months for the metal to emerge as sales after it is extracted at Western Platinum's South African mines. The time-lag makes it hard to draw conclusions from the price of the metal over the year, especially since there is a monthly swing in the price of rhodium. Overall, however, the drop in mining profits only explains a quarter of the profits decline. A more significant contribution to lower profits - not highlighted in Mr Rowland's introduction - comes from the group's businesses in the UK. The figures in the annual report reveal the weakness of the UK businesses, which include newspapers, steel manufacturing, hotels, property and car distribution. The UK, which represents 40 per cent of group revenues, was the worst hit geographical segment. Profits before tax and interest fell by Pounds 37m to Pounds 53m. East, Central and West Africa, which together provide 11 per cent of turnover, saw profits rise from Pounds 112m to Pounds 123m. The extent of the 1991 decline can be seen from the fact that 1990 pre-tax profits from VAG, Lonrho's Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution operations in the UK, were Pounds 20m. Yet in 1991 the whole of the UK's pre-tax profits (after subtracting interest) were just Pounds 19m. Lonrho's problems in the UK also help to explain its decision to cut its dividend for the first time since 1981. The company does not make enough UK profits to offset against the advanced corporation tax payable on its dividends. The annual report shows a contingent ACT liability of Pounds 78m. So, though the poor performance of the UK businesses only explains part of the overall drop in profits, it goes some way towards explaining the dividend decision. Not everything in the annual report was greeted with gloom. One big shareholder pointed to the Pounds 6m reduction in working capital as a pointer to tight management controls. But some shareholders were left unhappy by Lonrho's contacts with them last month, which stressed that it is a difficult business to understand. 'That doesn't mean it shouldn't try harder to explain what is going on', said one institutional shareholder. To try to offset the tycoon factor, Mr Rowland, who is 74, has decided to take a leaf out of Hanson's book. Last month Lord Hanson attempted to stamp out speculation about his successor by showing shareholders the depth of the company's management. Lonrho is planning a similar move at its AGM next month. The number of associate directors has been doubled to 20. The message at Lonrho's AGM will be that it too could find a successor to its chief executive from a number of strong internal candidates.

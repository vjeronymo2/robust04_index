			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow, March 31 (TASS) -- Russia's Gazprom gas  giant is forced to gradually reduce gas supplies to Belarus from  April 1, an official of Gazprom's central controlling  directorate told BUSINESS-TASS.    Earlier, Russia cut its gas deliveries to Belarus because of  huge outstanding debts of the republic's consumers to the  Russian state-run gas company. But as a result of  Russian-Belarusian negotiations, gas supplies to the former  Soviet republic were resumed in the full volume, some 54 million  cubic metres a day, from March 15. Since then, Belarusia's debt  to Gazprom has increased by another 100 billion roubles and  reached 500 billion roubles. Attempts by the Belarusian  Government to recover debts from the republican gas consumers  and to repay them to Russian suppliers have been in vain so far.    However, the Gazprom official said, in contrast to Ukraine,  Belarusia has not resorted to syphoning gas intended for Western  consumers from the pipelines crossing the republic's territory.  Therefore, gas consumers in Brest, Lithuania, the Kaliningrad  region and Poland are likely to continue receiving Russian gas  in the full volume.    Ukraine has not yet managed to repay its gas debts to Russia  either. As a result of the latest Russian-Ukrainian  negotiations, gas deliveries to Ukraine were resumed in the full  volume for a month's period, until April 10.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, January 5 -- Estonian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs made an official statement, on Wednesday, regarding  relations of Estonia and NATO in the light of the Lithuanian  application to join the latter, stressing the danger originating  from non-democratic powers in Russia, and the need for closer  ties between Central and East European states, including  Estonia, and NATO.    "Estonia is monitoring very closely the developments in  Russia and the directions of Russian foreign policy," Ministry  of Foreign Affairs' statement says. "The result of the recent  elections should have made it clear to the world community that  the democratic reforms in Russia may not be irreversible."  Therefore, it is equally important for the world community to  "support the reformers as well as to send a clear signal that  the policies espoused by the extremist politicians will not be  accepted," the statement continues.    According to the statement, this must include "tying the  Central and Eastern European countries closer to NATO, inter  alia through the `Partnership for Peace', in conjunction with  their increased ties with the European Union."    "As NATO enlargement should be seen in harmony with European  integration, so should the Baltic and Visegrad states be  included among the group of countries first to be offered the  possibility of NATO membership," Ministry of Foreign Affairs  statement stresses. "This approach must be coupled with an  invitation to Russian democrats to cooperate with expanding  European structures," it adds.    "Separating the Baltic and the Visegrad states, however,  either implicitly or explicitly, could be interpreted by some  countries as a `green light' to restore `spheres of influence',"  the statement concludes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "A Little French-Italian </F> Launcher"]    [Text] France and Italy are proposing a joint project for a  new solid-fueled rocket that can launch small satellites  weighing 1 t into a low orbit for $20 million. The rocket should  fly by mid 1999 if development--estimated at Fr1.8  billion--starts in 1995.    Both CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and ASI  believe  that there will be "a market for small satellites in a low orbit  representing several launches per year for Europe by the end of  the decade." The French and Italian national space agencies, as  a matter of fact, have been putting their heads together for two  years now (although with utmost discretion so far) on a subject  that recently led to sketching a new project for a European  mini-launcher, the ESL (European small launcher). The latter has  just been presented to the "Space Transport" Forum organized at  the end of November by AAAF [Aerospace Association of France].    ESL is a French-Italian project involving both of these  national agencies, although it was developed essentially with  French and German industry, that is, Aerospatiale, SEP [European  Propulsion Company], and DASA [German Aerospace Company]. But  Italian industry will be more directly involved starting with  the next phase that consists of a definition study (Phase A) for  the future mini-launcher--according to joint French-Italian  specifications--to be pursued for six months in 1994. As we were  told by Remy Hergott, technical deputy to the Directorate of  Launchers, CNES, it will be especially Aerospatiale and SEP in  France as well as BPD (Fiat) in Italy that will be involved in  this study.    1 t at 700 km for $20 million    ESL will meet a need that is being felt in Europe and  elsewhere throughout the world for launching small satellites at  lower cost. "The launch price tag is the decisive factor in the  definition of the small launcher," emphasized J-M Astorg, an  engineer with the Directorate of Launchers of CNES, in his  presentation. According to him, the cost of 1 ESL flight has  been set at $20 million (less than 120 million francs [Fr.]), to  send 1 t over a distance of 700 km. That is roughly the price  charged for a comparable performance by Lockheed for its new LLV  mini-rocket that should make its debut at the end of 1995.    The French-Italian promoters believe that the market for a  small European launcher will involve four types of  minisatellites for the following purposes: telecommunications by  constellations in a low orbit (of the type of Iridium,  Globalstar, Odyssey, Ellipso, Aries, Taos, and other Orbcomm),  observation in a polar orbit, scientific research (similar to  what Sweden did with its Viking, Freja, and soon to come, Odin),  and perhaps also military missions (involving telecommunications  or electronic listening, in other words, reconnaissance). ESL  could thus have to launch several telecommunications  minisatellites annually weighing 200 to 700 kg (in 60-90  orbits), at least one 200-500 kg scientific satellite and one or  several observation satellites weighing about 500 kg (in a  synchronous solar orbit at 800 km).    Typically, the range of performances expected of the future  launcher in this mold will range from 100 kg on any orbit up to  600 kg at 1,400 km or 1,000 kg at 700 km. The maximum payload  will have to be dimensioned a little bit beyond those figures at  about 1.4-1.5 t, and the accessible altitude will have to be up  to 500 km, according to CNES.    The French-Italian rocket should have high reliability  (0.99), bearable acceleration (7G), and good precision (4 km on  the major semi-axis and 0.01 inclination) for single or  double payload injection; the volume under the shroud will have  a height of 4.8 m and a diameter varying from 1 to 2.2 m.    The future launcher is thus designed for maximum reliability  and is intended to reduce the production and launch costs.  Taking the deliberately conservative assumption of only two  launches per year at the start of the operation, the market  could have between 5 and 10 launches per year in the end.    121 t mini-rocket    As currently defined, ESL is a three-stage, solid-fueled  rocket (the one used for Ariane 5: 68/18 PBHT [gross weight])  with a liquid-fueled terminal propulsion module. The rocket is  25 m high and has a maximum diameter of 2.6 m (which is  practically constant); it weighs 121 t. Takeoff thrust is about  173 t; in a vacuum, it is on the order of 190 t. That is based  on the launch facilities employed for Ariane 5 at Kourou and  especially the AR5 mobile pad and the ELA-3 firing step.    The first two stages, P50, are identical in terms of size  (2.6 m diameter) with just one nozzle adapted to operate both on  the ground and in a vacuum (diameter 1.7 m). These P50A and B  are each charged with 51.2 t of solid fuel in a composite shroud  to reduce the mass ratio (to 9% instead of 15%  metal). This  carbon-fiber-wound structure will be made according to the  technology used for engines of the M5 ballistic missile and the  nozzle will be made with the technology of the AR5.    The third stage, P7, charged with 7.2 t of powder in a  shroud  likewise made of carbon fibers but with a diameter of 2.3 m,  delivers a thrust of about 23 t (in a vacuum). The rocket, as a  matter of fact, has a fourth stage with the liquid propulsion  module (LM) integrated into the equipment compartment (2.6 m).  This engine will take care of roll pilotage, attitude control,  final trajectory correction, and circling in orbit. It carries  260 kg of hydrazine (N2H4) supplying 6400-N nozzles.    As a possible alternative to P7, German Aerospace also  studied a third stage, L5, with 5 t of liquid fuels (N204/UDMH)  using the 27.5-kN Aestus motor in a version derived from stage  P9.7 of AR5 (Cf., Air &amp; Cosmos/Aviation International, No.  1451). Although its cost is comparable, L5 has little chance of  being picked because it increases the acceleration at the end of  propulsion and thus reduces the payload by 200 kg.    CNES thinks that ESL as defined now could be built for Fr1.8  billion in four-and-one-half years. If development starts in  1995, the new rocket could fly by mid-1999.    ESA, of course, would take over the French-Italian project  to  "Europeanize it," and that is as it should be. But so far, the  Agency has displayed little interest in promoting a small  launcher in Europe. Still, it recently began a study to evaluate  the market and sketch the specifications for a small launcher  that would meet this need. However, in view of the political and  financial context, it seems doubtful that ESA could launch such  a project soon, even if it were recommended by the study that  will be completed in March 1994.    CNES furthermore believes that it must essentially count on  French-Italian cooperation to build and finance the ESL. Remy  Hergott thinks that Italy could finance a significant portion of  the project (one-quarter to one-third) in which BPD (FIAT) would  be mainly associated. Other European manufacturers would supply  parts of the rocket. The shroud would be made in Switzerland  (Contraves); the power module would be German (DASA) and the  jacks would be Belgian (SABCA).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |"ESL" Small Launcher Project                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Element     |Mass                                  |Thrust      |Combined du-|  |            |                                      |            |ration      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Empty       |Fuels       |Total       |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1st and P50A|4,800 kg    |51,200 kg   |56.0 t      |173 t       |100 sec     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2nd and P50B|4,140 kg    |51,200 kg   |55.3 t      |190 t       |100 sec     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3rd and P7  |700 kg      |7,200 kg    |7.9 t       |23 t        |110 sec     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |4th and LM  |582 kg      |260 kg      |0.8 t       |0.2 t       |600 sec     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Shroud      |420 kg      |            |0.4t        |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rocket      |            |            |121.0t      |173 t       |910 sec     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

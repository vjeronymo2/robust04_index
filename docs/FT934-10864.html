			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cincinnati Milacron in German acquisition CINCINNATI Milacron, the US machine toolmaker, is to buy the Ferromatik plastics-moulding equipment business from Klockner Werke of Germany for DM94m (Dollars 56m). The US company hopes the acquisition will bolster its moulding machinery business, while giving it immediate access to the European market, the world's largest for such equipment. The acquisition is expected to add Dollars 100m to 1994 revenues. The growing importance of the business to Milacron's bottom line was underscored yesterday by the announcement of third-quarter results. Stripping out extraordinary items, operating earnings were up 58 per cent at Dollars 8.4m, or 25 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 301m, a 33 per cent gain. The improvement reflected in part one of the best quarters ever for the plastics machinery group, which appeared to be on target for a record-breaking year in new business and sales. The strong performance in plastics equipment offset weakness in the machine tools segment, which posted flat sales, lower earnings and a 'precipitous fall-off' in orders. 'Our machine tools business continued to be hurt by the deep recession in the aerospace industry,' said Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman and chief executive. The results include an Dollars 18.1m charge related to Sano, a supplier of plastic film systems acquired in 1986. The company wants to sell Sano because of problems of integration with core businesses. With the one-time provision included, the company posted a net loss of Dollars 7.9m, or 23 cents, against net earnings of Dollars 7.3m.</p>

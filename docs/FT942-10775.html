			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Mobile communications Vodafone has managed to milk its franchise with great skill since the mid-1980s. But the value of this franchise is dwindling at a pace much faster than the company's current Pounds 5.5bn capitalisation implies. The strong rally in Vodafone shares since the middle of last month has been driven by enthusiasm over its success in winning more than half the mobile phone market and relief that the new Orange service was not more aggressively priced at launch. But these are short-term factors. The medium-term outlook is not so rosy. Orange will become a more formidable rival from the middle of next year when its network is fully developed. Mercury One-2-One, the other new player, is further behind but could accelerate its investment plans. These two operators will flood the market with capacity. Their marginal costs will also be below Vodafone's and Cellnet's. Sharp price cuts and margin squeezes will be unavoidable. Strong growth in demand will counterbalance these effects but not sufficiently to enable large profit increases beyond the next few years. Vodafone will still be able to earn a decent return on its investment for many years to come. But that is little comfort. The company's net asset value is only Pounds 600m on a historic cost basis and, given reductions in telecommunications equipment prices, probably not much more on a replacement cost basis. Vodafone is now valued at over nine times asset value. When the market stops looking at the attractive short-term prospects, the shares could come down with a bump.</p>

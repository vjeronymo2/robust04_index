			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Erratic session in leaderless market IN THE absence of a reliable lead from the US and Japan, the London stock market was left to react to domestic factors yesterday, with a handful of company features providing such highspots as there were. The announcement of a UK visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.55bn in July was certainly a disappointment to the stock market but with currency markets sluggish, share prices rallied from their initial fall. Domestic producer statistics for September were regarded as mildly favourable. London was helped by a firm stock market in Germany, which has been seen as a competitor with the UK for US fund investment. The session started well, with the Footsie 8.5 ahead to a new trading peak within the first half hour of trading as shares extended the gains scored late on Friday. The UK weekend newspapers had drawn attention to the pressure of demand for shares in European markets from the US mutual funds. However, the stock market has already taken this information on board and was inclined yesterday to wait for a return to full trading in New York before drawing any fresh conclusions. The early advance was halted and then reversed when stock index futures ran into sellers. The equity market slipped away and the Footsie 3,000 mark was briefly lost at mid-session as London contemplated the prospect of a Wall Street market trading while the Federal bond market, together with the banks, was closed for Columbus Day. The only saving grace of the London market was the extremely slow pace of equity trading, particularly in the first half of the session. Seaq volume was still under 300m shares in early afternoon. Sentiment picked up later and business also improved as the Footsie 3,000 proved a recovery platform. By the close, the FT-SE Index had rallied to 3,102.2, a net 6.4 points off on the day. The slow pace of the stock market showed itself most in a lacklustre performance from the blue chip stocks. Second line stocks continued to trade more hopefully, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, at 3,482.2, gaining 4.2 points. Seaq volume finally looked almost respectable at 444.3m shares against Friday's 477.4m for a retail worth of Pounds 1.03bn. Non-Footsie business made up around 63 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total. UK equity strategists sounded marginally satisfied with the stock market's ability to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 level on the first day of a week heavily featured by data on the domestic economy. In particular, there are some doubts ahead of the Retail price index (RPI), due tomorrow, which will follow two somewhat disappointing sets of monthly RPI data. The market was led yesterday by utility stocks, still attractive on yield considerations. Bank and property stocks, both seen as sectors likely to benefit quickly from the one further reduction in base rates still expected in this cycle, were also well supported. With the third quarter corporate reporting season now virtually over, it was left to Lucas Industries to please the market with its dividend and trading statement. However, the disclosure that Eurotunnel will have to call for at least another Pounds 500m from its shareholders was no help to investor sentiment.</p>

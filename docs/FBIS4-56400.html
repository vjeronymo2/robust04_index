			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Such is Politics" column by Dora Kramer: "Lula </F> Now Thinks Only About the Government"]    [Text] The PT [Workers' Party] convention, which ended  yesterday with the formalization of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's  candidacy to the presidency, focused on internal problems.  After overcoming the barrier built by the radicals who, in the  opinion of the candidate's staff are the only ones who can make  him lose the election, the campaign has gained the tone of  anticipated victory. Lula believes his adversaries have helped a  lot by engaging in actions that can be easily criticized. He is  now focusing his attention on Planalto Palace. He is currently  working on the basis of winning in the first round.    He will try to show both home and abroad that he is capable  of governing without the rancid leftist taste of the radicals  who have infested the PT. He assures that his government will  have a broad base, not from the viewpoint of ideology but of  ethics, with a commitment to the interests of the majority. To  show this broadness, last Fridya, one of Lula's closest advisers  reminded a group at the Petronio Portela hall in the Senate that  when Itamar Franco took over, Lula defended the continuation of  Adib Jatene at the Health Ministry.    This shows that Lula is not prejudiced against inviting a  former secretary of the Paulo Maluf government to join his team,  provided, of course, he supports the party program. The idea is  difficult to implement, but it reflects maturity. This is the  position Lula will use when he arrives in the United States on 7  May for a five-day visit to New York and Washington. He will  introduce himself as a future Brazilian president, committed to  reactivating Latin America's largest country. It is a major  step that should be matched by his actions.    He has a busy agenda. Since Bill Clinton, Hillary, and Al  Gore have already said they will not meet with candidates, no  meeting has been sought. The White House couple has its own  domestic CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] problems,  which we have already experienced here. Lula will contact the  State Department, the House of Representatives, and will deliver  a briefing at the Senate. He will meet businessmen, grant  interviews to THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES, and  talk with representatives of nongovernmental organizations and  with environmentalists. To the latter, he hopes to convey a  good image because, as Lula's external affairs advisers have  warned, they strongly influence U.S. foreign policy.    Brazilian news abroad has recently been quite negative, with  child prostitution, the killing of minors, a sizable robbery in  congress, etc., and so Lula will say that the country needs a  "social reform shock" and that to this end it must be  politically and economically stable. The national project that  Lula will outline abroad seeks economic stability through  reforms in order to end the social marginalization of the  majority of Brazilians.    In the foreign policy field, Lula will try to debate  Brazil's  role in the world. He believes the country has no consistent  foreign policy, not through any fault of Itamaraty but because  of the lack of a national project. Lula says he considers the  nationalist, development-oriented projects of the 1960's are  exhausted, explaining that he rejects the neoliberal position  under which the country should join the international economy in  a subordinate position. He will explain that Brazil's problems  with the United States are not ideological but economic and  commercial.    Lula may succeed in the country he will visit for the third  time, yet he will have to face competition from Fernando  Henrique Cardoso who, without doubt, is an internationally  recognized figure because of his tenure at the Finance Ministry.  Asked about this, PT Foreign Affairs Adviser Marco Aurelio  Garcia hesitated for some seconds before replying: "Fernando  Henrique is deja vu."    Upon returning from the United States, Lula will return to  his preferred public: the poor. An evaluation of the campaigns  has revealed that the caravans were successful. The polls show  that Lula's popularity grew from 18 to 36 percent thanks to his  tours of Brazil, and so the formula will be repeated. This time  it will be on a minor scale. He will choose places that are  strongly affected by starvation and misery, and will spend two  or three days listening to the have-nots. For example, he will  go to the Fluminense area in Rio de Janeiro and to Ribeira  Valley, in Sao Paulo State.    The program for the World Soccer Cup has already been  designed. Lula and his entourage will sail down the San  Francisco River from Pirapora to Juazeiro, to symbolize national  integration, which will be represented by the velho chico [not  further identified]. This will end last week in July. The PT  will then concentrate on television programs and on large  rallies.</p>

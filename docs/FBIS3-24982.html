			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, prime  minister and head of government, returned to Brazzaville this  morning after a week's stay in Paris. He was there to represent  Congo at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the  Brazzaville Conference.    The Congolese prime minister used this opportunity to hold  discussions with French authorities and businessmen on the  political and economic situation prevailing in Congo. His  interlocutors included French Cooperation Minister Michel  Roussin, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, Socialist Party Secretary  General Michel Rocard, the French defense minister's delegate,  and UNESCO Director General Frederico Mayor. The topics they  discussed included the political situation prevailing in Congo,  cooperation between France and Congo, and the devaluation of the  CFA franc. Was it an easy task? Here are the details from  Prime Minister Yhombi-Opango:    [Begin recording] [Yhombi-Opango] No task is ever easy. What  is lacking in the current situation is communication. There is  lack of communication. Before my departure for France, the  government reported on the situation at a cabinet meeting,  noting that there is lack of communication and lack of  understanding of the government's message. That is why the head  of state's recommendations to the government stated that the  activities of our embassies should be reactivated at the level  of the EEC countries, mainly, with Rome and Brussels. In regard  to the financial and business circles, we shall not rush into  anything. Discussions should be held first. We contacted some  business circles to invite them back to our country for  discussions. Economic issues are not tackled in the same way as  political issues. Economic issues are tackled with documents  and files and we have to present them. I took the liberty to  invite some French financial backers to come here to assess the  various fields that will be identified and to see how to revive  our cooperation.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you agree to continue talks  with the IMF?    [Opango] Of course, yes. Our discussions with the IMF to  reach an agreement are well under way. We are still waiting for  the results of our discussions. I will first meet with the head  of state and then with members of government for a speedy  response that will be conveyed to the IMF. I am convinced that  by the end of the week a memorandum of understanding  representing the concrete beginning of the establishment of our  program will be signed.    [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Prime Minister. What  about the negotiations relating to the Arbitral College and the  consultations between parliamentarians from Pool and Gnari  Provinces?    [Opango] I would like to say that I was very happy to see  that the Arbitral College has handed down its verdict, a verdict  everybody was waiting for and on which many rumors circulated.  I felt particularly moved not only because of the results  themselves but by the attitude of the politicians who went to  Libreville and by the various statements they made. Each of  them made it a point to say that they will abide by the verdict  of the college on the electoral dispute which means that  henceforth, the electoral process in our country has been  completed and it is now up to the government, with the agreement  of the president of the Republic and the friends who assisted us  to solve this crisis, to see in which way things could be  clarified and how to proceed with the organization of  by-elections.    I am saying here that when our politicians face their  responsibility -- as is the case here -- to abide by a verdict,  this shows that there is a certain spirit that is being  established in our country and that can turn things around and  bring hope to the our people.    In regard to the communique signed by parliamentarians from  Gnari and Pool Provinces, it was very important. We even took  the liberty to disclose it officially at the dinner that was  held on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary  of the Brazzaville Conference and all our partners warmly  applauded the news because it meant the beginning of the return  of peace in our country. Believe me, our country has many  friends. Our country is respected abroad so when people talk  about us in terms of weapons, guns, and rifles, it does not  befit our image. We are a country that is still respected in  France. The French are happy to recall that it was in  Brazzaville that many actions were first initiated. [end  recording]</p>

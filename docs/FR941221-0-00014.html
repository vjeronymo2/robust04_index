			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 566&hyph;A, the Commission reevaluated its posting requirements to strike a more appropriate balance between preserving competition between marketing affiliates and non-affiliated shippers and providing for disclosure of marketing affiliate discount information. The Commission retained the previous requirement that a pipeline making a discount offer to a marketing affiliate must make a comparable offer contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliated shippers. The Commission, however, then provided that details of the discount actually provided to the marketing affiliate be posted on the pipeline's EBB within 24 hours of the time gas flows under the discount transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for Rehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The three parties requesting rehearing contend that delaying EBB posting until after gas flows under a discounted transaction tilts too far towards protecting pipeline marketing affiliates while not providing sufficient protection against discrimination to non-affiliated marketer and other competitors. They request that the Commission require posting of marketing affiliate discount offers at the time when an offer of a discount to a marketing affiliate is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indicated Companies and NGC argue that posting after gas flows does not sufficiently protect non-affiliated marketers during the negotiating period, which they characterize as the most critical period. They contend that if a pipeline offers a discount to a marketing affiliate for a sale to a particular customer, a non-affiliated marketers may lose the sale to that customer unless the non-affiliated marketer is contemporaneously informed of the discount offer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGC contends that even assuming that posting of discount offers to marketing affiliates when the offer is made might permit non-affiliated marketers to enter into the bidding process with respect to a potential customer, the non-affiliate would not be stealing a market, but restoring competition. It further argues that immediate posting of discount offers to marketing affiliates is needed to detect unfair collaboration between pipelines and their marketing affiliates in which the affiliates know even before requesting a discount that the pipeline will grant whatever discount is necessary to make the sale. Finally, NGC requests that, if the Commission determines not to require contemporaneous EBB posting, the Commission should, at least, require posting of all offers, whether accepted or not. It suggests that offers rejected by marketing affiliates be posted immediately, offers that lapse be posted when gas would have flowed, and accepted offers be posted when gas flows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

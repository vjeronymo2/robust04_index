			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Bad-cheque affair bounces back at Republicans AFTER WEEKS of accusing their Democratic opponents of bouncing cheques, the Republicans are discovering that accusations, too, can bounce back. The Republican administration has gleefully watched the Democrat-dominated Congress tie itself into knots over the revelation that 355 present and former congressmen wrote bad cheques on their accounts at the House of Representatives' private bank. Some members used the bank, which covered these cheques without charging any fee, to provide what amounted to interest-free loans, and Republicans rubbed their hands as they observed that most of the worst offenders were Democrats. Now, however, it has turned out that the list of those who overdrew their accounts includes not only current Republican congressmen, but also three former legislators who now sit in the Bush cabinet. Mr Dick Cheney yesterday acknowledged writing at least 21 'problem cheques' in 1988 and early 1989, before President George Bush named him defence secretary, while Mr Edward Madigan, agriculture secretary, said 49 of his cheques were held for payment by the House bank while he was a congressman. Ms Lynn Martin, labour secretary, also said she had written 16 cheques with insufficient funds in the 39-month period covered by a House investigation. Although no taxpayers' money is at stake - in fact, the only losers were other congressmen - the House bank scandal has fuelled irritation across the US at the privileges of politicians. Leading Republicans such as Congressman Newt Gingrich had sought to depict the scandal as an indictment of the Democrats who have controlled the House without interruption since 1954 and who have prevented President Bush from passing legislation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai] </F>   [Text] The China-backed TA KUNG PAO, usually known for its  strict adherence to Beijing's official line, has shown a rare  streak of independence in its coverage of the sentencing of the  Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang on spying charges. Observers say TA  KUNG PAO has provided more balanced coverage of Xi's case than  Hong Kong's three other pro-Beijing dailies--WEN WEI PO, the NEW  EVENING NEWS and HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY.    While Hong Kong media began carrying unconfirmed reports of  Xi's sentence last Saturday, none of the pro-Beijing papers  covered the case until after the Beijing People's Intermediate  Court confirmed Xi's 12-year prison sentence on Monday.    TA KUNG PAO's prominently placed coverage on Tuesday  included  responses from Lu Ping, the director of China's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, moderate local political organisations and  even the Hong Kong government. WEN WEI PO, considered to be  more hardline than Hong Kong's other pro-Beijing dailies,  carried just a brief 100-word report quoting Lu Ping downplaying  the case's impact on the local press.    The discrepancy between the two papers' presentation of the  case became more pronounced after more than 100 Hong Kong  journalists petitioned the New China News Agency (XINHUA) to  demonstrate their strong objection to Beijing's closed-door  trial of Xi. TA KUNG PAO's lead story on Wednesday reported  that pro-Beijing Hong Kong figures had expressed concern about  the handling of Xi's case, as well as news about the petition  presented by local journalists. Furthermore, the paper ran a  rare editorial speaking up for the press. The editorial,  entitled "It's Essential for the Public to See Justice", urged  China to disclose information to show the public the verdict was  judicially correct. "China has reiterated that Xi Yang's case  has nothing to do with normal journalistic activities and will  not affect the Hong Kong media in general," the editorial said.  "The local press, however, still shows grave anxiety and  speculation about the case because of the unclear situation."    The editorial, which appeared to break ranks with the rest  of  the Beijing-controlled press, is believed to have been written  by Tsang Tak-shing who has served as chief editor of TA KUNG PAO  since 1986. Tsang, who is also a Hong Kong deputy to the  National People's Congress, told EASTERN EXPRESS he would demand  disclosure of details of the case, saying that "justice should  be seen to be done". But he was quick to add that he would  accept it if Beijing could not disclose those details owing to  considerations of legal procedure.    Analysts noted that Tsang's elder brother, Tsang Yok-shing,  was among the six Hong Kong affairs advisers who paid a formal  visit to XINHUA's Hong Kong office proposing that Beijing  release details of Xi's verdict. Tsang Yok-shing is also  chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong  Kong, a pro-Beijing political body.    WEN WEI PO on Wednesday did not carry any reports on the  case, publishing just two commentaries, under pseudonyms,  criticising leaders of the United Democrats, Martin Lee and  Szeto Wah, of using Xi's case to mislead the public.    Luo Fu, former editor of the NEW EVENING POST, said that  despite the apparent differences in covering Xi's case, none of  the pro- Beijing newspapers would dare to openly question  Beijing's ruling. "There will not and could not be any basic  difference among Beijing- backed newspapers, though their news  coverage may appear to vary on the surface," said Luo. He has  served a 10-year prison sentence in China after being found  guilty of spying offences allegedly committed in a closed trial.</p>

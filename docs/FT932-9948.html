			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Gas groups buy Russian helium TWO BIG rivals in the world industrial gases business, BOC Group of the UK and US-based Air Products &amp; Chemicals, yesterday announced identical agreements to purchase helium from Russia and sell it mainly in western European markets. The deals promise to increase competition in the European market for helium, which because of its cooling properties is critical to several new technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, used in modern body scanners, and fibre optics. No financial details were revealed, but parallel announcements from the two western companies said they could each purchase up to 100m cu ft a year of helium produced near Orenburg, 900 miles south-east of Moscow. BOC said the deal would increase its total helium supply by about 10 per cent. The long-team deals could allow both companies to expand their presence in the 700m cu ft a year European helium market, which is growing at more than 6 per cent annually. Worldwide demand for helium was growing at more than 10 per cent a year in the 1980s, but has now tailed off to about 4 per cent. The Orenburg plant is one of only nine helium sources worldwide. It currently produces only gaseous helium, but is being fitted with helium liquefaction equipment, enabling liquid helium to be delivered to the two western companies by early summer. The liquid helium is easier to transport. BOC and Air Products stressed that, although they have technically signed a single agreement, they will be competing fiercely in European markets. Air Products is the biggest seller of helium in Europe, and in some countries such as France BOC has very little presence. But the UK company said there was 'a fair chance that we will meet head-on in the UK'. The Russian parties to the agreement are SE Orenburggazprom, a division of Gazprom, the Russian state energy company; and Cryor, a Moscow-based private company. The Orenburg plant produces nearly all Russia's helium. As part of the deal, however, the two western companies will also receive deliveries of liquid helium from the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna and from the Kurchatov Institute near Moscow.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein to attend Belfast conference US commerce secretary Ron Brown, followed by Social Democratic and Labour party leader John Hume, leaves the Guildhall in Londonderry yesterday after meeting with Sinn Fein leaders to avert a row over the Belfast International Investment Conference. Sinn Fein, which denied reports that it had threatened to boycott the business conference, confirmed that its party councillors would attend today. With more than 300 delegates, it is the largest such conference to be held in Belfast since the troubles began 25 years ago. Mr Brown said the US would work with the people of Northern Ireland 'to replace the architecture of violence'. Report, Page 18</p>

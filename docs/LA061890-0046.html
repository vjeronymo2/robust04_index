			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: DONALD? THERE WAS NEVER A DOUBT  </P> <P> Who in the world -- in his right mind -- would ever pick Mike Donald to win a  U.S. Open?  </P> <P> His mother? No, she was on hand, looking worried every step of the way.  </P> <P> Las Vegas? Don't be silly. They're too smart for that. This is a guy who has  won only one tournament in 11 years on tour. This isn't one of your megastars.  </P> <P> An Open isn't that easy to win. Arnold Palmer won only one. Jack Nicklaus won  four -- in 34 tries. Sam Snead never won any. And he had more tournament  victories than anyone who ever played the game.  </P> <P> So who would pick a Mike Donald out of this Open crowd?  </P> <P> You're looking at him. Little old me. I picked Mike Donald last Tuesday, two  days before tee-off, when USA Today asked me who I liked to win the Open.  </P> <P> I had him all to myself.  </P> <P> Now, I have missed sports prognostications. I liked Denver in several Super  Bowls. I thought Sonny Liston would beat Muhammad Ali. I liked San Francisco in  the Series last year.  </P> <P> But I'm still alive with Mike Donald.  </P> <P> When that paper asked me for my pick and printed it, one of the people who  thought it was funny was Mike Donald.  </P> <P> Not any more. Mike is alive and well in this U.S. Open. Nobody's won it yet,  but Mike Donald is one of two golfers who can in a playoff for the championship  today.  </P> <P> At 2:55 p.m. Chicago time Sunday, Hale Irwin won this U.S. Open for the third  time. Or thought he had.  </P> <P> There were still 26 players on the course at the time. But they still had  Medinah's Hall of Horrors -- Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18 -- left to play.  </P> <P> Irwin knew these sociopaths were laden with bogeys and heartaches. He had made  a 45-foot putt on No. 18 to go eight under par and, even though there was a  fellow out there who was nine under, Hale wasn't worried.  </P> <P> Hale wasn't worried because the fellow was Mike Donald, and Hale was,  doubtless, one of the ones who who wouldn't pick Mike Donald. In fact, Hale  obviously threw out Nick Faldo, Curtis Strange, all the Simpsons and Joneses  and anyone else out there with a three-iron in his hand. When he sank his  sea-going monster putt on 18, Hale took off on a victory gallop that took him  around and around the green, high-fiving the officials, blowing kisses to the  crowd and acting like a man who had won a lottery -- or his third U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Hale liked the idea of being able to sit there in the clubhouse and watch the  field crash and burn out there. Hale knew the wind was up, the greens were  drying out, and, if Hale was worrying about anybody on the golf course, it sure  wouldn't be Mike Donald.  </P> <P> Hale could see what the course was doing to his playing partner, the great Greg  Norman. He knew what Medinah was capable of -- chopping down your swing,  scaring you with lightning-fast greens, inviting you to yawning traps with  downhill slopes in front of them.  </P> <P> Hale buzzed happily down to the media center and scampered a few more victory  laps down there. All he had to do was wait two hours and get his victory speech  ready.  </P> <P> He was almost right. The Faldos, Stranges, Jack Nicklauses and Seve  Ballesteroses fired and fell back. The course had them in its withering  crossfire. They were being cut down on the barbed wire.  </P> <P> But here came Mike Donald. He was dodging bullet after bullet. The guy who was  70 lifetime tournaments behind Nicklaus, 16 behind Hale Irwin and about $4  million in lifetime earnings behind Curtis Strange was not wilting.  </P> <P> Finally, he cracked. The par-four 16th, a boomerang-shaped torture chamber that  has more trees on it than some rain forests, mugged him. He had a three-iron to  the pin for his second shot to a green that looked like something that fell off  a letter. A three-iron is harder to hit than a house fly in a hot, dark room,  and Mike Donald dumped it in a sand trap. You knew he was looking at his first  bogey of the round. But maybe not his last.  </P> <P> No. 17 is not a golf hole. It's a public enemy.  </P> <P> But Mike Donald did not give in. He remembers turning to his brother, Pete, who  was caddying for him. "I could feel my heart really pounding," he recalled. "I  got goose bumps. I thought, 'This is the Open!' But I told my brother, 'This is  what I've practiced for 20 years for. This is why I've hit all those balls,  stroked all those putts.' I said to myself, 'Now, don't get wishy-washy. Just  play the way you've been playing for 70 holes for two more.' "  </P> <P> He did. He parred in to the clubhouse. He didn't do any dancing on the green,  he didn't circle the traps (although he had given some thought to somersaulting  on the apron if he sank his birdie putt). He simply stood there where nobody  (well, almost nobody) thought he would. Tied for the, by God, lead in the  United States Open.  </P> <P> And today? Well, he's spotting Hale Irwin two U.S. Opens and a lot of  experience. But Hale Irwin is spotting him 11 years. Irwin would be the oldest  winner in Open history. Mike Donald would only be one of the least expected.  </P> <P> If he wins, I'll try not to say I told you so. Nobody likes know-it-alls. But I  had him in the pool, too.  </P></p>

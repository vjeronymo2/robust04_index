			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPROMISE SET ON HISTORIC HOMES  </P> <P> After a five-year battle over saving historic homes in Redondo Beach, the City  Council has decided on a compromise approach that would raise barriers to quick  demolition but ultimately allow owners to tear down and replace such buildings.  </P> <P> City officials have decided to create an eight-member Preservation Commission,  effective Sept. 1. Under the measure, owners of buildings deemed to have  unusual historic and architectural significance will be temporarily forestalled  from demolishing, relocating or substantially altering their exteriors without  the commission's approval.  </P> <P> However, the protection covers only single-family homes that have been  designated as landmarks or are in a historic district. It expires after a  maximum of 225 days.  </P> <P> The Council included in its measure other limitations, including a provision  saying that only the owner of a building can nominate it as a landmark.  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Businessmen urged to bid for sell-offs THE CABINET Office is inviting senior business executives to a conference in London next month to encourage them to bid for the Pounds 1.5bn of central government services to be put out to tender before the end of September. Under the market-testing programme launched last month, more than 44,000 civil servants will have to compete for their jobs against bids from the private sector. The government expects to make savings of 25 per cent of the value of the services put out to tender, even when the contract is won by the existing staff. The conference is being held because of fears that business has yet to recognise the opportunities offered by the 60-fold increase in activities to be put out to tender. The government wants several bids for each activity, and hopes that a range of businesses will be involved. Ministers are also keen to highlight the extension of market-testing into activities previously regarded as core Whitehall functions, such as managing government computers holding criminal records. Other services to be contracted out include finance, accounting, auditing, payroll, recruitment, legal services, debt collection, typing and secretarial services, estate and building management. A similar event in Birmingham last month staged by the Ministry of Defence attracted more than 600 companies. The London conference, on January 18, is being organised along similar lines, with members of the Cabinet Office efficiency unit explaining the procedures for putting in bids. Detailed information will be provided for the first time about the activities to be market-tested. Representatives from each department will be available to discuss their department's plans and offer guidance on who to approach if bidding for a particular activity. More than 20,000 businesses have been invited.</p>

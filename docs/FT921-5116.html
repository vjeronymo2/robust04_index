			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BICC's cable from the contractors FT-SE Index: 2,558.4 (-7.0) The Channel tunnel is more than just a hole in the ground, judging by BICC's confirmation that the TML consortium lost Pounds 115m in 1991. The figure itself will have come as little surprise to the market, which is working on the not unreasonable assumption that the bitter claims dispute with Eurotunnel will end in the warring parties splitting the difference. What was more alarming yesterday was BICC's gloomy perception that there is still no solution in sight. BICC shareholders, though, may wish to focus their attention on their company's rather less publicised property black hole. It may well be that the Pounds 30m provision for projects completed, or close to completion, turns out to be a conservative one, but the housing land bank and long-term Spitalfields scheme remain genuine worries for the longer term. BICC is not the first to have made a hash of property, but it is a sobering thought that net cash of Pounds 150m was invested in land and property development between 1987 and 1990. Without it there would now be a lot more room for manoeuvre in the balance sheet, which is roughly 80 per cent geared if the convertible is treated as debt and off balance sheet loans with recourse to BICC are taken into account. The immediate outlook is hardly exciting, given that the European cables business clearly weakened in last year's second half. BICC ought to be able to make Pounds 130m pre exceptionals in 1992, but it will be some time before the dividend is increased. At 323p the shares need their 8 per cent yield.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 24 June, the Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan [Keidanren] (chairman Shoichiro Toyoda)  decided to urge the government to include the complete abolition  of 70 economic regulations, which was suggested in an interim  report worked out by the Economic Reform Study Council (the  Hiraiwa Council), in the five-year program for promoting  deregulation (action program) to be formulated by the end of  this fiscal year.    The 70 regulations are: 19 regulations on participation in  business operations, such as liquor production and sales; nine  regulations on facilities requirements, including the Large  Retail Store Law; 23 trade regulations, such as the state trade  items; and 19 price regulations, such as government purchase  prices for rice and wheat. Keidanren also demands the five-year  plan include a schedule for reducing regulations by half in five  years, at the longest, and completely abolishing them after 10  years.</p>

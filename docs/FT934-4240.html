			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Asda Asda's decision to sweep its troubled Allied business under the carpet by handing it over to a rival operator is doubtless the right thing to do from the management's perspective. Allied was a peripheral loss-making business which had been consuming a disproportionate share of cash and management time. Since the late 1980s, Asda has poured more than Pounds 100m into Allied to little apparent effect. The company has incurred operating losses of Pounds 17.7m over the past two years and is unlikely to produce a glowing contribution to Asda's interim results, to be released later this month. Nevertheless, the disposal will come as a severe blow to Asda's finances, requiring a Pounds 123.3m charge against its profit and loss account under the FRS3 regime. The acquisition of a 40 per cent equity stake in the enlarged Carpetland may offer little by way of compensation if the new owners find Allied's problems equally intractable. Still, it is worth recalling that the risky venture capital Asda retained in MFI eventually produced considerable rewards. Asda will certainly benefit from being able to devote more management time to its grocery chain. The challenge on that front is growing stiffer by the day. Asda was able to steal a march on competitors two years ago when it became the first superstore to emphasise consistently low prices. Its rivals are belatedly responding.</p>

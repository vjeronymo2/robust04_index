			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk board publishes co-operative proposals THE LONG drawn out process of reforming the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales moved up a gear yesterday with the publication of its proposals to turn itself into a single voluntary co-operative. The Bill to end the board's 60-year-old statutory monopoly on milk supplies is likely to come before Parliament in the autumn and be given Royal Assent in June next year. The final revocation of the scheme under which dairy farmers are required to sell their milk to the board would then follow some time in 1994, along with the flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a 25 per cent share of the British market for manufactured dairy products. Today the published proposals will drop through the letter boxes of nearly 30,000 English and Welsh dairy farmers. They will be able to choose whether to sell their milk through the new co-operative, or to go it alone. The MMB's assets - excluding shares in Dairy Crest - will be passed to the new co-operative. Dairy Crest will be floated as a separate company and shares distributed to dairy farmers on the basis of milk production over a qualifying period. Mr Andrew Dare, the board's newly-appointed chief executive, said yesterday: 'There is going to be a free market in milk. Any farmer can supply any buyer. It's a million miles from a monopoly'. Mr Bob Steven, the MMB chairman, said the board was convinced that a co-operative with pooled prices was the best way forward for the industry. It would pay market related prices, give security and regular payments to its members, and 'provide a fair balance against the ever-increasing concentration of processors and retailers'. The Agriculture Ministry said yesterday it would comment on the published proposals as soon as possible, and pointed out that the European Commission had put up no objections so far.</p>

Wali 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Ghazali, a 36-year-old Iraqi, denied  working for the Iraqi intelligence service, reversing his stand  when the trial opened on June 5.    At the request of lawyers for the two main  defendants--al-Ghazali and another Iraqi, Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir  al-'Assadi--the court adjourned the trial until April 2.    "I did myself wrong by my confessions," said al-Ghazali,  denying that the Iraqi intelligence service employed him to  assassinate Bush in a suicide mission in Kuwait in April 1993,  using a car bomb or explosives strapped to his body.    Earlier al-Ghazali and al-'Assadi, 33, regarded as the  ringleader of the group, said the Iraqi authorities had "forced"  them to carry out the mission.    Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives  into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot  to assassinate Bush.    Iraqi Ahmad Jabbar Habib, 21, repeated his denial Saturday.    The other defendants also denied any involvement in the plot  or links with Iraq. [passage omitted on Gulf War]</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: UNTOUCHABLE BY MULK RAJ ANAND (PENGUIN: $6.95)  </P> <P> As a sweeper whose hereditary labor requires him to come in contact with dung,  Bakha, the central character of Mulk Anand's novel, ranks among the lowest  members of the lowest caste. Bright, strong and disciplined, he dreams of a  better life while enduring the endless insults of his higher-caste neighbors.  </P> <P> Anand devotes nearly three-quarters of the book to Bakha's mistreatment (which  becomes both repetitive and boring), then tries to shoehorn the bulk of the  plot into the last few pages. After listening to a lecture by an ineffectual  Salvation Army missionary and a speech by Mahatma Gandhi, Bakha decides that  modern plumbing can remove the stigma of defilement and solve Indian's caste  problem, a revelation that ends the book on a weak note. "Untouchable" is most  interesting for its portrait of life under an ancient and virulent system of  prejudice.  </P></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Suez-UAP talks over joint interests on hold NEGOTIATIONS between Suez, the French holding company, and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurer, over their joint insurance interests are still on hold despite the former's bid to raise its stake in Victoire, the French insurer in which they have a joint holding. Suez on Monday unveiled details of an offer to buy the 2 per cent of Victoire's shares that it does not already own in concert with UAP. Suez, which controls Victoire with a 63 per cent stake and holds 98 per cent of the voting rights in concert with UAP, is offering FFr1,480 for each of the remaining 360,000 shares. However, Suez said that the offer did not affect its policy on UAP's plans to take control of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire. UAP has been trying to persuade Suez to cede control of Colonia, but Suez late last year broke off negotiations after a disagreement over price. Nevertheless, analysts said yesterday that the deal could foreshadow the resumption of negotiations between the two groups over the UAP stake in Victoire. Mr Michael Huttner, European insurance analyst with BZW Securities in London, said Suez's acquisition of the Victoire minorities could lead to a closer integration of the holding company with its insurance subsidiary. 'We are regarding this as a prelude to a wider deal. It is the first step in the real drama which will eventually lead to UAP getting hold of Colonia,' said Mr Huttner.</p>

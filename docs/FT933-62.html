			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Demand at auction is maintaining its September improvement and clearances are good, with generally under 10pc passed in. Prices have been firm or slightly dearer and the market indicator in Australia on September 29 was 433c/kg, unchanged from a week earlier. Problems in getting the Budget through have helped to cause weakness in the Australian dollar in recent weeks, and this enhances wool's cheapness in international terms. Strength in the wool market is not matched in tops and yarns where pricing is intensely competitive.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING PAPER;  </P> <P> BUSH'S LATIN TOUR: TALKS ON AID, DEBT AND UNITY;  </P> <P> THE NEWS:  </P> <P> President Bush will be emphasizing his interest in Western Hemisphere unity  with a five-day South American tour scheduled to begin Monday and to include  stops in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela.  </P> <P> The trip will take place in an international context that has evolved markedly  in the last few years. Overriding U.S. concerns in Latin America are no longer  fear of Marxist revolution or uneasiness with harsh military rule. Democracy  has become predominant in the region, and Washington now faces little  competition for influence from Moscow or Havana. At the same time, South  American governments are less worried these days about warding off "Yankee  imperialism" than about increasing exports to the United States and attracting  American investment.  </P> <P> Bush and his South American colleagues will discuss a wide range of world  issues such as the Persian Gulf crisis, the decline of communism, and difficult  world trade negotiations that will be going on in Geneva the same week. But  inter-American issues, such as Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative  and the problem of Latin American debt, will get the most attention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regional Issues:  </P> <P> Bush's Enterprise for the Americas proposal last June to create a hemispheric  free-trade zone, ease Latin America's debt burden and promote U.S. investment  in the region has the grandiose goal of uniting the hemisphere's countries in a  vast "economic partnership" for development and prosperity. Chile and the  United States have reached an initial "framework agreement" aimed at bilateral  free trade, and discussions have begun on a similar deal to promote free trade  between the United States and a regional common market planned by Brazil,  Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  </P> <P> Those four countries have set Jan. 1, 1994, as the deadline for eliminating all  tariff and trade barriers among them. If successful, they will create the first  fully functional common market in Latin American history. But some U.S.  officials worry that deeply ingrained protectionism in Argentina and Brazil, as  well as chronic economic instability and inflation, may retard efforts for free  trade.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the South American presidents will want more details from Bush on  what his Administration is prepared to contribute, as well as an indication of  how intensely and rapidly Washington intends to pursue the initiative's goals.  </P> <P>  Outlook: Reinforcement of U.S. commitment to development in South America, new  stimulus for restructuring South American economies, and more hemispheric trade  cooperation.  </P> <P>  The countries Bush will visit owe a total of more than $230 billion to foreign  creditors. Brazil and Argentina will be seeking Bush's support in their  negotiations with banks for easier repayment terms, arguing that easier terms  are in everyone's interest because they allow the economic development that  eventually will regenerate capacity for repayment.  </P> <P> Bush may be sympathetic with the South Americans, but he cannot forget the  interests of stockholders in American banks that are losing money on delinquent  foreign loans.  </P> <P> The Enterprise for the Americas plan includes relief on much of the $12 billion  owed by Latin American countries to the U.S. government, but the amounts are  relatively small for the countries Bush will be visiting. And while Bush can  urge debtor countries and private banks to seek mutually beneficial  accommodations, experience shows that there are no easy solutions.  </P> <P>  Outlook: Little direct impact on foreign debt problems, but perhaps better  understanding on both sides.  </P> <P>  In addition to the regional issues, there will be bilateral questions on the  agenda in each country:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brazil  </P> <P> Bush will spend Monday in Brazil, the most populous (150 million people) and  economically powerful country in Latin America, albeit one currently in a  recession.  </P> <P> Because boosting exports to the United States is an important part of Brazilian  growth strategy, President Fernando Collor de Mello may complain to Bush about  what Brazil considers protectionist American regulations and bureaucratic  procedures that restrict the entry of many agricultural and manufactured  products from Brazil. Bush, in turn, could urge Collor to move ahead with his  plans for reducing import taxes and other barriers against imports. Generally,  however, trade relations between the two countries are greatly improved since  Collor took office in March.  </P> <P> Collor also may ask Bush to help persuade suspicious members of the U.S.  Congress that there is no risk in permitting Brazil to buy the high technology  needed for development. Washington has been cautious about authorizing the sale  to Brazil of technology that could be used in missiles or nuclear bombs, even  though Collor has vowed that his government will not build the bomb.  </P> <P> Bush probably will mention the importance given by the United States to the  protection of "intellectual property" such as pharmaceutical patents and  software copyrights. Violations by Brazil have been a problem in the past, but  Collor's policy favors patent protection. He may ask for patience on  pharmaceuticals, however, because it will take time to wean the Brazilian  industry from pirated formulas.  </P> <P>  Outlook: Improvement in already excellent U.S.-Brazil relations, with progress  toward resolving some bilateral differences, and increased U.S. recognition of  Brazil's international importance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uruguay  </P> <P> Bush will give a strong symbolic boost to democracy in Uruguay, a nation of 3  million people. Luis Alberto Lacalle, who took office in March, is the second  elected president to govern Uruguay since the armed forces gave up power in  1984.  </P> <P> Few Latin American countries have more to gain than Uruguay from the free-trade  policies pushed by Bush. The Uruguayan economy is heavily dependent on its  larger neighbors, Brazil and Argentina, and the main markets for its  agricultural exports are the United States and Europe. The same day Bush  announced his Enterprise for the Americas plan, Lacalle telephoned him to  express full support.  </P> <P> Lacalle may voice some concern to Bush over U.S. subsidies for farm products  that compete with Uruguayan exports, but greater attention is likely to be  given to their common position in favor of lowering agricultural subsidies  worldwide under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The European  Community has been resisting drastic cuts in its subsidies in the current stage  of GATT negotiations, called the Uruguay Round, which began in 1986 at the  Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este.  </P> <P>  Outlook: Full cooperation and strengthened relations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Argentina  </P> <P> Bush will be in Argentina, population 32 million, on Dec. 5. U.S.-Argentine  relations are said by Argentine diplomats to be the warmest since before World  War II, as indicated by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision to send two  warships to the Persian Gulf in a display of solid alignment with U.S. policy  there.  </P> <P> Menem will avoid confrontation with Bush, but there are points of friction. For  example, the Argentines object to U.S. duties, quotas and other restrictions on  such Argentine exports as meat, steel, textiles and leather clothing. As a  major grain exporter, Argentina also quietly complains of unfair competition  from subsidized American grain exports. Menem may tactfully suggest to Bush  that the United States should practice the free-trade ideas that it preaches,  while reiterating his administration's commitment to lowering Argentine import  taxes.  </P> <P>  Outlook: A historical high point in U.S.-Argentine relations, and progress on  bilateral trade problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chile  </P> <P> Bush's visit to Chile on Dec. 6 will symbolize a welcoming U.S. embrace for  that country of 13 million following its return to the hemisphere's family of  democratic countries. President Patricio Aylwin, who took office when dictator  Augusto Pinochet stepped down in March, is eager to resolve U.S.-Chilean  conflicts left over from the Pinochet era.  </P> <P> Chile wants the United States to end a ban on the sale of military equipment  and parts to the Chilean armed forces. The ban was imposed by Congress in 1976  after a car bomb in Washington killed former Chilean Ambassador Orlando  Letelier and his American assistant, Ronni Moffitt. The United States wants  extradition of Chilean officers charged in the case or progress toward bringing  them to justice in Chile.  </P> <P> Aylwin will argue that his administration's efforts to resolve the matter  justify lifting the military sales ban.  </P> <P> Aylwin also wants the United States to give Chilean products the same exemption  from some import duties that it gives other Latin American countries under the  international General System of Preferences. The latest reason given by the  United States for excluding Chile was infringement on American pharmaceutical  patents by Chilean laboratories. Chilean officials hope Bush can be persuaded  that a recently enacted Chilean law protecting patents satisfies conditions for  granting the exemptions.  </P> <P> Chile also is concerned about U.S. tariff sanctions against such Chilean  exports as flowers, tomatoes and textiles that U.S. producers claim are  subsidized and therefore compete unfairly.  </P> <P> The Aylwin administration hopes that by helping to resolve those and other  problems, Bush will demonstrate concrete support for democratic government in  Chile, bolstering it against criticism by the right-wing opposition and army  officers who were happier with Pinochet as president.  </P> <P>  Outlook: Progress may fall short of Chilean government expectations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Venezuela  </P> <P> On his way back to Washington, Bush will spend the night of Dec. 7 in  Venezuela, where he will meet with President Carlos Andres Perez.  </P> <P> During an earlier term in the 1970s, Perez often criticized U.S. policy in  Latin America, siding with Cuban President Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's  Sandinista revolutionaries. But now he seeks harmonious relations with  Washington.  </P> <P> Whereas the old President Perez nationalized U.S. investments in Venezuela, a  country of 18 million, now he is offering guarantees and favorable conditions  to attract new foreign capital. Once he fostered government subsidies and state  enterprise; now he is a free-marketeer.  </P> <P> The new Perez administration, which took office in February, 1989, is preparing  to sign an agreement with the United States for the protection of patent  rights, and will renew a 1980 agreement on science and technology that was  suspended because of disagreements between the two countries.  </P> <P> American officials were hoping Venezuela, the hemisphere's biggest oil  exporter, would be ready to reach a framework free-trade agreement by the time  Bush arrived. It's not, though apparently not because of any disagreement.  </P> <P>  Outlook: More cooperation and trade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> The President Goes South  </P> <P> President Bush will visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela  during a five-day tour scheduled to begin on Monday.  </P> <P> Bush's itinerary:  </P> <P> 1. Dec. 2  </P> <P> Depart Washington D.C.  </P> <P> 2. Dec. 3  </P> <P> Arrive Brasilia, Brazil.  </P> <P> 3. Dec. 4  </P> <P> Depart Brasilia, arrive in Montevideo, Uruguay.  </P> <P> Depart Montevideo, arrive in Punta del Este, Uruguay.  </P> <P> 4. Dec. 5  </P> <P> Depart Punta del Este, arrive in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  </P> <P> 5. Dec. 6  </P> <P> Depart Buenos Aires, arrive in Santiago, Chile.  </P> <P> 6. Dec. 7  </P> <P> Depart Santiago, arrive in Caracas, Venezuela.  </P> <P> 7. Dec. 8  </P> <P> Depart Caracas, arrive in Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Lautro acts over pensions campaign LAUTRO, the chief self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, is taking measures against the Life Association of Scotland, the Edinburgh-based life company, that might lead to disciplinary action, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. LAS, which sells personal pensions, was told by Lautro to withdraw its 'pensions time bomb' advertising campaign last month. The campaign alluded to the Maxwell pensions scandal, which occurred in an occupational scheme and had no relevance to the field of personal pensions. LAS was not available for comment yesterday.</p>

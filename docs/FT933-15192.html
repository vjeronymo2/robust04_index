			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt threatens 1,800 DAX level LONDON-based strategists at NatWest Securities, Morgan Stanley and Nomura said nice things yesterday about Germany, or cyclicals, or both, although Mr James Cornish of NatWest kept a rein on his enthusiasm as he talked about 'puffs of steam from the German locomotive'. Frankfurt responded, extending Wednesday's advance, and one or two other continental bourses were inspired by this to a greater or lesser degree, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT blasted its way to a second consecutive 1993 high, basically because of a change of asset allocation policies among Anglo-Saxon investors, said Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The DAX index rose 63.94, or 3.7 per cent on the day to 1,783.70, up 2.5 per cent from the bullish post-bourse close on Wednesday. The afternoon was exciting yesterday, too, as the Ibis-based, post-bourse DAX inched closer and closer to the 1,800 mark, closing at 1,798.69. Turnover rose from DM8.3bn to DM15.5bn. Cyclicals were strong with BMW picking up DM37.00 or 7.1 per cent on the session to DM558.00 on strong US sales and Metallgesellschaft, the metals, engineering and trading conglomerate, rising DM24.60, or 7 per cent to DM374.00. Mannesmann put on DM18 to DM293.50 and then another DM7.50 in the post-bourse for an overall gain of 9.3 per cent, having reported a sizeable new gas pipe order from Malaysia. Mr Wiecking said that the market's June rise from 1,600 to 1,700 was produced on light volume and poor quality of leadership, but that the gains of the past two days had been on big volume and that Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Allianz had all shown a good performance. PARIS was inspired by the news coming out of Germany and, after a quiet morning session, began to move swiftly forward in late trading. The CAC-40 index closed 36.64 higher at 1,980.37, after a high of 1,989 and a low of 1,939. Turnover was a brisk FFr4.1bn. Companies with exposure to Germany did well: Peugeot gained FFr7 to FFr601, Michelin put on FFr7.90 to FFr163 and St Gobain advanced FFr21 to FFr528. Euro Disney fell more than 12 per cent after announcing, at the start of the day a larger than expected third quarter deficit, and forecasting a loss in the fourth quarter. The shares finished at a new year's low, down FFr8.70 at FFr59.50: the shares have fallen by nearly 40 per cent since March 30. Remy Cointreau was FFr5.50 up at FFr180.50 on satisfactory results, and forecasts of profits growth in the following year. ZURICH was inspired by Frankfurt, but it did not have that market's strength in cyclicals; and Swiss banks, unlike their German counterparts, had already had some heady rises to digest this week. So the move to cyclicals and industrials left the SMI index a relatively modest, 24.9 higher at 2,397.9. In banks, UBS, the focus of speculation earlier this week, rose a mere SFr2 to SFr1,172. Better gains came in industrials where Brown Boveri rose SFr13 to SFr820, Ciba Geigy certificates by SFr13 to SFr660, and in Nestle, the most active stock of the day, as it recovered a little from a Morgan Stanley downgrade earlier this week, and rose SFr14 to SFr1,103. Zurich Insurance put on SFr19 to SFr1,257. AMSTERDAM moved higher in line with other markets with some impressive gains seen in the cyclicals. In chemicals, DSM rose Fl 3.20 to Fl 92.70 and Akzo by Fl 5.30 to Fl 158.90. The CBS Tendency index improved by 2.2 to 116. MILAN was encouraged by gains in the insurance and telecommunications sectors, while hopes of a further easing in interest rates and a stronger bond market gave broad support to the market. The Comit index closed up 10.40 or 1.95 per cent at 543.67. Goldman Sachs, in a recent strategy paper on Italy, forecast a slowdown in the markets performance over the next quarter, given that the index has risen 19 per cent since the start of the year in local currency terms. The insurers have been a market favourite for some time on expectations of a positive turnaround in the sector. Generali, which closed up L1,180 to L38,300, has gained 31 per cent since the beginning of the year, while Fondiaria, up L1,170 to L30,086, has gained 15 per cent over the same period. Among telecoms, Stet improved L116 to L3,610, having slipped back over the last couple of days on technical selling as many investors liquidated holdings to purchase warrants. VIENNA was boosted by Frankfurt, short covering and straightforward buying interest as the ATX index rose 24.53, or 2.9 per cent to 859.02. Creditanstalt preferred rose Sch35, or 6 per cent to Sch618 and the utility, Verbund, was up Sch24, or 4.4 per cent to 566. ISTANBUL retreated a further 4.2 per cent, the composite index losing 474.6 to 10,789.2 in estimated turnover of TL787bn, up from TL597bn. Mr Ben Hakham of Carnegie forecast a further correction from recent highs, given the likelihood of higher interest rates in the short-term as the government seeks to reduce the debt burden, continuing profit taking and worries over further Kurdish violence.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 8                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1219.43     1219.60    1218.78    1220.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1265.39     1266.97    1266.56    1267.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1220.97     1222.16    1226.23    1225.73 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1268.97     1270.11    1271.88    1270.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 7     Jul 6     Jul 5     Jul 2     Jul 1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1211.33   1203.04   1197.01   1201.31   1213.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1260.04   1257.80   1253.51   1259.19   1270.98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1226.62; 200 - 1273.35 Low/day: 100 - 1218.27 200 - 1265.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

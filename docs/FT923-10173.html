			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / A long road to reform: The process behind the proposals Phoenix, Arizona, was the unlikely setting for the start of one of the most fundamental restructurings to have shaken the UK chemical industry. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, was visiting the city in October 1989 when his company's third-quarter results were telephoned through. 'I went ho-hum. They weren't bad, but they weren't as robust as they should have been. Something clearly had to be done,' says Sir Denys. He rang Mr Colin Short in San Francisco to ask the former treasurer of Chevron, the US oil company, if he would consider becoming ICI's finance director. Mr Short accepted and, after a brief discussion, the two concluded the group required radical cost-cutting. Shortly afterwards a review of the group's structure was begun. Ever since September 1986, when the company announced that its four bulk chemicals divisions were to be merged, there have been reports that ICI would float off its plastics and petrochemicals divisions. The need for a strategy review became increasingly apparent. 'The world economy was sliding into recession. It was getting nastier and deeper,' says Sir Denys. Two study groups were set up in September 1990. One, under Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief operating officer, was given the task of examining the group's organisation. The other, under Mr Tom Hutchison, a board director since 1985, was to look at strategy. Mr Hutchison's strategy group concluded ICI did not have enough resources to finance all its activities. Its report led to a restructuring plan announced in February 1991. The group also began actively considering hiving off parts of the company. A hint that such measures were being considered was given in the 1990 annual report when Sir Denys said the board would 'pursue with vigour the reshaping of the ICI group still more radically in the years ahead'. But, says Sir Denys, 'we all became rather distracted from the process when a certain gentleman took a considerable minority shareholding'. He was referring to Lord Hanson, whose company bought 2.8 per cent of ICI's shares in May 1991. At the end of that year, Sir Denys rang Sir David Scholey, chairman of ICI's advisers, S G Warburg. He asked him to provide someone who would approach the group restructuring with a financial and City perspective. Sir David chose Mr John Mayo, a 36-year-old corporate finance director at Warburg. For the next two weeks Mr Mayo read hundreds of ICI policy documents. Working with a small team of ICI planners, he examined about 40 well-thought out proposals. Of these 12 were practical, but only one was outstanding, says Mr Mayo. By April, that outstanding plan was put to the executive directors and then the non-executive board members. The main board agreed the plans on Tuesday. Yesterday ICI announced one of the largest restructurings of the European chemicals industry since the Allies broke up I G Farben at the end of the second world war.</p>

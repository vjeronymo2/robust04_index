			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Books: Mysterious pasts THE MIST IN THE MIRROR by Susan Hill Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 13.99, 256 pages ZEPH By AL Barker Hutchinson Pounds 13.99, 224 pages A RATHER ENGLISH MARRIAGE by Angela Lambert Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 288 pages THE JUDAS CLOTH by Julia O'Faolain Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 464 pages SUSAN Hill's mastery of suspense in The Mist in the Mirror is more valuable than any number of post-modernist gimmicks. Long established as a novelist who matters, she does not have to try to be trendy. This ghost story looks back to the turn of the century for its inspiration - not only for its setting, but for its virtuoso pastiche style. Its hero, Sir James Monmouth, is a distinguished-looking old gentleman regarded as something of a loner in his Pall Mall club. Despite his self-contained exterior, he is troubled by memories, and the causes of his anxiety are revealed in an autobiographical manuscript which he hands to a fellow-member. Brought up in ignorance of his parentage in colonial Kenya, he went on, after the death of his guardian, to spend the first 20 years of his adult life as a traveller in the Far East, emulating his hero, the great - though forgotten - explorer, Conrad Vane. Coming home to England, middle-aged and unattached, he sets himself the task of writing Vane's biography. But his very first night in London is marked by sinister disturbances - the pale-faced boy, the scream, the mysterious old woman - and when he starts making enquiries about Vane, he is warned off the trail by everyone he approaches. Shards of childhood memory begin to mingle with the supernatural, as the story moves through a series of coincidences towards its climax, maintaining its momentum by repeatedly creating a sense of security only to shatter it. Psychologically astute and disturbing in its ambiguities, its impossible to resist the manipulative power of this finely constructed tale. By contrast, Zeph, a comedy by AL Barker, has only a rambling sense of direction, despite its brevity. A series of scenes, loosely tied together without the reader-friendly convenience of chapter-breaks, it meanders around its eponymous heroine and her megalomaniac ambitions to become a great author. After her mother dies in a collision with a rubbish-bin, Zeph decides to turn their slightly surreal suburban home into a writers' colony. No real authors apply to her carefully worded advertisements, so she has to make do with whomever is on offer: sexy Nell, an old school friend with a crazed two-year-old son and a sullen husband who makes sculptures out of chicken bones; Maria, Zeph's father's black girlfriend, who daubs in oils and tells rather good fairy stories; and Toplady, failed seducer and maker of blue videos. Despite the odd startling one-liner, this novel never quite gets off the ground, principally because its heroine is more exasperating than endearing. Her lunatic literary bumptiousness can be funny, but you are never laughing with her, only at her. This is the sort of fiction that keeps its characters at arms length, and its off-beat humour is too brittle to satisfy. Angela Lambert, on the other hand, is not afraid of telling a straightforward story and going right to the heart of her characters. A Rather English Marriage contrasts two men, both in their seventies, whose wives die on the same day in the same hospital, and who move in together after the local vicar suggests they might provide mutual support in their bereavement. At first glance, Squadron-Leader Reginald Conynghame-Jervis and ex-milkman Roy Southgate look like stereotypes. Reginald is an upper class military chap with a rigid upper-lip and an inability to get through the morning without a snifter. Roy is a loveable advertisement for old-fashioned working-class family values. But Angela Lambert handles their relationship with such sensitivity that they both emerge as living, breathing individuals. Straightforward, compassionate, and honest with himself, Roy is a foil to Reginald's more interesting, more pitiful personality. Crushed by a lifetime of emotional self-repression, Reginald behaves on the surface like a parody of himself and only begins to see the truth about his marriage towards the end. A Rather English Marriage is observant, wry, and ultimately poignant. Successfully avoiding sentimentality, it offers a credible dramatisation of class tension and generational conflict. If Angela Lambert looks at British social history with the eye of a miniaturist, Julia O'Faolain's massive novel paints its characters larger than life. The Judas Cloth is set in 19th century Italy, and follows the fortunes of Nicola Santi, a priest brought up by Jesuits, through the long and turbulent reign of Pope Pius IX, which saw the rise of Italian nationalism and the diminution of papal political power. Despite some slow and stodgy passages, Julia O'Faolain manages to bring the extraordinary complexities of this historical period to life.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Dollar rallies on hopes of US rates rise The battered dollar bounced back on foreign exchanges yesterday as rumours circulated among dealers of an imminent tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The market performed a swift about-turn from Tuesday's fears that low inflation would delay higher interest rates, and focused instead on the prospects for an imminent increase in rates. The dollar closed more than a pfennig and a half higher in London at DM1.5383. It was also firmer against the yen, closing at Y98.15. The rally continued in New York, where the dollar closed at DM1.54125 and Y98.225, while in Tokyo this morning it opened at DM1.542 and Y98.20. There were suggestions in the markets that US short-term rates would rise by anything from 50 to 100 basis points, which would take them above German rates for the first time since September 1990. Although based on rumour, the calculations inspired greater dealer confidence in the dollar. Earlier the dollar had weakened slightly on the release of US consumer inflation data for June. Month-on-month inflation rose 0.3 per cent, in line with market forecasts, momentarily damping hopes of a Fed tightening. A quick increase in rates would dispel market fears that the Fed has been slow to respond to the threat of inflation arising from economic recovery. It would also quash concerns that the Fed is bending to the will of the White House, which does not want higher rates. Both factors have contributed to recent dollar weakness. Another factor contributing to the dollar's resurgence was the greater stability in international bond markets. Volatile bond markets had driven investors towards safe haven currencies such as the D-Mark and the Swiss franc, and the relative weakness of these two currencies in recent days is a sign of calmer markets. Analysts said the dollar's bounce provided evidence that some investors were becoming nervous about the weakness of the US currency against the yen. However, sentiment remains bearish and yesterday's bounce was seen more as a corrective rally than a turning point. Investors are still selling into rallies, which indicates pessimism about the outlook. But they remain cautious of taking aggressive short positions against the dollar, for fear of being caught out by central bank intervention. 'The lower we go, the more nervous the market gets,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London. The dollar has fallen by around 9 per cent since the beginning of June.

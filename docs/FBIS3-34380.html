This was reported by arrivals from  Baghdad in Iraqi Kurdistan in the past two days. They said the  clashes took place when the money changers refused to observe  the regime's recent instructions banning individuals from  dealing in currency in the Baghdad money market and restricting  this activity to a group of brokers working directly on behalf  of 'Udayy.</p>

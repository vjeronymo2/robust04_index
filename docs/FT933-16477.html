			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Safeway seeks block on discount project SAFEWAY, the supermarket chain, is to ask the Court of Appeal to quash planning permission granted to US company Costco to open a warehouse club, or US-style discount warehouse, at Thurrock in Essex. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway had each asked the High Court for leave to seek judicial review of Thurrock Borough Council's decision to grant planning permission for the warehouse, which would be one of the first examples of the format in the UK. The High Court last week dismissed the application, but Safeway confirmed yesterday that it had applied for leave to the Court of Appeal. Safeway says the council wrongly assessed Costco as a wholesale operation instead of a retail one. Thurrock granted general, or sui generis use, approval for Costco's scheme, rather than put it in the retail use class. Costco has insisted that its club will be open only to trade customers or groups such as charities. But the supermarket chains say that while Costco warehouse clubs in the US are technically wholesalers, many of their members are private individuals. They say that makes the clubs retail outlets. Safeway said: 'Based on experience in America, we consider Costco should be regarded as a retailer and their planning application should be measured against retail criteria. To do otherwise would be unfair to other retailers and could drive a coach and horses through the planning system.' Analysts have predicted that warehouse clubs, which sell a range of goods at bargain prices from out-of-town sheds, could 'turn the retail scene upside down' with sales of up to Pounds 2bn a year.</p>

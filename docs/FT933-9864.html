			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Georgian prime minister resigns GEORGIA'S parliament yesterday named head of state Eduard Shevardnadze temporary prime minister after the government of Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua resigned, Reuter reports. In a vote, the legislature gave Mr Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, two weeks to put forward a new cabinet to grapple with the economic disintegration and military upheavals facing the country. Mr Shevardnadze had warned that Georgia was exposed to grave danger and could only be saved by centralising power and introducing an 'emergency regime'. In a televised address he said: 'The fight that has begun in Georgia could become the start of civil war, the gravest civil war.' Separatist conflict in the region of Abkhazia and post-Soviet economic disintegration have brought the country to the brink of collapse.</p>

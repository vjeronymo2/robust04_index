			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS TO BE GIVEN BACKGROUND CHECKS BEFORE RECEIVING LICENSES  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol, prompted by mounting concern over the safety of  children who ride to school on buses, announced last week that the agency will  tighten the application process for school bus drivers to obtain licenses.  </P> <P> Robert Rengstorff, chief of enforcement for the CHP, told the Assembly  Transportation Committee Thursday that beginning June 1, 180-day temporary  licenses will no longer be issued to drivers employed by school districts and  private school bus companies.  </P> <P> Under the CHP plan, developed during the past few weeks, applicants for permits  to drive school buses will be licensed only after fingerprint and background  checks are completed. Currently, drivers who pass state tests are given  temporary six-month permits to allow them to drive while the checks are being  completed.  </P> <P> Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because "there  just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants  have been involved in serious bus incidents."  </P> <P> In recent incidents two bus drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit, the nation's  largest private school bus contractor, have been arrested on suspicion of  driving school buses while drunk. A third Laidlaw driver was arrested for  carrying a loaded gun in his bus. Laidlaw serves the Long Beach Unified School  District.  </P> <P> The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), said he called  the hearing to examine the procedures used by Laidlaw, other bus companies,  school districts and state agencies.  </P> <P> "There's something seriously out of whack" in the system, Katz said. He cited  the recently discovered criminal backgrounds of some school bus drivers,  allegedly faulty procedures of state authorities in licensing drivers and the  poor accident record of private school bus operators.  </P> <P> Laidlaw officials defended their practices, saying the company has instituted a  comprehensive driver safety program.  </P> <P> But Katz said that based on CHP figures the accident rate for all private  school bus contractors is significantly higher than the rate for drivers  employed directly by school districts. The Los Angeles school district employs  1,300 drivers, and the remaining 1,500 who transport the district's students  work for private firms, school officials said.  </P> <P> A specific breakdown of the accident rate for Los Angeles schools was not  available.  </P> <P> According to 1987-88 school year figures for the entire state released by  Katz's office, drivers employed directly by school districts were involved in  nearly seven accidents per million miles compared to almost 11 accidents per  million miles for private bus companies. A spokesman for Katz said those  figures -- the most recent available -- were for buses that carry 20 passengers  or more.  </P> <P> Spike Helmick, deputy CHP commissioner, confirmed the disparity, suggesting  that one reason is that drivers for school districts tend to keep their jobs  longer than do drivers for private contractors.  </P> <P> Complaints about school bus drivers have risen in recent months, following the  arrests of two Laidlaw Transit employees accused of driving buses while drunk  -- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw is paid  about $20 million a year by the Los Angeles Unified School District and is its  largest bus contractor, school officials said.  </P> <P> In January, a Laidlaw driver, Harold Keith Lone, was arrested in Encino as he  prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School. A breath test showed  Lone had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the legal limit  of 0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to  hide a lengthy criminal record, including five drunk driving convictions.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, a school bus driver transporting Clairemont High School  students in San Diego was charged with drunk driving after his bus rear-ended a  pickup truck, injuring three people, according to the CHP.  </P> <P> Moreover, Katz said he was also concerned about another San Diego case in which  Laidlaw driver Victor H. Gomez in 1987 allegedly kidnaped a 5-year-old girl  from a school bus and molested her. A civil lawsuit filed by the child against  Laidlaw is pending. San Diego police said Gomez remains a fugitive.  </P> <P> During Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez still has a valid  license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the Department of  Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency "had not suspended or revoked"  Gomez's license because "we had no information from law enforcement or other  sources that would allow us to act."  </P> <P> Katz complained about the DMV's "business-as-usual approach" in such cases.  </P> <P> He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors "are not  acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening  the drivers."  </P> <P> Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw Transit's Van Nuys-based  operation, acknowledged that when he joined the office "substantial  improvements were needed."  </P> <P> Laidlaw has improved its checking of applicant references and training since  Katz's committee had a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said. "We feel our  procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner," he said.  </P> <P> Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as "isolated" but said they  pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse  among drivers.  </P> <P> In an attempt to discourage problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to  adopt criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on  employment applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and a  $10,000 fine for violations.  </P></p>

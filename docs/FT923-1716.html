			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Ulster talks deadline extended THE DEADLINE for completing the talks on the political future of Northern Ireland was yesterday extended in apparent recognition that a conclusion to the complex negotiating process is still some way off. Yesterday's session of strand two of the talks  - which are taking place in three strands, or sections  - set no new deadline. But it was decided that after three days of talks in Dublin this week, the next round will return to Belfast next week. When the talks began last April, the intention was that they would be concluded by the end of July. That deadline was later extended until the end of this month. Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said the presence in Dublin of leaders of the Ulster Unionist party from Northern Ireland was a 'historic' event, but added that he did not wish to over-emphasise this 'out of sensitivity for the other participants'. Yesterday's session at Dublin Castle was the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922 that unionist leaders had visited Dublin for political discussions. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP), led by the Rev Ian Paisley, stayed away from the talks for part of last week and is boycotting this week's Dublin phase, arguing that the Irish government has not demonstrated any flexibility over the territorial claim to Northern Ireland enshrined in its constitution. Articles Two and Three of the 1937 Irish constitution lay claim to the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley attacked the Ulster unionists yesterday for meeting the Irish ministers, saying: 'Some of the unionist negotiators drink at the bar with these men . . . my party is not in that business. The only time we address them is across the table when we are standing up for what Ulster stands for and will stand for.' Terrorism and security matters, the issues of identity and allegiance, as well as what is considered the central issue of the constitutional status of Northern Ireland were touched on yesterday. Mr Andrews said afterwards: 'The discussions were very positive. Every day there are new ideas. Certain progress was enhanced by today's business.' A bilateral meeting between the British and Irish governments is due to be held this evening and is expected to set a date for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference. This will also be a bilateral meeting of the two governments and will take place in the context of the 1985 Hillsborough Agreement  - to which the unionists are opposed, as it gave Dublin a say, albeit minimal, in Northern Ireland's affairs. It was at the insistence of the DUP that the Anglo-Irish conferences were suspended last April to allow the talks process to proceed. The talks are designed to find a replacement to the agreement. Last month it was agreed that the next bilateral conference would not be held 'before September 28'. Both the British and Irish governments are concerned that any further postponement of the conference would undermine the 1985 agreement, but there is also concern that the convening of a new conference might prompt the DUP to withdraw from the round-table talks altogether.</p>

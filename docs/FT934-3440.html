			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Intellectual imported into party politics: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections Alexander Tsipko is an outstanding example of an intellectual imported into party politics. A twinkling-faced, fast-talking man in his early 50s, he is a Civic Union candidate, writes John Lloyd. The Civic Union is led by Mr Arkady Volsky, head of Russia's main industrialists' union, and numbers among its leading candidates Adm Vladimir Chernavin, admiral-of-the-fleet and a former Soviet deputy defence minister. Yet Mr Tsipko is unabashedly an intellectual - and a semi-dissident one, at that. He came to prominence in 1988, when he published a series of articles in a relatively obscure journal locating the tyrannical genesis of the Soviet state not in Stalin, not even in Lenin, but in the writings of Karl Marx himself. He claimed that Marx had laid the theoretical foundations of a politics which was bound to be monopolistic and, as it turned out, murderous. Even in the early days of glasnost this was heady stuff; the more so since Mr Tsipko worked in the Communist party central committee as a consultant under the liberal aegis of Alexander Yakovlev, chief party ideologist. Mr Tsipko has now launched himself against the current leadership: President Boris Yeltsin and the radical reformers of Russia's Choice. 'He (Mr Yeltsin) is the typical party product: rude and vulgar. He is not used to opposition so he does not have it round him. When he was first party secretary in Sverdlovsk he was among the most enthusiastic of the Communist leaders: very firmly against any kind of experiments with reform. 'Everything is now very black and white - just as it used to be with capitalism and socialism. Now, if you are not for the president, you are a fascist; if you do not agree with the new constitution, you are a terrorist. I do not agree with the new constitution: it cannot last. 'The reformers are typical representatives of the intelligentsia which came to maturity in the 1970s. They did nothing. They never showed any signs of dissidence. Only when they were given permission under glasnost did they begin to show some signs of action. 'Now, they still act like Bolsheviks. They treat the country like an empty field, ready for their experiments - only now it is the imposition of capitalism and not of communism.' Mr Tsipko puts himself in the same frame as east European dissidents who are speaking out against the victimisation of Communists by the new anti-Communist forces. 'This was a country created by the Soviet period. You cannot make that disappear suddenly. You must recognise and work with this. Gaidar forced the break-up of the Soviet Union. I was against that. It ripped apart what had been constructed and which was working in some way. 'There will certainly be a united centrist bloc after the elections. . . By making politics black and white the president and his supporters are trying to squeeze it out, but it must exist if the country is to survive. I remain a liberal, but I also want a strong state; the two are not incompatible. Indeed, I would say the first depends upon the second.'</p>

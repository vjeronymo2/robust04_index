			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Maputo late this afternoon, the Supervision and  Control Commission [CSC] interrupted its meeting on confinement  problems. Faustino Igreja has further details.    [Begin recording] [Igreja] The General Peace Accord's  Supervision and Control Commission will continue to discuss the  confinement problems tomorrow, at a time when the government  admits responsibility for the delay being observed in sending  its men to confinement centers. Deputy Planning Minister Tomas  Salomao led the government's delegation to the CSC meeting.    [Salomao] In practice, what is being observed in the field  is  that some confinement centers do not have the capacity to  receive large numbers of troops. What is more, we experienced  some logistical problems. The government is to blame for some  of these problems, while institutions providing some products  are to blame for other problems. Evidently, a process of this  nature means that we were sending men to confinement centers and  not pushing them there. All the same, we have reassessed the  situation. We identified the critical points. It is true that  there is some delay in the confinement process. The provincial  commanders received instructions to speed up the process. Thus,  when we assess the si??x&gt; [?n?er to comment about the statement  made by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader that  his movement would interrupt the confinement process if there is  no greater flow of government men to confinement centers by  Saturday [22 January].    [Salomao] It is not a question of the government normalizing  the situation by Saturday. It is a question of the parties  carrying out their responsibilities. The government has its  responsibilities in order to complete the number of troops to be  sent to confinement centers. Renamo too has its  responsibilities. If we see the numbers, we realize that it is  not only on the government side that there is an imbalance.  There is an imbalance on both sides. This being the case, the  government has its responsibilities and Renamo too has its  responsibilities. What the government has to do is to carry out  its responsibilities and Renamo too must carry out its  responsibilities.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. deputy minister, what is the  situation at the moment regarding the collection of weapons at  confinement centers?    [Salomao] There was a proposal made by the president of the  Cease-Fire Commission to immediately begin to collect 50 percent  of the materiel found in confinement centers. We agreed with  this position since security conditions for weapons at  confinement centers are not good. It is therefore important  that the weapons collected are sent to regional warehouses where  the United Nations, the government, and Renamo have access to  these warehouses.    [Unidentified reporter] At the moment, we continue to  experience riots by the armed forces. Some troops, who have not  been confined, are raiding shops and blocking roads. Why can't  we avoid these problems?    [Salomao] I cannot say that riots are continuing. There were  incidents at Namialo, Cuamba, and Massinga. There are reasons  for some of these incidents -- delays in processing salaries,  bad logistical conditions -- while others were just acts  disturbance and agitation. Corrective measures to resolve these  problems have been adopted. The chief of the general staff is  carrying out work in the northern and central regions to assess  the situation. We are therefore correcting the situation.    [Igreja] During the CSC meeting, Radio Mozambique  interviewed Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation.    [Domingos] We began a series of meetings today which, I  think, will continue for a number of days. We shall meet again  tomorrow and we are going to examine the report presented by the  president of the Cease-Fire Commission today.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] President  Dhlakama  said that he would interrupt the confinement process if the  government continues to drag its feet in confining its troops?    [Domingos] Well, we have this forum. We shall use it to  present our [words indistinct].    [Unidentified reporter] Renamo therefore expects to  interrupt  the confinement of troops?    [Domingos] If that is necessary, we shall declare it here at  the level of the commissions.    [[Unidentified reporter] You therefore deny the statement by  the Renamo president?    [Domingos] I do not deny it. I am only saying that the  statement made by my president will formally be presented here  at the level of the commissions.    [Igreja] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN  secretary general, thinks the situation will improve.    [Ajello] There is a report which was presented by the  president of the Cease-Fire Commission on the confinement  process. There are delays and there are problems. We are  discussing these problems to see how we can resolve them and so  that the parties can have the time to study the report from the  president of the Cease-Fire Commission that we are going to  present now. Tomorrow afternoon, at 1500, we shall resume our  meeting and discuss the report.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you consider valid the  government's reasoning that there are technical problems  concerning the confinement process?    [Ajello] I want to understand what these problems are. If  they are technical problems, we want to see how can assist in  resolving them to have a correct confinement process, because  now it is not progressing smoothly.    [Unidentified reporter] The Renamo president said that he is  going to interrupt the confinement of Renamo forces if the  government continues [words indistinct]?    [Ajello] I do not think the government will continue not  confining its troops. The government is resolving the problem  and beginning to confine troops in 15 areas approved in  December. I do not believe there will be a need to disrupt the  process. [end recording]</p>

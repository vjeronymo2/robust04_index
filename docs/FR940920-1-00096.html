Therefore, no Hg control is needed to meet the MACT floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because acid gas/PM control systems (DSI/ESP) will be needed at small plants to meet other MACT requirements, activated carbon injection could be added to the acid gas/PM control system to achieve Hg control. The incremental cost to add activated carbon injection to control Hg at small MWC plants already equipped with acid gas/PM control is about $1.40/Mg of MSW combusted. The EPA believes that this cost is reasonable given the concerns over the bioaccumulation of Hg in the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the EPA's test programs to study Hg removal using SD-based scrubbing systems with activated carbon injection, the EPA has also conducted Hg performance tests of DSI-based scrubbing systems with activated carbon injection at small MWI's (Borgess, Michigan, MWI). The use of activated carbon injection with either SD-based scrubbing systems or DSI-based scrubbing systems has demonstrated greater than 85-percent Hg control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In combination, DSI/ESP systems with activated carbon injection can achieve Hg emission levels of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for Hg for small MWC plants is 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Dioxins/Furans for Small MWC Plants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The MACT floor for total dioxins/furans is 1,700 ng/dscm, which is above typical uncontrolled levels of about 1,000 ng/dscm. Although the MACT floor for dioxins/furans would be based on no control, DSI/ESP is already needed to meet MACT for other pollutants, and GCP are needed to meet MWC operational and CO requirements. The combination of GCP and DSI/ESP can achieve total dioxin/furan levels of less than 125 ng/dscm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, MACT for Hg for small plants would be based on using activated carbon injection. Activated carbon injection provides additional removal of dioxins/furans beyond that achieved by the acid gas/PM control system, as discussed in the rationale for MACT for dioxins/furans for large plants. Recent tests at small MWI's using DSI systems with activated carbon injection have also shown that additional dioxin/furan removal is achieved with activated carbon injection (greater than a 50-percent reduction over levels achieved by the acid gas/PM control system). Based on the use of activated carbon injection with GCP and DSI/ESP systems, a level of 60 ng/dscm would be achievable. The EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ basis and a total mass basis. Based on EPA's analysis, a total dioxin/furan level of 60 ng/dscm is equivalent to 1.0 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for MWC's at small plants is 1.0 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ or 60 ng/dscm total mass dioxins/furans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

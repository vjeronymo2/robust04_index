			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the purpose and standards of business Sir, Recent reports of internal and external 'whistle-blowers' - such as Graham Pink, sacked as a nurse from Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport - have drawn attention to real or alleged sub-standard conduct in public services. Whether the complainers are right or wrong, and whether their complaints are public or private, everyone involved seems to pay a heavy price. One whistle-blower is reported to have incurred costs of over Pounds 70,000. Another has lost pension rights, probably involving a much higher figure. The governor of the Bank of England, referring to corporate misconduct at high levels, has counselled the need for eternal vigilance as preferable to setting up yet more watchdogs ('Bank governor urges check on corporate abuses', April 29). But will a concerned public be sympathetic to this 'leave it in our hands' approach? These 'scandals' do not so much point to a collapse in business standards as to a demand for higher ones. There is now an embryonic 'business ethic' movement. There needs to be a constructive debate on how to identify, maintain and spread acceptable business standards. This is the only way to avoid the dubious gimmicks, dogmas and false dawns that industry and management seem to attract. Adam Smith's remarkable insights more than 200 years ago can provide some, but by no means all, of the answers to the questions raised lately by the Archbishop of Canterbury. They cannot provide a universal licence for everything that happens in the marketplace.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By An Wei (1344 0251) and Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): </F> "We Should Conscientiously Study, Publicize, and Implement the  State Council's Important Written Reply and `Beijing's Overall  Urban Plan'"]    [Excerpt] At a standing committee meeting of the municipal  party committee held on the morning of 23 February, Chen Xitong,  secretary of the municipal party committee, emphasized that the  entire municipality should conscientiously study, publicize, and  implement State Council's important written reply and "Beijing's  overall urban plan," make concerted efforts, and strive to build  Beijing into a fairly modern international city by 2010.    Participants at the meeting heard a speech given by a  responsible person from the committee for planning and  construction in the capital on opinions concerning the study,  publicity, and implementation of the State Council's important  written reply and the arrangements for "Beijing's overall urban  plan."    Chen Xitong gave a speech. He said: Beijing's former  leaders formulated the "initial program for Beijing's overall  urban construction plan" as early as the 1950's, enabling  Beijing to score great achievements in construction and  development. After the "Great Cultural Revolution" started,  Beijing was forced to stop implementing the "overall plan," and  urban construction was bogged down in chaos. After the 10-year  turmoil, we reformulated "Beijing's overall urban construction  plan" based on the original plan and new conditions, which was  approved in principle, with an important written reply attached,  by the CPC Central Committee and State Council in 1983.  Practice in the past 10 years proved that this plan is correct  and has yielded great results and brought about great changes in  Beijing's urban and rural outlook. However, this plan was drawn  up under the condition of the planned economy, and some aspects  have failed to suit the new situation and need to be revised and  developed due to the political, economic, and social development  of the capital and the growth of its population.    Chen Xitong pointed out: A prominent characteristic of the  new overall plan is the strengthening of tertiary industry to  meet the needs of the socialist market economy. In the past,  Beijing's lack of markets brought many inconveniences. Tertiary  industry has been expanded over the past years, but this is  still not sufficient and helpful to the development of the city,  and people still have inconveniences in living. We should  attach great importance to the development of tertiary industry.  The new overall plan also gives prominence to the strategic  gradual transfer from downtown areas to outer suburbs in urban  construction and the strategic shift from expansion by building  new projects to adjustment and renovation in the construction of  the downtown areas. This conforms with Beijing's reality. Party  and government leaders, people's congress standing committees,  committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, and people across the municipality should all  conscientiously study, publicize, and implement State Council's  important written reply and "Beijing's overall urban plan," make  concerted efforts, and strive to build Beijing into a fairly  modern international city by 2010.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Management: Crocodile scales - Motoko Rich meets busking boss Theo Lieven, pianist and president of Germany's largest PC manufacturer The 250 music-lovers who gathered at St James's Church in London's Piccadilly for a performance of Mozart's Double Piano Concerto in April were, said one of the performers, a bit unusual. 'When they clapped they really appreciated the music,' says Theo Lieven. 'Normally when I play in concerts you may have people there who clap because they have to.' Lieven, though, is a bit unusual himself. A pianist who has performed with orchestras in Vienna, Berne, Louisiana and California, he is also president of Vobis Microcomputer, Germany's largest PC manufacturer and Europe's largest PC retailer. Some past audiences may therefore have felt compelled to applaud because they work for him. Lieven is one of an elite band of busking bosses that includes Trevor Holdsworth, retired chairman of GKN (a pianist who has played with orchestras in London), Sony president Norio Ohga (trained opera singer and international conductor in his spare time) and Kenichi Ohmae, head of management consultant McKenzie's Tokyo office (flautist who performs in Tokyo). While he makes no simple connections between the disciplines of music and business, Lieven suggests that the motivations to play an instrument or head a company may be similar. 'In the concert you have the clapping of the audience, in business you have the clapping of the bank,' he says. 'If you play the piano you are your own conductor. So if you are not someone who knows what he wants you cannot play the piano. Or lead a company.' For the Vobis president, piano playing intensifies rather than eases his lifestyle. He has been leading the jet-setting life of a performer (he flies his own aeroplane) since 1991, when he met Hannes Keller, a software supplier and fellow pianist, at a press conference in Switzerland. In 1992, when recording a CD, they were noticed by William Kushner, conducter of the Lake Charles Symphony in Louisiana, in the US. Kushner invited the pair to play with the orchestra in the US. The idea of getting paid to play gave Lieven such a thrill that he never banked the cheque (for Dollars 1,500). Indeed, the international piano foundation that he established at a villa near Lake Como in Italy in 1991 - which every year sponsors five pianists to take master classes with outstanding musicians - suggests he is keen to put more into music than he takes out. Trained as a classical pianist in his home town of Aachen, Germany, where Vobis is based today, he won second prize in a city piano competition at the age of 18. 'If I had been the first-prize winner I would have continued but since I was not I decided to do something else,' he says. That something else was a mathematics course at Aachen University. There, at the age of 23, he and a friend, Vobis partner Rainer Fraling, started a business selling Hewlett-Packard scientific calculators to classmates. Soon they had secured a contract to sell 2,500 HP calculators for DM1,000 (Pounds 400) each. From there the company expanded by about 50 per cent a year, opening shops throughout Germany and expanding into 10 European countries. The business really took off, though, after Vobis launched its manufacturing divison when an order for Commodore computers failed to show up. Lieven was desperate for units and flew to Taiwan to see a computer parts supplier. By January of 1988, Vobis was making its own machines. 'At the time it was a short-term thing,' said Lieven. But Vobis's operation grew, and now the company is second only to Olivetti in PC production in Europe, with a turnover in 1993 of DM2bn. A friend once likened Vobis's management style to the temperament of a crocodile. 'They sit for hours and hours in warm water looking and looking, doing nothing and relaxing,' Lieven says. 'But the moment a zebra comes and they spot a chance for food, they snap it.' Lieven prepares for concerts on the same principle. 'One hour of effort a day is enough.'</p>

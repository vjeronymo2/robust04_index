			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Fractured fantasies in the raw - Sophie Constanti sees Second Stride breaking boundaries At the end of Fast and Dirty - the collective results of a five-week experimental theatre workshop initiated by the mixed media performance ensemble, Second Stride, and presented at Whitechapel's Curtain Theatre  - the artistic director, Ian Spink, bounds on stage and invites the audience to join him and the performers at a nearby pub. Although the suggestion veers uncomfortably close to that brand of luvvies-at-the-cutting-edge liberalism in which woolly, post-performance debate between creators and public is marketed as a form of personal growth for all, Spink throws it our way with the kind of admirable folly and spontaneity which, judging by the evening's miscellaneous offerings, appears to have inspired most of Fast and Dirty's participants. Take, for instance, the prologue to a series of untitled voice and movement improvisations featuring the eight members of Group 2. Bungling but prudent ringleader Phelim McDermott instructs the assembled crew of actors, dancers, and musicians to be 'positive about other people's ideas . . . be available . . . be sparing with words . . . and, if all else fails, to ask for lights out.' In the first of the group's enjoyable juvenile efforts, two men jostle and prance around the lolling body of a woman who reaches out in vain for assistance. In the second scene, McDermott mobilises various body parts - an elbow, a knee, even his eyes - in the ridiculously exaggerated manner of a bad mime artist or novice dance student. But his most absurd contortions are reserved for 'doctor's' orders to 'move (his) intention'. In another episode, a duet for two women dissolves in an orchestrated attack of coughing and sniffing, the prelude to a run of physical endurance testing which, although mainly for McDermott, sends his colleagues into fits of barmy aggression, forcing an immediate curtailment of all activity. The continual threat of chaos, so amusingly manipulated by the performers, is perfectly balanced by the unexpected moments of impotence and fear that characterise all true forms of improvisation and experiment. The performers feed on and savour those moments. In the final tableau, an unseen schoolteacher is heard admonishing a pupil. 'I want you to come out in front of the whole class and dance,' says the teacher, a command which prompts instant paralysis and strikes a chord of comic-horror with immaculate ease. Less is left to chance in the first item of the evening, a collaboration - entitled I Would Be Desirable - between director Hilary Westlake, choreographer Sue MacLennan and composer Fabienne Audeoud, involving two actors, two dancers and a singer. Working around a single, unanswerable question, 'If I were you, who would you be?', the performers evolve and dissect their own language of physical and verbal communication. Their faces are shown in close-up on a bank of video screens which later accommodate edited footage of an encounter between the dancing couple, Julien Joly and Gill Lyon. At a bistro table, one man interrogates another to no avail, eventually storming off-stage only to return disguised in a woolly hat and all-in-one plastic glasses, eyebrows and nose. Themes of mistaken identity and jumbled memory colour the intervening text for two speakers, who, revising their stories as they recite them, are periodically thumped by their respective silent partners. Fragments, the two-part closing work directed by Lucy Bailey and Ian Spink for a third group of performers, is the most impenetrable piece on the programme. Based on selected texts written in diary form by an unnamed 20-year-old woman, it lures you into a dangerously unpredictable fantasy world of dopplegangers, alter egos and evil spirits. In her bedroom, a woman dressed in a night gown and prone to intermittent bouts of furious scribbling is visited by Lizzie Saunderson's Babushka, a collector of dirty laundry, by a musician who outstays her welcome, and by the oddball couple (Linda Dobell and Liz Ranken) who, as the woman's parents, display an even greater tendency towards lunatic behaviour than their disturbed daughter. Ranken (the father) turns into a convincingly semi-rabid dog but, having regained his/her composure, is later to be seen drowning under a black sea constructed from plastic bin-liners. And just when the storm of slamming doors and hysterical exchanges seems to be blowing over, Desiree Cherrington's mute diabolist springs to frightening life, clambering on to the desk and up the wall. As Spink explains in his introduction to the evening's events, the act of presenting such raw, newly formed work demands a two-way negotiation of the process-versus-product argument. Over the past few years, many performers have stressed the importance of funding for research and development. But are such embryonic creations of any interest to an audience? Work as intellectually mature and focused as Second Stride's Fast and Dirty contributions offers, even in its unfinished state, a revealing insight into the perils and delights of theatre which is led by opportunity, accident and instinct. As McDermott points out in his round-up of performance possibilities: 'Some people (in the group) might never come on stage.' But that, he reminds us, 'is a valuable contribution to a piece, sometimes.' Second Stride's next project, Badenheim, will tour from autumn 1995.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: State Bank of NSW back in the black State Bank of New South Wales, the regional Australian bank, returned to the black in the six months to March after large reductions in doubtful debt charges and abnormals. The bank, owned by the New South Wales government but earmarked for sale to the private sector later this year, turned a ADollars 89.6m (USDollars 64.4m) loss into a ADollars 19.7m net profit on static operating income of ADollars 314.8m. Before taxes and charges, earnings eased 9 per cent from ADollars 89.5m to ADollars 81.7m. Doubtful debt charges fell 53 per cent from ADollars 109.8m to ADollars 57.7m and total problem loans were down 19.4 per cent from ADollars 1.2bn to ADollars 964.2m. Tax took ADollars 10.3m against a ADollars 26.6m credit previously. The New South Wales government said recently that only one contender, believed to be Colonial Mutual, the Australian investment group, remained interested in buying the bank. Sale legislation is scheduled for this September.</p>

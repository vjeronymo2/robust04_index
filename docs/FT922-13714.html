			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Big output boost by Nissan THE RAPID build-up of output in the UK by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, compensated last year for a steep decline by established producers such as Rover, Peugeot and Jaguar. Nissan, which began volume-car assembly in the UK in 1986, increased production last year by 63.6 per cent to 124,666 from 76,190 in 1990 according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Nissan will remain a vital factor in the development of UK car production for the next two years with output forecast to rise to 175,000 this year and 270,000 next year. The company's efforts will be helped by the introduction of a second car range this summer. Honda and Toyota, the other Japanese carmakers developing assembly plants in the UK, will both begin volume assembly by the end of the year. Honda will start at its Swindon, Wiltshire, plant in October and Toyota in Burnaston near Derby in December. Overall UK car output fell 4.5 per cent to 1,236,900 last year, largely as a result of a 13.8 per cent fall in Rover car production and a 24.5 per cent drop in output by Peugeot, the French carmaker, at its Ryton, Coventry, assembly plant. Rover car output fell last year to 359,951, a figure which includes 35,952 Honda Concertos assembled by Rover. Ford's UK vehicle output (including Jaguar and Aston Martin) fell 3.7 per cent to 484,639 from 503,525 a year earlier, largely as a result of the 45.2 per cent decline in production by Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary. The recession in the UK and in the US took a heavy toll on UK luxury car output, hitting Rolls-Royce as well as Jaguar.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1991       1990      1991/90                               Jan-Dec     Jan-Dec    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                       1,236,900   1,295,611        -4.5 Rover (British Aerospace)     395,624     464,612       -14.8  -cars****                    359,951     417,351       -13.8  -Range Rover/Discovery        35,673      47,261       -24.5 Ford (excl.

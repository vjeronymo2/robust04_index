			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / De Klerk tells ANC it must oust radicals MR FW de Klerk, the South African president, yesterday stated that he would not share power with the African National Congress (ANC) until it ousted radicals from its ranks and disbanded its armed wing. Both these demands could place a serious obstacle in the way of early progress to a multi-racial interim government. Mr de Klerk told a special session of the country's white-dominated parliament that he did not expect the South African Communist party (SACP), the ANC's closest ally, to form part of the first multi-racial government 'because they do not have the support of the people'. This is likely to be contested by the ANC, many of whose top leaders are also officials of the Communist party. Communist leaders have made clear they intend to contest the first multi-racial elections in alliance with the ANC. Following the deaths of 26 people during an ANC march, led by SACP leaders, in the Ciskei black homeland, Mr de Klerk has taken a tougher line against radicals in the ANC, whom he sees as frustrating talks on a new constitution. Mr Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, highlighted the slow pace of these negotiations when he said on Monday night that he did not expect the first all-party elections to take place before the end of next year. Mr de Klerk has recently come under sharp criticism from whites both inside and outside his party for making too many concessions to the ANC, including a recent agreement to free hundreds of political prisoners, some of whom committed terrorist crimes. Yesterday the president said the ANC would have to become a registered political party before he would consider sharing power in an interim government. 'I am not willing to form a government of national unity with the ANC as it is now. It must get rid of the radicals . . . it must undergo a transformation,' he said. He added: 'It must get rid of the uniforms and the weapons . . . it must be transformed from a militant movement into a political party.' ANC spokeswoman Gill Marcus said the policy-making national executive committee would consider Mr de Klerk's comments on Wednesday. Wrapping up a two-day debate on multi-party democracy talks and measures to combat the country's endemic political violence, Mr de Klerk said he would never submit to radical pressure or hand power to a dominant majority.</p>

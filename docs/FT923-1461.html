			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Yugoslav plea to avert exclusion from UN MR Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump state of Yugoslavia, warned the United Nations last night that exclusion of his country's delegation from UN activities would set a bad precedent. In a last minute bid to avert his delegation's exclusion from the UN general assembly, Mr Panic argued that his state - consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro - fulfilled all requirements of UN membership. Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador, formally introduced a resolution to exclude the rump state, following the declarations of independence by other republics in the former Yugoslavia. Sir David said the exclusion was in no sense a 'punitive measure' against Serbia nor one designed to undermine the Yugoslav peace process. He said it was only designed to deny the Serb-controlled rump state's right to inherit the UN seat Yugoslavia held before its break-up. Mr Panic served notice that he would formally apply for the new federation's readmission. Earlier, he pleaded his case in an hour-long meeting with the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent members - the US, Britain, France, Russia and China - who reaffirmed their rejection of Belgrade's claim to be the automatic successor to a state that was a founding member of the UN. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, repeated that position on behalf of the European Community in his address to the Assembly yesterday and insisted that a delegation from the new 'Federal Republic of Yugoslavia' should not participate in the work of the General Assembly. Privately, western officials stressed that they did not want to do anything to harm Mr Panic's standing and they acknowledged his political courage. But they reiterated their view that Serbia and Montenegro must follow the same route as the other republics of former Yugoslavia and apply for independent membership if it wished to be in the UN. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US acting secretary of state, told reporters he believed Mr Panic was working hard and constructively to bring peace to the region, but both he and Mr Hurd agreed there were 'very serious problems' to be resolved before the penalties imposed on Belgrade could be lifted. Any of the permanent members of the Security Council could block its membership application through a veto. In an appeal addressed to all UN members, Mr Panic said the case of Belgrade's membership affected the rights of all small states and its expulsion would set a dangerous precedent. 'Today it is Yugoslavia; tomorrow it may as well be any other member state of the United Nations,' he said. Mr Panic is determined to strengthen his fragile base in Serbia, despite attempts by Serbia's ruling socialist party to threaten another no-confidence vote against him. As soon as he returns to Belgrade, he will try to gain control over television, currently monopolised by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. Television is the main source of information for the countryside which continues to support Mr Milosevic. To achieve this, Mr Panic wants to change the federal constitution, in a move aimed at placing the television, or at least one of the two main channels, under federal control.</p>

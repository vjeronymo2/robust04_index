			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: The Colonel decides to fall on his sword - The end of a minister with a history of backing losers ON July 24 1989, as the losers and winners from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 11th reshuffle played out their parts in Downing Street, a burly, bushy-eyebrowed MP strode past reporters, chuckling at the commotion across the street. 'Who's in and who's out?' asked Mr Michael Mates, MP for East Hampshire, making a brief appearance unconnected with the drama across the street. Almost exactly four years later Mr Mates himself was 'out'. Known around Westminster as the Colonel because of his long Army career, he had finally done the decent thing and fallen on his sword. Perhaps it was surprising that his career embraced a period of ministerial responsibility, given a streak of stubborn independence and outspokenness which can lie uneasily alongside political office. Preferment was never on the cards for a standard bearer of the Tory party's centre-left while Mrs Thatcher was at Number 10. He never regained favour with the Tory right after campaigning for Mr William (now Lord) Whitelaw for the leadership in 1975. Mr Mates has since been closely aligned with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, acting as his chief lieutenant in the trade and industry secretary's 'wilderness years' between the 1986 Westland affair and the 1990 leadership election. Given that record, and the latest revelations concerning his links with Mr Asil Nadir, the MP acquired something of a reputation for backing losers. Even his finest hour, at the head of a full-scale Tory rebellion against elements of the poll tax, ended in failure - crushed under the weight of a 100-seat Commons majority. Now 59, Mr Mates started his political career 19 years ago by applying to become Tory parliamentary candidate for Petersfield - now East Hampshire - even before he had joined the party. He told his selection meeting he would join if they chose him. Continually passed over for ministerial office, Mr Mates concentrated on his interests in defence policy and Northern Ireland, serving on several Commons and backbench Tory committees. He chaired the all-party defence select committee but found controversy over failure to disclose his business connections with two defence-related companies. bringing criticism from the committee on members' interests. Appointed last year as a Northern Ireland minister, he warmed to the job. But he never managed to win a following in the province, with nationalists regarding him as as a slightly pompous Englishman unlikely to be hard on the Army establishment. Controversy returned once his links with Mr Nadir became public. In spite of a strenuous defence, his chances of survival were not helped by a lack of committed friends at Westminster. The flow of damaging leaks inevitably spelled the end. The detail of Mr Mates's misfortunes became swamped in the embarrassment that the affair was inflicting on the prime minister and his government. In the end, he could not avoid the fate which he had so rashly encouraged Mr Nadir to resist.</p>

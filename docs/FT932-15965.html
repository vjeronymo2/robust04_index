			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / ITV lifts network budget to Pounds 540m THE ITV companies have agreed a total national network budget for 1994 of Pounds 540m, an increase of Pounds 25m on the current year. The budget, which includes the cost of ITN's news programmes, was at the upper end of expectations. In spite of a widening gap between the resources of the ITV companies, some of which bid considerably more for their franchises, all agreed to put up their share - in proportion to their net advertising revenues - after only two meetings and no fundamental disagreements. The latest ratings, for the week to March 28, show that ITV won a 41 per cent share of the audience compared with 32.5 per cent for BBC 1 and a total of 42.2 per cent for both BBC channels. Channel 4 had 11.2 per cent. Advertising revenues are improving and advertising agencies forecast net revenues for all commercial TV broadcasters of Pounds 1.89bn for 1993 (Pounds 1.84bn at 1992 prices), compared with an expected total of just under Pounds 1.8bn for 1992. National Economic Research Associates, an economic consultancy, recorded in its March survey of leading advertising agencies an improvement in confidence for the fifth successive month.</p>

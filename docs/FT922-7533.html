			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Mixed signals cloud outlook on rate cut THE FEDERAL Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meets tomorrow to consider the state of the US credit markets, with Wall Street divided over the likelihood of an early cut in short-term interest rates. The Fed last eased on April 9, when it cut its target for the key Fed funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75. Many analysts are expecting it to trim a further 25 basis points off Fed funds over the next few weeks. Some aggressive Fed manoeuvring on Wednesday of last week briefly, but wrongly, suggested it might already have done so: the central bank chose to add reserves to the banking system, which for a time took Fed funds below the 3.75 per cent target. The move was eventually seen to be a purely technical move, in response to wide swings in bank reserve demands, yet some traders viewed it as a possible foretaste of easing to come. However, the indicators that might trigger a Fed easing continue to throw out very mixed signals as the economy climbs slowly away from last year's recession. Last week produced stronger-than-expected retail sales for April, on top of lacklustre revised March figures, yet car sales in early May remained sluggish, at a 5.7m unit annual rate. This reinforced the view that the revival in consumer spending needed to underpin recovery was still modest. According to the market's easing theory, the Fed will cut Fed funds one last time in this interest rate cycle to ensure that the recovery does not peter out, as it did around this time last year. Adding weight to the easing theory has been the performance in recent weeks of money supply, which dipped well below the Fed's 2.5 to 6.5 per cent target band for growth this year. Last Thursday, however, it staged a bounce back into the target range, with M2, the monetary measure tracked most closely by the Fed, surging by Dollars 9.8bn in the week ended May 4, far ahead of the Dollars 3bn to Dollars 5bn expected. Many analysts judged that this ruled out an immediate Fed easing, but Mr Ed Yardeni, of CJ Lawrence, noted that excluding M1, the narrow money measure which tracks currency in circulation and demand deposits, M2 actually fell Dollars 700m during the week. However, Mr Lawrence Lindsay, a Fed governor, said during the week that money supply growth had been weak in April because of seasonal factors, in particular the deadline for filing Federal income tax returns, and should start to show the 'beginning of a bounce back'. All this adds up to a consensus view that the Open Market Committee will this week retain its 'bias towards easing' and give Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, the go-ahead for a further cut in Fed funds over the next few weeks if - and it remains a big if - a batch of statistics provides worrying signs of economic weakness. Last week's statistics on inflation have given the Fed more room to ease without provoking market fears of spiralling prices. The producer price index rose just 0.2 per cent in April, below the consensus forecast of 0.3 per cent, and the consumer price index rose by a similarly small amount. This further evidence that inflation is under control, coupled with the belief that economic recovery will remain subdued, sustained the three-week rally in the bond market. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue ended the week  29/32 higher in price, while its yield dropped eight basis points to 7.815 per cent. The lower yields helped bring a rush of corporate bond issuers into the market, which some bears interpreted as a warning that the rally may not have much further to run.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Holders take up 43% of BET rights SHAREHOLDERS subscribed to only 43 per cent of the shares in the Pounds 200.1m rights issue launched by BET to restore some order to the business service group's balance sheet. Underwriters were not, however, altogether unhappy with the 106m shares they were left holding. Barclays de Zoette Wedd, the brokers, offered to buy the stock at 107.5p, some 2.5p below the rights price of 110p and enough for the underwriters to break even on the deal after their underwriting commission. Only 20m of the 106m shares were in fact offered for sale, leaving the bulk in the hands of sub-underwriters happy to hold their stake, the company said. BET's rights issue was widely recognised as a necessary step towards restoring some stability to a balance sheet bloated by debt and auction market preferred stocks to fund a late 1980s acquisition binge. But as the stock market fell in the run-up to the closing date of the offer, BET's share price fell, removing the rights issue discount and raising the prospect of a substantial and damaging flop. In the event, a 43 per cent subscription level appears to border on a successful issue. Shareholders who are daily being unnerved by the state of the markets were wary of taking up their rights when experience of recent new issues suggested they would be left with shares as sub-underwriters. Yesterday BET closed at the rights price of 110p.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / World Trade News: Waste-to-energy project in Taiwan Ansaldo Volund, a Danish subsidiary of Ansaldo, the Italian state-controlled engineering company, and Chung-Hsin Electric &amp; Machinery, its Taiwanese partner, have won contracts worth Dollars 300m (Pounds 205.4m) to build waste-to-energy incinerators for two Taiwanese cities, Andrew Hill writes from Milan. The orders are worth about Dollars 200m to Chung-Hsin and Dollars 100m to Ansaldo Volund, for a four-year project which will generate electricity for the equivalent of 20,000 families in the cities of Pali and Hsinchu. Ansaldo, which is controlled by the Italian state engineering group Finmeccanica, said the award would give Ansaldo Volund 40 per cent of the Taiwanese market for incinerating urban waste, or 50 per cent if the share of NKK, the Japanese company to which the Danish group has granted a licence, is included. The group has won orders for two other incinerators in Taiwan.</p>

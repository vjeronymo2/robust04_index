			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] would not hesitate to prosecute  employers who retained their employees' temporary voter cards  against their will, the IEC said in a statement on Monday [11  April]. It said it had come to the attention of the IEC's  Investigation Department, via reports from specialist monitors  in the Western Cape, that temporary voter cards were in some  instances being retained by farmers on behalf of their workers.    This also appeared to be the practice among some employers  in  the Western Cape.    According to Advocate [Lawyer] Nicholas Tee, national  co-ordinator of the IEC's Investigation Department, the IEC  would investigate any complaints lodged by any workers who  alleged their cards had been retained by their employers against  their will.    "The practice of retaining temporary voter cards and id  documents for employees is injudicious. If it is found to have  occurred without the consent of the worker, prosecution in terms  of the Electoral Act and prescribed regulations will follow  immediately," the IEC said.</p>

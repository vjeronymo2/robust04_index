			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Buying into eastern Germany, the dream and the reality Sir, Christopher Parkes's admirable article ('German privatisation', August 11) highlighted the gulf between dream and reality as far as the proposed sales of industrial and commercial propositions in eastern Germany are concerned. The situation is, if possible, even worse as far as agricultural land is concerned. The Treuhand boasts of having some 450 large farms for sale. When one follows this attractive statement up, one finds that they have actually sold only one farm and that they are in a position to sell, perhaps, only one more. The German government announces that purchasers who wish to start new dairy units in eastern Germany will have made available 'unlimited milk quota'. In reality this means enough for 60 cows - a totally uneconomic number - or if in partnership the new owner may receive milk quota for 120 cows. The Treuhand puts the 'sales' of its 450 farms in the hands of a firm of accountants which has probably never sold a square metre of land let alone 450 farms, each in excess of a thousand acres. The Treuhand in London conveys one message, in Berlin another and yet a third view is given by the Treuhand in the Lander. The basic problem as far as eastern Germany's agricultural land is concerned lies in the fact that the overall land-use policy has become a political football between those who believe that the five eastern Lander have a significant structural advantage in their large-size farms and the Bavarian attitude of so many German ministers who believe that the 20-acre peasant smallholding should be the norm for the whole of Germany. In the meantime potential land purchasers should ignore the siren calls of the Treuhand and their British selling agents.

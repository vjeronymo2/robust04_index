			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON SURVIVING THE MEDICARE CRUNCH  </P> <P> A recent headline on an Economist article about Medicare in the United States  admonished: "Better not be ill." The truth of that will become evident to most  Americans, 65 and older, on Jan. 1 when the so-called catastrophic coverage  ends.  </P> <P> For a significant minority of seniors -- those who supported the successful  political struggle to repeal the year-old legislation -- there will be no  problem. These are the relatively well-off persons who already have so-called  Medi-Gap and other insurance to cushion them against the huge expenses that  Medicare does not cover. The congressional retreat on catastrophic relieved  them of paying not only the premium, $5.30 a month in 1990, but also the income  tax surcharge.  </P> <P> Still at issue, of course, is the problem of protection against the ruinous  costs of long-term nursing home care. The catastrophic bill offered only  marginal relief to this, the most serious health finance problem for seniors.  With repeal, most seniors will be again fully exposed to the impoverishment of  lifetime savings that almost inevitably follows long-term illness. The  influential U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Health Care is working on a response  to that as part of its March report to Congress.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the new year will bring one positive development for Medicare  beneficiaries. Tighter controls over doctors' fees for Medicare patients were  adopted by Congress last month.The phasing in of the new system will commence  Jan. 1, with full implementation due in five years.  </P> <P> One of the most significant protections of the catastrophic legislation, now  repealed, was its unlimited benefit covering hospitalization. Not many are  affected. The average Medicare hospital stay is 7.5 days. But for those with  long illnesses, the cost will once again be staggering. Under catastrophic, the  maximum hospitalization charge in 1990 would have been $592. Without  catastrophic, that $592 must be paid for hospitalization at the beginning of  each 90-day benefit period, and there are no hospital benefits for a 60-day  period between illnesses.  </P> <P> Skilled nursing facility benefits revert also to the old rules. Once again, a  minimum hospital stay of three days must precede entry to a nursing facility.  Under catastrophic, that requirement was waived and the only charge was a  co-payment of $22.50 for each of the first eight days of the 150 days of  skilled nursing-facility care provided per year. As of Jan. 1, coverage will be  limited to 100 days for each benefit period, and 60 days must pass after the  100-day benefit has been exhausted before readmission from a hospital to a  nursing facility is permitted. Furthermore, after the first 20 days, the  patient must pay $74 a day out of pocket.  </P> <P> Gone also will be the overall cap of $1,370 a year in out-of-pocket expenses  for doctor bills provided by the catastrophic legislation. The premium for this  medical coverage will be $28.60 a month in 1990. The patients pays the first  $75 of doctor bills each year and 20% of the balance of approved doctor  charges. Also lost were the prescription drug benefits that were to have been  phased in, as well as provisions to cover the cost of premiums for low-income  persons to assure universal coverage.  </P> <P> The full impact of what has been lost will be learned first in the new year by  those struck by illness and injury requiring long hospitalizations. Their  experience may help other Medicare beneficiaries better understand how  vulnerable they are because of the diminished protections. That, in turn, may  encourage a greater effort in Congress to address the health-care gaps of the  nation as the bipartisan commission prepares its report.  </P></p>

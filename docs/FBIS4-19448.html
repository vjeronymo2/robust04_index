			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Social Democrats [SPD] will  not agree to the Bundeswehr's participation in UN combat  missions under any circumstances. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping  made it clear in Bonn today that his party's political position  will not change, even when the legal disputes have been  clarified before the Federal Constitutional Court.    Following his return from a trip to the United States,  Scharping said in Bonn that he assumes the judges in Karlsruhe  will insist on involving the Bundestag in a decision on the  participation of German servicemen in UN missions.</p>

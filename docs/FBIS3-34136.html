			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Ghare Bahire" column by Sandhani] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton has delivered his first  `State of the Union' speech. In this speech, the President  referred to the past and also spoke about the future. He did  not bother about the present. Perhaps, Clinton did so because  the present is very temporary while the future is everlasting.    According to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the  president must give the State of the Union speech every year.  George Washington and John Adams used to come personally to the  Congress to deliver their speech. Their successors used to send  their written speech to the Congress and these were read out.  This practice continued for almost 100 years. Later, during  the rule of President Wilson and President Franklin, the  previous practice of the president coming to the Congress to  deliver his State of the Union speech started again. This  system is continuing till today.    The State of the Union speech is very important as it  focuses  on issues relating to the domestic and foreign policies of the  United States. President Clinton has also referred to both  domestic issues and foreign policy matters in his speech. He  dwelt at length on the steps taken by his administration during  the past year and also elaborated on the plans of his government  for the current year. The President did not make any attempts  to hide his failures. This distinguishes a leader of a  developed country from those of the developing countries.  Referring to his election pledges, the President said that a  pragmatic budget was formulated last year with a view to  bringing economic discipline to the country. He also referred to  the signing of the NAFTA and GATT accords. President Clinton  categorically stated that no compromise with national interests  have been made in any sector. He claimed that the number of job  opportunities created by his government over the past year  exceeded those created in the previous four years. The President  also gave an outline of the programs taken up by his government  for the year 1994. He said the new programs are aimed at  creating more job opportunities, improving health care  facilities, curbing the crime rate, and preventing drug abuse.  The President further stated that expenditures in over 300  programs will be curtailed and 100 domestic projects will be  ended in order to develop the economy. He, however, stated that  there will be no reduction in the military budget and added that  the efficiency of the armed forces will remain unchanged so that  they can face any situation.    Dwelling on foreign policy, the President said that the  United States would continue to extend its assistance for the  cause of democracy and the protection of human rights. He also  stated that U.S. support for economic reforms in Russia will  continue. But he did not elaborate on whether any emergency  assistance will be provided to Russia. It may be mentioned that  the Second World War did not only lead to the downfall of German  fascism, but also shattered the economy of several European  countries. According to some historians, the Second World War  was won by Britain, but it lost its colonies. Similar was the  fate suffered by the Dutch, the Portuguese, and the French, who  also lost their empires. After the war, the Indian subcontinent  also became independent. Mandatory Western rule came to an end  in several countries of the Middle East and an armed struggle  was launched in Africa to overthrow the white rule. After the  Second World War, the Europeans did not have the power to hold  on to their colonies. Their condition was precarious. As a  result, Churchill lost the elections held in his country. At  that time only the United States was unaffected by the war and  it earned a lot of money by selling arms. After the war, the  United States under the "Marshall Aid" program funneled huge  assistance to Europe and helped the war ravaged countries  rebuild themselves. Though the former Soviet Union was the worst  affected by the war, it did not receive any assistance. During  the war it had to fight to protect every inch of land in  Leningrad and Stalingrad. At the end Stalin himself took over  the command of the army and was able to change the course of the  war by his wisdom, farsightedness, and military strategy.  Later, some scholars opined that Stalin committed some blunders  and said that the present day Russia is the outcome. Massive  assistance is needed for the development of the Russia.  President Clinton has admitted this, but he has not given any  hint regarding "Marshall Aid" to Russia.    We should not emulate everything which takes place in the  United States. But the modern world is so small that it is very  difficult to keep our eyes shut. We have to import everything  -- not only the design of bridges and roads, but also fashion.  If we look closely it could be observed that we import more bad  things in comparison to the good ones. It is difficult to say  whether we will be able to learn some good lessons from the  State of the Union speech made by President Clinton. While  dwelling on the programs of his government, President Clinton  did not criticize former governments. He has only stated what  he has done and what he intends to do. His speech also  reflected the priority given by him to the interests of his  nation. He has given emphasis on the creation of more job  opportunities, curtailing expenditure, and preventing misuse of  funds. The President also did not hesitate to tell his  countrymen that there is no alternative to hard work for the  development of the country. There is nothing new in what he has  said. Everybody knows that hard work is the key to progress.  The leaders of the Third World countries are also aware of it.  We have seen that the GATT talks were about to fail due to the  conflicting interests of different countries, including the  United States, France, and Italy. In spite of this, however,  none of the negotiators sacrificed the interests of their  respective countries. They did so because employment  opportunities will shrink if they fail to develop trade and  industry. It may be said that creation of employment  opportunities is the most important yardstick for measuring the  success or failure of a government.    The full text of the State of the Union speech by President  Clinton has not been published in any newspaper of our country.  There is a lot to learn from portion of his speech which has  been published. But, will we learn any lessons from his speech?</p>

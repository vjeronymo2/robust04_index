			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian  sources said that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is currently  studying a proposal to form a Palestinian human rights committee  that is independent of the Palestinian Authority and is not  affected by internal or external factors.    These sources said that an internal committee has been  formed, comprising of the following members: Salwa Abu-Khadr,  secretary general of the Palestinian Women's Union; Nabil  Ramlawi, PLO ambassador to Switzerland; Yahya Yakhluf, director  general of the PLO Cultural Department; Jamil Shihadah,  secretary general of the Palestinian Teachers' Union; Father  Ibrahim 'Ayyad, member of the Palestine National Council; and  Mrs. Jamilah Saydam, alias Umm Sabri, official responsible for  external relations in the Women's Union.    The sources pointed out that the duty of this committee will  be to propose a list of the persons who will then make up the  Palestinian human rights committee.    Informed Palestinian sources feel that 'Arafat's intention  to  form this committee is to confront the committee formed by Dr.  Hanan 'Ashrawi, the official spokeswoman for the previous  negotiating Palestinian delegations. She rejected her  appointment by 'Arafat to the Palestinian National Authority and  declared that she will continue her activities through the  committee she has formed to defend Palestinian human rights in  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: Gruber's marvellous confection - London Concerts Mahler's death-haunted Das Lied von der Erde was preceded, in the London Philharmonic concert on Tuesday, by HK Gruber's 'pan-demonium' cabaret Frankenstein]] from 1978. Bizarre, but not unreasonable - granted a long interval between them, which there was: though Gruber is a wild card, even at his jokiest he embodies a deep Viennese continuity. Mahler too had a sense of humour, not so very different. The planners of the 'Alternative Vienna' series may have missed a trick by not putting this programme first. In a pretty well-filled Festival Hall, the audience - of whom some unknown but sizeable proportion must have come for Das Lied - were evidently entranced and delighted by Gruber's marvellous confection, as audiences invariably are. It was a pity that they had already missed his Cello Concerto last Saturday, and had only 24 hours' notice for his Violin Concerto no. 1 ('aus schatten duft gewebt', 'woven from the scent of shadows') which Ernst Kovacic played on Wednesday with the London Sinfonietta. After all, it was Frankenstein]] that revealed to a wider public that something quite original was going on in Vienna. A few shellbacks make it a point of honour to resist Gruber's blandishments (a chap in front of me stalked out after the third or fourth song), some of them old-style conservatives and some severe modernists, who can all agree that he is slumming. Yet this off-the-wall entertainment, set to wicked 'children's verses' by HC Artmann, fairly wriggles with bright twists on familiar tropes, popular and classical alike; makes inspired play with toy-instruments; relies shamelessly upon the composer's own ripe idiosyncrasies as chansonnier - and yet fixes the goal-posts for a serious new game. Franz Welser-Most conducted it sympathetically, though without the flair and crackle that Simon Rattle bestowed on its Liverpool premiere. In the event, the subversive charms of Frankenstein]] were enhanced by contrast with Welser-Most's lacklustre Das Lied: better than his spavined Mahler Ninth last week, but still stiff and short-breathed - as he left his tenor Thomas Sunnegardh, starved of air by his unrelenting beat. The mezzo was Doris Soffel, whose clarion eloquence wanted softer edges for 'Von der Schonheit' and the visionary Abschied. Next night in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Gruber himself conducted his ravishing violin concerto: all its fey excursions generated with cogent fantasy, and in Bergian shot-silk textures, from a tender pop song of his own which is revealed only at the close. Kovacic, its dedicatee, played it sweetly and soulfully, rejoicing in the stratospheric new flights the composer devised to flank the final song fore and aft. Gruber also led, and was heard in (both live and on tape), the Groove Music of young Lukas Ligeti, son of the celebrated Gyorgy. Jazzy material - much like Michael Torke's and mostly loud - was distributed among the performers, following different computer click-tracks on their own earphones, which ensured that their disparate paths would crisscross regularly and resoundingly. Plenty of raw, candid energy, less of finesse; at some 22 minutes, slightly overstretched. That concert began and ended with vintage Kurt Schwertsik, Gruber's senior colleague and incessant inquirer. For his 1974 Music from Mu ('Mu' was a mythical Pacific Atlantis, the terrain of '30s novels by Colonel Churchward) he drew upon his investigations of Javanese music to create a pithy, pawky sound-world in little. The Sinfonietta brought it to palpable life. Eight years later Schwertsik wrote a fairytale opera after Brentano, Das Marchen von Fanferlieschen Schonefusschen - 'The Wondrous Tale of Fanferlizzy Sunnyfeet' - which has been travelling Europe ever since (Paul Driver reviewed it warmly on this page when it reached south London a year or two ago). Its interludes add up to a delectable sequence: laconic, funny and various, affectionately backward-looking but fractured, and scored for an off-balance ensemble that establishes its own suave terms. The nearest comparison that comes to mind is Walton's Facade Suite - but I could listen to these Schwertsik 'Transformation Scenes' much more often, expecting fresh post-modernist disclosures every time.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Woodchester shares fall 30p on profits warning Shares in Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, tumbled 30p to 128p yesterday following a profits warning from the company as a result of restructuring costs in the UK and Ireland amounting to IPounds 15m (Pounds 14.4m). The company reported a 6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to IPounds 16.4m in the first half of 1993, and said pre-tax profits for the second half, and before the new exceptional item, 'will be broadly in line' with that. Woodchester said the provisions were 'deemed to be fully adequate and are of a one-off nature.' They are necessary to reduce 'an unacceptably high cost base' and to eliminate a number of 'peripheral product lines which are unprofitable.' The restructuring would result in a 'significant improvement' in the company's long-term profitability. Credit Lyonnais, Woodchester's majority shareholder, 'has fully endorsed the restructuring plan . . . and has formally reaffirmed its full commitment to the continued development of the group.' At end-1993 NCB stockbrokers in Dublin forecast full-year pre-tax profits of IPounds 37.5m.</p>

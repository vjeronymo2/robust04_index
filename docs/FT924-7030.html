			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (1): Deliberating over change - The strict government regulation of South Korea's financial system has outlived its usefulness. But while reforms are badly needed, officials fear that liberalisation could release forces damaging to the economy SOUTH Korean bureaucrats are in a quandary as they prepare to unveil important financial liberalisation proposals next month. They realise the country's antiquated financial system needs to be overhauled to improve industrial competitiveness. But they fear deregulation will also unleash forces that could disrupt the economy. How they resolve this dilemma is one of the most important issues confronting South Korea in the 1990s, since financial liberalisation holds the key to the country's progress. The government successfully used the financial system to transform South Korea into a mighty industrial power during the past three decades. The state borrowed money from abroad and funnelled it through the quasi-government banking system to strategic industries at low interest rates. But this system, appropriate for a developing country, has lost its ability to allocate funds efficiently as South Korea's increasingly sophisticated economy defeats efforts to manage it by bureaucratic fiat. Government controls, including regulated interest rates, stringent limits on capital and foreign exchange transactions, and credit allocation, have led to distortions in the financial system. The result is high interest rates caused by a chronic shortage of capital. This has occurred even though South Korea has one of the world's highest savings ratios. Financial regulation is hampering the country's industrial development at a critical point as South Korea tries to navigate the route taking it from being a low-cost producer of cheap bulk goods to a manufacturer of high-tech products. Companies have problems funding research and improving productivity because of the restrictions on credit and foreign corporate borrowing. High financing costs have saddled the big conglomerates, or chaebol, with huge debt burdens, reducing their profitability. Many small and medium businesses face the threat of bankruptcy. The financial system is also discouraging foreign investment since foreign companies have problems raising capital locally or transferring funds from abroad. Officials acknowledge that the financial system is causing problems but they remain cautious about change. Their hesitation in introducing fundamental reforms reflects concerns ranging from the loss of bureaucratic control and fear of foreign ownership to economic destabilisation and the banking industry's weakness. Officials argue, for example, that speedy liberalisation would damage the economy, with a sudden influx of capital causing inflationary pressure and sending interest rates higher. 'We don't want to experiment with the economy,' Mr Oum Bong-sung, counsellor to the Minister of Finance, says. 'Credit demand will continue to exceed supply even in a liberalised market,' Mr Kim Chang-lok, director of the Ministry of Finance's International Finance Division says. 'Koreans like to speculate and much of the borrowed funds will go into the property market because it offers better rates of return on investment. 'Rapid financial liberalisation would not solve our need for capital and it could reduce the savings ratio.' The government cites its earlier attempt to deregulate interest rates in 1988, which caused rates to rise and forced the reform to be aborted, as an example of the challenge it faces. It argues that a gradual approach is necessary to avoid adverse side effects. Most international economists agree that a short-term rise in interest rates is almost certain once deregulation is introduced because of the country's capital shortage. But they add that rates will fall in the long term as capital inflows ease the funding shortage and the increased availability of other financial investments attracts money from the property market. Also impeding liberalisation is the unpreparedness of domestic financial institutions, particularly the banks, to deal with market deregulation. The country is overbanked, with large bank staffs, inefficient management and inadequate services. The regulated interest rate system has guaranteed bank profitability since the interest rate spread between lending and deposits is two to four times higher than in the US and Japan. Deregulation will create the need for rationalisation, while forcing the banks to develop such management skills as credit analysis instead of relying on government guidance in making loans. Bank supervision and regulations must also be strengthened, including the possible introduction of a deposit insurance system. But perhaps the most worrying danger facing the banks is that of their large non-performing loans and assets, the result of government policy requiring banks to provide 'policy loans' at subsidised rates to strategic industries. Banks have also been forced by the government to invest in securities as part of an unsuccessful attempt to bolster the stock market, but the value of these shares has fallen. Although the weakness of the banks is due to government intervention, officials are now using their troubles as a reason to delay liberalisation. Liberalisation, however, has potential advantages for the banks. Interest rate deregulation will allow them to recover deposits lost to other financial institutions, such as short-term finance companies, which now offer better interest rates. Slowing down liberalisation is the fear that foreigners, particularly the Japanese, will take advantage of the relaxed controls to increase their economic influence over South Korea. Koreans still harbour strong resentment towards Japan because of its colonial rule between 1910 and 1945. The government also worries that the chaebol will consolidate their economic dominance under the financial reforms. The abolition of credit allocation will allow the chaebol to monopolise financial resources at the expense of small and medium businesses, officials argue. The chaebol have been winners and losers under the financial system. Their growth was spurred by the state-mandated subsidised loans, with easy credit encouraging them to build up huge debt/equity ratios. But the government has cracked down on the chaebol in the past few years in an attempt to curb their power. Limits on foreign borrowing and other credit restrictions have driven up their financial costs, while increasing their debt burden. Although financial liberalisation would remove one restraint on the chaebol, the government has other ways of keeping them under control if it introduces new rigorous anti-trust laws. But financial liberalisation will still represent a loss of power for the bureaucracy, which has used financial controls to keep industry dependent on the state. Deregulation will also mean the government will have to compete against the chaebol in acquiring funds, raising state costs. Consequently, there is resistance among officials to reforms. All these concerns will almost certainly lead Seoul to reject the Anglo-American model of a financial system governed largely by market forces. Instead, reforms will follow the Japanese model, with the easing of some controls and retention of others to ensure that the financial system still plays an influential role in industry policy. Less certain is whether South Korea will be able to stick to its preferred course of gradually relaxing interest rates and foreign capital movements. The country is under pressure from the US to accelerate the liberalisation process. A 'wild card' is the possible sudden collapse of North Korea and a German-style takeover by the South. This would cause an enormous demand for capital and may force it to open up its financial market more rapidly to attract foreign investment.</p>

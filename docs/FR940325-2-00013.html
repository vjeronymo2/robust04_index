Petitioner notes that at verification respondent could not provide the Department with any contemporaneous documentation regarding the acceptance of the essential terms of sale by the customers associated with these contracts. Petitioner contends that, despite the fact that respondent believes that these shipments were based on contracts entered into before the POI, the Department could not verify the existence or terms of these alleged contracts. Petitioner also maintains that respondent refused to provide the relevant data requested by the Department with regard to this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner further argues that respondent never demonstrated that the alleged contracts governing these CA cement shipments were made prior to the POI. According to petitioner, the alleged contracts cover time periods much earlier than the POI and in fact constitute unilateral sales proposals made by Lafarge which are not evidence of a binding commitment between the parties as to quantity and price. According to petitioner, Lafarge also has not demonstrated that these shipments were not in excess of the quantity requirements stipulated in the alleged contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner believes that, as BIA, the Department should apply a rate of 198.10 percent, the highest margin alleged in the petition, to account for these sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent maintains that for these CA cement sales the Department should use the date of the customers' acceptance of the graduated requirements pricing proposals as the date of sale and exclude these sales from its final analysis. Respondent believes its pricing proposals were accepted by the customers when the customers placed initial purchase orders at the prices specified in the proposals. At the time these orders were placed, respondent claims the parties had already orally reached an agreement with LCA regarding the percentage of their requirements they were committed to purchase from LCA in order to qualify for each price level specified in the proposals; the orders provided confirmation of each customer's prior acceptance of LCA's pricing proposal. Because these initial orders were dated prior to the POI, respondent argues that the date of sale for the shipments made during the POI pursuant to these proposals also fell outside the POI and, therefore, these shipments were properly not reported to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent notes, however, that, should the Department disagree with its reasoning and determine that the shipments pursuant to graduated requirements contracts should be included in its analysis, there is no basis for the Department to make adverse inferences or use ``punitive'' BIA. Respondent asserts that it fully disclosed the nature of its graduated requirements contracts to the Department from the start of this case, and it had no reason to believe that it should provide further information about those shipments in the form of a sales listing. Respondent further notes that it provided a summary of the quantity and value of the shipments made during the POI under the graduated requirements contracts in its December 29, 1993, supplemental questionnaire response, and that, at verification, Department verifiers retained as an exhibit a listing of all the POI invoices generated under these contracts with related pricing and other sales data. Respondent argues that, if the Department decides to include these sales in the final determination, the sales data examined at verification should be used to allow proper analysis of these sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioner in part. Despite several requests for information in our questionnaires, Lafarge did not provide documentation regarding customers' acceptance of the graduated requirements pricing proposals. For example, Lafarge did not provide any of the ``initial'' orders allegedly placed pursuant to these graduated requirements pricing proposals. In addition, respondent did not offer any indication of the date on which these ``initial'' orders were placed for purposes of establishing date of sale for these sales. Furthermore, respondent could not provide at verification any contemporaneous documentation or other sufficient evidence regarding acceptance of the terms of sale by customers associated with the subject graduated requirements contracts or indicating a ``meeting of the minds'' between the parties with respect to price and quantity, despite the Department's repeated requests for such evidence. The POI invoices that we examined at verification that were allegedly generated pursuant to the pricing proposals and ``initial'' orders gave no indication of association with the pricing proposals or ``initial'' orders, and respondent provided no other documentation that would establish such a connection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

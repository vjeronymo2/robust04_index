			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Clarke opposes further year of 1.5% pay limit MR KENNETH CLARKE will resist the imposition for a further year of a firm 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay. But the chancellor has refused to pre-empt an expected cabinet debate on the issue by ruling out entirely the extension of compulsory pay restraint. In his interview this week with the Financial Times the chancellor said that a second year of rigid pay restraint across the public sector would increase the risk of a damaging bounce-back when the ceiling eventually was lifted. Mr Clarke issued a warning  - repeated yesterday on BBC Radio  - that he would be ready, if necessary, to raise taxes in his November Budget. There was a predictably angry reaction yesterday from some rightwing Tory MPs. Mr David Shaw, chairman of the Conservative back-bench finance committee, said that another round of higher tax increases would be unacceptable to most MPs. He called instead for further reductions in spending. But the chancellor told the FT he saw little prospect of squeezing further the overall spending targets agreed by the cabinet for the next three years. The targets, the toughest since the early 1980s, allow for growth in spending of less than 1 per cent a year after allowing for inflation. Mr Clarke said the history of pay norms suggested that 'they do tend to succeed in the first year.' But he added: 'Holding them thereafter has all sorts of downsides, including the inflexibilities and so on which they introduce. We're also very committed to making sure there is no catching on, no bounce-back after the restraint. The longer you keep it on the more . . . the dangers become.' His view is said to be backed by Mr John Major. But Mr Clarke is aware that several cabinet colleagues believe that it may be impossible for the government to hold to their departmental spending limits unless it maintains a clear line on public-sector pay. Signalling what is expected to be an intense debate in the cabinet committee charged with dividing up the spending total, Mr Clarke said: 'There are a whole lot of programmes where making a judgment about the pay is very important to the spending round . . . I don't think we're going to come to any decisions about what to do on pay, whether to do it programme by programme; do it across the board; what to do; until we're well into the spending round.' That left open the possibility that the government might opt to replace next year the present rigid ceiling on actual settlements with a looser, but pre-announced, limit on the public-sector pay bill. The chancellor used his interview also to stress that he intends to pay much closer attention to the concerns of industry in framing his first Budget. Mr Clarke said he wanted to 'engage' industrialists in discussion of the overall stance of economic policy. He would seek also to 'test' his own ideas for tax and other changes affecting business in a regular dialogue with the captains of industry.</p>

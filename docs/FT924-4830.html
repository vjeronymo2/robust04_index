			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Zimbabwe seeks further aid pledges: Favourable response expected at Paris meeting THE government of Zimbabwe, battered by the worst drought in living memory, today meets consultative group donors in Paris to seek further help for its structural adjustment programme. A broadly favourable response from the World Bank-chaired meeting is likely. Implementation of the five-year programme, now nearing the end of its second year, is broadly on target, despite unsatisfactory progress on public sector and institutional reform. The drought is taking a heavy toll, however. Macro-economic performance has fallen well short of targets. Farm production is estimated to have fallen by more than a third, while official forecasts point to a 10 per cent decline in real GDP, the worst recession in 60 years. Inflation, which peaked in the third quarter this year at 48 per cent, is also way ahead of expectations. Over the three years to 1993 a cumulative current account balance of payments deficit of some Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) is forecast, double the original programme target. As a result, Zimbabwe's foreign debt will rise to over Dollars 3.9bn next year, or 75 per cent of GDP, while the debt service ratio will reach 28 per cent of exports. In a paper prepared for the donors, the World Bank says Zimbabwe will need Dollars 1.4bn in external aid next year, and Dollars 3.2bn over the three years to 1995. In addition to substantial lending by the multilaterals (IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank) 'large inputs are also needed from bilateral donors and commercial banks'. Of the Dollars 1.4bn for next year, Dollars 910m will come from existing commitments - Dollars 144m from the IMF; Dollars 178m from the World Bank; Dollars 213m from the ADB; and Dollars 246m in grants and bilateral loans. New grant commitments of Dollars 200m and new bilaterals loans of Dollars 150m are being sought at the Paris meeting. Donor response is likely to be positive, despite mounting demands on a near stagnant pool of foreign aid. For its part, the Zimbabwe government will come under pressure to improve its performance, especially on civil service reform and privatisation, fiscal management and the deregulation of investment.</p>

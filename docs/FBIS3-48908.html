			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva] </F>   [Text] Sofia, December 29 (BTA) -- Bulgarian President  Zhelyu Zhelev described the leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) in Russia as an "outright fascist." Interviewed for  the National Television and talking to Bulgarian and foreign  reporters, President Zhelev expressed his serious concern over  "the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon," comparing the Russian politician  to Hitler three times. Dr. Zhelev voiced his doubts that Mr.  Zhirinovskiy would ever be allowed to visit Bulgaria again, no  matter what his future position might be.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived on a private visit to Bulgaria  on the evening of December 25. In the three days of his stay,  he made a number of statements saying, among other things, that  President Zhelev should be replaced with one of his advisers,  Bulgarian-born Svetoslav Stoilov, unknown here so far, that  Bulgaria should regain Thrace, Macedonia and Dobrudzha, and that  Romania was an invented state. At 1930 hours local time last  night, the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior ordered Mr.  Zhirinovskiy to leave this country within 24 hours. The Sofia  Airport authorities reported that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left on  a regular service flight to Moscow at 1420 hours local time  today.    "A self-respecting sovereign state cannot allow any  politician coming from another country, be it even a great  power, to insult the people he has come to by his statements,  injure the country's sovereignty and retailor the borders it has  with neighbouring countries, especially at a time when  hostilities are going on in the immediate proximity, or strike  off at one scoop whole states as in the case of Romania, a  circumstance which, if we keep silent, could sour this country's  relations with its neighbours," the president said, explaining  why the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior expelled the Russian  politician from the country.    "Had we taken action earlier, it would have created the  impression of a nervous reaction indicating possibly fear or  uncertainty on our part," President Zhelev said in reply to the  question if Zhirinovskiy's expulsion from Bulgaria was not  belated. "And yet Zhirinovskiy did a very good job, showing what  he really is; now that he has been expelled, no normal person  can suspect us of having some other considerations besides the  actual one. He is an inadequate politician who, wherever he  goes, is always getting into mischief," the Bulgarian president  went on to say.    Commenting on Zhirinovskiy's intentions to visit Bulgaria,  possibly in another capacity, next year again, Dr. Zhelev said  that this would be a political issue which the Bulgarian  institutions would have to decide. Having been expelled once,  he may be denied entry next time, Dr. Zhelev said.    Invited to say what his reaction would be should  Zhirinovskiy  win the Russian presidential election, Dr. Zhelev said: "There  is a lot of time until the presidential election, and in the  meantime the Constitution may change, there may be a number of  other elections, parliament may also change." Dr. Zhelev did  not rule out the possibility of the LDP reacting negatively to  its leader's statements.    Commenting on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statement that  Bulgaria  should regain Aegean Thrace and Macedonia, President Zhelev  recalled that before Zhirinovskiy, Hitler also wanted to give  Bulgaria those lands. The Bulgarian president described this  statement as funny because "he brought down a peg or two certain  Balkan politicians who have been trying to counter some sort of  local education based on Christianity, Eastern Orthodoxy,  Pan-Slavism and other anachronistic ideas to Europeanism,  Eurocentrism and the Euro-Atlantic structures." The path to  follow is unification with Europe, becoming an integral part of  Europe, and not inventing local structures like the ones we have  already had, but they all came to nothing," Dr. Zhelev stressed.  However, responding to another question, he said that NATO  could continue its existence only by turning into a system of  collective security, "otherwise sooner or later this will lead  to the establishment of other regional groups, blocs and  alliances because none of the former socialist countries has  reliable foreign political and military guarantees for its  security at the moment."    President Zhelev expressed his opinion that the LDP leader's  statements will by no means influence Bulgarian-Russian  relations or, if they have some effect, it will be rather  positive.    According to the Bulgarian president, what matters is not  Zhirinovskiy as an individual but Zhirinovskiy as a phenomenon  emerging in most Central and East European countries as a  logical consequence of the difficulties they face in the period  of transition. Zhelyu Zhelev, who wrote the book "Fascism" and  was awarded a Ph.D. degree for his dissertation on the  totalitarian state, expressed his fears that having won over the  masses with demagogic promises and coming to power, such an  individual would replace demagogy with dictatorship.    In my view, now that we are building democracy at the end  of the 20th century, our democracy has no right to be naive and  helpless as liberal democracy was at the beginning of the  century when it was so easily usurped by totalitarian  adventurers, the president said. In his opinion, "democracy at  the end of the 20th century should have all the antibodies  needed to counter all possible mutants and relapses of  totalitarianism -- both of a fascist or communist type."    "Producing those antibodies is a must and I think we will be  compelled to produce such antibodies to counter any possible  relapses of totalitarianism," Dr. Zhelev stressed.    The president said that the prosecutor's office in Bulgaria  should take action against Vuzrazhdane, a recently established  ultra-right organization led by Father Georgi Gelemenov who  declared his intention to persecute Gypsies and Bulgarian Turks.  "I think that the prosecutor's office should have taken action  against Gelemenov long ago because his statements run counter to  the Constitution, they are an open incitement to subversion and  violation of human and minority rights which is impermissible in  a democratic society," President Zhelev said, adding that "the  constitution, they are an open incitement to subversion and  violation of human and minority rights which is impermissible in  a democratic society," President Zhelev said, adding that "the  prosecutor's office should act very quickly and categorically."</p>

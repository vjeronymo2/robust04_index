			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Summary of implementation of the goals of "three, five, </F> eight, and 10": "Stride Forward Toward the Good Beginning of the  Magnificent Goal"]    [Text] If we say that Tianjin's development pace has  obviously accelerated since the commencement of reform and  opening up, then, the changes in the future will be even more  spectacular. When drawing the outlines of the magnificent  blueprint for striding forward toward the 21st century,  Tianjin's people have vividly summarized the blueprint as the  goals of "three, five, eight, and 10." That is, to quadruple  the 1980 GNP in 1997, three years ahead of schedule; to  basically complete the rebuilding of dangerous and shabby houses  in urban areas in five to seven years; to readjust and renovate  through grafting all large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises in about eight years; and to basically complete the  building of the new coastal area in about 10 years. At present,  the implementation of these four fighting goals are being  organized in a planned and step-by-step manner.  <H5>  The Demand of the Situation, and the Expectation of the </H5> People    The raising of these four fighting goals is not the  subjective assumption of a certain person or some persons, but  is the objective demand of Tianjin's development and the  expectation of Tianjin's people. The sixth municipal party  congress and the first session of the 12th municipal people's  congress, held last year, defined Tianjin's overall development  target and set forth the demand of using 20 years' endeavor to  make Tianjin one of the areas in China that basically realize  modernization and to build Tianjin into the commercial, trading,  and banking center of northern China, into a comprehensive  industrial base that is advanced in technology, and into a  modernized international big port city opened to all directions.  To this end, we must turn goals and tasks into specific actions  based on the analysis of Tianjin's situation and the overall  situation, must map out plans and arrangements for several  stages, and then carry out these plans and arrangements step by  step. The goals of "three, five, eight, and 10" have been  defined around the fulfillment of the overall target after many  investigations and appraisals were conducted. These four goals  are internally connected with one another and affect and  supplement each other. In the overall plot of the acceleration  of Tianjin's development, we have given prominence to  appropriately handling the relations between existing  enterprises and new enterprises. On the one hand, we have  stressed the endeavor of invigorating existing enterprises and  grasping the readjustment and renovation of old enterprises;  and, on the other hand, we have stressed the necessity of  cultivating new and major economic growing points. In the  economic layout, we have stressed the development of new areas  and the rebuilding of old areas. In the priorities of  development, we have given prominence to invigorating large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises and developing rural  economy. In the relations between production and livelihood, we  have defined the necessity of regarding the improvement of the  people's living standards as the starting point and the ending  point of all work on the basis of developing production.    Being examined and approved by the municipal people's  congress last March, these four goals have evoked strong  repercussions among Tianjin's people, and the vast numbers of  cadres and the masses have been inspired by these goals. Most  people maintain that these four goals are not only realistic but  also press the people to forge ahead; and these four goals are  not only the demand of the situation but also the expectation  and the voice of the vast numbers of the masses. Many people  say that all localities in the country are now vying with one  another in developing themselves, Tianjin, as a municipality,  should be even more rapid in the pace of carrying out reform,  opening up, and economic construction. We have the wish and the  vigor to let our hometown develop at an even faster pace and  become even more beautiful. These four goals have let us catch  sight of hopes and have a bright prospect. In particular, the  goal of rebuilding all dangerous and shabby houses in five to  seven years has enjoyed popular support and become the central  topic talked by the people at streets and lanes. As said by the  common people, "there is no need to enter the 21st century by  living in old and shabby houses built in the thirties and  forties."  <H5>  Drawing the Concerted Efforts of All Fronts </H5>   Realizing these four fighting goals is a grand, huge project  all fronts should make concerted efforts to realize these goals.  To this end, the municipal government has exerted great  efforts and strengthened the organizational leadership over the  realization of these goals. A leading group for realizing these  four goals has been organized with Mayor Zhang Lichang as its  head. This leading group has four subteams with responsible  vice mayors as their heads and relevant commission, bureau,  district, and county responsible persons as their members.  Offices subordinate to the subteams have been established to  take charge of day-to-day investigations, coordination, and  supervisions. So far, four subteams have convened meetings on  several occasions, defined overall plans and annual plans for  implementing these four goals, also divided the tasks among each  level, set up a system for assessment of targets, and done their  best to firmly attend to the implementation of these goals. For  instance, the subteam of the new coastal area emphatically  studied the plan of the key coastal development area and defined  the dividing lines of the new coastal area. The new coastal  area covers five districts (including Tanggu, Hangu, Dagang, and  parts of Dongli and Jinnan), and 20 townships. It occupies an  area of 350.36 square kilometers. This area is a new rising  area whose prospects for economic development are greater than  any other areas in Tianjin as well as one with the highest  degree of opening up, the widest coverage of policies, and the  best infrastructural facilities. The new coastal area will  develop 188 square kilometers in the next 10 years or by 2003.  At that time, its gross domestic product and foreign export  value will account for 40 percent, respectively, of the  municipality's total. This year, its GNP will increase by over  20 percent and surpass the growth rate of the municipality. So  far, the construction of some key projects is in full swing.  The 140,000-ton ethylene, 200,000-ton polyester, Jinnan-Hangu  highway, and Dagang-Tanggu highway projects are under full  construction. The pre-phase preparatory work for the Beitang  power plant, the project for diverting Luanhe water to Hangu,  and the third coal gas plant is in full swing and these projects  are being listed for examinations and approvals. Tianjin Harbor  is accelerating its construction pace and is to obtain a  capacity of annually transporting 500,000 standard containers to  foreign countries and to possess 40 million tons of loading and  unloading capacity. The development zone should continue to  keep the leading positions in the whole country in terms of the  fulfillment of its targets. In the first five months of this  year, the development zone made new headway in inviting  businessmen and bringing in capital. A total of 233  foreign-funded enterprises of three types have been approved.  The investment in these enterprises totals $747 million. The  investment scale of the projects averages at $3,056,400.    The municipal economic, commercial, and communications  committees conducted deep and thorough investigations on  readjustment and transformation of old enterprises with foreign  capital, worked out specific plans for transforming state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises step-by-step, and also  prefulfilled the tasks for readjustment and transformation with  foreign capital in the next five years. Of the municipality's  748 state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises, 214 should  fulfill the tasks for readjustment and transformation with  foreign capital this year and 143 should fill the tasks next  year. That is, 48 percent of the large and medium-sized  enterprises should be transformed in 1994 and 1995. The  municipal economic committee urged that through grafting  readjustment and transformation, 318 large and medium-sized  enterprises should realize the quadrupling tasks three years  ahead of schedule. In 1997, the total industrial output value  should reach 74.59 billion yuan and the profits and taxes  realized by the industrial enterprises should reach 10.27  billion yuan, respectively, increasing by more than 600 percent  and 400 percent over 1980. The grafting readjustment and  transformation of the commercial department's 80 large and  medium-sized enterprises are under smooth progress. Ten joint  ventures have made preliminary achievements in grafting  transformation, 11 enterprises have made progress in  readjustment and transformation, and the reconstruction and  expansion of nine large-sized retail sales shopping centers are  under full swing.  <H5>  Implement These Goals Step by Step To Achieve Initial Results </H5>   The key to realizing the four goals is to do a good job in  taking the first step and to have a high starting point. If we  do a good job in the first year, we may enhance the spirit,  boost morale, and lay a foundation for future development. To  realize the goal of quadrupling the GNP three years ahead of  schedule, from 1993 to 1997, we must increase the municipality's  GNP at an annual progressive rate of over 11 percent, and this  year we plan to increase the GNP by 12 percent. This requires  our efforts to conscientiously grasp well all quarterly and  monthly economic tasks. Judging from the operational situation  of this year's first quarter, the development rate and  efficiency were fairly good. The whole municipality's GNP  reached 15.415 billion yuan, up 12.4 percent over the same  period last year, thus attaining the required progress. Of  this, 296 million yuan came from the primary industry, up 4.4  percent; 9.72 billion yuan came from the secondary industry, up  12.1 percent; and 5.399 billion yuan came from the tertiary  industry, up 13.5 percent. From January to May, the total  output value of industrial units at and above the township level  across the municipality reached 37.669 billion yuan, up 16.6  percent over the same period last year.    The project of renovating slum houses that draws the  attention of the people across the municipality has been  smoothly carried out. The municipal leading comrades have  traveled to the construction sites to give work guidance and  help solve problems on many occasions. Six districts in the  municipality have taken quick actions, grasped this work firmly,  done solid work, actively collected construction funds, expanded  the strength to invite business and introduce capital, and  unceasingly accelerated the progress of renovating slum houses.  From January to May, the municipality as a whole demolished a  large area of slum houses totalling 520,000 square meters, built  houses covering an area of 4.29 million square meters, completed  the construction of 438,000 square meters of houses, and enabled  10,019 residents to move into new houses.    On the basis of sizing up the real situation, industrial  enterprises have accelerated the pace in grafting, readjustment,  and transformation of old enterprises. They signed 66 contracts  on utilization of foreign capital from January to April. The  total volume of contracted investments reached $448 million,  and the volume of contracted foreign capital reached $251  million. Of this, 53 items were on grafting and transformation  of old enterprises with foreign capital, the total volume of  contracted investments reached $396 million, and the volume of  contracted foreign capital reached $214 million.    A good development trend has emerged in the construction of  a  new seaside area. At present, the whole line of the Tianjin  Port-Tanggu highway has been initiated. Most of the earthwork of  the Tianjin section of the Shanhaiguan-Guangzhou highway has  been completed. The Xinhua Road overpass in Tanggu is expected  to open to traffic by the end of June. Construction of a heat  and power plant and a water plant in the development zone is in  full swing. The Nanjiang bridge project at the port area is  progressing smoothly. The intangible conditions for building the  polluted water disposal center are being strengthened, and the  pre-phase preparatory work for building the energy wharf has  been comprehensively carried out.    We will sow what we reap. This year's opening situation is  quite good and the trend is excellent. We are convinced that as  long as the higher and the lower levels across the municipality  work with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and make  indomitable and unremitting efforts, we will surely attain the  "3.5.8.10" fighting goal on time or ahead of schedule, and  Tianjin will surely have a more brilliant future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a statement to our reporters today, Democratic  Party [PD] Chairman Petre Roman referred to the recent  government reshuffle, expressing his disappointment that it had  been done without first consulting with the other political  forces and, especially, without first consulting with  parliament. The reshuffle was done in this way despite the fact  that lately the government party and the other parliamentary  parties had been engaged in a dialogue, Roman said. Such  consultations would have been necessary, he assessed, as some of  the offices subjected to the reshuffle are important for our  national interests.    Regarding the talks conducted by PD representatives with the  leaders of PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], Roman said  that actually they were discussions rather than negotiations  merely intended to clear up certain things. However,  consultations and the dialogue have to be continued in order to  concretely solve the problems and sorrows of the people.    The PD leader said that the current government seems to be  detached from reality, which is a serious matter, considering  the way the people's problems and sorrows have accumulated.  Those who bear high responsibility in our society ought to show  interest for all such problems, Roman pointed out, saying that  the time is ripe for a program of hope and confidence.</p>

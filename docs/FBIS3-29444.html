			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. Government has announced that it has  decided to begin taking the process of slapping sanctions on  Japan in connection with the issue of increasing U.S. mobile and  car phone manufacturers' access to the Japanese market. In  response, Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and  telecommunications, issued on the morning of 16 February a  statement saying, "Japan has scrupulously observed an agreement  concluded between Japan and the United States, and I regret the  U.S. Government's decision." In the statement, the minister  also said, "If the United States imposes sanctions on Japan,  Japan will deal with the sanctions in accordance with GATT's  rules." In this way, he indicated that Japan will not hesitate  to take its case to GATT. Meanwhile, the U.S. Government is  reportedly studying the possibility of slapping more sanctions  on Japan following the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework  talks. In his statement, Mr. Kanzaki expressed his vigilance  about the move by the U.S. Government, saying, "Although I  cannot clearly anticipate what sort of sanctions the U.S.  Government is planning to impose on Japan, the U.S. Government  will undoubtedly take a tough stand on trade toward Japan."    The posts and telecommunications minister in his statement  stressed that the Japanese Government has fulfilled its side of  the Japanese-U.S. agreement on mobile phones by taking the  necessary steps, including allotting frequencies to U.S. firms,  and he said that the U.S. Government's reason for imposing  sanctions on Japan is not justified.    A government source indicated on the morning of 16 February,  "Japan has been doing what it has to do, and I believe that U.S.  firms' business efforts probably have been inadequate." The  Japanese Government is poised to wait and observe future  developments for the time being, saying, "It is hard to take any  action until the sanctions to be imposed on Japan by the U.S.  Government come to light." The Japanese Government, however,  intends to take Japan's case to GATT if the U.S. Government  imposes sanctions on Japan. Some government officials take the  view that "If the Japanese Government takes Japan's case to GATT  to argue with the U.S. Government at the GATT's arbitration  panel, it is clear that the U.S. Government has no justified  counterarguments and that the U.S. Government may not actually  impose sanctions on Japan."</p>

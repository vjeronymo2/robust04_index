			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Congratulations to the Yemenis... </F> Congratulations to King Husayn"]    [Text] Yesterday, when the Yemeni brothers signed the  document of pledge and accord, the Arabs experienced one of the  brightest moments in recent times, and Jordanians witnessed a  historic and dear event not experienced for a long time. Under  the patronage of the great Hashemite leader, the Yemenis have  thus turned a page and opened a new and glorious chapter in  Yemen's modern history.    The signing ceremony held at sunset on 10 Ramadan was a rare  scene in this nation's life. This nation followed the  proceedings, carried live, while dearly hoping that all Arab  issues will be resolved through dialogue, reconciliation, and  accord. The nation also hopes that this reconciliation will  create a new Arab tradition for resolving problems and settling  disputes.    The ceremony which ended the political crisis in fraternal  Yemen has tangibly highlighted this nation's ability to overcome  its difficulties and crises when there is solid will, good  intentions, and sincere efforts aimed only at securing the  nation's interest and effecting Arab unity in the face of all  elements of estrangement and division.    Thus, we view what happened at King Husayn's house, the  Arabs' great house, as a praiseworthy turning point not only in  the course of a crisis that concerns the brothers in happy  Yemen, but also in this nation's situation. This nation has  discovered a successful mode of action which, together with  sincere efforts, may ultimately end the numerous seditions.  Such seditions can only be overcome through dialogue, openness,  and reconciliation, similar to this wonderful Yemeni model.    Such a great historic Yemeni event provides an opportunity  to  warmly congratulate our brothers in Yemen on this great national  achievement, and also to extend congratulations, coupled with  appreciation, to His Majesty King Husayn, whose sincere efforts  and high Arab and Islamic status have largely contributed to  realizing this achievement. This Yemeni domestic event has  turned into a great pan-Arab celebration that translates the  Hashemite conscience's deep yearning for Arab unity and pride  and for establishing a new modern pan-Arab entity.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Investors remain cautious on equities LONDON STOCKS were squeezed yesterday between a New York market struggling around new highs and a growing lack of enthusiasm for buying UK stocks at current levels. Equity volume improved but with Wall Street battling to hold on to the Dow 3,000 range as it entered the new session the UK market closed on the downside. The reduction in the US trade deficit for February had little effect on the London market, which was taking its cue from Wall Street's reaction. Share prices closed above the day's lows, however, after Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, reiterated his confidence in an upturn in the UK economy during the second half of the year. His statement followed disclosure that March unemployment figures for the UK showed the sharpest monthly rise for 20 years, and indicated strong recessionary pressure on the British economy. Equities opened higher in response to Wall Street's move above Dow 3,000 overnight. But the day's high, a gain of 8.5 on the Footsie, was reached very early and prices soon began to melt away in the absence of institutional support. The UK employment data was unhelpful, but it was uncertainty about the outlook for Wall Street that unsettled London in early afternoon, turning the market down by ten Footsie points. In the event Wall Street looked uncertain in early trade, and showed a fall of a couple of points on the Dowas London closed for the day. At its final reading the FT-SE Index was 6.6 off at 2,538.4, some seven points below its all-time peak. Seaq volume increased smartly after Mr Lamont's encouraging statement to record a total of 798.1m shares for the session, compared with only 481.1m on the previous day. London Stock Exchange data confirmed that daily retail volume in equities has fallen this week, with Tuesday's session recording only Pounds 805.9m. This is an unsettling development for UK securities houses - some have been forced to make further cuts in staff levels despite recovery in average daily retail turnover to above the Pounds 1bn figure. There were further indications yesterday of uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the UK market. Both Samuel Montagu and Nomura Research Institute Europe expressed concern about the outlook for sterling. Montagu predicted that sterling would 'plunge' this summer on prospects of a general election in the UK, weakness in the German mark and domestic pressures for lower interest rates. Nomura Research was more cautious, commenting merely that this week's trend insterling indicated a possiblefurther erosion in its value. The market took aboard a Pounds 128m bid in the brewery sector, but the much bigger bid said to be overhanging the market failed to materialise yesterday. Speculation of a takeover move on a grand scale continued to circulate, however. The rights issue calendar, too, continued to produce only minor moves in the shape of cash calls yesterday for a further Pounds 187m from Slough Estates and David S. Smith, the packaging group. Despite Wall Street's strength overnight the international blue chips recorded mixed changes. Oil stocks remained unsettled as crude oil prices churned around the Dollars 19 a barrel mark. North Sea exploration stocks, which are more directly influenced by crude oil prices, also weakened yesterday.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cover-up on the beach Sir, Your entertaining article on worldwide beach fashion ('Art of wearing very little', March 5/6) was spoilt by a serious omission. Germans may be covered up in the Baltics, but in the Balearics they are more or less totally uncovered - and the larger they are, the less they wear. It becomes rather over-powering by the end of the season] Erica de Graaff-Hunter, Cala Gas, 07590 Cala Ratjada, Majorca</p>

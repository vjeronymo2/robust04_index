			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Home and Community-Based Services Waivers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary to waive certain Medicaid statutory requirements to enable a State to cover a broad array of home and community-based services. Coverage of these services enables elderly, disabled, and chronically ill persons, who would otherwise be institutionalized, to live in the community. Section 1915(c) specifies the services that may be covered, the conditions for granting waivers, and the provisions governing the scope of services under waivers. Section 1915(c) was added to title XIX of the Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA '81), Public Law 97&hyph;35, to encourage the provision of services to Medicaid recipients in noninstitutional settings. Prior to the enactment of OBRA '81, the Medicaid program provided limited coverage for long-term care services in noninstitutional settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State may request approval by HCFA of waivers under section 1915(c) to provide home and community-based services that are not otherwise available to certain recipients under the State's Medicaid plan. These services must be furnished in accordance with an individual written plan of care subject to approval by the State's Medicaid agency and may be furnished only if the individual would otherwise require the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR and if the costs are reimbursable under the State's plan. (The original statute specified SNF or ICF. OBRA '87 struck out SNF or ICF and substituted NF or ICF/MR.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing regulations governing home and community based services under waivers under section 1915(c) appear in various sections of 42 CFR parts 435, 440, and 441. This final rule with comment period contains regulations which amend each of these three parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the enactment of COBRA, a waiver granted under section 1915(c) of the Act allowed a State to receive Federal financial participation (FFP) for the following services as home and community-based services: case management services, homemaker/home health aide services, personal care services, adult day health services, habilitation services, respite care, and ``other'' services as requested by the State and approved by the Secretary. Section 9502(a) of COBRA revised section 1915(c) of the Act to explicitly include certain prevocational, supported employment, and educational services as habilitation services under home and community-based services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Habilitation services are authorized by section 1915(b)(4) of the Act and defined in section 1915(c)(5)(A) of the Act, as amended by section 9502 of COBRA, as services designed to assist individuals in acquiring, retaining, and improving the self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to reside successfully in home and community-based settings. Section 9502(a) of COBRA also added new sections 1915(c)(5) (B) and (C) to the Act that allow a State to request HCFA's approval to include certain additional services previously excluded from coverage in its definition of ``habilitation services'' for individuals who receive waiver services after discharge from a NF or ICF/MR. Sections 1915(c)(5) (B) and (C) provide that habilitation services include prevocational, educational, and supported employment services, but do not include_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Special education and related services, as defined in section 602 (16) and (17) of the 1975 Amendments to the Education of the Handicapped Act (Public Law 94&hyph;142, now located at 20 U.S.C. 1401 (16) and (17)), that are otherwise available to the individual through a local educational agency; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Intel cloning tussle begins to warm up TEXAS Instruments has intervened in the legal battle over Intel's efforts to prevent 'cloning' of its top selling microprocessors, which form the 'brains' of IBM-compatible personal computers. TI's entry into the fray appears likely to pit two of the largest US chip makers against one another in the widening legal battles surrounding the multi-billion dollar market. TI's intervention stems from patent infringement suits filed a week ago by Intel against Chips &amp; Technologies, a supplier of semiconductor devices for personal computers. In its suits, the latest in a barrage of litigation surrounding Intel's top selling '386' microprocessor, Intel alleges that a new version of the 386 violates several Intel patents. Intel is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent C&amp;T from transferring the microprocessor technology to any third party. Chips subcontracts production of these devices to Texas Instruments, one of the largest US chip makers. Texas Instruments has a broad patent cross-licensing agreement with Intel that covers, among others, the patents in dispute in Intel's suit against Chips, which Chips maintains provides a 'complete defence' against Intel's allegations.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: The brighter side of bank charges - Serious Money IT NOW looks inevitable that banks will reintroduce charges for those customers who are in credit. Abbey National said this week that the move was likely within a few months. The banks have been nervously following a 'you first' approach to the issue. Rather like the process of pre-Budget speculation about tax increases, the hope may be that repeated airing of the prospect of change may diminish the protests when change actually occurs. The industry seems to be edging towards a flat monthly fee plus additional charges for items such a stopped cheques. Chances are that the market will fragment, with some groups offering 'free' banking to those who agree to keep high minimum balances. Given the current low levels of interest rates, it may be worth keeping a high float to avoid the charges. If rates were to go back above 10 per cent, then it would be a tricky calculation as to whether the interest foregone on the float (if the same sum were kept in a savings account) outweighed the charges. Every week, our highest rates for your money table, produced by Moneyfacts, gives details of high interest cheque accounts. The Chelsea Building Society, for example, pays 6.1 per cent on those willing to keep a minimum of Pounds 2,500 in their accounts. Some of these accounts cannot be used for day-to-day dealings. For example, Fidelity's cash unit trust gives a chequebook to those with more than Pounds 5,000, but cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250. So one strategy could be to pay for as much as possible by credit card, and then pay off the bill each month with a cheque out of a high interest account. Charging tends to be a subject on which some people feel a sense of moral outrage, perhaps because of the perception that banks are making their customers pay for their mistakes in other areas such as property lending. But banks, like any other business, will charge what they can get away with in the market. The only solution for aggrieved bank account holders is to be as adept at shopping around as building society depositors. When Save &amp; Prosper introduced a monthly charge on balances below Pounds 1,000, it found that 5,000 of the 6,000 customers affected closed their accounts. Admittedly, it is more of a hassle switching bank accounts than it is moving your savings, given all those direct debits which have to be changed. The best deals are likely to come from those institutions with the lowest costs, ie those which have not invested vast amounts of capital in a branch network. Inevitably there will be some depositors who find they need the convenience of their branch and who decide, however reluctantly, to put up with the charges. For the rest, it may be time to recognise that there is no need to have an account with one of the big high street names. Other institutions may have a service which suits your needs better, or perhaps, as with First Direct, you may simply need to move to a different part of the same institution. There are dangers in moving to a less well-known institution - remember BCCI. But bank charges may be the alarm call which investors need to alert them to the services they have been missing. Investment trust groups are exploiting the sector's recently revived popularity to raise new funds. Three particular areas of investment have been attracting money: smaller companies, emerging markets and Japan. Smaller companies are thought to be due for a revival after suffering from the recession; emerging markets, it is argued, have greater prospects for economic and corporate profit growth; and Japan has rebounded sharply from the lows it reached last year. In the small company field, there are issues from CW Asset Management (a vehicle for Peter Webb, who used to run Thornton's smaller companies unit trust) and a second indexed fund from Hoare Govett. In emerging markets, following a spate of offers from existing trusts earlier in the year, John Govett is launching a fund. And both Dunedin and Perpetual are floating Japanese trusts. There is a natural temptation for small investors to opt to buy shares in new trust issues. Perhaps this is because it is easier to pick one new trust than to choose from hundreds of existing funds. And it may be that managers do better if they start with a clean slate. But there are drawbacks to new issue investment. The costs involved in a new issue often eat up 3 to 4 per cent of the launch capital, so that the investor is nearly always buying shares at a premium. Given that it is possible to buy shares in an existing trust, which have a published performance record, at a discount, a new issue is automatically 'expensive'. One strategy might be to wait for the trust to launch and fall to a discount before buying. Of course, if every investor used this tactic, no new trusts would be created. Most trust launches now use devices to try to get round the discount problem  -warrants, a limited life or a split capital structure. Nevertheless, if you really want to invest in a particular area, it may be worth seeing if there are well-established trusts available at a discount before taking the plunge.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Groznyy may demand the restoration of the USSR if  Moscow keeps saying the Chechen republic is part of Russia, a  member of President Dzhokhar Dudayev's staff told Interfax.  According to the same source the former Soviet leaders would be  invited to Groznyy for consultations on the issue.    A senior presidential spokesman said the Chechen leaders  recognized the legitimacy and legal acts of only the Soviet  Union. "As for the legitimacy of the Belovezh agreements that  caused the USSR to fall apart, the Chechen leaders have big  doubts about them", the source told Interfax. "The Chechen  people have the full right to this, because when for the first  time in their history they took part in the referendum on  preserving the USSR, they voted "yes"."    "If Russia, which does not have a legal reason for  statements  that Chechnya is a member of the Russian Federation, keeps  saying so, Groznyy will reserve the right to call in question  the legitimacy of the Russian Federation and its leaders", the  senior source at the Chechen presidential staff said.</p>

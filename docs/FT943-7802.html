			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Who pays the bill? I have received from my solicitor the draft of a trust deed setting up an interest-in-possession trust. My son and daughter are the immediate sole beneficiaries for their lifetimes, sharing the income but leaving the capital (including capital gains) intact. They are to be followed by my two grand-daughters, on the same terms. In the matter of inheritance tax, my solicitor now tells me that 'a person who has the right to income arising from a trust fund (or the right to the use of it, if it consists of, say, property or chattels) is treated as owning the trust fund, and it is taxed on his or her death as if it were part of his or her overall estate.' Is this correct? And, if so, who pays the tax? My solicitor now suggests that I should consider switching (with a very big increase in his fee) to a discretionary trust, but I do not wish to do this unless there are really good reasons. Your solicitor is correct in that, if your children have an equal life interest in the trust fund, then 50 per cent of the value of that trust fund will be held in their respective estates. If you survive for seven years from having made the gift to the trust, then there will be no inheritance tax on your death. On the death of each respective child, their respective estates will bear the inheritance tax on the underlying value of the fund at that time. Your children have the ability to relinquish their life interest so that the assets pass down a generation at some future time. I am not sure a transfer of the trust fund into a discretionary settlement would be appropriate, but I would need to know much more about the situation to advise further.

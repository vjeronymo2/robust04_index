			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sedat Sertoglu: "An Appalling Trap for Turkey"] </F>   [Text] Several groups in Europe, which are supported by  pro-Greek-Cypriot and pro-Armenian elements in the U.S. Congress  and Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand, have put into effect a very  dangerous plan, which can fragment Turkey. These groups, which  have not been effective enough in their initiatives in Europe,  have managed to raise the Kurdish problem in Washington. In  fact, they have already made several initiatives to influence  the U.S. Congress and the newspapers. Several U.S. officials  have already cautioned Ankara on the plan to divide Turkey. The  Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have launched an effort to  have the necessary measures put into effect against the new plan.    According to the experts, the plan, which has been drawn up  by several groups that support the Greek Cypriots, Armenians,  and the Kurds, is as follows: The United States will be  frequently informed that Turkey's military operations against  the PKK are aimed against the entire Kurdish people in that  country. Turkey will be accused of committing an act of  genocide against all the Kurds. Speakers will be selected to  address the U.S. Congress commissions and international  platforms on the matter. That will create a wave of pressure  against the Clinton administration. Next will be a move by  those who are aware that Turkey will not hold talks with PKK  leader Abdullah Ocalan, to persuade that organization to reduce  its terrorist activities and publish bulletins to defend its  case. The PKK bulletins will be similar to those the PLO  published in the past.  <H5>  New Headquarters </H5>   The next step will be an effort to find a country that will  agree to host Abdullah Ocalan and his organization. An effort  is being made at the present time to determine whether or not  the PKK can be moved, as in the case of the PLO moving its  headquarters to Tunisia after the defeat it suffered in Lebanon  in the past. Two reasons have been given for that. The first  is that the PKK will not be able to remain in Damascus after  Syria and Israel conclude a peace agreement and the second is  that Saddam Husayn will not agree to allow Ocalan and his  organization to remain in Iraq because he eagerly waits for the  embargo to be lifted. The experts have said that several  initiatives have been made to find a new host country for the  PKK either in north Africa or in Europe.    As soon as Ocalan and the PKK are transferred to a new  country, the Western capitals, Washington in particular, will  direct pressure on Ankara to force it to hold talks with Ocalan,  who will have assumed a position similar to that of 'Arafat.  Ankara will be informed that Ocalan is no longer involved in  terrorist activities.    Meanwhile, the architects of that appalling plan will make  every effort to disrupt relations between Ankara and Washington.  They will use every opportunity to create friction between  Turkey and the United States in the foreign policy domain.  Furthermore, they will try to create a reaction in the U.S.  public opinion against Turkey.    Considering all that, the experts have warned Ankara to be  very careful.</p>

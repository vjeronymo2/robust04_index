			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 14 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian Government  reiterates Bulgaria's hope to be granted full membership in the  European Union [EU]. Bulgaria is ready to make the required  representations as soon as the prerequisites for that have been  created, says a declaration of the Council of Ministers adopted  today.    The document states the resolution of the Bulgarian  Government to do its best and accelerate this process, proceed  with the reforms and create the necessary economic, legislative  and other conditions for Bulgaria's full integration into the EU.

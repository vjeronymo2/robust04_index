			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Braslia loses Battle of the Zeros BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco yesterday conceded defeat in the Battle of the Zeros and signed a decree cutting three noughts from the country's inflation-battered cruzeiro, changing its name to the 'real cruzeiro'. The move comes as a relief to a population whose mental skills have been stretched to the limits by the present exchange rate of about 75,000 cruzeiros to the dollar. The digits involved in even basic sums do not fit on calculators, causing havoc in the financial sector. Even the low paid are receiving monthly wage packets in millions of cruzeiros; a Big Mac hamburger costs Cr200,000, a basic television Cr30m and buying the cheapest new car requires well over Cr1bn. The announcement, signalling the fourth currency change in seven years, came as a surprise. Mr Franco has always been firmly against the idea, once saying: 'The last thing poor Brazilians need is to see their money devalued'. He even sacked his last but one finance minister in February for having the audacity to announce that he wished to cut three zeros from the currency. Since then the president has presumably been won over by the central bank, which long ago ran out of famous Brazilians to put on bank notes, resorting to Amazonian fishes (there are 2,000 varieties). As news of the change spread yesterday, critics accused the government of cosmetic measures to disguise inflation, which is forecast to top 34 per cent a month in August. The main television channels ran warnings that the removal of three zeros from prices did not mean the items had become cheaper. Unlike previous changes the announcement of the new currency is not to be accompanied by an economic shock package or banking holiday, both of which have become taboo following the failure of previous economic plans. However, the new real cruzeiro, following the country's economic Truth Plan announced in May, could prove to be an unfortunate choice of name. There is no sign of economic stability despite the best efforts of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the new finance minister. With presidential and congressional elections due next year the national mint is likely to be busier than ever. The changes to the currency are due to come into force on Monday. The Cr5m note, due to appear in September and decorated with a nameless cowboy, is expected to be scrapped. But with inflation running at 1,500 per cent a year and rising, it should not be too long before Brazilians are all big-spending millionaires once again.</p>

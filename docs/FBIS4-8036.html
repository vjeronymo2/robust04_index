			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.W.: "Six Years for Adaptation of Standards; </F> Poland Submitted Application for EU Membership"]    [Text] The official application for Poland's  membership in the European Union [EU], which was submitted in  Athens on Friday [8 April], was accepted positively by EU  Council Chairman Theodoros Pangalos. This is what Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski told journalists upon his return  from Greece. According to Olechowski, the year 2000 is a  possible date for our country's acceptance into EU.    "The Government of the Polish Republic hereby has the honor  of submitting an application for the Polish Republic's  membership in the EU, based on Article 0 [as published] of the  EU Treaty, and also to inform that Poland is ready to begin  negotiations at an appropriate time, concerning its joining EU."  Such is the wording of the document signed by [Prime Minister]  Waldemar Pawlak. The application was submitted in the presence  of Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the government's plenipotentiary for  European Integration, and Jan Borkowski, chairman of the Sejm  Commission for the European Treaty. "Either a big storm and a  big legacy will come out of this little application or nothing  will come out," said the chief diplomat.    The Polish application will be debated along with Hungary's  at the next session of the EU Council of Ministers on 18 April,  after which it will be submitted to the European Commission,  which will render its opinion. According to A. Olechowski, the  process of rendering an opinion on the document may take as long  as three years. This means that formal negotiations concerning  membership will begin in about the year 2000, while the process  of adapting Polish realities to meet EU legal and economic  requirements will take between five and 10 years.    "Russia should be a member of the G-7 group and should have  its own strategic agreement with NATO, but it should not be  linked to the `Partnership for Peace' program." This is how  Olechowski commented on a statement made Friday by Vyacheslav  Kostikov, Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, when Kostikov stated  that Russia would like to combine its joining the "Partnership"  program with its joining the group of the seven most  industrialized countries of the world.</p>

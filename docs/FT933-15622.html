			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / People: Emmott's surprise departure from Morrisons Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based superstore chain, announced yesterday that Bob Emmott, joint deputy managing director, had resigned from the company to 'pursue an alternative career'. Martin Ackroyd, finance director, explains that Emmott's resignation had been accepted after he sent in a letter late on Tuesday. But mystery surrounds his future plans. Ackroyd says Morrisons has 'no idea' what Emmott intended to do next, and Emmott himself could not be reached at his home yesterday. There was speculation inside the company that he had left to join another retailer. Ken Morrison, company chairman, says he regretted the departure of a man he had worked closely with since he joined the company in the late 1960s and who had played an 'increasingly important role', culminating in his appointment to the board in 1987, and eventually as joint deputy managing director. Morrisons, which operates 59 superstores mainly in the north of England and was named the UK's top-performing company last year by the Institute of Directors, insisted there had been no disagreement with Emmott, and relations had remained amicable.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGE SMOKE DETECTOR BATTERIES  </P> <P> One of modern technology's more common items, the smoke detector, is being  ignored by many owners, often to their peril.  </P> <P> Non-working smoke detectors contribute to as many as 6,000 fire-related deaths  and 130,000 injuries each year, according to Change Your Clock, Change Your  Battery, a cooperative campaign sponsored by the International Assn. of Fire  Chiefs, the American Burn Assn. and Eveready Battery Co.  </P> <P> They hope that tying in the ritual of time change Oct. 28 with the routine of  changing batteries will increase the number of working smoke alarms and  emergency flashlights. The group estimates that 50% of home smoke alarms now  are useless because of old or missing batteries. And without working  flashlights, the difficulty of locating safe, swift exits in night fire  situations increases.  </P> <P> Besides this annual routine, checking the batteries with the test button at  least once a month is recommended.  </P></p>

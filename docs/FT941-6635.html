			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Intrastat system criticised - In a Nutshell Senior managers of exporting companies spend as much as 10 hours a month filling out intrastat returns for HM Customs, according to a survey by Community Network Services. All companies with exports and imports - or what are now called arrivals and despatches from the EU - of more than Pounds 140,000 are required to fill in the returns. But since intrastat was introduced at the start of 1993, the system has been criticised for under-estimating the volume of UK imports. Some analysts, such as UBS's Bill Martin, say the import figures are as much as 50 per cent adrift. Now it appears the system is also eating into the time that managements could be spending developing their businesses. The returns are often filled out by management accountants, company secretaries or financial controllers. However, according to CNS, which offers a software package to help put together the intrastat data, only 9 per cent of companies submit returns by floppy disk and only 4 per cent used a modem or another form of electronic data interchange. The rest submitted their returns on paper. CNS. Tel 0489 589922</p>

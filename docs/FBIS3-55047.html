If one or all  of the culprits is found guilty by that court, the execution of  the sentence should be carried out by Moldova. Radio Rossii,  which broadcast the news, mentioned that the Tiraspol  authorities favor the CSCE suggestion, provided that Russia, a  country that enjoys the confidence of the Dniester leaders,  should vouch for the independence of the court.    The CSCE Mission in Moldova has also warned against the  perils of using the Ilascu case for political purposes.    A commentary broadcast last night by BBC cites, among other  things, a statement by Mr. Pavel Barbalat, the chairman of the  Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Moldova, that he had  not been briefed on the CSCE recommendations and that the  Moldovan party would refuse such a formula. In this way  [Dniester leader Grigore] Maracuta, Mr. Barbalat assessed,  merely wishes to have the legality of his office confirmed,  although he had assumed that office arbitrarily. The sole  solution to the problem would be the unconditional transfer of  the prisoners from Tiraspol to Chisinau, as otherwise there are  no guarantees that in the future other separatist forces would  not stage a new trial and then ask for a three-party trial of  the case.    Also according to the BBC, Mr. Dumitru Postovan, the chief  prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova, has also stated in turn  that he has no knowledge about any such suggestion by the CSCE  Mission.</p>

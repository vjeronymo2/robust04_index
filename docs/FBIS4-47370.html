			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. I. Morozova, Geology and Geophysics </F> Institute, Uzbek Academy of Sciences; UDC 551.590.2]    [Abstract] The dynamics of appearance of linear cloud  elements over faults after nuclear explosions at test sites in  Kazakhstan and in China in 1988, 1989 and 1990 is examined. The  study involved an analysis of NOAA meteorological space  photographs at 1:25 000 000. A seismotectonic approach was used  as the basis for this research. During this period there were  ten nuclear tests in Kazakhstan and two in China. The distance  between these test sites was 1200 km. In three cases there were  no cloud lineaments because it was clear weather, in a fourth  case there was a negative result, but in the other six cases,  each of which is described in detail, there was a significant  correlation between the nuclear shots and presence of cloud  lineaments. A comparison of the times of appearance of cloud  lineaments after explosions in Kazakhstan and China shows that  in China the atmospheric reaction to the explosions began  earlier -- after eight minutes and after three hours, whereas in  Kazakhstan it was after four hours. Cloud lineaments did not  appear over the Kazakh test site on the first space photographs  after a nuclear explosion. This is possibly not because of  atmospheric conditions, but because of different crustal  viscosity and elasticity. A figure accompanying the text shows  the propagation of disturbances along faults from the test  sites. The energy of the Semipalatinsk shots is propagated over  an area of 300 000 square kilometers, whereas that from the  Chinese shots extends over an area of 200 000 square kilometers.  It is concluded that the propagation of disturbances from  nuclear explosions can be traced along faults from the dynamics  of the linear cloud anomalies above the latter.

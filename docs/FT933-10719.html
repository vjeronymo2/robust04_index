			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Decision time in Mideast 'fast approaching' MR WARREN Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday said that the violence in southern Lebanon last week had illustrated the price of failure to make progress in the Middle East peace talks. He warned the participants that 'decision time is rapidly approaching'. Speaking in Alexandria after a two-hour meeting with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the secretary of state said the intense Israeli shelling of southern Lebanon and Hizbollah's raids into northern Israel had served as a 'reminder to all parties that the Arab-Israeli negotiations can quickly deteriorate if we do not take this moment for peacemaking'. Mr Christopher's warning appears designed to put pressure on all participants to the talks - Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians - not to allow the Israeli bombardment to preclude immediate movement in the deadlocked peace talks. In Jerusalem, however, both Israeli and Palestinian officials were pessimistic about chances of a breakthrough in their negotiations during the secretary of state's visit. Several members of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, including Mr Haider Abdel Shafi and the People's party, said they would boycott Mr Christopher's visit because the US continued to back unacceptable Israeli proposals. Even those Palestinians who plan to meet him today said they did not expect a breakthrough on the two fundamental obstacles: Palestinian control over Arab East Jerusalem and territorial jurisdiction over the settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories during an interim period of self-rule. For its part, Israel is urging Mr Christopher to concentrate on the Syrian track of the peace process, which focuses on prospects for an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. Israeli officials yesterday continued to promote the view that the crisis last week could be turned into an opportunity to focus on stalled talks over the Golan Heights. Mr Christopher said yesterday that, as 'partner' in the talks, the US was 'prepared to stay the course'. The Lebanese government, meanwhile, yesterday decided to send troops from the Lebanese army into southern Lebanese villages under the control of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Lebanese officials said the move was designed to 'preserve people's security' in villages along the north of Israel's self-declared 'security zone' inside Lebanon. The deployment appears to be a gesture to bolster the 'understanding' which followed a US-brokered ceasefire in the Israeli bombardment on Saturday and in which, despite its protestations to the contrary, Hizbollah appears to have undertaken to stop firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. However, the movement of Lebanese troops will not constitute an attempt to disarm or contain Hizbollah, officials in Beirut said. Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, has repeatedly said he cannot act against what he calls the 'Lebanese resistance' while Israel retains a presence inside Lebanon's borders. Israel said that more of the 400 Palestinian deportees stranded in Lebanese no man's land for eight months would be eligible to return in September, taking the number of deportees to have returned to around 200, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Medium-term growth projections revised down THE Treasury has revised down its projections for medium-term growth in the UK after taking into account the effects on industry of the recession and the dim prospects for the world economy. Officials are projecting average annual growth over the next four years of 2.5 per cent, slightly under 1 percentage point less than the assumption in the Budget a year ago. They are also assuming that, as a result of weaker economic activity than that expected in the 1992 Budget, tax revenues will stay relatively low for a considerable period. That is likely to keep the fiscal deficit at a high level at least until 1997-98. Over the next year, the Treasury is predicting a weak recovery in the UK driven largely by increased exports and company activity, rather than any marked increase in consumer spending. It says the international outlook is marred by weakness in Germany but could be helped by signs of a recovery in the US. In an analysis of economic prospects released with the Budget statement, the Treasury says that, as a result of spare capacity in industry, 'inflation is assumed to fall further in the medium term'. It warns, however, that after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism 'there may be little progress (in inflation) over the next two years if the current level of the exchange rate continues'. The Treasury is forecasting growth of 1.25 per cent in gross domestic product this year, close to the consensus estimates in the City and slightly higher than its forecast released in the November Autumn Statement of 1 per cent. It is postulating a pick-up in total UK output towards the end of this year, with growth between mid 1993 and the middle of next year of 3 per cent. Consumer spending is thought likely to expand by just 1.25 per cent this year, picking up only slightly to 1.75 per cent between the first halves of this year and 1994. Export growth is projected to pick up from an annual rate of 5.5 per cent this year to one of 10.5 per cent by the middle of next year as sterling's devaluation makes UK goods more competitive overseas. Economists at the Treasury take a more gloomy view about longer-term growth prospects than at the time of last year's Budget, which occurred a month before the general election. In 1993-94, it is assuming growth of 2 per cent, followed by 2.5 per cent in 1994-95 and 2.75 per cent in each of the two following financial years. A year ago it assumed gross domestic product would rise by 3.25 per cent in 1993-94, followed by growth of 3.75 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 3.25 per cent in the next three financial years. Taking into account the tax-raising measures announced yesterday, government revenues are now thought likely to increase from Pounds 229bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 293bn by 1996-97. In last year's Budget the corresponding projections were for Pounds 247bn and Pounds 312bn respectively. With government spending over the medium term also set to rise faster than projected a year ago, the government deficit is projected in the latest Treasury statement to move from Pounds 50bn in the financial year starting next month to Pounds 35bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 30bn the following year. In the last Budget, the Treasury theorised that the deficit would come down from Pounds 32bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 19bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 6bn in 1996-97. Non-oil business investment in the UK is expected to rise modestly by 1 per cent this year, but company profits are likely to move relatively quickly 'as demand rises, firms continue tight control of labour costs and pressure on margins eases'. The Treasury says that the trough in business investment as a share of gross domestic product is likely to occur in the first half of 1994, at a level 'well above' those seen in the previous recessions in the past 20 years. The Treasury reckons the UK's volume share of total world trade in manufactured products will rise to about 5.7 per cent by the middle of next year from just under 5.5 per cent last year. It says that 'while import growth outstripped demand growth' in the UK last year, the degree of import penetration was 'not out of line with its long-term trend'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TREASURY'S ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1992              1993                                  Latest     March 1992**    Nov 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product             -0.5                3           1 Non-oil GDP                        -0.5                3        0.75 Manufacturing output              -0.75             3.75        11.5 Consumer spending                  0.25                3        1.25 Government consumption            -0.25             1.25         0.5 Fixed investment                  -0.75              3.5        0.25 Exports                               2              6.5         5.5 Imports                            5.25             8.25        5.75 Current account deficit (Pounds bn)                          12             9+++        15.5 Inflation****                      3.75***      3.25++??     3.75*** GDP at current prices (Pounds bn)                         599              663         629 Government spending (Pounds bn)*                        260              280         n/a Government receipts (Pounds bn)                         224              247         n/a Govt. borrowing (Pounds bn)          35               32        c44  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                1993          1994                                              Latest      Latest**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product                         1.25             3 Non-oil GDP                                       1          2.25 Manufacturing output                           2.75 Consumer spending                              1.25          1.75 Government consumption                         0.25          1.25 Fixed investment                                0.5          2.75 Exports                                         5.5          10.5 Imports                                        4.75          9.25 Current account deficit (Pounds bn)            17.5          18.5 Inflation**                                 3.75***     3.75++*** GDP at current prices (Pounds bn)???            628           671 Government spending (Pounds bn)???*             280           296 Government receipts (Pounds bn)???              229           251 Govt. borrowing (Pounds bn)???                   50            44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: all figures are year on year percentage changes, unless otherwise stated. *including privatisation proceeds; ??? financial year; +++ at an annual rate; **** Q4 on Q4 unless stated; ++ Q2 on Q2; *** RPI less mortgage interest payments; ??

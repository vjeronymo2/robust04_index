			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by German Velasquez Clavijo] </F>   [Text] Three months after the Capitalization Law was  passed, the process is moving along nicely, according to the  government. Apparently, judging by reports from the top  officials of the executive branch, the sectoral laws governing  the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), the National  Electric Power Enterprise (Ende), the National Smelting  Enterprise (Enaf), the National Railway Enterprise (Enfe), and  Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB) are in the process of  being revised, and investors have shown great interest.    The national government set a deadline of 18 months for this  process to be completed. By the end of that period, state  enterprises should have been converted into mixed corporations,  their book value should have been appraised at the financial and  market levels, regulatory bodies should have been formed, and an  international call for bids should have been issued for the  purchase of shares.  <H5>  Legal Progress </H5>   The framework law on capitalization has been enacted, but  the  legal instrument of the regulatory bodies responsible for  monitoring the provision of communication, electricity, fuel,  and transportation services has not been completed yet.  Moreover, the strategies for obtaining more fresh money have not  yet been finalized.    The sectoral laws for the regulation and organization of  markets, which will set policy on concessions, authorizations,  rates, and fees for the five companies, are being analyzed and  evaluated. The president and his cabinet will be approving them  any day now, and then they will be sent to Congress.    In short, the procedures for carrying out the capitalization  process have not yet been defined, and therefore it would be  premature to take a stand on the viability of the process or its  pros and cons.    It is important to know in advance what regulatory  frameworks  will govern the different sectors, what criteria will be  followed for selecting strategic partners, what strategy will be  followed for each company, and what costs and benefits the  process will entail.    So far, however, the first steps in the process have already  been taken by the principal executives of the six enterprises to  be capitalized: Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB), the  National Electric Power Enterprise (Ende), the National  Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), the Metallurgical  Enterprise of Vinto (formerly Enaf), the National Railway  Enterprise (Enfe), and the Lloyd Bolivian Airline (LAB).  <H5>  YPFB </H5>   Any day now, the employees of the state petroleum enterprise  will become the first shareholders in the enterprise, once its  legal status is officially converted to that of mixed  corporation. Its bylaws are now being revised.    The Hydrocarbon Law is also under consideration. It is  currently in the hands of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada,  who is expected to approve it and send it on to Congress.    According to Capitalization Minister Alfonso Revollo, the  new  legal instrument will include a tax system for the hydrocarbons  sector (an excise tax on gasoline) and other measures aimed at  attracting investors.  <H5>  Value Declined </H5>   Sources say off the record that the value of YPFB has  dropped  from $1.5 billion to less than $1 billion. The president of the  enterprise, Mauricio Gonzales, has urged caution, however,  noting that it is premature to discuss specific amounts because  higher offers may be made on the market.    It is not known officially what YPFB's book value is; all  that is available is estimates from recent audits. The final  results will be released after the consulting firm completes the  appraisal of assets.  <H5>  Principal Problem </H5>   One of the problems that will beset the YPFB capitalization  process is its heavy debt. The state petroleum enterprise owes  more than 1.4 billion bolivianos, equivalent to $300 million,  primarily because of the agreement with Argentina to "start from  scratch."    This situation may be resolved by the replacement of the TGN  [expansion unknown], but Minister Revollo stated that first the  macroeconomic impact must be studied, or failing that,  liabilities must be included in the process.  <H5>  National Electric Power Enterprise </H5>   The capitalization of the National Electric Power Enterprise  (Ende) may allow for the sale of energy to the neighboring  countries of Argentina, Chile, and Peru, said President Sanchez  de Lozada. For this reason, an infusion of fresh investment  funds is necessary.    He stated that Bolivia is now the country with the smallest  electricity production, 700 megawatts. An effort will be made to  reverse this situation with incentives and foreign investment.    To carry out this task, the electricity market must be  deregulated and Ende must be regarded as just one more company  competing with others in power generation and distribution. To  achieve that end, experts at the Energy Secretariat have begun  to revise the Electricity Code in consultation with experts from  the World Bank.  <H5>  Ende Value Unknown </H5>   The minister of capitalization indicated that no one yet  knows Ende's book value, but this month the figures will be  released after an external audit is performed. He explained that  it is a profitable and well-run enterprise, which makes it more  attractive on the investment market.  <H5>  Metallurgical Enterprise of Vinto </H5>   In the mining sector, capitalization will take place in the  smelting company of Vinto (formerly Enaf), since this is the  only company in the sector that is still in production and  making a profit. That fact will arouse the interest of the  private sector.    This month, company executives will hire a consulting firm  to  appraise the firm and evaluate its situation. In addition, all  the instruments necessary to regulate the process are now being  drawn up.  <H5>  Company Value </H5>   The latest appraisal of the Metallurgical Enterprise of  Vinto  indicates that its value is $50 million. This figure may be  high, however, considering that Minsur [expansion not given]  invested $17.5 million installing its own smelting plant, with a  production capacity of 13,000 fine tons of tin, 5,500 tons less  than that of the national smelting enterprise.  <H5>  LAB </H5>   The capitalization of the country's first airline is now  under way. Top executives are reorganizing and restructuring the  firm to make it more attractive to the private sector.    Analysts say that under current conditions, the company  could  only last two more years. Thus, a capital infusion is essential,  especially considering that it lost $12 million in the last  fiscal year.    Despite these circumstances, LAB executives say the airline  has great potential for capitalization. Most airlines in the  world are going through crises, and the Bolivian company is no  exception.  <H5>  Entel </H5>   The government considers the capitalization of Entel of  vital  importance, so it has invited a dozen foreign business  executives representing Korean Telecom, AT&amp;T (of the United  States), GTE Corporation, France Telecom, Titan Corp., and  Telefonica de Espana to become familiar with the process and  with the company's potential.    In addition, the Sectoral Law on Communications, the Law on  Regulatory and Arbitration Bodies, and amendments to the tax  provisions of Law 843 are now being drafted.  <H5>  Book Value </H5>   According to accounting records from previous fiscal years,  Entel should sell for $141 million to $200 million, but the  consulting firm will release the official information after  appraising the company's assets and liabilities.  <H5>  National Railway Enterprise </H5>   The National Railway Enterprise (Enfe) has already begun the  capitalization process in an effort to strengthen the  transportation system and provide more efficient service to the  public, in hauling freight, and in import and export activities.    It is also in the process of reorganizing its assets and  liabilities and studying the Railroad Law that will regulate its  activities with a view to making the railroad company more  attractive to foreign investors.  <H5>  Excess Workers a Problem </H5>   One of the problems that will hinder capitalization is the  large number of superfluous personnel. In 1985, there were 7,199  employees, but layoffs have brought that figure down to about  4,000.    This total is not ideal, said Revollo, because the company  cannot support that many employees. He explained that this  matter will be negotiated during the capitalization process.</p>

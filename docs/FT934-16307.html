			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Shetland salmon farmers to get compensation for Braer contaminated fish SHETLAND SALMON farmers are to be paid Pounds 14m compensation for fish still contaminated by the Braer oil tanker disaster. One million year-old salmon will be destroyed after the farmers argued successfully that they could still cause health problems. One quarter of Shetland's salmon was contaminated by the spill last January. Until this settlement, the International Oil Pollution Compensation fund had been paying compensation to farmers on a month-by-month basis in the belief the fish would clean themselves as they grew.</p>

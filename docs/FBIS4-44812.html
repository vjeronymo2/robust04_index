Their goal is to renovate virtually all  forces by 2005-2010.    Western manufacturers visiting Santiago, Chili, for the  FIDAE'94 Show 21-28 March began to see visions of an enormous  goldmine. Most Latin American countries, which were overarmed in  the 1970s, now have only aging fleets of fighters, on their last  legs, at their disposal. And for lack of financial resources,  these several hundred combat planes will not be totally replaced  until the next decade.    Until then, upgrading is the solution of choice. The scope  of  South America's replacement and maintenance market had been  limited until now by tacit agreements between the principal  states in the region, which were anxious to maintain the  existing balance of power. But Argentina upset this stability  last December when it decided on a program to update its 36  A-4/A-4M Skyhawks and buy another 24 on the North American  market. In response, Chili, whose short-term projects had been  limited to the purchase of five Mirage 5s to accommodate  increased staffing, issued a bid invitation to acquire 20  additional aircraft on the second-hand market.    This rivalry has rekindled competition on all sides. In  Chili, SABCA is offering a batch of 20-25 Belgian Air Force  Mirage 5BAs updated by Sagem (MIRSIP), which are vying against a  French proposal to sell 18-20 upgraded Mirage 5Fs taken from Air  Force stocks (see AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL  No 1465).    Meanwhile, British Aerospace is offering 15 former Nigerian  Air Force Jaguars, which are being presented as virtually new  aircraft, while Israel has proposed a fighter midway between the  Kfir C-2 and C-7 to be manufactured by IAI. Former defense  minister Rojas's preliminary decision in favor of the Belgian  proposal will bring a Chilian military delegation to Belgium in  early April. But despite the Army's continued influence, the  final decision rests with the new government which took power  last 11 March. As it happens, purchases of future weapons in  Chili have run up against a Congressional challenge to the  current law allowing 10 percent of the proceeds from national  copper exports to be used to fund military acquisitions.  Moreover, a parliamentary investigating committee is looking  into accusations that the Chilian Army misappropriated funds.    The stakes in Argentina are no longer purely military.  Lockheed's proposal to update 18 of the Air Force's 36 Skyhawks  at FMA (Fabrica Militar de Aviones) facilities in Cordoba seems  like a first step toward a takeover of the company by the  American aircraft manufacturer. The Argentine government, which  is anxious to successfully privatize the military arsenal, seems  so favorable to this eventuality that an agreement may be signed  quickly in late May or early June.    Lockheed's arrival in Cordoba would be a serious threat to  all European civil and military manufacturers, starting with  Dassault. The latter is negotiating a contract in Argentina to  modernize the last 24 Mirages, extending their life to  2015-2020. The deal would be a considerable upgrade market, and  would include the installation of a new radar system and  "headup" and "headdown" displays. Lockheed is offering to supply  the same type of equipment--without delay--on its updated A-4s.    Europeans fear a repeat of this scenario in other Latin  American countries, primarily Brazil, where there are plans to  privatize the Embraer company in late May and distribute 60  percent of the company's shares to the private sector.    European and American manufacturers are thus well aware of  the need to establish themselves in all Latin American markets.  Unable to sell highly sophisticated equipment for now, upgrades  are just the entry ticket they need while waiting for better  days. In this respect French equipment makers, who flocked to  the FIDAE show this year, have a long way to go. Besides  American domination, the South Africans and Israelis are strong  competitors. The IAI has a solid foothold in Chili through its  ongoing modernization of 15 Mirage-Panteras, six of which are  already in service in the Chilian Air Force (FACH).    In addition to aircraft and system upgrades, the South  American market needs a certain number of operational  "retrofits." In Chili, for example, FACH is studying the  possibility of in-flight refueling of its Pantera fighters. To  counter American and Israeli offers of Boeing refuelers and  BAe's offer of VC-10s, the French group Intertechnique and SIDMI  Co. are proposing an innovative, less onerous system that can be  adapted to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It involves an  11,000-liter, removable on-board tank, which can refuel four to  six airplanes by means of a standard boom running through the  cargo door, closed in flight. The French firms may team up with  the Chilian firm ENAER on the system, which they would offer to  other regional air forces with in-flight refuelable fighters.  Peru and its Mirage 2000s come to mind.    The two companies are also teaming up on a ship-based,  in-flight refueling system for helicopters (HIFR), which could  be adapted to different types of machines, notably Chili's Super  Pumas. All approaches are worth exploring. Sully Produits  Speciaux, for instance, presented for the first time in Santiago  a new single-piece windshield that is better suited to the  large-angle use of HUDs on all type of Mirage IIIs and 5s and  their spinoffs (Kfir, Dagger, etc.). Though equipment makers are  involved in a front-line battle in South America today, aircraft  manufacturers are beginning discussions for the future. Besides  the traditional contest between Dassault (Mirage 2000), General  Dynamics (F-16 A/B), and British Aerospace (Harrier), Sweden's  Saab is eager to offer an export version of the Gripen JAS-39C  by 1997-98. The Swedish fighter may be equipped with new  engines, flight controls, and partly altered avionics in the  meantime. Such a development may involve SNECMA [National  Aircraft Research and Manufacturing Company] through its future  M88-3 jet engine. The Russians--newcomers in this part of South  America--revealed their ambitions by presenting their entire  panoply of modern combat planes (MiG-29, Su-27, and Su-30) for  the first time at FIDAE.  <H5>  Boxed Material: Equipment Makers' Strong Presence </H5>   A healthy contingent of equipment manufacturers and  maintenance companies dominated the eighth FIDAE (Feria  Internacional des Aires y del Espacio), which was organized in  Santiago, Chili by the Chilian Air Force (FACH). The largest  showing was American. Little in the way of new equipment was  exhibited at the show, which is mainly devoted to weapons, all  kinds of systems, and equipment. With 22 companies represented,  France ranked third among the 32 participating countries, behind  the United States (90), and Chili (57). In addition, Israel,  Italy, and Canada sent particularly large delegations.  Inaugurated by Chili's new president, Eduardo Frei, the  exhibition received greetings from American president Bill  Clinton and a visit by former British prime minister Margaret  Thatcher. On the French side, no member of the government or  general staffs made the trip, and few high-ranking officials  were present. In this respect the French delegation, headed by  Edmond Marchegay (GIFAS/French Aeronautical and Space Industries  Group), was politically underrepresented and supremely isolated.

The main beneficiaries  were Aerospatiale's helicopter division (now Eurocopter), which  delivered 75 craft; Airbus, which sold 15 aircraft despite 10  cancellations; the ATR consortium, which placed 7 planes (3  cancellations); Aerospatiale's missiles branch, which sold about  35 Exocets (different versions); and Matra, which took orders  for several batches of "Magic" 2 air-to-air missiles (about 50)  and sold a few surface-to-air "Mistral" missiles to Chili.    Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, which took 72 percent of the  deliveries and placed 66 percent of the orders, stand out from  other countries of the region. Chili and Peru trail the pack,  with 1 percent of orders and 7 percent of deliveries for the  first, and 6 percent of orders and 4 percent of deliveries for  the second.    In late 1993, however, the Thomson-CSF group made a  significant breakthrough in Chili by winning an important  contract ($20 million) to supply a "Eurocat" 200 air traffic  control system, slated to be up and running in late 1995 in  Santiago. A second phase, worth a similar amount of money, is  still under negotiation.    The Franco-German group Eurocopter sold six "Cougar"  helicopters to the Chilian Navy in 1993. The last of the batch  will be delivered in early April. Other negotiations are  underway with Brazil for Cougars and with Chili, where  Eurocopter is offering the Navy the BK-117--in competition with  the Bell 230--and two additional Bo-105s for border guards. To  date, 65 of Chili's total 135 helicopters (including 44 Bells)  are Franco-German made. However, Eurocopter has expressed fears  that Chili will join the ranks of the local "common market"  (NAFTA), which could add--as it has in Mexico--an approximately  20 percent tax to its imports. Despite recent successes, the  French aerspace industry still lags behind its main competitors,  notably the United States, in South America.    The primary criticisms leveled against French suppliers are  high prices, long delivery times, and seriously inadequate  after-sales service. Boeing heavily dominates the civilian  market throughout the continent, where ATR has nonetheless won  significant victories. There is strong competition for the  military market, in which Israeli and South African  manufacturers have established themselves as upgraders.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Open-ended talks rejected by Shamir MR Yitzhak Shamir, Israeli prime minister, has rejected a US proposal for an open-ended Middle East peace conference. This is likely to cause tension between the two countries. The US proposal was one of five points that Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr David Levy, Israeli foreign minister, had agreed during talks in Jerusalem on Friday. Mr Baker's latest Middle East tour ended abruptly later that day when he heard of his mother's death. He arrived in Israel after meeting leaders in Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Mr Shamir insists that the regional peace conference, which would be sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union, meet only once to lay the groundwork for direct bilateral negotiations between Israel and individual Arab states, and Israel and the Palestinians. The premier fears that, under the conference's auspices, Israel might be forced to give up Arab territories occupied since the 1967 Middle East war. 'We are opposed to that because, if there are subsequent sessions of the same meeting or conference, we'll never get to direct negotiations,' said Mr Shamir. As part of the agreement by Mr Baker and Mr Levy, the conference would reconvene occasionally to hear progress reports, but only with the support of every member, including Israel. News of the agreement led to a furore at the weekend among some of the more obdurate members of Mr Shamir's right-wing coalition, who threatened to resign if Israel agreed to the open-ended peace conference. Some of the key issues left unresolved at Mr Baker's abrupt departure from Jerusalem are: what role the UN and the European Community would play in the peace conference, and who would be in the Palestinian delegation to the talks. Following the weekly Israeli cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Levy said his agreement with Mr Baker had been co-ordinated in advance with the prime minister. Mr Levy insinuated that Mr Shamir had got 'cold feet'. 'We will continue to act to advance the peace process and whoever cries of despair or gets cold feet cannot distort the picture - which is that Israel is achieving the most important parameters from the diplomatic point of view in a way that was not achieved in the past.' Mr Shamir tried to play down differences with the US, Israel's closest ally: 'I do not think we are heading towards a crisis. These negotiations are important, but I think it's too early to say that efforts in this direction have been frustrated.'</p>

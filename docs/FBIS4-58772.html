			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Qatar Karmela Menashe] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Saudi Arabia sent a more  senior representative to the multilateral disarmament talks in  Qatar than it had to previous encounters -- the king's cousin,  Prince al-Turki. Saudi Arabia sought to prove that it was the  true master of the Gulf region.    Throughout the discussions, the Saudi representative's stand  was obvious: Progress in the multilateral talks and the  practical implementation of confidence-building measures can  take place only after the peace process makes further progress.  [passage omitted]    Eytan Bentzur, a Foreign Ministry deputy director general  and  member of the Israeli delegation to the Qatar talks, says the  Saudis encumbered the progress of the talks. They should  realize better than anyone else that they have a vested interest  in the peace process, and in deflating tensions in this  sensitive and charged region, he said. [passage omitted]    Despite the Saudi attempt to place obstacles, resolutions  were adopted. It is unclear whether the Gulf states were  thereby disobeying Saudi Arabia, which tried to demonstrate that  its own stands will prevail vis-a-vis the other members of the  oil-producing countries alliance, or perhaps the Saudis were  militant only in plenum sessions.    Outside the formal talks, the Israeli delegation held  conversations and meetings with the Tunisian representative, who  made attempts to soften the Saudis, with the representatives of  Oman, Egypt, and the U.S., and with the Qatari foreign minister.    After the talks, Israeli delegates said this was another  step  toward normalization with the world. [passage omitted]</p>

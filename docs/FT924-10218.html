			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Sweden in move to tackle bank sector crisis SWEDEN will this week announce plans to set up a special authority to tackle the crisis in the country's banking sector. The move is part of a package of measures designed to shore up the battered financial system and strengthen foreign confidence in it. It follows concern that credit losses for all of Sweden's banks could reach SKr100bn (Dollars 18.7bn) over the next few years. Details of the new proposals could be announced as early as tomorrow. It is expected that the authority will provide loans, guarantees and capital assistance to stricken banks and other financial institutions and play a key role in the restructuring of the sector during the 1990s. Mr Bo Lundgren, tax minister, said the earliest the new authority could start operations would be the middle of next year. The proposals are being drawn up in consultation with the opposition Social Democrats to ensure they are approved in parliament. The problems in the Swedish banking sector were underlined only last week when Sparbanken Sverige announced eight-month losses of SKr6.5bn after a 62 per cent increase in loan losses to SKr10.4bn. It warned that if losses continued at the current pace next year, it might have to seek state support. Earlier this year, the state had to intervene to save Nordbanken with SKr20bn worth of grants and guarantees and Forsta Sparbanken with SKr7.3bn. In September, the government had to pledge it would guarantee Gota Bank's commitments after the bank indicated that credit losses this year would reach SKr8bn.</p>

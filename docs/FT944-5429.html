			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (1): Keep to the straight path Financial planning is a bit like the Pilgrim's Progress: the correct path is relatively straightforward; what is difficult is sticking to it. The financial world is full of traps and pitfalls. But provided you head in the right direction and avoid attempts to divert you and your money, you will probably do better than most people. This survey was not planned as a cautionary tale - but a number of the articles point out traps and explain how to avoid them. Financial traps come in three varieties: crooks and skulduggery, constraints and penalties, and innocuous-seeming costs which eat into your investments and savings. The founder of UK financial regulation, Professor Jim Gower, once commented that far more financial damage was caused by incompetents than by rogues. This is still true. Robert Maxwell was - fortunately - an exception. Of course you need to check that an insurance company or a financial adviser is genuine, and that your money is going where you think it is. But in most cases the answer will be reassuring. Lack of flexibility is a more common problem. Too many financial firms still tie clients down to long-term contracts, with hefty penalties for anyone who changes his mind. Conventional life insurance, pension plans and pension top-ups can be particularly bad. Although the details of what you are and are not allowed to do will usually be spelt out in the small print, few clients read it, and even fewer would understand it if they did. Most find it outrageous that someone can contribute to an endowment policy for several years and get nothing back if he cashes it in early. This lack of flexibility is the companies' way of protecting themselves against the third problem: expensive incompetence. Too many financial firms still act as though their customers owed them a living - regardless of how their investments perform. But the heavy charges which provide that living make it very hard for the investment to produce good results to the client - even if the men who manage the money do a competent job. This is now changing. From the beginning of next year, life and pensions companies will have to explain how they operate in a way that customers can understand. And already many of them are starting to tinker with their products so that they will look acceptable when the curtain goes up. But that does not mean the investor can relax. Initially, at least, there will still be a bewildering variety of products on the market. Disclosure will only be useful to those customers who take the trouble to compare what different financial retailers have on offer. That often includes looking at different products which can do the same job - which presupposes a good understanding of how those products work. Knowledge is not the key to good investment, but it is the key to avoiding bad investments.</p>

In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday,  Semenov said that land forces should be slightly trimmed up to  make them more mobile and manoeuvrable, better governable and  able to perform any task. He said that presently Russian land  troops are engaged in various operations in Tajikistan, South  Ossetia, the Dniester region of Moldova and other trouble spots  in the former Soviet Union. He stressed that they are also fit  enough to replace Russian paratroopers in Bosnia.    Speaking about the problems facing his troops, Semenov said  that the major of them is the lack of finances. It takes 10 to  15 years to develop new types of weapons, but there are no means  to finance new programmes, most of which remain on paper. He  regretted that the Manevr management and control system which  was developed almost 20 years ago has become obsolete but there  is nothing new to replace it with.    Semenov said that the principle of left-over staffing of  land  troops which make up almost a half of the Russian army is  especially alarming. The system of service on a cotract basis  has proven ineffective. "Until the country gets a strong  economy, one can hardly hope that skilled volunteers would join  the army," he said.</p>

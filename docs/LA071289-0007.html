			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OKS MORE FUNDS TO STEM THE MINORITY SCHOOL-DROPOUT TIDE  </P> <P> San Diego city school trustees gave tentative approval Tuesday to the spending  of more money on programs to improve the poor academic standing of many  minority students. However, they also told top administrators that they want  more accountability.  </P> <P> In essence, the school board -- in a long and occasionally intense session --  said it will spend more funds to try and stem the the dropout tide, especially  among black males, but that principals and teachers must be held accountable  for bringing about improvements, however modest, over the next several years.  The board told the staff to set reasonable outset goals that can be reached  through hard work, rather than targeting long-range outcomes that have little  expectation of being met.  </P> <P> The board heard a staff proposal to give geographic clusters of schools, which  include a high school and the junior highs and elementary schools surrounding  it, up to $100,000 to manage better the many dropout programs and initiatives  already under way.  </P> <P> Trustees also showed support for a $250,000 pilot program at four schools with  large numbers of black males that would set up special counselor advocates to  give the students additional counseling, adult mentors, academic support and  other measures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controversial Plan  </P> <P> In addition, a majority of board members said they will stay the course with  their controversial plan for Gompers Secondary School in Southeast San Diego. A  still-divided Gompers staff has been ordered to give neighborhood students,  almost all of them minority, greater access to the school's special  math-science program heretofore limited to only a few resident students and an  equal number of white students who bus to Gompers.  </P> <P> Final action on the dropout and black male proposals is scheduled for next  week. The board on Tuesday did approve creation of a parent-teacher study  committee at Madison High School in Clairemont to decide whether the Madison  community wants to close the campus during lunch and prohibit students from  leaving.  </P> <P> School district administrators admitted in their dropout report Tuesday that in  many ways they are doing an inadequate job of managing the myriad programs in  place to improve student academic performance and lower the number of dropouts.  </P> <P> Projects to address the same problems are often implemented separately in  varying degrees from school to school, even within the same cluster, without  the necessary coordination to make sure that students retain the same services  as they move from an elementary to a junior- or senior-high.  </P> <P> Even within a particular school, new ideas that develop from a pilot program  often fail to become part of the overall academic program, deputy Supt. Bertha  Pendleton said.  </P> <P> Last month, administrators conceded that they had failed to do sufficient  follow-up at a much-publicized new dropout prevention program to know whether  students enrolled in the special classes returned to their regular schools or  dropped in spite of the intervention. Only on Tuesday was Pendleton able to  tell trustees that the new program has so far succeeded in maintaining severely  at-risk students in school.  </P> <P> In an effort to get more results from all the initiatives, Pendleton proposed  that schools within a given cluster set up formal planning processes so that  ideas and strategies can be more widely and consistently implemented. Although  a few clusters have coordinated individual projects, none so far have attempted  ongoing general coordination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Goals for Attendance  </P> <P> The process would include setting up goals for attendance, achievement, parent  involvement, and dropout reduction for each cluster, as well as coming up with  ideas and implementation deadlines.  </P> <P> There would also be money, up to $100,000 a year, made available to clusters  that come up with specific plans. In addition, those clusters that improved  attendance -- considered the single most important predictor for future  dropouts -- would receive a portion of the money collected by from the state as  a result of showing higher attendance rates.  </P> <P> Trustee Shirley Weber suggested that Pendleton and Supt. Tom Payzant also  consider appointing a "dropout czar" to coordinate the more than a dozen  programs. However, Payzant said that while more supervision is needed, he does  not want to send a message to individual teachers and principals that they  could interpret as giving them less responsibility for making students more  successful.  </P> <P> And Pendleton emphasized that, despite all the intervention programs, the key  to boosting the performance of students, especially black and Latinos who drop  out in excess of 40% during their high school years, remains in improving  regular classroom instruction.  </P> <P> Pendleton's plan for black males, who perform more poorly than any other ethnic  group or gender in the city, calls for appointing four black male advocates,  probably special counselors, to work at four pilot schools: Knox Elementary and  Gompers, its allied junior high; and at Fulton Elementary and Bell Junior High.  The schools have about 850 black male students among them.  </P> <P> The advocates would be charged with a wide variety of duties intended to help  improve attendance, increase the small number of black males who now achieve  grades of B or better and improve self-esteem, among other items.  </P> <P> Trustee Jim Roache spoke for the board in finding merit with the plan, except  that "this board always is presented grandiose objectives and goals that we  never attain. . . . I want a few more concrete and attainable objectives, and  say here they are, so that, if a school fails, we will withdraw the money and  take it elsewhere."  </P></p>

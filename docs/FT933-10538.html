			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Greece The temptation for political leaders, as the timetable for monetary union appears to recede, is to relax the effort for fiscal virtue and go back to bad old ways, writes Kerin Hope. As the only EC state never an ERM member, Greece has stayed on the sidelines. Yesterday, central bank officials made clear that policy would not change: the drachma will continue to depreciate slowly against the Ecu; the target for the year is about 6 per cent. To the government's relief the annual inflation rate of around 16 per cent has enabled it to postpone the drachma's entry to the ERM, due to happen as soon as inflation dropped to 10 per cent. With the new margins the drachma could join, in theory, but a senior banker said yesterday: 'One major reason for joining was that the disinflationary effect would increase confidence in Greek monetary policy. But with a potential swing of 30 per cent, that's no longer the case.' A bigger worry will be keeping the medium-term stabilisation programme on track. With an election due in 10 months at the latest, politicians are demanding sharp increases in public spending. But a faster decline in interest rates is all the government can realistically offer, assuming that rates fall elsewhere. Even then, there is limited scope, given the need to raise about Dr160bn (Pounds 453m) every month to finance the public debt, now over 120 per cent of GDP. Ms Miranda Xafa, economic adviser to the prime minister, said: 'We simply can't afford to ease up on fiscal discipline, just because Maastricht looks further away today.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 7 Jun (AFP) -- The Zairian opposition  press today published the criticisms leveled against France on 5  June at a rally organized by the Union for Democracy and Social  Progress [UDPS], Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's radical opposition  party.    UPDS executive committee member Kibassa Maliba had on that  occasion severely criticized France's position on Zaire --  France was accused of "supporting dictatorship" -- and announced  that a campaign would be organized to boycott French interests  in Zaire.    According to LE PHARE, this is a "real declaration of holy  war reminiscent of what Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]  has launched against French interests, in particular.    "Both in Kinshasa and up-country, people are today convinced  that France does not deserve anything better than the war now  being waged against her by FIS fighters," the paper continued.    "Thank God," the paper adds, "the difference is that the  Bantu is essentially nonviolent by nature." So, French  nationals in Zaire do not risk waking up one day to the reality  of finding their throats cut, their children's heads smashed,  and their women raped. But it must be repeated that this does  not in anyway attenuate the hatred which the Zairian public  henceforth has for this Mitterrand style of hypocrisy.    In its own installment, LE PALMARES is of the view that  "France is a thorn in the flesh of Democratic Zaire" and accuses  her of "infiltrating the Zairian democratic process to draw  attractive dividends from it."    The paper further writes, "France is enticed by the hope of  deriving economic benefits from the rich Central African  region." For its part, LA REFERENCE-PLUS points out that "the  spontaneous enthusiasm" created by the criticisms leveled  against France among participants at the 5 June rally is a  testimony "that it will not be a good thing for a countryman of  Francois Mitterrand to invest tomorrow in Zaire."</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Planned Community: Coming soon to a world near you: Star Trek Town, the only  community in the world for followers of a science-fiction television series.  Recent ads in the News, Observer of Raleigh, N.C., and Star Log magazine call  on mature "Star Trek" fans to help form a community where they could live out  the moral code set by Kirk, Spock and the Starfleet gang. But to boldly go  where no man has gone before takes time and planning, and the people behind the  proposal wouldn't discuss specifics. DANIEL CERONE and SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

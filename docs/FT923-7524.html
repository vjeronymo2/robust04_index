			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Managers find faith in index-matching strategies - Passive management techniques BRITAIN's leading fund managers, who pride themselves on their stock-picking skills, have long scorned passive management techniques. But the passive strategy used in index matching is increasingly being seen as an option for pension fund managers who have lost faith in the roller-coaster performance records of many of Britain's top money managers. An indexed portfolio consists of all the shares in an index whose performance the fund manager wishes to track and in a proportion to each company's capitalisation. It requires no analysis of each share's underlying performance or prospects. The Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, announced recently it would use index matching to manage half the equities portion of a portfolio it intended to buy with proceeds from a recent sale of Wellcome shares. Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of Wellcome Trust, said that tracking the FT-A All Share Index of 654 UK stocks seemed a logical approach for a charity whose liabilities were in Britain. While active fund managers can and do out-perform the index, they rarely do so consistently. And in the interim, fees for index tracking are well below those charged by active managers. Passive management was boosted several weeks ago when Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, announced its Pounds 1bn pension fund was dropping its classic-style fund managers in favour of an index-tracking house. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, the UK's largest external index-tracking fund manager, won the Marks and Spencer account against two top-drawer 'active' managers, Prudential Portfolio Management and Mercury Asset Management. 'There's been an increasing trend towards index matching over the past four years,' said Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Combined Actuarial Performance Services, a pension fund performance measurement service. Mr Clamp estimates that 15 to 20 per cent of UK pension assets under management are managed on a passive basis, with one fund, the Pounds 20bn scheme of the Post Office and British Telecommunications accounting for about a quarter of that. Roughly Pounds 12bn of the fund is managed using index-matching techniques. Mr James Woodlock, director of BZW Asset Management, the UK's largest external manager of indexed funds, said that passively managed funds under its management have grown from Pounds 3.5bn at the end of 1987 to Pounds 8.5bn by the end of 1991. Since the start of this year, indexed funds have risen by another Pounds 3bn and they now account for nearly half of BZW's Pounds 25bn under management. Mr Woodlock said that clients were attracted by greater certainty of return offered by index matching, even if it rules out the potential for out-performing key stock indices. Fees and transactions costs are lower, partly because fewer transactions need occur, he added. Some supporters of index tracking say it is the fee structure which rewards passive managers less generously than active managers, that has caused UK fund managers to resist it. WM Company, a pension fund performance measurement service, estimates the market at a somewhat smaller but still significant 12 to 15 per cent of all funds under management. In the year ended 1991, WM Company noted that 90 per cent of the indexed funds which it monitors had out-performed the index. This suggests that index-tracking fund managers have some way to go to improve their technique if they are to exactly match the key FT-All share index. In seeking to explain the tracking error, WM said it believes that a number of partly-paid issues and the distribution of various rights offerings distorted calculations of returns. By comparison, over half the actively managed funds had under-performed the index. Also, the weighted average return of active fund managers measured by the WM index in 1991 was 20.0 per cent, compared with 21.1 per cent for index fund managers. Not all those who have shifted to passive management have done so because active managers offered disappointing results. One large UK pension fund with roughly Pounds 6bn under management said it chose index matching because the size of the scheme was impairing the ability to move in and out of shares quickly. 'The number of stocks in which we choose to be active is 60 to 100. But the size of our equity portfolio had become so large we couldn't manage that effectively,' he said. Sticking to manageable stakes would have required investment in far more companies than the in-house fund manager felt could be monitored effectively. Mr Robert Colville, director of Financial Activities at M&amp;S, said the company had decided to switch its pension scheme to a largely index-matched system of management after conducting an analysis of asset and liability classes. Mr Colville said the investment approach used by active managers appeared incompatible for a mature fund such as Marks and Spencer which had a large pensioner population looming. Indexation allows the pension scheme to tie its returns more closely to those of the stock market providing an element of inflation-proofing for investment returns. About 20 per cent of the fund remains in the hands of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Managers who handle the fixed interest portion. In the US, roughly 51 per cent of domestic equity pension fund assets are managed using index-matching techniques in a trend begun in the 1970s. Index matching has taken a long time to cross the Atlantic. Mr David Damant, managing director of MAP Securities, said: 'There is a certain distrust among UK fund managers of anything academic and index matching is a rather academic discipline.'</p>

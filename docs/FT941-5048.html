			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (2): Image problem begins to improve - Factoring and discounting are enjoying good times Rarely can the factoring and invoice discounting industry have enjoyed more propitious times. While the banks have been suffering in the recession from criticism that they are not doing enough to support smaller growing businesses, factoring has won an increasingly good hearing. Most encouraging for an industry that still suffers from an image problem has been support from the Governor of the Bank of England. Factoring, the Governor said in a report earlier this year on the relationship between banks and their customers, was a method of financing that companies should seriously consider as an alternative to the traditional overdraft. Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has added his weight, suggesting that factoring is a method smaller companies should consider to help enhance their performance. The industry's growth rate, has also been impressive, albeit from a still modest base. According to the Association of British Factors and and Discounters, which represents the largest companies in the industry, total sales factored by its members jumped in 1993 by over 23 per cent to Pounds 19.68bn. This followed growth of 12.7 per cent the previous year and a less exciting 2.5 per cent during 1991. Given the flexibility that factoring and invoice discounting can offer small and growing companies, it is surprising that at any one time the industry extends only Pounds 1.6bn while the banks extend Pounds 45bn in overdrafts. Factoring's share of this financing pie is growing, however. And Ben Allen, chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters, thinks the industry is on the verge of take-off. 'There is always a great demand for our products as we come out of recession,' he says. 'People have order books and week balance sheets and consequently need cash flow.' But demand is also growing because of the attitude of the banks. 'It appears the banks are finding it more difficult to lend on traditional overdraft terms particularly to small businesses,' Mr Allen adds. Some bankers say this reluctance to supply working capital required to fund growth will persist for some time. They appear to have taken a look at lending and decided they are being asked to provide what is, in effect, equity to undercapitalised companies, in return for which they only receive a loan margin as reward. Factoring therefore becomes a flexible alternative. For a start, factoring facilities automatically grow as a company's sales grow, unlike an overdraft facility which is usually a fixed amount that can only be increased after lengthy negotiations with the bank. Ben Allen also believes the industry has 'come of age' recently. His view is supported by Michael Bickers, publisher of an independent annual report on the factoring industry*. 'If bodies like the Bank of England are supportive it is bound to help the industry get over the image problem it has had for several years,' he says. Yet the misgivings persist. In some eyes, turning to factoring still suggests an act of desperation from a supplier who cannot find finance elsewhere. Some companies still refuse to have their invoices discounted or factored for this reason. Others say the service is expensive. This is more questionable and often based on unfair comparisons. The finance cost of simple factoring at Kellock, where Allen is managing director, is deliberately set at a rate less than banks charge on overdrafts, he says. It is the cost of running the debtor ledger for a company - between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent of turnover - that puts up the price and may make it appear more expensive. 'Most companies that factor do not have credit controllers so the cost of administering the debtor book that the factor levies is an additional charge,' says Bickers. But the company is able to save some of the cost - or, more likely, management time - needed to run the debtor book. Invoice discounting, which is used by larger companies, is marginally more expensive than overdraft, however. This is because the company has to pay for an audit by the invoice discounter who wants to know the company is running an acceptable standard of credit controls. Some companies also say factoring can cost more than an overdraft as the facility fee has to be paid on the full debtor book, even if less than that amount is required for part of the time. Factors say that if the facility is frequently under-used fees can be re-negotiated. In fact it is invoice discounting which is growing quickest. This is partly because it is not necessary to disclose the services are being used and partly because more large companies are turning to it. 'Invoice discounting has become the flavour of the decade,' says Allen. The market is therefore split between those ABFD members, like UCB and TSB, that do almost nothing but invoice discounting and the rest that offer both factoring and invoice discounting. Where the industry's potential is least developed is export factoring. Last year this sector grew 36 per cent albeit from a very low level. This trend is particularly welcome to smaller exporters because banks generally do not lend against export receivables. Until recently many factors were also cautious. One reason demand is increasing is that more continental European companies have been hit by recession and are learning to pay their debts considerably later. But the factoring companies are also improving the way they handle foreign receivables. 'In recent years they have managed to construct an effective network of factoring companies around the world,' says Bickers. Most of the factoring companies use a network called Factors Chain International, based in Amsterdam: an association of correspondent factoring companies in the main export markets. Of the ABFD members only International Factors, which is owned by Lloyds Banks and is the largest UK factor, is not a member. Whether export factoring really becomes an option for the smaller exporter depends on whether the banks, which control many of the factoring companies, are prepared to see a bigger challenge to their existing export finance business. * Factoring in the UK: available from BCR Publishing. 081 466 6987</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  Maxwell Laboratories' board of directors has unanimously rejected an  unsolicited $17-a-share cash merger offer by JAYCOR, a private, San Diego-based  defense contractor, the company said Thursday.  </P> <P> Maxwell's board determined that the "highly conditional" merger offer would not  serve "the best interests of the stockholders," according to a prepared  release. Maxwell, which develops high-tech products for the defense and  commercial markets, closed down 25 cents at $14 on Thursday.  </P> <P> Maxwell's financial and legal advisers determined that the $17-per-share offer  was "inadequate and otherwise on unacceptable terms," the company said.  Maxwell's board also determined that shareholders would be best served by  "Maxwell's continuing as an independent public entity now and in the  foreseeable future."  </P> <P> Neither company was available to elaborate on the merger offer Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will hold  a third round of working-level talks on a bilateral territorial  dispute on February 21 and 22 in Moscow, Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Terusuke Terada said Tuesday.    The meeting in Moscow will be the first about the  long-standing territorial dispute since Russian President Boris  Yeltsin visited Japan last October.    Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda will attend the  meeting, while Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov will  represent Russia, Terada said. Terada declined to comment on  the possible agenda for discussions at the two-day meeting,  saying the Japanese and Russian Governments are currently  working it out through diplomatic channels.    Japan claims four Russian-held islands off northeastern  Hokkaido. The former Soviet Union seized Shikotan, Kunashiri,  Etorofu and the Habomai Islets at the end of World War II.    Tokyo and Moscow originally scheduled the working-level  talks  for January, but postponed them at Russia's request.</p>

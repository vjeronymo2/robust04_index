			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Towards a smaller but more interesting Union - The progress of the restructuring in the Vestey empire WHEN Mr Terry Robinson, the former Lonrho director, joined Union International, the Vestey family's trading arm, as chief executive earlier this year he was in for something of a surprise. Net debt had grown from Pounds 269m at the end of 1990 to Pounds 420m, yet no one at the group could offer a suitable explanation why. 'There were no financial controls,' says Mr Robinson. 'No one knew why borrowings were increasing because no one knew who was spending what.' Subsidiaries, ranging from cattle ranching to food processing to the JH Dewhurst butcher chains, set their own capital expenditure with little direction from the centre. As a result, the group breached its banking covenants last year. The empire of the Vesteys, one of Britain's wealthiest families, had expanded rapidly, buying land and assets in South America, Australia and Europe. Union had acquired interests in ranching, food processing, canning, fruit distribution, commercial property and butchers chains. Mr Tim Vestey, at only 30, became the latest Vestey to take over the reins of chief executive last November. In order to persuade the banks to continue to fund Union he promised to bring in an outside professional to run the company. The Vesteys' choice was Mr Robinson. The situation was more serious than it may have at first appeared because Union was no longer rich in assets. The net assets, after peaking at Pounds 215.4m in 1989, fell to Pounds 176.7m the following year. A severe downturn in the property market will lead to the write-down of Union's property value by more than Pounds 60m in the accounts for 1991, expected to be published next month. Rationalisation of some of the businesses is also likely to lead to a substantial additional write-down of net assets. They will fall below Pounds 42m at the end of 1991 - less than a quarter of 1990's value and less than half of the called up capital of Pounds 83.7m. One lead banker said the group was in a 'real shambles' when Mr Robinson arrived. To persuade the steering committee of nine banks, led by Lloyds, to agree to extend repayment of their loans until the end of 1994, Mr Robinson had to convince them that Union had taken more effective control of all its businesses. First, he introduced management meetings every Monday morning for detailed financial planning for Union's diverse operations. Participants were also expected to decide which businesses should be sold and which should be kept. Each subsidiary was given a profit target and a cap on capital expenditure. An incentive programme meant that up to a third of managers' salaries could be generated by performance related pay. Second, Mr Robinson recruited Mr Paul Taylor, a senior executive from Lonrho, as his finance director to head up a new finance committee. This would monitor the results of the managers' meetings by ensuring that spending targets and profit forecasts were met. By the end of July the group could offer the bankers some evidence that it was taking effective control. Net debt had been reduced by Pounds 83m over the year and was falling towards the Pounds 300m mark. In addition to the effect of the financial controls, the debt had fallen because of a number of selective disposals. The South African fruit and bottling businesses were sold for Pounds 13m, the Australian ranching interests for ADollars 45m (Pounds 16.6m) and some of its smaller food companies went for Pounds 10m. Mr Robinson says Union will now focus on being a food processing and distribution group. All the other interests are up for sale. 'We will be a much smaller company, but perhaps a more interesting one.' Union has already earmarked further disposals. It is trying to sell Dewhurst and Vestey Estate property, which include office developments in the City Depending on how quickly it can reduce its debt, it may sell majority stakes by way of flotation in many of its ranching and food processing companies in South America. Mr Robinson said: 'Pension funds increasingly believe they should hold a small percentage of their funds in the less developed world. This is why flotations of some of our businesses in the emerging stock markets of South America looks a more attractive option today. We do not need to control 100 per cent of all our subsidiaries.' In the event of the worst case scenario - were Union to find that it was not reducing its debt as fast as expected - Mr Robinson says he would be prepared to sell the Dewhurst butchers chain, which is being slimmed down from 1,000 retail outlets to 600. All of this is designed to reassure the bankers who are being asked to give their approval to the Pounds 300m refinancing agreement including easier banking covenants. Mr Robinson has agreement of the big nine, which include Midland, Barclays and Standard Chartered. He now needs every one of the other 70 to agree to stretch out their loans. Bankers said they were not greatly surprised or disappointed by the details of the refinancing The smaller ones may quibble with elements of the debt rescheduling proposal. But they may, in the end, decide there is no alternative to the restructuring proposal.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> WHITE OAK PROJECT PREVIEW A TRIUMPH  </P> <P> "It was nice that he wasn't classical," a dancegoer at Wang Center for the  Performing Arts remarked in a surprised tone to her companion as Mikhail  Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project adjourned for intermission.  </P> <P> In fact, Wednesday evening's preview performance, in effect the debut of  Baryshnikov's elite mini-troupe of 10 dancers, was extravagantly nice and  classically unclassical. Harnessing Baryshnikov's handpicked team to Mark  Morris's ingenious creations turned out, not unexpectedly, to be a master  stroke, and it was rewarded with a roaring, standing ovation.  </P> <P> As Baryshnikov has said he wishes, White Oak is an egalitarian band of prime  movers, most of them veterans from ballet and modern dance. Beginning with  "Going Away Party," whose music -- by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys --  cannot obscure its smart stepping, White Oak's dancers were individually as  well as collectively compelling.  </P> <P> Baryshnikov, of course, is more equal than the others; even though he is  standing in the back of the group as they wave a howdy in "Going Away Party,"  he manages to capture attention.  </P> <P> Here, he cuts a mean diagonal as a lovelorn cowboy figure, a perfectly tumbling  tumbleweed. With his hair slicked back, wearing denim and fringe and white  boots, Baryshnikov is the odd man out as the good ol' boys and girls recapture  a bygone spirit of innocent lechery on the plains.  </P> <P> What's equally fun is Morris's lighthanded evocation of other dances. As  couples join hands and shuffle-step, they're outlining a Texas two-step. Morris  makes a square dance's Grand Right and Left by having two people switch places,  making us see, in that quote, a whole, turning circle.  </P> <P> The voluptuous -- no kidding -- Morris and the slender Baryshnikov were a tangy  contrast in the charming, flicker-footed "Pas de Poisson," set to Satie's  "Entr'acte Symphonique de Relache," with Kate Johnson.  </P> <P> Baryshnikov again played babe-in-the-wood, acting bemused by the intricacies of  performance, responding gamely to the moment of the actual pass of the poisson.  Here they're rubber and the trio passes them into the wings. Then he wilts,  sinking eloquently into the floor, eyes wide in panic, as Johnson and Morris  leave him standing out there alone.  </P> <P> But Baryshnikov's panicked pose was just that. His solo "10 Suggestions," set  to Alexander Tcherepnin's "Bagatelles," which Morris himself had danced last  year, this time offered a glimpse of a brilliant dancer creating movement  rather than a brilliant choreographer dancing. As Baryshnikov worked with the  props, from a hoop to a pith helmet, they seemed not as funny as they had when  Morris used them; now they were things that made us see how a dancer uses  space.  </P> <P> "Motorcade," a new work for the group, set to Saint-Saens Septet, and performed  by eight dancers costumed in dark-hued velvet pants, was the most classically  oriented of all the pieces. It offered Promethean poses, glimpses of dancers  Rob Besserer and Peggy Baker in ravishing turns, and moments when Besserer and  Baryshnikov were borne aloft like statues on a feast day.  </P> <P> Couples raced across the floor as if on wings; quartets reached toward each  other as they filled the stage on the diagonal. In its moments of light and  darkness, "Motorcade" magnificently captured the dynamic of the human spirit in  the way that always sets Morris' work apart.  </P></p>

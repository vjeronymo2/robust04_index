			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Observer: Yoof-speak Would you call Arnold Schwarzenegger a gym shoe or Tom Cruise a snapper? Leo Burnett wouldn't advise it. The American advertising agency has just carried out a coast-to-coast survey into the mood and idioms of America's children. As a result, it reckons it is better placed to help manufacturers wanting to sell their wares to the nation's teens and sub-teens. Information is power, it says, and language unlocks information. Hence it seems that the celebrities kids most want to meet are (in descending order) Arnold Schwarzenegger; Luke Perry (who he?); Tom Cruise; and joint fourth, Kevin Costner and Cindy Crawford. Ross Perot gets a 'notable mention' but there is no sign of George Bush or his rival Bill Clinton. No doubt they come into the snapper category. Although by no means universal, terms for anyone considered odd proliferate: in Chicago a strange person is a 'gym shoe'; in New York, a 'nad' or 'skeezer', and a 'snapper' in LA. But the longer these kids stay in celebrity-adulation mode probably the better for them; they have already considered the 'worst things about being an adult'. Of the surveyed children aged 11 to 17, 43 per cent thought 'financial responsibility' was the worst aspect of adulthood; 27 per cent thought 'having/finding a job' rated the lowest marks, but 19 per cent thought 'taxes' were the most depressing thing. Old heads on young shoulders.</p>

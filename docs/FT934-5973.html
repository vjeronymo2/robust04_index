			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy gets support at German expense Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers, increased Italy's weighting in the broker's pan-European portfolio yesterday by 3 percentage points to 8.2 per cent against a benchmark 5.3 per cent, writes Our Markets Staff. This came at the expense of Germany, which is now at 13 per cent against a 15.5 per cent benchmark. He said that the move reflected as much concern with valuation levels in Germany, as exploiting Italian opportunities. 'The lack of sensitivity to movements in short term rates will make the transition from an interest rate driven market to an earnings driven market difficult for Germany next year,' he maintained. But in Italy, the trend of inflation had improved continuously, while a L8,300bn trade deficit in the first seven months of 1992 had been converted into an equivalent surplus this year. Mr Rooney saw Italian bonds and the lira at current levels, supported by these trends, as fundamentally cheap. Politics remained the joker although any government resulting from next year's general elections would be better than the series of administrations that had dragged down the Italian economy over the past two decades. Mr Rooney had reservations about the stock market, stemming from the inability to explain its performance in terms of fundamentals, inadequate dividend growth, and the fact that the transformation of the political and economic landscape has not been replicated in the corporate sector. 'The difference is that the market has underperformed in both local and common currency terms by around 11.5 per cent so far this year and the economic fundamentals have improved,' he said. PARIS was bemused by trading in Euro Disney which fluctuated wildly, being suspended limit down twice, then gaining some 20 per cent in value from its nadir, before being suspended once more; it finally closed FFr2.20, or 7 per cent higher at FFr29.40 in turnover of some FFr158m. With its small weighting in the CAC-40 the price movement had minimal effect on the index, which raced ahead to end up 47.79 or 2.3 per cent at 2,118.40. Turnover was estimated at FFr3.7bn. It was suggested that short-covering was partly behind the market's climb yesterday, with domestic investors taking advantage of the absence of US institutions to become aggressive buyers. AMSTERDAM was pulled higher in line with other bourses, the CBS Tendency index adding 2.4 or 1.8 per cent to 135.7. Turnover was estimated to have been around Fl 1bn, helped by strength on the options market. Cyclicals returned to favour, DSM and Akzo showing respective rises of Fl 4.00 and Fl 3.00 to Fl 102.20 and Fl 178.80; good buying was also noted among financials. Further strength was seen in KNP BT, the paper group, following Wednesday's results which were not as bad as some analysts had been forecasting: the shares rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 41.70. Royal Dutch went against the trend, slipping Fl 2.10 to Fl 195.60, partly on a weaker oil price. FRANKFURT climbed on the Volkswagen four-day week agreement, and extended its gains after hours after Bavaria came in with a drop in its year on year inflation rate to mid-November. The DAX rose 18.16 to 2,047.71 and the Ibis-indicated index by another 10.09 in the afternoon to 2,057.80. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.5bn with VW accounting for DM980m of that, far ahead of its average volume. The four-day week was estimated to be worth a 20 per cent reduction in the carmaker's costs, the shares rose DM9.50 to DM412 and, in a generally strong automotive sector, Daimler continued its recovery with a rise of DM12.20 to DM717. The big results of the day came from Bayer. The prospect of an 18 per cent fall in 1993 pre-tax profits was less severe than expected, yet the shares rose only DM1.90 to DM324.50 during the session compared with DM2.70 to DM278.70 for Hoechst and DM5.10 to DM268.40 for BASF. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, head of research at James Capel in Frankfurt, observed that Bayer had been expected to produce better results than the other big two chemical stocks, which had underperformed the market in the first three weeks of November, while Bayer had outperformed. The bad results came from Metallgesellschaft, where heavy losses, no dividend and the prospect of a rights issue supported by a defensive coterie of big corporate shareholders left analysts shaking their heads in despair. STOCKHOLM saw volatile trading in Volvo after major shareholders said that they would back the proposed merger between the Swedish group and Renault of France. The B shares, which had been trading at a high of SKr431 before the announcement, fell back, closing off SKr3 at SKr407. The Affarsvarlden general index added 2.0 to 1,314.0. MILAN continued higher with sentiment helped by signs that the government had won political consensus on the need to see the budget approved by the end of the year. The Comit index rose 9.79 or 1.9 per cent to 536.06. Fiat, firm on Wednesday after it announced plans for redundancies and temporary lay-offs, bounced L235 or 6.6 per cent higher to L3,800 after demand by domestic funds sparked short covering. Speculation that the car group was thinking of selling Alfa Romeo was firmly denied by Fiat. Sip, L63 higher at L3,029, Olivetti, L25 firmer at L1,805, and Pirelli, L89 ahead at L1,849, continued to pick up ground lost earlier in the week. Benetton surged L1,140 or 5.4 per cent to L22,290 on the view that the cheaper lira could help its exports. MADRID was given a breathing space as the holiday closure in the US took American sellers out of the market. The general index closed 2.27 higher at 296.78 in turnover down from Pta37.2bn to Pta20.6bn. Electrical utilities rose in depth, led by Fenosa, up Pta14 at Ptta534, and Iberdrola, Pta16 better Pta896. Telefonica, which said on Wednesday that it was well set for Europe-wide competitition in telephone networks, rose Pta30 to Pta1,665. ZURICH was firmer, but off the day's highs, with activity restrained by the absence of US investors. The SMI index rose 9.0 to 2,726.8. Nestle continued higher after Wednesday's 10 month figures, the shares adding SFr6 to SFr1,185. Swissair added another SFr9 to SFr756, only SFr4 short of its price ahead of last weekend's announcement that the Alcazar talks had been called off. Banks were broadly higher with CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, gaining SFr40 to SFr3,455. COPENHAGEN dropped 2 per cent on late selling in thin trading, the KFX index losing 2.01 to 99.41. ATHENS was unsettled by reports that the government planned to increase taxes on share dividends by up to 10 per cent. The story was later denied. The general index dropped by 13.73 to 851.98. ISTANBUL hit a new record high on late buying, which left the composite index up 473.5, or 2.8 per cent, at 17,195.1. Buying interest concentrated on the iron and steel, cement and banking sectors, with Eregli rising TL300 to TL6,500. Turnover was estimated at TL1,400bn.

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HARD WORKER HAD MADE WAY AMONG DEMOCRATS;  </P> <P> PARTY TURNS FROM FELON IN ITS MIDST  </P> <P> Orange County Democratic leaders are attempting to distance themselves from a  convicted felon who later won a place in local party organizations through  "hard work," and even got himself elected to a state Democratic Party  committee.  </P> <P> "In politics you're always looking for people who will work hard and produce,"  county Democratic activist Chris Townsend said Tuesday. Townsend, former  president of Orange County's Democratic Associates, said the man, Howard O.  Kieffer, "was very hard-working."  </P> <P> Kieffer, 33, a marketing consultant who resides in Trabuco Canyon, was indicted  by a federal grand jury in January on charges of defrauding the government and  filing fake income tax returns that netted him $212,000 in refunds.  </P> <P> In 1984, Kieffer was convicted of two counts of felony grand theft, including  fraudulently purchasing airline tickets and illegally deeding himself a house  that he used as collateral for a loan. When the loan was foreclosed, the actual  owner, a widow, was forced to give up the home to pay for it, authorities said.  </P> <P> County Democratic Party Chairman Mike Balmages said the controversy over  Kieffer has been embarrassing to the party but said he was not sure what else  could have been done.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Guidelines  </P> <P> "There are no proscribed rules or guidelines on how to handle something like  this," Balmages said. "When allegations surface, you automatically get American  feelings that a person is innocent until proven guilty . . . you do nothing  until the allegations are proven to be true.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, Howard has apparently been convicted of something, and that  is troubling because you do want to distance yourself as a party from people  whose integrity is in question."  </P> <P> Kieffer, while refusing comment on the previous or current criminal cases, said  Tuesday that only a few of his Democratic friends had spurned him in the wake  of his legal troubles.  </P> <P> "When the indictment was first announced, I received in the first weekend  probably 150 phone calls." Kieffer said. "It was 5 or 6 days before I received  my first negative phone call, and then there were only two."  </P> <P> He added that while he awaits trial, "Life goes on and you can't just crawl in  a hole and hide. . . . I can't do that. I just have to hold my head up."  </P> <P> Kieffer ran the Laguna Hills regional office that provided get-out-the-vote and  voter registration services for presidential contender Michael S. Dukakis and  other Democratic candidates.  </P> <P> "I think I'm a good organizer, and I think I'm known as somebody who gets  things done," Kieffer said.  </P> <P> After stories of his indictment and previous convictions were published,  Kieffer was asked in February to resign from the board of the associates, a  Democratic Party support group. When he did not, he was removed, Townsend said.  </P> <P> "Because of the nature of felonies he had pled guilty to, it would be  inappropriate for him to remain on the board, which has fiduciary  responsibility of the organization," Townsend said.  </P> <P> Kieffer said he did not resign because his term was to have ended in a week in  any case.  </P> <P> Kieffer also was an alternate on the county Democratic Central Committee. He  was recently removed from that spot by the man who had appointed him, Howard  Greenebaum, who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Ron C. Packard (R-Carlsbad) in  last November's election.  </P> <P> Kieffer also has, in effect, been removed from his spot on South Orange  County's 70th Assembly District Committee, to which he was elected at the state  Democratic Party convention last month. The election was subsequently called  into question because of allegations that people ineligible to vote had  participated. New elections have been ordered for Kieffer's post as well as  officers of the district committee.  </P></p>

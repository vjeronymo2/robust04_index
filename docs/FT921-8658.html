			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The Long View: Professional fouls THERE ARE no more vulnerable victims of fraudsters than ever-so-slightly greedy old age pensioners, offered a little bit more for their money by charming and sympathetic rogues. Within the past few days Anthony Wheeler, a former mayor of Chippenham, got four years for a Pounds 1.3m swindle and Peter Clowes was sent down for ten years for stealing Pounds 14m (although investors would have lost more than Pounds 150m in Barlow Clowes without government compensation). Small investors may be a little safer for the confinement of these two, but the honesty of the financial markets remains doubtful. Two Guinness trials have collapsed or been abandoned, leaving much debate about the conduct of fraud trials; Conservative MPs are threatening legal action against Lloyd's, the venerable insurance market which was once at the centre of the City of London establishment; and the plight of the pensioners of Maxwell companies remains unrelieved - apparently the banks which received misappropriated share certificates as collateral accept no obligation to return the stolen goods. Perhaps we should not get all this out of proportion. We are seeing a temporary peak in financial crime which has emerged from the huge growth of investment, borrowing and financial trading in the 1980s. There are historical parallels with the scandals of the 1920s which led to the last wave of financial regulation, including the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act in Britain. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Glass Steagall Act date from the same period. With the financial boom over we can expect the level of newly-exposed fraud to subside quickly. Public regard for the honesty of the financial markets may not be restored quickly, however. We have fallen between two stools. At one extreme we could warn the public that the financial markets were all fundamentally dubious, and they should trust nobody. Alternatively we could impose a heavyweight regime of restrictions which could guarantee the public's safety, at the cost of crippling the flexibility and efficiency of the system. We have chosen a middle course. Pompous regulators have set up expensive structures, and bankers and insurance officials pose as paragons of virtue. The public, however, has no easy way of knowing, in the wake of the BCCI collapse, which institutions are sound. Moreover, compensation is a lottery: Barlow Clowes victims have been repaid, even though they were strictly speaking not entitled to be, while Maxwell pensioners are simply not covered. Defences are being hammered into place. This week officials of Imro, the regulatory body which authorised Robert Maxwell to control Bishopsgate Investment Management, claimed in front of a Parliamentary Select Committee that there were no grounds for turning him down. If that is true then there seems little point in the whole elaborate approach which has been developed through the Financial Services Act 1986. Of course, it may not be true, and it may be simply that the Imro men were, like most people, frightened of crossing the litigious Maxwell. Curiously, Imro has been much more ruthless in cracking down on several leading investment institutions which have run into administrative problems with their personal equity plans. They have been heavily fined because small sums went astray. On the other hand, the much bigger problems which many life assurance companies have had in administering personal pension plans have gone entirely unpunished, because they are the responsibility of another regulator, Lautro, which takes quite a different attitude. These inconsistencies are unfortunate, but the real point about the trials of Imro is that bureaucratic bodies of this kind are better at enforcing well-defined rules than they are at dealing with slippery people. Infringements involving misallocation of money or clear breaches of rules can be detected by inspectors, whereas the suspect behaviour of individuals normally has to be reported by someone and recognised as potentially dangerous by a regulator. Indeed, clients sometimes complain, but fellow practitioners or professionals such as accountants, lawyers or actuaries seldom do. Nobody shopped Robert Maxwell. Telling tales is not part of the City of London's culture but, unfortunately, our system of self-regulation assumes that it is. Protection has a price. The public scarcely lost out through business failures in the old London Stock Exchange before Big Bang. But this was because the market was run as a cartel with generous commissions and the ability to eject troublemakers. Once competition was introduced the old compensation scheme had to be abandoned. There is a particular problem when the professionals meet the public. In professional markets, dealers are essentially trying to cheat each other, within certain rather fuzzy conventions. When cases reach court it is hard to define precisely what normal custom and practice consists of, and dishonest (let alone criminal) behaviour is therefore almost impossible to prove. Should the public ever blunder into this ethical pea soup it is gravely at risk. Few private individuals were exposed to the manipulation of the Blue Arrow rights issue but more than 20,000 were tempted by the prospect of large and easy returns into becoming Names at Lloyd's. By definition these are - or were - people of substantial wealth. They trusted the professionals, and the problem was not just that the professionals claimed to be honest when they were not, but that so many of them actually believed it themselves. Within largely closed communities it is too easy for people to take it for granted that they are entitled to huge rewards for undemanding responsibilities. No bell rings when greed becomes dishonesty. Perhaps the peak of the fraud cycle is over. But in the end it may prove a mistake to try to impose arbitrary standards of business ethics across a broad front. It might be better to provide a restricted range of regulated and protected investments and services and then to warn members of the public that they stray at their peril. But a warm smile, an obsequious manner and an extra percentage point of interest might still collect quite a lot of money down Eastbourne way. How to beat the cowboys: Page III</p>

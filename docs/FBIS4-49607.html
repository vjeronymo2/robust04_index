			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The Hubei Provincial  Government has decided to do everything within its power to  assist the Dongfeng Automobile Company in becoming an auto giant  capable of building one million units annually.    The company, based in Shiyan in northwestern Hubei, is one  of  the three car manufacturers designated by the Chinese Government.    A provincial government official said that the company plans  to build 800,600 motor vehicles a year by the year 2000,  including 360,000 passenger cars.    Its annual production will rise to 1.16 million units by  2005, including 620,000 cars, the official said.    He said he believed that the implementation of the company's  development plan would enable Hubei's economy to take off.    A committee for invigorating Hubei's automobile industry has  been set up, with provincial Governor Jia Zhijie serving as its  head, he said.    It will mobilize local governments and departments to aid  the  company in carrying out its development plan.    To this end, the provincial planning commission has decided  to gear the company's production plan with the plan for the  growth of Hubei's economy as a whole, he said.    Relevant provincial departments have been requested to  include production of metals, machinery, electronic products,  rubber, engineering plastics, textiles, glass and other  auto-related goods into their long-term production plans, he  added.    In addition, provincial departments in charge of  environmental protection, taxation, land administration, urban  construction and transportation have been mandated to formulate  preferential policies in support of the company in implementing  its production plan.    Local manufacturers are being encouraged to co-operate with  the company, he said, adding that the company can become a  principal shareholder in these manufacturers.    To meet its production target for the year 2000 the company  will require 34 billion yuan in investment, the official said.    The provincial financial department has decided to allocate  one billion yuan in bank loans annually over the next five years  to help local manufacturers modernize the production of auto  parts and accessories, he said, adding that banks will increase  loans to the company.    Moreover, businesses manufacturing auto parts for the  company  will issue shares in China in a move to raise money, he said.    Economists in Hubei agreed that government backing is  essential for the takeoff of the automobile industry, as shown  in Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea.    Hubei has good conditions for expanding the auto industry,  with a whole range of well-developed related industries, such as  metallurgy, chemicals, rubber, plastics and electric power, one  economist noted.</p>

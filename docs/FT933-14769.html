			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Coal haulage probe confirmed NOTTINGHAMSHIRE Police confirmed yesterday that fraud squad officers were investigating the affairs of a coal haulage company and its subsidiaries in which the Union of Democratic Mineworkers had a minority shareholding. National Plant and Transport, the group involved, was owned by a Nottingham business family which had close contractual arrangements with British Coal during the 1984-85 miners' strike. Mining Skills, the subsidiary, is at the centre of the inquiry. It was 49 per cent owned by the union but the UDM's involvement is not believed to be part of the investigation. Police are looking at transactions between Mining Skills and the factoring subsidiaries of two banks, Confidential Invoice Discounting, of Lloyds Bank, and RoyScot, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

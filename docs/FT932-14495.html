			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Housing cash to be 'clawed back' THE INCREASE in funds for spending on local authority housing projects announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in last year's Autumn Statement, will be clawed back, a survey by the Institute of Housing suggests. The institute says today that a survey of 30 directors of housing authorities indicated that the amount raised as a result of Mr Lamont's decision to allow local authorities to spend all capital receipts generated from the sale of assets in the year to December will be far less than the Pounds 1.75bn he anticipated. The government first estimated that of this amount, Pounds 1.1bn would be available from the sale of housing assets, a figure which the Department of the Environment has revised to Pounds 950m. The institute's estimate is that housing receipts will total about Pounds 750m. Mr John Perry, director of policy at the institute, said: 'Many local authorities are finding that the capital receipts holiday has a sting in the tail. The holiday is being paid for at the expense of investment in 1994 and 1995. Government will cut Pounds 441m to pay for a relatively minor boost now.' The survey finds that although the authorities anticipate generating Pounds 150m in receipts this year, with Pounds 80m already earmarked for housing investment, there will be no new local-authority building and only 400 additional homes will be built through housing associations. The institute said that every director surveyed expressed concern about the reduction in the government's contribution to mandatory renovation grants from 75 per cent to 60 per cent.

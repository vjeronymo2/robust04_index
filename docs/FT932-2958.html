			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (4): Fierce debate over contracts - Political parties divided over radical reforms in industrial relations law TWO YEARS after the implementation of one of the most radical reforms of industrial relations law achieved in any industrialised country, New Zealanders remain divided about the benefits and costs. The Employment Contracts Act (ECA), which became law in May 1991, swept away a century of state regulation of the labour market in favour of a deregulated system which effectively by-passes trade unions. Under the old system, which dated back to 1894, most wages and conditions were set centrally in negotiations between unions and employers' representatives, and were then legally ratified as occupational 'awards.' These awards covered all workers in each trade, most of whom were also legally required to be union members. The effect was that bargaining was difficult at company level, and almost impossible at plant level. The ECA scrapped compulsory union membership and national awards in favour of civil contracts between employers and individuals or groups of workers, which are enforceable under civil law. Employees can negotiate their own contracts or appoint bargaining agents, which can be trade unions. Strikes are legal only during negotiations, but there are minimum entitlements for wages, holidays and sickness benefits. However, no consensus about the system has emerged, partly because of conflicts between various surveys as to its impact on job creation, working conditions and competitiveness. Mrs Anne Knowles, the Employers' Federations' labour market manager, says the ECA has been 'crucial to the recovery now taking place in New Zealand. It was the last link in the deregulation of the economy. 'In the past, companies had to be competitive on every aspect of their operations, except labour costs. Now they know that if they don't get a competitive edge through negotiation they can't blame anybody else,' she says. The employers complain, however, that the impact of the Employment Contracts Act has been weakened by a narrow interpretation of the law by the Employment Court, which hears allegations of illegal activity by employers. The Council of Trade Unions (CTU), agrees that the act has reduced labour costs, but claims that the ECA has failed to promote job creation, and has promoted an authoritarian management style. 'The act was a one-off hit at labour costs. It has produced a productivity boost, but the improvement in competitiveness is not sustainable because it has not been followed by an increase in business investment,' says Mr Ken Douglas, CTU president. The opposition Labour Party claims the act breaches United Nations provisions on labour market practices established by the International Labour Organisation, ILO. Mr Mike Moore, Labour leader, says that the ECA will be scrapped if the party wins the next election. There would be no return to the awards system, but trade unions would recover their lost bargaining rights. Mr Moore says such a change would bring New Zealand into line with employment practices in other advanced countries. But the prospect worries the employers. 'Any change back towards a centralised prescriptive system with special rights for trade unions or employers' associations would be a retrograde step,' says Mrs Knowles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Customs Committee arrested the account  of the major Russian state enterprise "Rosneft" demanding  payment of customs duties worth more than 148 billion rubles for  supplies of 2.6 million tonnes of oil to Ukraine.    As the Oil Information Agency learned in the Russian Customs  Committee, its leadership is not yet prepared to comment on the  incident, "because we understand that we create a precedent of  persecuting a state enterprise which fulfils orders of the  government."    At the same time, representatives of West Siberian oil and  gas enterprises told the agency's correspondent that they do not  rule out the possibility of appealing to the Russian President's  Administration's Control Department following the facts "of  absurd attempts to take the money for export of oil which we  must supply under intergovernment agreements to those who do not  pay for it." Out of the total amount of payment for this lot of  Russian oil (225 billion rubles) Kiev paid less than half.    A well-informed source in "Rosneft" said in an interview  with  the Oil Information Agency that Russian oil and gas enterprises  received an additional export quota for supplies in the summer  of 1993 of 2.6 million tonnes of oil to Ukraine in connection  with "the need to supply this oil anywhere, in order just to  unload pipelines." He said that Kiev and Moscow acted in the  framework of the Russian-Ukrainian intergovernment agreement  envisaging tough terms of payment for Russian fuel supplied to  Ukraine. "Rosneft's duty was to conclude contracts with oil  plants concerning technical organization of supplies and control  payments by the Ukrainian side.    Kiev in turn promised to attract foreign investors for  paying  Russia up to $50 million a month and to purchase up to 20  billion rubles on hard currency exchange to pay for oil  supplies. However, despite efforts by Russian organizations,  the full debt has not been repaid.    Russian government experts note the weakening of Russia's  positions on the world and domestic oil markets caused by a fall  in oil prices and non-payments crisis. In their opinion,  attempts to increase financial pressure on fuel and energy  complex enterprises may cause a sharp decline in the extraction  of oil and other fuels, as well as a sharp reduction of oil and  gas exports.</p>

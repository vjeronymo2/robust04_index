A statement by the Slovak Foreign Ministry addressed to the  members of the Danube Commission, received by CTK today, said  that Hungary's representative to the Commission had accused  Slovakia of failure to honor the official system of announcing  emergency occurrences on the Danube.    According to preliminary information by Slovak authorities,  the accident in the lock at Gabcikovo was due to man's failure  as the captain grossly violated regulations guiding passage  through the lock.    "The unequivocal conclusions stated by Hungary are evidently  aimed at discrediting the reliability of the Gabcikovo  hydroproject and its positive contribution to international  navigation and to its safety," the statement says.    It points out without specification that Hungary's  "unilateral" moves, that are at variance with its international  commitments, raise serious obstacles to international navigation.    The statement also points out Hungary's effort "to get the  Danube Commission entangled in the dispute between Slovakia and  Hungary [over Gabcikovo] even though both parties have agreed to  settle the dispute before the International Court of Justice in  The Hague."    The statement also protests against the effort to include  Gabcikovo in the agenda of the Danube Commission's  deliberations. It stresses that at the next session of the  Commission's relevant body, Slovakia will raise the question of  "seeking solution to the unfavorable navigation conditions  caused by the moves taken by Hungary."    Under agreement reached by Slovak and Ukrainian bodies the  Zernograd will be removed from the lock on Saturday [19 March].</p>

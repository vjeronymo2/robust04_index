Some 1,600 members of peace organizations and religious  groups across the country took part in the rally held in Yaizu,  Shizuoka Prefecture, to commemorate the nuclear incident, which  occurred off the Bikini atoll in the South Pacific on March 1,  1954.    In the so-called lucky dragon incident, the Japanese fishing  boat No. 5 Fukuryu Maru ("Lucky Dragon V"), which was based in  Yaizu, was showered by a cloud of radioactive ash after the  United States conducted a thermonuclear bomb test some 135  kilometers to the west of where the ship was conducting fishing  operations.    Most of the 23 crew members suffered nausea, pain and skin  inflammation and one of the crew later died.    The incident sparked outcries in Japan against the U.S.  testing of nuclear weapons and attracted worldwide interest in  the influence of radioactivity on the human body.    At the rally, the participants adopted a resolution calling  for the dismantling of all nuclear arms while the radiation  victims or their bereaved families are still alive.    Among the participants was John Anjani, who was then mayor  of  a village near the atoll and was also exposed to radioactive  ash, and Anthony Guarisco, chairman of an association of U.S.  veterans who fell victim to radioactivity from atomic testing.</p>

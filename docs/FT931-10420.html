			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gas chief vows to repel boarders - Deborah Hargreaves on a growing trend against foreign investment THE RUSSIAN gas industry is not going to make the same mistake as the oil industry and sign over its resources to foreign companies, according to Mr Rem Vyakhirev chairman of the Russian state gas production company, Gazprom. Mr Vyakhirev's voice carries much political clout in Russia as he presides over one of the country's most important sources of hard currency and one of Russia's few - perhaps its only - success stories. He also has the ear of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, ex-Gazprom chairman who is now prime minister and was once deputy to Mr Vyakhirev at an oil refinery in Siberia. His resistance to foreign involvement in joint venture gas production and transportation marks another blow to many western oil and gas companies, which have seen their ambitions in Russia increasingly frustrated. Mr Vyakhirev, who left the oil industry because of its rush to involve foreign investors, believes a lack of strategic thinking has left the industry without the wherewithal to solve its own problems. Russia could be forced to import oil in two to three years. Gazprom, on the other hand, has managed to maintain gas production in spite of a chronic lack of capital. Russia has 40 per cent of the world's gas reserves, much of which is in shallow, uncomplicated geological formations that can be developed fairly easily. Mr Vyakhirev admits that Gazprom may approach foreign companies for specific, small-scale investment projects, but he would rather see domestic gas prices raised more quickly in line with inflation to provide investment funds. The country recently raised gas prices by 200 per cent but this still leaves them way below world prices at Rbs600 (70p) per 1,000 cubic metres. 'These prices will be in place for five months and I'd like to see prices increased automatically. If not, all these additional rises will be worth a glass of vodka by the end of the year,' Mr Vyakhirev says. Inflation in Russia was running at a rate of 2,200 per cent last year. Gazprom's production chiefs agree: 'Gas prices are ridiculous; they don't even cover our costs of production', says Mr Reim Suleimanov, director general of Urengoi Gazprom in western Siberia. 'We can't invest with prices at this low level - we can barely survive.' Mr Suleimanov runs the world's biggest gas field, in Urengoi, which last year produced 280bn cubic metres of gas. Much of this is sent to western Europe via pipeline across the Ukraine. But he is painfully aware of the need to invest in new satellite fields in order to keep production steady. Otherwise it will begin to drop off from 1997. Mr Suleimanov wants to develop neighbouring fields in the giant Urengoi cluster such as Pitsovoye, Yen Yakha, North Urengoi and eventually Zapolyarnoye. He realises that these fields must be developed now in order to come on stream in four years' time, when output is falling from the main Urengoi deposit. But Mr Suleimanov does not have the funds to put into investment and Gazprom's headquarters in Moscow have so far come up with little cash. A feasibility study on the north Urengoi field has estimated development costs of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 350m. The total cost of bringing all the satellite fields into production would be more than Dollars 1bn. Mr Vyakhirev estimates that Gazprom as a whole requires Dollars 8bn to Dollars 9bn for its development plans over the next five years. The company has secured about a third of its needs in foreign bank credits and is in discussions with more banks. There is an alternative for Mr Suleimanov: he can sell gas condensate and oil on the world market for hard currency - these are produced as by-products from his gas field. Gazprom centrally receives about Dollars 4bn from these sales - half of which is allocated to the government partly to pay off debts since Gazprom was set up as a joint stock company last November. But Mr Suleimanov is not allowed to keep most of his hard currency receipts and he believes his investment funds will be slow in coming: 'It is my personal point of view that without foreign involvement, those fields will not be developed,' he says. The problem for Mr Suleimanov and other heads of production at Gazprom is that Moscow wants to retain a tight rein on their activities. 'The unified gas system was not invented; it was designed like an aircraft and it operates like a single organism,' Mr Vyakhirev says. In spite of Gazprom's transformation into a joint stock company with sales of shares planned to employees, Moscow is not offering much local autonomy. 'What is this freedom everyone is crying about? - it's like a disposable napkin. Liberty is a notion to be used for clever people, but for simple people it's just a waste,' Mr Vyakhirev believes. Urengoi Gazprom has been working to a limited extent with Bechtel Energy Resources on specialised drilling technology that will enable the company to reach deeper layers within its gas fields. So far, Bechtel has drilled two test wells at a cost of Dollars 2m each, but the company is minimising its spending until it receives a clearer message about foreign investment. Mr Alexander Margulov, director general of Yamburggasdobycha - Gazprom's production association on the giant Yamburg field 200 km (125 miles) inside the arctic circle points to certain areas for foreign investment. 'We are badly lagging behind in ecological care, completion of wells, and hi-tech equipment.' Production in Yamburg is still increasing - at a level of 178bn cubic metres a year and rising to 205bn cu m by 1995. This level can be maintained for 10 to 15 years. The role Mr Vyakhirev foresees for foreign companies is as providers of equipment and technology that is not available in Russia. 'We don't need extensive scientific assistance, but we've certainly identified certain problems that can be helped from outside,' he says Gazprom needs large diameter pipes, horizontal drilling technology, welding equipment and insulation. In addition, the company is inviting tenders from international construction companies to build a Dollars 550m PVC plant at Urengoi which would be run on local gas. 'We want to be as self-sufficient as possible: we're not planning any large-scale involvement of foreign companies,' says Mr Vladimir Rezunenko, a Gazprom board director. But Mr Rezunenko goes on to point out that even Gazprom's smaller projects such as that for the production of 5.5m tonnes of oil from the Yamburg field are large by world standards. Indeed, the tide appears to be turning in Russia against foreign involvement in joint venture gas production projects. Many foreign companies are now targeting Kazakhstan and other independent republics that are opening up to outside investment.</p>

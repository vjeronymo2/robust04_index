			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Clough denies personal payments for transfers: Venables spoke of 'bagfuls of money', says Sugar LONG-STANDING claims that unorthodox financial practices are commonplace in British soccer were fuelled yesterday when it was alleged that Mr Brian Clough, the former manager of Nottingham Forest football club, received personal payments when transferring players to other clubs. The claim was made by Mr Alan Sugar, the Tottenham Hotspur chairman, in an affidavit submitted to the High Court hearing into his attempt to sack the Spurs chief executive, Mr Terry Venables. The allegation was strongly denied by lawyers for Mr Venables. Mr Martin Mann QC, for Mr Venables, claimed that Mr Sugar had attempted to pervert the course of justice by threatening Mr Jonathan Crystal, who is a barrister, fellow Tottenham director and ally of the chief executive, unless he dropped crucial evidence from his affidavit. A separate hearing on this issue is due to start on Monday. In his affidavit, Mr Sugar claimed that when Mr Venables was trying to buy Mr Teddy Sheringham, the England international, from Nottingham Forest for Pounds 2.1m, he told the Spurs chairman that Mr Clough 'likes a bung' - a personal payment - to make transfers go smoothly. Mr Venables had told him the usual procedure was for Mr Clough to be met in a motorway service station where he would be given a bagful of money, Mr Sugar claimed. The allegation was strongly denied by both Mr Venables and Mr Clough. In an affidavit submitted to the court, Mr Venables described the claims as 'bizarre' and 'a lot of nonsense'. Mr Clough also denied that any money had passed between himself and Mr Venables over the transfer. 'The last time I was in a motorway service station, I went for a wee,' he said. Relations between Mr Sugar and Mr Venables had now deteriorated to such an extent that one of them would have to sell his shares and leave the club, Mr Mann said. He accused Mr Sugar of reneging on an agreement, reached when the two men first took control of the club in June 1991, that they would retain equal voting rights. After the club's rights issue in November 1991, when Mr Sugar extended his stake in the club from 23 per cent to 46 per cent, the chairman began a campaign to undermine Mr Venables's position, he said. In one case, Mr Sugar negotiated a deal with BSkyB without making any reference to Mr Venables, Mr Mann said. The hearing is expected to end today.

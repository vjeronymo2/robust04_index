			<p>BFN     [Text] "The job of improving public finances will be done  with a mini-budget which will have effects on this year's  deficit and on the 1995 accounts," a communique of the Treasury  said. It also analyzed the "turbulence on the financial  markets."    "To this uncertain climate have been added some internal  developments which may increase public expenses. However, these  will be balanced by special measures aimed at bringing more  money to the state," the communique added.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> We've known Marc Pally as the creator of lush, teeming universes of  deliberately disjunctive organic forms. Now it appears he also can be a  devil-may-care provocateur. If this new approach lacks the romantic near-chaos  of Pally's previous work, it still has a raffish appeal. In "Group Show," for  example, a wall of 58 small oval and rectangular paintings recycle '80s sayings  ("slow growth"), allude to subjects in the news ("junk bonds") and quote  adspeak ("early-bird special").  </P> <P> Day-Glo and eccentric colors, busy patterns, goopy textures and various styles  of lettering keep everything puttering along. But the joke is the way the  visual-aural static nearly overwhelms allusions to a famous art critic and a  couple of artists.  </P> <P> In still other works, like "Weak Link," Pally adds painted words -- vile data,  cash flow, zero gain -- to his language of images. The words give the paintings  a new stridency and pointed social relevance, threatening to destroy the  delicate ecological balance of the imagery. But Pally has taught us how to  intuit seeming disarray and imbalance as a map of the mind's wanderings. Given  the context, the angular metallic designs in "Weak Link" read as ornaments  produced by an ancient civilization; white dots on black leaf forms suggest  that mold may be setting in now.  </P> <P> With the exception of a disappointing experiment -- silver paintings textured  with bumpy vegetative forms and celestial bursts -- the remainder of the  exhibit shows Pally in firm control, a painterly Prospero commanding the  spirits of his rich and strange visual territory.

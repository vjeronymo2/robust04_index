			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AT&amp;T AND ITALTEL SIGN BROAD PACT  </P> <P> The Italian telecommunications equipment maker Italtel today signed an  agreement with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for a far-reaching  partnership in manufacturing and sales of equipment.  </P> <P> Under the accord, AT&amp;T will acquire 20% of Italtel. In exchange, Italtel's  parent, the Italian state holding company STET, will take a 20% share of  AT&amp;T-Network Systems International (ATT-NSI), a joint venture between  AT&amp;T and Philips NV of the Netherlands.  </P> <P> In addition, AT&amp;T has agreed to make a direct investment of almost $150  million in Italtel, said an official involved in the deal who requested  anonymity.  </P> <P> The accord, which was widely expected, was an important victory for AT&amp;T.  It allows the U.S. giant access to the ripe Italian telecommunications market,  which is dominated by Italtel, and improves AT&amp;T's position for the  post-1992 unified European market.  </P></p>

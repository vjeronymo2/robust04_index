			<p>BFN     [Text] Toronto, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Nearly 600 Chinese  people of various circles in the Toronto area hosted a grand  banquet at the Royal York Hotel on the evening of 23 April, to  welcome Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, who is currently on a  visit to Canada.    Zou Jiahua delivered a speech at the banquet. He said:  Canadian Prime Minister Chretien's treating the development of  relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific Region as the major  point of Canada's foreign policy will promote the development of  Sino-Canadian economic relations and trade. The potential for  developing Sino- Canadian relations is tremendous.    Zou Jiahua hoped that Chinese people in Canada will continue  to play the role of a bridge promoting friendship between the  Chinese and Canadian peoples. He also briefed those present at  the banquet on China's domestic situation.    Eggleton, president of Canada's Federal Treasury Board,  attended the banquet. In his speech he said: Canada must rely  on all people, including the Chinese people present at the  banquet, for its economic development; it cannot rely on only  mayors and governors. The activities of Chinese people play a  very important role in strengthening Sino-Canadian relations.  Chinese people in the Toronto area are very active. This is  one of the reasons for Toronto's success.    Eggleton also said the Canadian Government will seize the  opportunity to develop Sino-Canadian relations.    Representatives of local Chinese people also took the floor  at the welcoming banquet.</p>

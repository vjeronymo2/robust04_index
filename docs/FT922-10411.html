			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Voice mail comes to the rescue - Worth Watching In the aftermath of the devastating explosions that killed 200 people in Guadalajara, Mexico, last week, thousands of people desperate to hear from friends and relatives found telephone lines jammed, writes Louise Kehoe. In response Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) transformed its new corporate 'voice mail' service into an emergency message system. By making a free telephone call victims of the disaster were able to leave messages, as could callers from outside the area. Telmex staff, making use of lines not available to the public, passed on these messages. In the two days following the disaster, Telmex received some 13,000 messages to the emergency service and delivered word from victims to at least 4,000 anxious relatives and friends. What made Telmex's rapid response to this tragic event possible was a recently purchased Centigram Communications' programmable voice processing system. Designed to provide 'voice mail' services to large corporations, the system was remotely reconfigured from the manufacturer's California headquarters in a matter of minutes.

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Unibank chief to quit as losses soar UNIBANK, the Danish bank, yesterday reported a 1992 loss of DKr4.66bn (Dollars 737m), compared with losses of DKr1.65bn in 1991. This is the biggest loss ever reported by a Danish bank. Mr Hugo Schroder, chairman of the supervisory board, will resign at the bank's annual meeting in April 'as a consequence of the highly unsatisfactory result for the bank in 1992'. The company will not pay a dividend for the second consecutive year. The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the year was 11.6 per cent on a balance sheet which was slimmed from DKr263bn to DKr221bn. Equity capital declined from DKr15.4bn to DKr10.7bn while the total capital base was unchanged at DKr20.8bn. Mr Thorleif Krarup, chief executive, said the bank did not expect to need new capital in 1993. He forecast a reduced loss and a moderate further reduction in the balance sheet for the current year. He said that on an unchanged balance sheet total equity capital would need replenishing if the bank loses much more than DKr3bn in 1993. The 1992 loss was caused by bad loss provisions of DKr6.28bn, up from DKr5.4bn in 1991, and a loss on the value adjustment of the securities portfolio of DKr492m compared with gain of DKr1.15bn in 1991. A loss of DKr656m, up from DKr487m in 1991, by the bank's London subsidiary, Unidanmark Holding, contributed to the group's loss. The losses in London have arisen almost entirely as a result of property engagements. The bank's forecast of a reduced loss in 1993 assumes unchanged interest rates and share prices (which fell by 25 per cent last year), continued slack demand for credit and high bad loss provisions.</p>

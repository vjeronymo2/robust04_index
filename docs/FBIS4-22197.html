			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, chief of staff </F> and first deputy commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, under  the rubric "From the Standpoint of a Professional"; "The Black  Sea Fleet: Myth and Reality"]    [Text] The notion that Ukraine does not need to create its  own Naval Forces and that the Black Sea Fleet is one and  indivisible and fully capable of defending the interests of both  Ukraine and Russia on the southern maritime border is currently  being promoted with increasing persistence in the mass media and  in statements by Russian political leaders at various levels and  by high-ranking officials of the Navy of the Russian Federation  and the Black Sea Fleet. Without entering upon a discussion of  the political reasons behind these statements and the reasons  why the interests of Ukraine have become so dear to the Black  Sea Fleet, I would like to express my views from a professional  standpoint regarding the military potential of today's Black Sea  Fleet and its present condition.    An objective analysis shows that today this Fleet is not  capable of successfully performing its tasks. The claims about  its high level of combat readiness are pure myth that belie the  real state of affairs. Numerous facts attest to this. The Black  Sea Fleet is equipped with obsolete models of missile weaponry  of the former USSR, some of which are no longer produced by  industry. For the past seven to ten years, no regular  maintenance [planovi remonty] has been performed on the  missile/artillery weaponry [raketno-artyleriyska zbroya], and  only breakdown repairs [avariyno-vidnovchi remonty] are being  carried out. Considering that the average age of the ships is 15  to 20 years and that lately no funds have been spent on their  maintenance, it is obvious even to a nonspecialist that the  Fleet will die of its own accord by the year 2000 because it  will be morally obsolete [moralno zastarilyy], as well as  because of its technical condition. Given their service life and  technical condition, it makes no sense to modernize and  refurbish these ships. The intensity and quality of ensuring  their combat readiness has dropped for many reasons. One-time  sorties by a group of 20-25 ships are hardly proof of the  Fleet's might and combat readiness. Hence, it is a myth to  describe this Fleet as a guarantor of the CIS.    For several years now, no new surface or underwater ships  and  no auxiliary vessels have been added to the Black Sea Fleet. The  majority of the combatant ships need both minor and capital  repairs.    Currently, 20 combatant ships of the Black Sea Fleet, five  submarines, 20 auxiliary vessels, and five special-purpose  vessels are undergoing repairs at Ukrainian ship repair  facilities. Plans calls for sending another 77 ships and vessels  for repairs.    As we know, even the shortest halt in the development of  military equipment is intolerable, because it becomes both  morally and physically obsolete very rapidly. Thus, if the ships  of the Black Sea Fleet are not being equipped with the latest  equipment today, one can hardly speak with any credibility about  their high level of combat readiness.    Take, for example, one of the mine-sweeping elements  [divizion tralshchykiv] of the 68th brigade of the Sea Area  Defense Force [OVR]. Half the mine-sweepers in this element were  put into service before 1975, or almost 20 years ago. Their  twenty-year-old sweeping and other equipment is hardly likely to  be suited to sweeping for today's mines.    The situation in other subunits, units, and formations of  surface ships is similar. Nor is the combat readiness of the  Black Sea Fleet's submarines up to the necessary level. There  are plans to write some of them off as unsuited for further  military service. Some have been unable to sail for a year  because of damage to some material part, because their storage  batteries have run down, etc. For example, the storage batteries  in all the submarines in one formation have been fully depleted  or are nearing depletion, and the submarines have been off  combat-ready status since February of this year. The command of  the Black Sea Fleet is planning to remove them from active  service in the combat-ready forces and mothball them.    One hundred percent of the aircraft fleet of the Black Sea  Fleet needs to be renewed. Due to a lack of fuel and lubricants  [PMM] and spare parts, there are almost no training flights for  aviation personnel. Under such circumstances, the skills and  expertise of flight personnel grow rusty.    The hydrographic department of the Black Sea Fleet is not  performing its full range of duties from Izmayil to the village  of Chornomorske and in the vicinity of Yalta because there are  no funds to pay rent for this territory. The Black Sea Fleet is  in a difficult financial situation.    There are extremely serious problems in the staffing of the  Fleet's subunits, ships, and units with command cadres. For  example, only one-third of the ships in the mine-sweeping  element [divizion morskykh tralshchykiv], of which we spoke  earlier, have Combat Section-1 [BCh-1] and Combat Section 2-3  [BCh2-3] staff commanders. Only 60 percent of the slots for  warrant officers [michmany] and 50 percent of those for petty  officers [starshyny] are filled. Every second ship lacks such  leading specialists as sonar operators [akusty] and radiometric  operators [radiometrysty]. When making sorties for military  training exercises, ships are forced to "borrow" sailors, petty  officers, warrant officers, and officers from the ships  remaining in port.    A similar situation exists in many other subunits. At  present, 20 percent of all junior officer slots are unfilled.  Graduates of Russian military schools are unwilling to serve in  the Black Sea Fleet because of the unstable situation.    The command of the Black Sea Fleet is forced to reorganize  the Fleet. This reorganization anticipates retiring a number of  obsolete and unsailable [nekhodovi] ships and transferring their  specialists into the crews of operating ships. Certain subunits  and units of the Black Sea Fleet are being reorganized, and  ships and vessels are being removed from active service and  mothballed.    For example, in September of last year, a separate  helicopter  regiment was disbanded in one of the garrisons. A radiotechnical  observation platoon [radiotekhnichnyy vzvod sposterezhennya] was  disbanded at one of the bases, which had a sharply negative  impact on navigation in this region of the Black Seal. The  construction of a secure command post [zakhyshchenoho komandnoho  punktu] of the staff of the Black Sea Fleet has been frozen. The  expensive equipment that had already been installed there is  being stolen.    The incidence of theft and squandering of equipment and  other  property is very high in the Black Sea Fleet. The number of such  incidents is rising in spite of the fact that criminal charges  have been lodged in some instances. As, for example, in  connection with the disapperance in one of the units of 44  silver-zinc batteries valued at many millions of rubles.    The number of ships, vessels, and military equipment that is  being written off, as it were, is also very large. All this is  being done unilaterally, without the approval of the Ukrainian  side, even though, as has already been stressed, the Black Sea  Fleet in this transitional stage belongs to Russia and Ukraine  in equal parts. Nevertheless, the fleet takes orders only from  Moscow. Thus, the Commander in Chief of the Navy of the Russian  Federation issued an order on 24 August 1993 instructing that 15  combatant ships and vessels, including the SKR Krasnyy Krym  [guided missile destroyer Kashin class DDG], several submarines,  amphibious assault, and other ships be written off during  1993-94. In the aviation units, aircraft equipment and motor  vehicles [aviatsiyna i avtomobilna tekhnika] are being written  off in bulk and by the piece, as they say.    The large-scale commercial activity on the Black Sea Fleet  cannot help but be of great concern as well. This activity is  also being carried on unilaterally, without the participation of  the Ukrainian side and without handing over 50 percent of the  earnings from the sale of this property to Ukraine as required  by the existing agreements. The PSK Donbass [coastal rescue  ship], the SRZK Ladoga and Kursk [AGI Mayak class] have already  been sold to commercial structures at below-market prices, and  the SRZK Ritsa [AGI Mayak class] has been handed over to the  hydrographic department to be passed on to businessmen. The  RS-239 and the PAS Kuban [personnel support ship] have been  given to Bulgaria purportedly in payment for repairs performed  for the Black Sea Fleet.    The facts cited above are only the visible tip of the  ruinous  process of squandering and theft that is taking place in the  Black Sea Fleet. Much of what is happening here is veiled in  secrecy. And the commands of the Navy of the Russian Federation  and of the Black Sea Fleet fiercely defend these secrets. What  other explanation is there for the categorical rejection of the  insistent and frequent demands of the Ukrainian side that a  competent bilateral commission conduct an inventory of the Black  Sea Fleet's assets and determine what it possessed on 6 December  1991?    It is clear from the facts presented above, as well as many  other facts known to us, that to speak of the Black Sea Fleet as  a guarantor of Ukraine's security is, at best, irresponsible.  The Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine, and the borders of  Ukraine are protected by her Armed Forces, including those that  are stationed in the autonomous republic.    The security of the people of Ukraine can be guaranteed only  by her own Naval Forces. According to the document signed by the  two presidents in Yalta, these Naval Forces, like the Navy of  the Russian Federation, are to be created on the basis of the  existing Black Sea Fleet. Only after this has been done will it  be possible to consider unifying the command of the two fleets,  which could ultimately guarantee the security of Ukraine and  Crimea as well as the Russian Federation on the southern  maritime perimeter.</p>

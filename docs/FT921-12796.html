			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (35): PostScript TIMES HAVE not been propserous for collective-fund investors. Even with the recovery in world stock markets during 1991, ten out of the 15 unit trusts sectors covered in our tables, and ten out of the 13 investment trust sectors, have incurred a loss over the last two years. Worst of all were those trusts investing in Japan, with the average unit trust in the area losing 35 per cent over two years, and the average investment trust more than 40 per cent. Even over the longer five-year period, many trusts failed to beat the 64.6 per cent return on index-linked National Savings. Four investment trust sectors managed to do so, but no unit trust sector achieved this feat. The brightest sector has been UK income growth investment trusts, several of which now stand at a premium to net assets. The elimination of the discount has boosted the share-price performance of this sector. The individual investment trust leader over five years is the tiny Capital Gearing trust. Among unit trusts, the five-year champion is Newtown Income; the recent poor performance of the Japanese stock market has meant that the previous star, Schroder Japanese Smaller Companies, has slipped back. The five-year performance records of collective funds ought to pick up in November, when the 1987 stock market crash will start to drop out of the statistics. For the moment, it is really only over the 10-year span that the benefits of collective fund investment can be seen. The average UK equity income trust, for example, turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 5,033 between January 1982 and January 1992, and the Key Income fund turned the same sum into Pounds 7,480. The difficulty for potential investors is that past performance, while a useful guide, sends out some contradictory signals. Capital Gearing has turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 2,625 over five years, but over the last two years it has turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 536. Which is the better indicator of its future performance? Fidelity Japanese Special Situations is seventh in its sector over five years, but 67th over two. Nor do the performance figures settle the thorny question of whether unit or investment trusts offer the better prospects to the small investor. Investment trusts seem to have the performance edge, as measured by these tables, but a good deal of this due to discounts narrowing. Such narrowing cannot occur again. Indeed, the volume of investment trust new issues creates a chance that the discount could widen once more. The relative performance of unit trusts could look alot better in five years time.</p>

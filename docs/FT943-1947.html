			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Technip investors to cut stakes The principal shareholders in Technip, the French engineering group, are planning to reduce their stakes in the company, possibly through a flotation on the Paris stock exchange, Technip said yesterday. Elf Aquitaine and Total, France's two big oil groups, Gaz de France, the state-owned utility group, and ISIS, which is part of the state's Institute Francais de Petrole, hold the shares in the company. The largest stakes are held by Elf and ISIS, which each own 35.9 per cent of the shares. Technip, which has annual sales of FFr7.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn), is mainly involved in engineering and construction work for the oil, energy and petrochemicals sectors. Last year it achieved net profits of about FFr285m, an increase of 25 per cent. The company is active in all of the world's main geographical markets, and derives 92 per cent of its turnover from exports. It has a workforce of 5,500. The proposed sale, which could take place by the end of the year, depending on market conditions, would involve a French and international offering. Banque Nationale de Paris and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as advisers and lead managers of the issue, while Schelcher Prince has been selected as sponsoring broker. The sale of shares in Technip, which has been under consideration for several months, would assist its international development, according to industry analysts in Paris.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Spies turn their gaze to world of big business / A look at the growth of routine industrial surveillance work by MI5 and MI6 LONDONERS watching the completion of the costly riverside headquarters buildings for MI5 and MI6, the organisations which lie at the hub of Britain's intelligence services, may be forgiven for asking exactly what the tenants will find to do. The end of the Cold war and Mr John Major's pledge to unravel Britain's secretive society might be seen as good reasons to scale down the state's intelligence-gathering networks. But this week's claims that a number of large British and foreign companies have been the subject of routine surveillance throws light on an aspect of the security services' work which is thought to be growing. Although the old, politically based framework for securing information remains intact, the intelligence services are believed to be taking increasing advantage of the growing globalisation of business. Multinational companies, often operating in highly sensitive defence-related industries, can provide an alternative vehicle for monitoring and gathering information. They may offer a conduit for useful information on the transfer of sensitive technology and on arms sales, as well as on more general economic intelligence. Among the companies identified in yesterday's Financial Times as having come under scrutiny by the security forces, GEC Marconi is one of the most obvious targets. From its secluded, low-profile headquarters in Stanmore, north London, the company is at the forefront in developing highly sophisticated, defence related products. Some of its electronic systems are assumed to be deployed by the security services. A senior executive of Lonrho, the international trading group, said he was 'not surprised' it had been mentioned as a target. He claimed Mr Tiny Rowland, the company's chief executive, had been considered 'offside' by the authorities in the late 1980s, although he believed relationships had improved since Mr Major had become prime minister. Rolls-Royce, another name mentioned, is heavily engaged in defence work and has associates closely involved in the nuclear industry. General Motors of the US, which is also identified, owns Hughes Aircraft, one of the largest missile manufacturers in the US. Spying between rival companies is well-established. ICL, the computer manufacturer, issued warnings to staff more than 20 years ago about the dangers of industrial spies. Staff were told not to throw scrap paper in waste paper baskets or to leave ribbons in typewriters. The concept of govern-ment-approved intelligence- gathering in the corporate sector is not new. There have been some suggestions that as far back as 1967 some British companies were under official surveillance on the in-structions of senior ministers. Intelligence services are thought to maintain a watch on international businessmen with high-level government contacts - a description which fitted Robert Maxwell perfectly. The intelligence services' ability to collect information does not rely on a late-night rummage in wastepaper baskets. One expert in the corporate intelligence sector says private operators occasionally come across evidence of MI5 - known in the business as Box 500 - or MI6 activities. These are invariably identifiable because of the deployment of highly sophisticated electronic intelligence-gathering equipment, unavailable to most specialists. Sometimes the contact is more direct. Most telecommunications equipment in the modern office, including computers, telephones, telex and fax machines can be intercepted, or in some cases monitored from outside a building by reconstructing data from 'leaking' radiation emissions.</p>

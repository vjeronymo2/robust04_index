			<p>BFN     [Text] The task force on hard drugs has mapped out new  strategies to eradicate drug trafficking. They include the use  of lectures, conferences, seminars, as well as symposia and a  massive public enlightenment campaign to educate the public on  the consequences of drug abuse. In addition, more tribunals  have to be set up throughout the country to try drug offenders.  The chairman of the task force, Brigadier General (Ishaya  Bamaiyi), gave the information yesterday in Lagos when members  of the task force visited some foreign embassies and high  commissions in the country. He advised the international  community to assist the federal government in its efforts to  eradicate drug abuse.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rail men made outdated pay structure point seven years ago Sir, It is ironic that Robert Taylor should lead his report with a comment from Railtrack chairman Robert Horton complaining about an 'outdated pay structure' ('Railtrack takes the route to modernisation', June 22). RMT (NUR) made this point seven long years ago. The existing pay structure has developed over decades. BR traditionally preferred to pay low basic rates of pay and build up earnings by overtime, supplements and allowances. This was because it was cheaper to employ labour on this basis. Incidentally, Robert Taylor misunderstands some elements in the package. Isolation allowance is paid for isolating current and taking on extra responsibility in abnormal working conditions, not for working in an isolated area. But I am surprised that he omits to mention that the original package of measures (including the 5.7 per cent with strings offer) was a productivity deal with a clause committing the union to further productivity measures. The government, with all the ineptness we have now come to expect, managed to blow the deal out of the water, although I believe it met the criteria it seems so keen to defend. Changes in working practices are not being opposed by RMT, although we have reservations about some elements Railtrack proposes. Job evaluation, for example, is not a panacea and our experience in other parts of the industry is that, far from solving problems, it creates new ones. RMT's objections to the package put by Railtrack at Acas are, first, it does not address the claim and, second, it is a very poor deal for signalling grades. Even if we ignore past productivity it does not recognise new productivity. At very best it means an average of Pounds 4 per week increase in gross earnings. The reality is Railtrack cannot guarantee any increase for any individual because of the way the package has been constructed. Not only is job evaluation difficult to predict, Railtrack admits it is not ready to introduce annualised hours. Juggling existing monies from one pocket to another is not an increase in pay. Furthermore, 30 per cent of signalling grades will be considerably worse off. Mr Taylor asserts that RMT should have pressed the claim more resolutely in the past. Does he mean that we should have taken strike action seven years ago as the only way we could have forced the issue? That is a strange argument for the FT to articulate. This dispute has to be resolved by talking to each other. As Mr Taylor reveals, the differences behind the rhetoric are not unbridgeable. If the government leaves negotiators to settle the issues realistically we have already proved a deal is possible. Transport secretary John MacGregor's latest intervention raises questions about his sincerity in seeing this straightforward industrial dispute resolved.

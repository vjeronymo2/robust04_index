			<p>Seeking      to force Washington to accept Pyongyang's unilateral  withdrawal from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), North  Korea has notified the U.S. side at Panmunjom of the  establishment "a new negotiation body" representing the Korean  People's Army.  According to the North Korean news agency KCNA on  24 May, a "Panmunjom mission," headed by a North Korean  lieutenant general, has been set up with a view to establishing a  new "peace arrangement" to replace the MAC.  Clearly moving to  establish a precedent for its functioning, the mission, through  its "chief liaison officer," formally protested the recent  shipment of U.S. Patriot missiles to South Korea.  Pointedly  disregarding the existence of the United Nations Command (UNC),  the protest was lodged with the "U.S. Forces side."  Pyongyang  had been boycotting the MAC since March 1991, when a South Korean  general was named to head the UNC, and in April had called for  DPRK-U.S. talks on a new peace accord to replace the 1953  Armistice Agreement that established the MAC (Trends, 4 May 1994,  pages 3-4).

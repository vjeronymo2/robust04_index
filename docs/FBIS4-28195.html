			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Soe Win Nyo: "The 21-Member Orchestra"] </F>   [Text] Many people believe that the most powerful person  in Burma is Secretary-1 Khin Nyunt. However, Khin Nyunt is not  the most powerful person in control of the political path of the  country. In reality, Khin Nyunt himself, along with all the  other members of the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration  Council], are mere puppets being manipulated from behind the  scenes. The body behind them is called the state's steering  committee, led by Bo Ne Win or the 21-Member Committee. This  body was not formed in a hurry. The 21-member Committee is a  new name of Our (?Red Army) Group, which was formed during the  four eights [August 1988] democratic uprising to stage  counterstrikes and to quash the demonstrations.    Members of this body were hardcore BSPP [Burma Socialist  Program Party] members, who supported the BSPP until its last  days. They did not even join the NUP [National Unity Party]  which is the BSPP under a new name formed without much ceremony  to prolong its life. Among them were Sein Lwin -- known as the  butcher of Rangoon -- Dr. Maung Maung, Aye Ko, Kyaw Htin, and  Thura Tun Tin, and last executives of the BSPP. The purpose of  this body is to continue holding on to national sovereignty to  protect their lives and property. That is why they advocate the  participation of Defense Services in the leading role in the  future politics and making the Defense Services a government  within the government while they try to remain as a government  outside the government. However, unfortunately for them, there  are two factions within the body.    One faction is led by the butcher Sein Lwin with Khin Nyunt  and Myo Nyunt as members. This faction does not carry out  political reforms at all and upholds the total (?obliteration  policy). Another faction is led by Thura Tun Tin with Kyaw Htin  and Dr. Maung Maung as members. This group is willing to have  political reforms that do not affect their standing. (?Like  killing two birds with one stone), they want to gently change  the situation in Burma while trying to create their exit.    The antagonism between the two factions was evident in the  matter over the appointment of the deputy commander in chief of  the Defense Services. It took one year to appoint the deputy  commander in chief of the Defense Services while the two  factions argued over who should be selected. In the end, Maung  Aye, who is neutral, does not belong to either faction, and gets  along with both factions, was appointed as the deputy commander  in chief with the consent of both factions.    There is antagonism between the two factions and internal  strife within each faction.    Although the like-minded Sein Lwin and Khin Nyunt belong to  the same faction, they once had differences over the so-called  SLORC Ruby, which was smuggled out of the country by Sein Lwin  and Naypyidaw Than Htut. Sein Lwin will never be able to  forgive Khin Nyunt for exposing the smuggling of the SLORC Ruby.  Sein Lwin took this incident as an extreme insult to him by  Khin Nyunt, who is very much junior to him. Meanwhile, Khin  Nyunt is holding this criminal act of gem smuggling as Sein  Lwin's weak point. Both of them are selfish, arrogant, cruel,  and cowardly. That is why it is impossible for two lions to  share the same cave. It is the nature of cowards to strike  first if they think they will be attacked. That is why their  cooperation will be temporary and based on their interests.    Moreover, Khin Nyunt's display of influence is an annoying  sight to others. The worst is that Khin Nyunt is acting like an  officious person everywhere because he is being favored by Bo Ne  Win. He is also copying Bo Ne Win's style by frequently  presenting his wife at state functions. Nowadays, Khin Nyunt's  wife, Dr. Khin Win Swe, appears quite often in the newspapers.  Now Khin Nyunt is presenting his wife the way Bo Ne Win used to  present Daw Khin May Than [Madame Ne Win]. This shows Khin  Nyunt is aiming for Bo Ne Win's dictator post.    Because Bo Ne Win is still around, the antagonism between  the  two factions and internal strife within each faction are kept  quiet. If Bo Ne Win dies then there will be no way to control  the antagonism between the factions, and there will be a big  explosion. It is certain that Ne Win is the most powerful  person in this body. Ne Win's visit to Singapore for medical  treatment in the last week of January clearly shows his  influence is still maintained in this committee and in the  Defense Services like before.    While meeting with Japanese journalists on 17 January,  before  Ne Win's visit to Singapore, Khin Nyunt said Bo Ne Win's health  is good good with the exception of general complaints and that  he has been staying peacefully with his family since his  retirement from politics. Soon after Khin Nyunt's remarks, Bo  Ne Win left for Singapore for eye and dental treatments. It  shows Bo Ne Win still has an influence on Burma. Another point  is a growing internal conflict in the Defense Services due to  dissatisfaction in the Defense Services concerning Khun Nyunt's  behavior. Nowadays there are many cases of insubordination,  desertion, and conflicts among the regimental commanders in the  SLORC's Defense Services. Bo Ne Win, who still has an influence  on the Defense Services, controlled the situation without saying  a word by presenting himself in such a way as to show that he is  still alive and in good health, and to demonstrate that these  things should not happen in the Defense Services.    Bo Ne Win did the same thing in 1989 when he attended the  Resistance Day dinner party in his capacity as a patron of war  veterans to control the Defense Services, which were then marked  by a power struggle and jockeying of positions between the  democratic-leaning commanders and commanders like Khin Nyunt,  who are reckless and self-seeking.    It is certain that there are cracks appearing in their  steering committee, and the situation of the Defense Services is  also not so good. Moreover, their steering committee now looks  like a damaged boat rolling from side to side and tossing on the  waves without any control. It seems their broken boat will not  be able to continue the journey. In accordance with its name,  the steering committee, the committee members will have to show  the noose to the public that will be placed around their necks  for unjustly killing thousands of people and for the crimes they  have committed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Social Democratic Party  [SPD] has strongly criticized the German Government's military  aid for Turkey. It has never been clarified whether these  weapons have been used against Kurds, SPD Bundestag group  chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose said in the Bundestag today. If the  German Foreign Ministry is now requesting proof of such  allegations from human rights groups, then this is "evidence of  a miserable failure on the part of the Foreign Ministry over  many years."    Klose advocated civilian CSCE observers investigating  conditions in Turkey. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  (Free Democratic Party [FDP]) must launch a relevant initiative  immediately. The CSCE has responsibility for this, not least  because the conflict is threatening to extend beyond Turkey.    Klose added that Germany is greatly affected because the  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) does not shrink back from  terrorism even in the Federal Republic. This is unacceptable.  Klose stressed that those who abuse the right to hospitality  must be "prosecuted, sentenced, and expelled." However, the  expulsion orders can only be executed "if, in each individual  case, proof is furnished that the deportee will not be tortured  or killed in Turkey." [passage omitted]</p>

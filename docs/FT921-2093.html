			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / MMC to probe card charges THE OFFICE OF Fair Trading confirmed yesterday that it had started to investigate a recent price increase in the credit-card services which banks provide to retailers, David Barchard writes. Barclays, National Westminster and Midland banks said recently they were seeking increases in the commissions. The banks say the amount of the increase would be very small as the commissions average 1.6 per cent of each transaction. They are seeking an increase that will push the average towards 2 per cent. This would very nearly restore commissions to their level four years ago, before the banks began to compete against each other in this area and started cutting their prices. 'We have launched an informal investigation following complaints from the retailers' consortium and other retailers,' the OFT said yesterday. If the OFT found strong evidence of anti-competitive activities by the banks it could refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Retailers say the increase demanded by the banks could force them to raise prices. But the banks suggest that the difference to most retailers could be very small - perhaps as little as 14p in each Pounds 100 of credit card sales.</p>

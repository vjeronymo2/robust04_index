			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (17): For a few dollars more - Performance Measurement WHEN MR Maurice Stonefrost of the British Rail pension fund was commissioned more than a year ago by the National Association of Pension Funds' Investment Committee to head an independent inquiry into performance measurement, it was at a time of intense controversy over so-called 'short-termism' by City fund managers. There had been a series of hostile takeover bids for British companies. Industrialists were quick to allege that fund managers were too ready to accept a few pence more per share from a takeover bidder rather than back existing managers. Moreover, they wanted ever-higher dividends, regardless of the year-by-year fortunes of companies. A lot of captains of industry were eager to suggest that the quarterly performance measurement to which British pension funds are typically subjected was a prime source of short-termism. In the event, when the Stonefrost Committee reported in January this year it became evident that (as in previous inquiries) such prejudices had failed to stand up to detailed scrutiny. Performance measurement emerged primarily as a technical matter rather than a key controversial theme of industrial politics. Nevertheless, the committee made several important points: First, the background. Two performance measurement services are dominant in the UK pension fund business. The bigger is that of the World Markets Company, originally a soft commission service of Edinburgh stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie, but now owned by the US financial giant Bankers Trust. In 1990 WM, still based in Edinburgh, analysed 2,464 pension fund portfolios in the UK, and more than 2,000 were regarded as suitable for inclusion in the aggregate data relating to WM's 'universe' of funds. At the end of 1990 these WM-measured funds were valued at Pounds 209bn, representing, according to WM, some 77 per cent of the UK pension fund industry (which by implication was worth about Pounds 270bn at market value on that date). The second company is Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) which was formed some years ago out of the separate measurement operations of the actuarial firms Bacon &amp; Woodrow, R Watson and Mercer Fraser, and was later enlarged by the incorporation of the Noble Lowndes service. During 1990 Caps measured 1,495 UK pension funds in its Trustee Service, worth Pounds 127bn. Though the Caps service is smaller, its results are in some ways more representative of the externally managed company pension funds. The WM Pension Fund Service, for its part, includes more of the giant Pounds 1bn-plus public sector schemes which in certain respects have different characteristics, with much higher investments in directly-owned property, for instance. At the end of last year the typical Caps fund held only 2.3 per cent of its assets in property, but the corresponding WM figure was some 9 per cent. Nevertheless, the overall investment performance indicated by the two services was almost identical in 1990: minus 10.6 per cent for WM and minus 10.5 per cent for Caps. Over 10 years WM shows an average annual return of 15.1 per cent, Caps of 15.4 per cent. In addition there continue to be one or two independent performance services run by consultants such as Godwins and Wyatt, although these are confined to fairly specialist roles. There are good technical reasons for measuring performance frequently - at least quarterly - to achieve accuracy in the rate of return calculations. But nobody suggests that fund managers should be assessed on such a short-term basis (let alone on the monthly basis on which US funds are often measured nowadays). The Stonefrost Committee was concerned that fund managers should not be held to account more frequently than once a year, and that trustees should fully understand the meaning of the performance numbers, ideally with the help of an annual briefing by the measurers. It was also convinced that greater effort was needed to relate performance measurement to the individual benchmarks or objectives which, more and more, are being laid down for particular pension funds. The broad 'league table' approach, relating to median-beating objectives or top quartile targets, though still popular, is being rendered increasingly obsolete by the diversity of benchmarks. According to Mr Stonefrost: 'It is up to the funds themselves to seek to be measured against like funds.' One result may be an increasing segmentation of the performance measurement process. 'We don't think that the median is going to go out of vogue,' says Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Caps, 'but there may be a proliferation of medians.' Aside from short-termism, the most controversial aspect of pension fund performance measurement is probably the use (or rather, misuse) of performance data by the fund managers themselves. The ability to outperform over periods of three to five years has become absolutely fundamental to the success of fund management companies in winning new business (even though statistical evidence suggests there is little connection between past and future performance). There is in consequence tremendous pressure on managers to manipulate the data for marketing purposes. Thus the Stonefrost Committee commented critically on a survey which indicated that two-thirds of managers claimed to beat the median. It called for an industry committee to be set up to establish standards for performance statistics in advertising and marketing by investment managers. The sort of manipulation which goes on is that managers leave out of their records the funds from which they have been sacked (these tend, of course, to be the bad performers), and they may leave in or out, on a subjective basis, according to whether it suits them or not, funds on which there is a restricted brief. Also, they may advertise performance over odd periods, thus contriving to minimise the impact of particular bad years. A new committee is now being formed, through the NAPF and the fund managers' trade body, the Institutional Fund Managers' Association, to establish a code of conduct and thus clean up one of the murkier corners of the performance measurement business.</p>

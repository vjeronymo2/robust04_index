			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT: 'WHY NO OUTRAGE?'  </P> <P> After reading your editorial "Why No Outrage?" (Jan. 10), I became outraged!  You bet! But who really cares? I was outraged when Ronald Reagan was elected  President the first time because his math was all screwed up. When you think  that you can lower taxes, raise defense spending, and balance the budget you  should have your head examined.  </P> <P> I wrote to you protesting his reelection in 1984 after watching Reagan give a  speech about his perceived greatness at the Republican Convention. His math was  still screwed up! That was outrageous! He should have been arrested for lying  to the public.  </P> <P> But after watching this ding-dong get elected twice and people wanting him to  run for yet another term, I've given up! When you're outnumbered by ding-dongs  you better run for the hills! Are the patients really running the asylum?  Apathy, apathy, apathy.  </P> <P> JON CORMIER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

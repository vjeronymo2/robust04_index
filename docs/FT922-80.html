			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Passionate issue high on political agenda: The row over abortion threatens to become a key election factor NO TOPIC in contemporary America provokes such passion as abortion. For every poll showing 70 per cent of the country, including a majority of Catholics, in favour of reproductive rights, another will reveal a similar number believing that to terminate a pregnancy is to commit a form of murder. Not since the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements of more than a generation ago have the streets been so full of protest. Hardly a week goes by without an attempt being made to close down, often violently, abortion clinics. In early April as many as 1m people marched peacefully through Washington in favour of freedom of choice. The language of the abortion debate is extreme. Last week Mr Randell Terry, of the anti-abortion Operation Rescue, had no compunction in declaring that 'anyone who says they are a Christian and yet supports child killing is a liar and a sheep in wolf's clothing'. Mr David Andrews, of the Planned Parenthood Federation, can put it just as starkly. 'We have moved,' he said, again last week, 'from Roe vs Wade (the 1973 Supreme Court ruling establishing the constitutional right to an abortion) to this administration vs American women, and American women will not stand for a loss of their reproductive rights'. Reconciliation seems impossible, so entrenched are the respective positions, leaving any resolution to the courts, government and politicians. And this is an election year. Six justices on the nine-member Supreme Court were elevated by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Their nominations were designed to advance the conservative agenda in general and to exclude those known to believe in freedom of choice in particular. As is often the case, the judges are beginning to behave in ways not entirely intended by the presidents who promoted them. Three justices in particular - Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, both Reagan appointees, and David Souter, named by Mr Bush - have begun to inhabit a broad middle ground, pragmatic, often narrow in judgment and disinclined to set constitutional precedent. They stand between Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, both of moderate Republican lineage, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the more doctrinaire right. Justice Byron White, named by President John Kennedy and the only Democratic appointment, has become more conservative over the years. Twice in the last week the new centre turned down Bush administration arguments - on religion in schools and on habeas corpus. Their general tendency seems to be to uphold the rights of states to set their own law, but last Friday they felt compelled to tell Mississippi that it had not done enough to rectify the legacy of segregation in higher education. This is, by no stretch of the imagination, a liberal court, as those who have sought to avoid the death penalty have found out. Moreover, its two most liberal voices, Justices Blackmun and Stevens, are ageing. There are rumours that the former will soon retire; moves are afoot in the Senate to ask Mr Bush not to nominate a replacement before the election, should he step down. The political demarcation lines on abortion are clearer. Mr Bush was once in favour of the right to choice, but changed his mind when he became Mr Reagan's vice-president. Vice-President Dan Quayle hardly lets a moment go by without inveighing against the moral perils of single motherhood. Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, stands solidly behind freedom of choice, as does his party. The position of many prominent Catholic Democrats has best been expressed by Governor Mario Cuomo of New York who argues that, although he accepts church doctrine, he must also as a public official uphold the law, which now permits abortion. Mr Ross Perot's opinions are less distinct, as they are on so many issues. But the prospective independent candidate, while frequently talking of the need to restore traditional family values, has never called for a ban on abortion. In the past, for all the passion it has generated, abortion has tended to fade as an election determinant. This year, however, the calculation may be changing. No single overriding subject is consuming the electorate and, perhaps because of this and perhaps because its time has come, there has been a conspicuous surge in interest in women's issues. Almost all, regardless of party, are pro-choice. There is even a vocal pro-choice Republican women's lobby which is threatening to upset the planned unity of the Houston convention in August. This should concern Mr Bush, whose strength in the party has always derived in good part from the support he gets from Republican women. The Supreme Court's action yesterday has ensured abortion stays high on the political agenda this year.</p>

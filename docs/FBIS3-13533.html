After the meeting, Ross said that the  talks were useful and good and that he will meet with 'Arafat  again this evening. Asked if the Palestinians will go to  Washington to negotiate with the Israelis, Ross said that this  issue has not yet been decided but consultations will be  continued.    Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Political Department,  took  part in the meeting and said that the talks with Ross were very  useful and were characterized by frankness. He noted that the  talks dealt with the details of the situation in the occupied  territories and the need to provide security requirements for  the Palestinian people so that political negotiations can be  resumed. He said that the talks with Ross will resume this  evening to continue discussion on the points that were not  resolved during the meeting.    Members of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations declined  to make any statements on the resolved issues or the points of  disagreement. There are indications that during the meeting  Ross failed to obtain 'Arafat's agreement to declare the PLO's  return to the negotiating table with the Israelis and the  resumption of the talks, which is the condition that the United  States set on voting for the resolution submitted to the  Security Council on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.</p>

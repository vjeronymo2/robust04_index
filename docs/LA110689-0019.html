			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: URGE SHY KIDS TO TAKE RISKS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Both my children are very shy and, as a result, I'm afraid  they're limiting themselves. I worry because they often tell me that they'd  prefer not to go to school dances or enter into extracurricular activities. I  was just the opposite, so it's difficult for me to understand. How can I help  them be more outgoing?  </P> <P> F.G.T.  </P> <P> DEAR F.G.T.: It's difficult for me to tell whether you're describing a tendency  for your youngsters to be introverted, or whether they're really limiting  themselves or avoiding risks of all kinds because of shyness.  </P> <P> If they have one or two close friends, but prefer to avoid large groups, if  they're more comfortable reading or doing other quiet activities rather than  going to school dances or athletic events, I wouldn't worry. Because you were  more extroverted doesn't mean they should follow in your footsteps. I'm not  sure you should encourage them to be more outgoing. It's not easy or desirable  to turn an introvert into an extrovert, or vice versa. There's plenty of room  for both.  </P> <P> What is important is that your children develop their talents and live up to  their full potential. Extreme shyness will interfere with this. Children should  be encouraged to take intellectual risks, trying out new concepts knowing that  if they make a mistake, it won't matter, for this is one way we learn. Shy  people are afraid of failing, and overly demanding parents can increase this  fear.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I have an irritating habit of crying whenever I'm really  angry. Since I'm now working in an office where I'm looking for a promotion,  this can prove embarrassing. Thus far, I've always been able to get some  private spot where no one notices, but how can I break myself of this idiotic  habit? As a woman, I know it's going to work against me.  </P> <P> T.T.  </P> <P> DEAR T.T.: While crying in the office isn't a great idea, it's not that  unusual, according to recent statistics unearthed by psychologists Jeanne Plas  and Kathleen Hoover-Dempsey. Apparently, 80% of the women and 50% of men  admitted to having had at least one good (or bad) cry while at the office.  </P> <P> Grief is the most common reason for both, but joy is the second most common  reason for men, while anger takes second place as the cause of tears for women.  Males have been brought up to feel that the emotion of anger is acceptable,  even "manly," while females haven't been socialized in the same way. Women  aren't supposed to get angry, and if they do, they're not supposed to express  it.  </P> <P> Once you realize that it's all right to be angry and you learn constructive  ways to express those feelings, you won't cry. Women have as much right to  express disapproval and to express their feelings as men do; both sexes need to  learn to be assertive and rational, rather than aggressive and irrational.  </P></p>

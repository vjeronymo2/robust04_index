			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 9 Mar -- Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik  has called for Russian troops to be withdrawn from the Baltic  republics as soon as possible in an interview with ITAR-TASS.  "Our position is that the final date for the troops' withdrawal  should," he stressed, "remain 31 August 1994. There are 2,500  Russian troops in Estonia at present. This minimal number of  troops could have been pulled out much sooner. But when Russia  proposed a compromise option, giving 31 August as the date, we  agreed with her, understanding as we do the difficulties."    "Estonia," Luik continued, "welcomes the recent statement by  the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin that Russia  would not tie the problem of the Russian-speaking population in  the Baltic region to the withdrawal of its troops. That is the  correct position. We also believe that Russia should first  fulfill its international obligation and pull out its troops and  then we can settle all the other matters."    As for the rest, in the opinion of the minister relations  between Russia and Estonia are developing normally. "If, for  instance, you look at trade links, then they are not bad at  all," said Luik. "There is a very active commercial transit and  imports from Russia and exports out of Estonia are also active.  Part of the humanitarian aid to Russia passes through Estonian  ports. The two countries' business circles are developing their  cooperation well. We have nothing to complain about on that  score."    When asked if there was any territorial dispute between  Russia and Estonia, Luik replied: "The Estonian side believes  that it is necessary to observe the 1920 peace treaty signed in  Tartu. But we have always called for this question to be  resolved peacefully, at negotiations. We also have proposed  resorting to the International Court at the Hague on the matter  in question or, which would be even better, to make use of the  intermediary services of a third party. We do not intend to  dramatize this issue. For us the main thing is the withdrawal  of the troops. We can solve the remaining problems later."</p>

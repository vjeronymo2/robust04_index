			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: INSURANCE WON'T SUFFER S&amp;L-LIKE COLLAPSE  </P> <P> Big questions are being asked about insurance -- whether the companies that  insure your life or your business can stand up to an economic hurricane  themselves.  </P> <P> The life insurance industry, one of the mightiest oaks in the U.S. financial  landscape -- with $9 trillion in face value of policies and more than $1  trillion invested in securities, real estate and commercial mortgages -- is  being questioned on its ability to meet policyholder claims if real estate and  junk bond values continue to slide.  </P> <P> On Monday, the property-casualty side of the industry -- $200 billion a year in  premiums to cover trillions worth of automobiles, homes and businesses -- was  challenged by Public Citizen, the Ralph Nader group in Washington, on whether  it could withstand a severe recession.  </P> <P> Some alarmists, linking insurance with the savings and loans, say the industry  threatens taxpayers and policyholders with big losses.  </P> <P> But such views are extreme. Policyholders won't lose -- although they could be  discomforted -- and taxpayers shouldn't lose either. The likelihood is that  insurance will work out of its problems in the years ahead, although its  troubles will mean less money available for investment in industry and real  estate.  </P> <P> Like so many other financial chuckholes left over from the 1980s, insurance's  troubles will make life a little poorer for Americans in the '90s. So you  should know what all the shouting is about.  </P> <P> Some of the present concern can be discounted as political gamesmanship -- such  as the Nader group's call for Congress to change laws governing  property-casualty insurers. "Concern about solvency on that side of insurance  is misplaced," says Herbert E. Goodfriend, insurance analyst with  Prudential-Bache Securities. Property companies are better-heeled than ever, he  said.  </P> <P> But more genuine questions are being asked about life insurance. IDS Financial  Services, through its own insurance division, issued a study recently  suggesting that 20% of the largest insurance companies would run into serious  trouble if changes were not made.  </P> <P> David Shulman, real estate expert at the Salomon Bros. investment firm,  predicted in June that insurance companies would run into defaults on  commercial mortgages in 1991. Today, he says, "the recession has brought  forward the day of reckoning."  </P> <P> Prudential's Goodfriend notes the recent $650-million increase in loss reserves  by Travelers Insurance and predicts that half a dozen large insurers will have  to set aside similar, if smaller, reserves against investment losses.  </P> <P> The problems reflect not only the slumping economy, but changes in life  insurance as it went from a dull, reliable business that sold you a policy and  paid off when you died, to a performance-oriented high-flyer. Where the  industry once invested most conservatively in bonds and properties, in the last  decade it reached for higher yields in junk bonds and more speculative real  estate.  </P> <P> The higher yields allowed insurers to compete for investor dollars by offering  annuities and other investment policies -- all with a tax-deferred buildup of  income.  </P> <P> The industry also reached for pension business, offering to guarantee  retirement payouts to employees with investment contracts. Today, many big  companies face losses on those high-interest guarantees -- notably Equitable  Life, which could lose as much as $1 billion. To put that in perspective, the  firm has $62 billion in assets.  </P> <P> Commercial real estate is a growing problem -- office vacancy rates are up in  many parts of the country. That means rental income and thus insurance company  cash flows will be down.  </P> <P> What if a company gets in trouble? There is an industry guarantee system in  which all companies chip in to rescue the policyholders of the ailing member.  Policyholders won't lose, although as creditors they may have to wait for their  money. And, note well, the industry's guarantee system isn't backed by  regulation in some states, prominently New Jersey and California.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the industry's strength should be kept in mind. The great  mass of life insurance investments are in high-grade securities and sound real  estate. That's why fears of catastrophe are overdone. The industry needs to  rebuild the financial equivalent of porch rails and fences, not the whole  house.  </P> <P> So insurance companies will pull in their horns in the '90s, building up  capital and reserves, and limiting investment -- another sore muscle for the  U.S. economy but not a mortal injury.  </P> <P> The industry's troubles offer yet another reflection on the 1980s. It is being  called the decade of greed, but it was something else -- a time of  institutional mania. Some of the biggest -- and supposedly smartest --  companies are troubled. They took simple ideas to extremes -- that  high-yielding bonds might not be riskier than high-quality ones, that all real  estate is a sound investment.  </P> <P> It was really a decade of blind optimism. But as we recover now, we shouldn't  fall victim to blind pessimism. The '80s weren't as good as people thought they  were, and the '90s won't be as bad as they fear.  </P></p>

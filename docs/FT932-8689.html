			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Back from the brink / A look at entrepreneurs who have survived and learned from early setbacks It took a Christmas Eve telephone call from Jayne Murray's bank manager for her to realise that her business was in trouble. The call came eight months after Murray had bought the Tulip Tree coffee shop in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The manager warned that Tulip Tree had exceeded its agreed overdraft limit by Pounds 3,000. 'Up to then I had been going through the motions,' recalls Murray. 'I didn't understand what it was all about. When the bank manager phoned everything just fell apart.' Murray had taken an enterprise training course on leaving university, but acknowledges she did not maintain financial controls in the early months. She also now feels that she paid too much for the company in the first place. Faced with the prospect of the business going under, Murray called a staff meeting to explain the situation and to seek her employees' support and held emergency discussions with her parents, who were directors in the business, to analyse the problems. Two and a half years later, wage cuts, closer attention to costs and prices and tight controls on the business's finances have turned a Pounds 70,000 loss into a small monthly profit. The Tulip Tree employs seven people, has monthly sales of Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 9,000 (excluding VAT) and Murray, now 25, is working on plans to expand the catering side. Murray's experiences are not untypical of many small business owners. Inexperience or an external shock such as a recession or the loss of a large customer poses an early challenge to the business's survival. With determination and luck the business survives; without them it goes under. Recognition of this common scenario prompted Durham University Business School (Dubs)*, which works intensively with small firms in the northeast, to launch its Great Escape Business Development Award. The award goes to the business owner who has learned most from his or her experience of near-disaster. Murray was one of six business owners to be short-listed for this year's award. Entrepreneurs are judged on four criteria: the scale of the threat relative to the size of their business; the effectiveness of their response; the level of insight demonstrated; and the extent to which they subsequently apply what they have learned to running their business. Only one of the participants went out of business. Martin Jones was forced to close his record production company after running out of funds, but has since relaunched himself as MBR Productions, providing business training to the music industry. All of the others survived though some came very close to failing. The Questions Answered Consultancy, a York-based research and marketing agency, was burgled nine months after it was set up and its computer equipment with its business records were stolen. Back-up records had not been properly kept and contracts were lost. Peter Harrington, QAC's founder, considered looking for a job but after the initial despair he rallied and got the business going again. The computer equipment was replaced and back-up discs are now kept up to date. More importantly, says 27-year-old Harrington, the shock of near-disaster focused his thinking and made him realise careful planning would be needed if the business was to go anywhere. A decision was taken to concentrate on the regional market and a successful guidebook for teachers bringing school parties to York was produced. Harrington has taken on two more staff and he expects a near-threefold increase in turnover this year to Pounds 100,000. A move to larger premises is planned. QAC's recovery depended on Harrington re-assembling his business records and buying new computers, but Harsh (Ultimate Hydraulics), a supplier of hydraulic tipping systems, faced an even more serious threat. Established in 1987 to market a device to improve the safety of conventional lorry tipping systems, Harsh had just invested for expansion when its markets collapsed. Grant Faulkner, the founder and managing director of the Full Sutton, Yorkshire-based company, responded by cutting costs and putting suppliers under pressure for discounts. He also signed up a leading distributor, believing this would open new markets and guarantee the company's future. It was only after the deal was signed that Faulkner, now 28, realised this was only the start of the process. 'You don't sell to distributors but through them,' he says. 'A sale is not made until the product moves on to the end user.' Yet more effort and cash had to be invested in training programmes for the distributor's staff, in brochures, packaging and new product development. These actions paid off. Harsh managed to maintain sales in a much-reduced market and it expects to be profitable this year on sales of Pounds 950,000. It employs 10 people. Dealing with distributors is a common problem for the young business, to judge by the experiences of the Great Escape participants. John Owens, now 29, founder of Newcastle-based Robot Simulations, recalls how two of his main distributors failed to make any sales for a five-month period and his company's income dried up. 'In the end I went out on the road and sales turned right round in two months,' he says. 'We solved the problem just in time because we were about to hit our overdraft limit. The dealers were a wall between us and our customers.' Owens called in a business counsellor, Roger Verrall, to help him with these problems and realised he was far happier concentrating on the technical side of the business, creating software programs which allow the users of industrial robots to simulate their operation. He stepped down as managing director and sold 51 per cent of the company, which employs six people and has sales of Pounds 90,000, to Verrall. Owens was not the only entrepreneur to relinquish majority control of his business among the Great Escape participants. Peter Wild, founder of Wild Vision, a Boldon Colliery-based manufacturer of circuit boards for Acorn computers, also brought in an outside shareholder when problems arose. Wild Vision grew steadily over its first five years, but was hit by the recession in the early 1990s. Schools, important buyers of Acorn computers, cut spending when they became responsible for their own budgets and rumours that Acorn was planning to launch a new computer further reduced sales. The company faced the prospect of exceeding its borrowing limits. Wild, now 31, realised that sales would always be limited by the fact that he had no capacity for software development, without which the boards could not be used. There was no time to develop this expertise in-house, but at the suggestion of Acorn he teamed up with Computer Concepts, which had software skills but no hardware expertise. Computer Concepts took a 74 per cent stake in Wild Vision leaving Wild with the rest. 'For the first three months I waited for them to come and tell me what to do but they didn't,' says Wild. 'They have an arm's-length management style.' The link-up with Computer Concepts put Wild Vision's finances on a sounder footing and it expects sales of Pounds 400,000 this year. It recently took on two design engineers, taking its workforce to 15. The judging team decided Murray had learned the most from her experience of saving the Tulip Tree and awarded her the Pounds 1,000 prize. She and the other five shortlisted candidates are also eligible for a session to assess their personal and business goals provided by CPCR, a Gosforth-based consultancy and sponsor of the Great Escape. Judging a conventional small business competition is difficult enough because of the diverse nature of the businesses which take part, says Dubs' David Mullen. Judging an award which attempts to measure the management of potential disaster rather than the achievement of success is even trickier. *Mill Hill Lane, Durham, DH1 3LB. Tel. 091 374 2211.</p>

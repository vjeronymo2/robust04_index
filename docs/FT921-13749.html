			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Difficult to assert the electricity generators are abusing their position at consumers' expense Sir, Mr Andrew Cook (letters, November 28 and January 2) charges that the electricity pool pricing system is 'arcane and secretive' and that the generators are manipulating the market. The pooling system is complex, but only because electricity cannot be differentiated by source and is difficult to store. The pooling system is nothing more than a means by which this commodity can be traded. Like other commodity markets, customers can purchase at the 'spot' price, or they can enter into contracts which stabilise prices. A 15 per cent rise in the contract price offered to Cook's resulted from the removal of a cross subsidy which had favoured certain classes of consumer, typically those with effective lobbying power, to the detriment of other consumers. Cook's decided to take a chance on pool prices and so suffered from the recent price spikes. The rules by which pool prices are established may be complex but are certainly not 'secretive'. Copies of the 'pool rules' are freely available from any supplier and were surely studied by a company where electricity accounts for 8 per cent of manufacturing costs. More serious is the suggestion that the generators are manipulating the market. Since National Power and PowerGen own most of the generating plant, it is likely that they can control pool prices. However, the pertinent question is whether they control the wholesale price of electricity which, for the vast bulk of consumers, is determined by contracts. One guide is that Cook's would be unable to find anyone to build a power station and supply it with electricity at or below the present level of pool prices. Moreover, the regulator was unable to determine whether present prices were higher than expected for a competitive market with surplus capacity, ie were higher than 'avoidable costs'. So it is difficult to assert that the generators are abusing their dominant position at consumers' expense. Indeed, during one of the price spikes, the recent report by OFFER suggested that both companies probably lost money. In real markets, firms do not cut their throats willingly, nor do they miss market opportunities. Anthony White, James Capel &amp; Co, James Capel House, 6 Bevis Marks, London EC3</p>

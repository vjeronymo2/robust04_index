Panov, who was until recently the Russian Ambassador in  South  Korea and for whom the present post was somewhat a surprise,  sees his main task in promoting confidence in the relationships  between Russia and Japan.    Panov has said that relations with Japan are a key priority  of the Russian foreign policy determined by Russian President  Yeltsin.    During his last year's visit to Tokyo the two sides fixed  the  top priorities of Russian foreign policies towards Tokyo. I do  not see what is to be changed so much to deviate radically from  our course, said the diplomat.    Speaking about the territorial problem in the Russian-  Japanese relations, Panov has said that everyone in Russia seems  to know about its existence. The problem does exist but joint  forces are needed to search and find the way out, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak by </F> unidentified correspondent in Surt on 26 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] What is the occasion of this visit?    [Mubarak] It is not really a visit. It is a meeting with my  brother and in the same country. I mean when I move from Cairo  to Surt or Tubruq I consider myself moving in the same country.  In fact I think that the meeting with the brother Colonel is  something that will make both peoples happy because we are  consulting each other, exchanging views, investigating any  problems and helping development in both countries. All these  things are for the benefit of the peoples. Our visits are  always valuable working visits. The meetings with the brother  Colonel are always for exchanging political views, exchanging  economic views or for discussing projects for the benefit of  both countries.    [Correspondent] Does the presence of some ministers with you  here in Libya have some definite significance.    [Mubarak] When I come to Libya do you want me to come  without  ministers? Everyone of them has work here because there are  existing links. For instance, there are agreements to establish  a railway link across Libya to Egypt. There are operational  joint companies. There are many things and a lot of work  between us and Libya.    [Correspondent] Are there any new developments in the Arab  and international arenas which you are going to discuss today.    [Mubarak] Naturally we will talk about all the problems in  the Arab arena. We will talk about Yemen, perhaps we will talk  about Somalia. We will talk about everything that concerns the  Arab World because it concerns us.    [Correspondent] What is President Mubarak's comment on the  new developments of the so-called Lockerbie case, particularly  the developments...    [Mubarak] Let us not talk about Lockerbie on TV. Let me talk  about such things with the brother Colonel.    [Correspondent] But there are new developments which  exonerate the Libyan citizens.    [Mubarak] I do not want to talk about this issue now. Let me  talk about this with the brother Colonel. In the media you  always publish something and then he comes up with a reply and  we get into bickering. Leave us alone. With the brother  Colonel I will discuss these issues.    [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. president.</p>

The purpose of the symposium was:    To affirm our attitudes and positions on Marxism-Leninism  and  Ho Chi Minh thought, with this regarded as our ideological  foundation and compass for action. To clarify the theoretical  and practical basis of this affirmation.    To defend and develop Marxism-Leninism, oppose plots to  eliminate Marxism-Leninism and socialism in conditions in which  the world is undergoing many changes and in which the country is  facing great difficulties and challenges.    To exchange opinions on a number of the most common and  important issues of Marxism-Leninism that are related to the  topics, and to create a unified basis for preparing the  instructional materials.    Almost 100 people attended the symposium. Dao Duy Tung, a  member of the Politburo and Standing Committee of the  Secretariat and council president, and Nguyen Duc Binh, a member  of the Politburo, director of the Ho Chi Minh Institute of  National Politics, and vice president of the council, attended  and presided at the symposium along with council standing  committee members Nguyen Dinh Tu, the secretary of the Communist  Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee and head of the  Department of Science and Education of the Central Committee,  Dang Xuan Ky, a member of the CPV Central Committee and head of  the Marxist-Leninist and Ho Chi Minh Thought Research Institute,  and Nguyen Duy Quy, a member of the CPV Central Committee and  director of the National Social Sciences and Humanities Center.  The council members, the chairmen, vice chairmen, secretaries,  and members of the five instructional materials preparation  committees and secretariat, and a number of full-time cadres who  are monitoring the KX-10 program attended, too.    Dao Duy Tung, who gave the opening speech, stated the goals  and requirements of the symposium and, at the same time, pointed  out the discussion format. He called on the scientists to go to  the heart of the issues raised and discuss things with a  democratic and scientific spirit and a lofty sense of  responsibility.    Professor Dang Xuan Ky, in his introductory remarks, raised  a  number of theoretical and practical issues of Marxism-Leninism  and methodological issues in understanding, developing, and  defending Marxism-Leninism today.    The scientists attending the symposium discussed things very  vigorously. Many of the ideas manifested new approaches with  independent and creative ways of thinking. There were 41  speeches. Many people spoke two or three times and frankly  debated specific issues. The symposium revolved around five main  issues:    1. Correctly understanding Marxism-Leninism and issues  concerning methodology:    Those at the symposium analyzed the essential points in  great  depth in order to correctly understand the basic theoretical  contents of Marxism-Leninism. Based on this, they unanimously  affirmed the great role of Marxism-Leninism in our era. Even  though socialism has now collapsed in many countries,  Marxism-Leninism is still our banner and a compass for our  actions. The collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe is not synonymous with the collapse of  Marxism-Leninism. Grasping the revolutionary and scientific  nature of Marxism-Leninism and making creative use of this in  our country's specific conditions is the basic guideline in our  ideological and theoretical work.    However, to understand Marxism-Leninism correctly, we must  distinguish between what Marx, Engels, and Lenin said from the  erroneous things that others have said in explaining their  theory, which has transformed their theory. The arguments of  Marx, Engels, and Lenin must be placed within the specific  historical conditions of the time in which they advanced their  arguments. This is the only way to correctly understand the  issues posed by these men. Their arguments must be placed within  the framework of a system; they cannot be separated. At the same  time, they must be understood under the new light of the present  age.    2. The essence and nature of the age:    There have long been many different views on this issue.  Some  people say that the present age is still a period of transition  from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope, with this  starting with the Russian October Revolution. This is true even  though socialism as an international system with the Soviet  Union as its pillar no longer exists. Others agree that the  present age is a period of transition from capitalism to  socialism on a worldwide scope, but they say that this must be  explained more concretely in accord with the changes in the  present situation. Specifically, attention must be given to: a.  the influence of the scientific and technical revolution; b.  capitalism has the potential to grow thanks to many factors  (even though the basic conflicts of capitalism are becoming  sharper and sharper; c. the rise of more than 100 newly  independent countries; d. the appearance of urgent universal  problems that are related to the fate of mankind; e. and the  collapse of the international socialist system. Many people  think that the present age must be defined in accord with the  real situation and in accord with the scientific and technical  revolution, which is having a great influence on social  progress. This revolution has created an all-around crisis for  both socialism and capitalism. Mankind is facing urgent problems  that everyone must help to solve if we are to survive.    Through discussion and debate, those at the symposium said  that even though realistic socialism in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe has collapsed, the present age is still a period  of transition from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope.  This is an objective reality and the direction of movement and  development of history. However, the manner of expression must  be balanced.    3. On the theory of "economic and social structure":    Many people affirmed Marx' analysis concerning the evolution  of man through economic and social structures, which holds that  this started from historical materialism. This provides a firm  basis for viewing the development of economic and social  structures as a natural historical process. Some people said  that this theory is correct, but that it needs to be  supplemented, because when the theory was first formulated, Marx  analyzed mainly Greek, Roman, and Western European societies. He  was not able to study Asia or other places. The universal nature  of this theory must be clarified. The analysis can also be  supplemented by civilization. But if this approach based on  civilization is made absolute and this leads to a rejection of  the economic and social theory of Marx, that would be a mistake.  Marx' theory on economic and social structures is correct. It is  still the "foundation stone" of historical materialism. It  reflects the laws of development of human society and is the  methodological basis for examining specific historical  viewpoints.    4. The historical significance of the theory of surplus  value  and the nature of modern capitalism:    Many people affirmed that Marx' theory of surplus value is  still the foundation of his economic theory. This is still the  basis for analyzing the changes in modern capitalist society.  Others said that the theory of surplus value is of epochal  significance and that it is still the basis for analyzing and  understanding modern capitalism. However, Marx' arguments on the  absolute impoverishment of the proletariat were correct only  during during the time of free-competition capitalism. Today,  there is only relative impoverishment. The theory of surplus  value was correct only during the age of "industrial"  capitalism. Now, in the period of "post-industrial" capitalism,  this theory is no longer correct. Today, capitalism produces  wealth not by exploiting the surplus value of the workers but by  using modern techniques and technology (robots). Capitalism is  accumulating many socialist factors, which is making capitalism  more "humane."    Through discussing and debating the above ideas, those at  the  symposium affirmed that Marx' theory of surplus value still  maintains its original value. Because in the final analysis,  only with live laborers can surplus value be created. As for  modern capitalism, the following must be clearly recognized: the  effects of the scientific and technical revolution, the new  development standards of the production forces, the new forms of  production relationships in capitalism, and the fact that the  working class in the capitalist countries has undergone a  structural change (the middle class has expanded).    5. The historical mission of the working class:    It was affirmed that socialism will replace capitalism and  that it is the working class that has this historical mission.  But when talking about the historical mission of the working  class, it must be understood that the concept "working class"  includes those who have a working class consciousness and  position. Reality shows that the great majority of the leaders  of the working class are intellectuals with a working class  consciousness and position. Some people criticized the view that  the working class no longer has a historical mission as the  representative of the new production formulas. That role now  belongs to the intellectuals.    Those at the symposium analyzed the above ideas in great  depth and unanimously agreed that even though capitalism has  made changes and even though the structure of the working class  has changed, the historical mission of the working class has not  changed. Today, just as in the past, the working class is still  being exploited by the capitalist class both intellectually and  physically. The working class still represents modern  production. Its historical mission is still to eliminate the  yoke of capitalist exploitation and transform capitalist society  into a more progressive and humane socialist society. Only with  the working class will liberating the working class be viewed as  tied to liberating all of society.    Concluding the symposium, on behalf of the council and the  presiding officials at the symposium, Professor Nguyen Duc Binh  evaluated the results of the 3-day symposium and mentioned the  tasks that must be done following the symposium. He stressed  that we agree on many of the problems but that we must continue  to study and debate things. As for those issues on which there  is a lack of agreement, the committees must continue to study  things and organize discussions and debates. The council will  reach conclusions in order to have a scientific basis for  preparing high-quality instructional materials and satisfying  the requirements in studying and teaching Marxism-Leninism and  Ho Chi Minh thought in our country today.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Wassall rights issue to pay for Pounds 94.3m hostile bid for Evode WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, yesterday launched its biggest hostile bid to date with a Pounds 94.3m offer for Evode, the chemicals and plastics group. Mr Andrew Simon, Evode chairman, said he would fight the bid 'tooth and nail' and urged his shareholders to reject the offer. Wassall's cash offer of 80p per Evode share, compared with Wednesday's closing price of 72p, values the ordinary shares at Pounds 58.2m. Evode's shareholders have been offered share and cash and share alternatives. The conglomerate is also offering 85 new convertible preference shares for every 100 Evode convertible preference shares. This values each Evode convertible preference share at 88.5p compared with Wednesday's closing price of 75.5p, for a total of Pounds 36.1m. Wassall's shares yesterday closed 15p down at 183p. Evode's shares rose 19p to 91p. The conglomerate bought 3.5 per cent of Evode from Scottish Amicable at 80p a share. Wassall is financing its deal with a 3-for-5 rights issue at 150p per share to raise Pounds 103m, net of underwriting commissions. It will be payable in two instalments, the second of which is conditional on the success of the offer. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, which holds 8 per cent of Wassall, is to take up its rights. Wassall is forecasting an increase of more than 60 per cent in pre-tax profits to at least Pounds 16.5m for the year ending December 31 and a final dividend of 1.7p per share (up from 1.33p). A strong performance from the North American plastics operations helped Evode increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.8m for the half year to March. Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said: 'There is overwhelming evidence that Evode's disappointing performance is because of low margins due to poor management.'

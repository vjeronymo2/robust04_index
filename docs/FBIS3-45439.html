First, rice prices in coastal areas went up  and, in the meantime, rice prices in China's major producing  regions, such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, also rose in  succession. In December, shock waves of grain price hikes in  southern China spread to the north and influenced prices of  other varieties of grain, such as wheat, corn, and edible oil.    During the 15 years of reform and opening up, panic buying  in  a small number of localities, triggered by the fluctuation of  some commodity prices, was not an unusual occurrence. But  because this time the problem was with grain, a special  commodity, the shock it caused to the people was naturally much  bigger. Moreover, this disturbance affected an extensive area.  It quickly sparked the concern of the entire society and grain  prices became a hot topic. Those who had shown a relatively  high degree of tolerance toward increases of some commodity  prices due to price reform, also found it hard to keep cool this  time. The State Council was very concerned about grain prices.  In late December, the State Council held a special work meeting  and decided on a number of measures to keep grain prices under  control. It made some stipulations, such as setting a ceiling  on retail prices. The promulgation of these relevant measures  quickly reversed the situation. The grain shock, which had  lasted several months while constantly spreading far and wide,  was gradually appeased. This also indicates that the country  has sufficient grain reserve and is able to roll back grain  prices to a rational level.    Nevertheless, how did this shock begin? Information supplied  by the Ministry of Agriculture indicates that 1993 was a  fruitful year for agriculture. With the exception of reduced  cotton output, total grain output reached a record high and new  grain purchased by the state and put into storage was roughly  the same as last year.    What is the reason for these big increases in grain prices  in  a year of bumper grain harvests?    The authorities here believe that the fluctuations in grain  prices at present are not a problem of grain production. An  in-depth and cool-headed analysis is necessary on this issue.  It is right to say that the supply of agricultural products in  various localities on the mainland is sufficient, but prices of  agricultural products are relatively low. Cheap grain harms the  peasants. In these years, peasants in major producing regions  find grain cultivation less and less lucrative, or even lose  money growing grain. Since reform began 15 years ago, grain  prices have been adjusted a number of times, but because prices  of agricultural industrial products have been rising too fast in  the meantime, the scissors difference between industrial and  agricultural prices did not narrow, but has widened. In recent  years, the growth rate of peasants' income has been visibly  lower than that of the urban population. In this context, the  peasants' wish to increase grain prices to some extent is  completely understandable.    But while peasants waited for price increases and hesitated  to sell their grain too early lest they lost money, consumers,  for fear of big price hikes next year, wanted to buy more grain  and put it aside. Grain dealers, who deal between the producers  and consumers, and state-run grain enterprises, in their  capacity as the main channels of state-managed grain  circulation, were naturally very aware of such a mentality among  producers and consumers. Both wanted sales prices of grain to  go up so that state-run grain enterprises could make up for  losses they had suffered over the years as a result of the state  subsidy policy to some extent, and individual grain dealers  would have a chance to make more profits. Furthermore, some  circulation channels at the moment are not very smooth. As a  result, grain prices spiralled upwards.    The above-mentioned circumstances were the inherent causes  of  the grain price hikes. Here, one can easily recognize that  although some elements were not entirely irrational, these price  fluctuations are very abnormal and the main cause is  psychological. Certain erroneous beliefs are worthy of  attention. At present, problems are largely found in the  circulation field. If grain prices are too low, this is not  conducive to grain production, so they should be raised to an  appropriate degree and step by step. But fluctuations that are  too fast and too drastic will pose a disadvantage to both  producers and consumers and may cause shocks to other commodity  prices. They are also very negative for the implementation of  many of the reform measures that are about to emerge. The idea  held by some people that "price hikes are harmless" is wrong.  Grain is a commodity, but a special commodity. If grain is not  brought into the market system, there is no future for grain  production. In the process of moving toward a market system, we  should explore special methods for managing this special  commodity and establish special means of regulation and control.  The mainland has a population of 1.2 billion and food is still  first things first. Even the slightest problem in this respect  may jeopardize social stability and undermine the overall  interests of reform. Therefore, some men of insight here  believe that the fluctuation in grain prices this time is not  necessarily an entirely negative event: It is a reminder to  relevant quarters that in the course of establishing a socialist  market economy, grain, as a special commodity, should be managed  with special methods. It goes without saying that we must never  backtrack. The only way out is to deepen the reform.    The grain shock not only provides a topic for people working  in the grain production and circulation fields to ponder, but  also sets a serious question for people in all circles on the  mainland: Are we prepared for this big switch toward a market  economy? Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and State Council  have time and again advised cadres at all levels and the general  public to be fully prepared for a market economy. A market  economy is a stormy ocean and we lack the necessary knowledge  and competence to sail on this ocean. When this great vessel of  ours embarks on its voyage toward the ocean of the market  economy, all the crew, sailors, and passengers must be prepared  and learn to sum up experience in practice. Only in this way  can we reach our destination in triumph. Practicing a market  economy does not cancel the need to strengthen management, still  less does it warrant a laissez-faire attitude. We must conduct  well the necessary macroregulation and control in accordance  with the laws of the market. This is a topic which is derived  from the grain shock that is being discussed by people here. I  have talked about it briefly in the hope that it will throw some  light on your understanding of the situation on the mainland.    [Signed] Bao Xin    [Dated] 28 December 1993</p>

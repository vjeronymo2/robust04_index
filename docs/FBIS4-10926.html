			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 26 March  1994 on page 9 reports that Sandinist National Liberation Front  [FSLN] leader Bayardo Arce denied reports that Daniel Ortega  removed deputies William Ramirez and Herty Lewites from the Bank  of Nicaragua (Banic) Board of Directors. According to Arce,  Ortega had asked Antonio Lacayo not to ratify their positions  until the FSLN National Directorate made a decision. According  to the article, Ramirez and Lewites accused Ortega of conducting  a "witch-hunt" against those who signed the document "For the  Sandinism of the Majorities." Sergio Ramirez's heads the list of  those signing the document. [For related information on this  topic see FBIS-LAT-94-O59 pp 42-45.]    Supporters of Sergio Ramirez said that Ortega plans to place  Luis Enrique Figueroa and former National Police Chief Rene  Vivas on the Banic board in lieu of William Ramirez and Lewites.  The article reports that Ortega is making "unilateral" decisions  against the sympathizers of Dr. Sergio Ramirez. As a further  example of this the article explains that Ortega removed Larry  Astorga and Violeta Delgado from the leadership of the 19 July  Sandinist Youth.</p>

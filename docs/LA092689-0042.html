			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The premier edition of St. Louis' new morning newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, was  snatched up around the city by curious readers. Sales were brisk around town,  and many of the Sun's shiny red street corner boxes, dubbed "facts machines" by  the Sun, were empty by mid-morning. The Sun, whose debut featured a color  picture of a sun rising behind the Gateway Arch, is the first major newspaper  to start from scratch in a big U.S. city since the Washington Times in 1982.  The Sun published 200,000 copies of its premier edition. The colorful tabloid  is competing with the 110-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The Post-Dispatch  has been the city's only daily paper since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded  in October, 1986.  </P></p>

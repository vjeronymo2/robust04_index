			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Bonds: New regime likely to raise cost of doing business LAST WEEK's agreement between European governments on common capital standards for the securities industry contained several concessions which pleased Eurobond firms. However, on even the most optimistic interpretations, Eurobond underwriters are likely to find the cost of doing business higher under the new regulatory regime. If the detail of the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) contains any nasty shocks - which is still a possibility, since last week's agreement covered only general tenets - the primary Eurobond market could be significantly changed in character. Most areas of the London-based bond and equity markets welcomed the compromise agreed by government officials early on Wednesday morning. It is clear the UK Treasury achieved its primary strategic goal: to protect London's small specialist securities houses against larger continental European universal banks. For Eurobond underwriters, the most important change is that the 'window' allowed to new issue underwriters before full capital requirements start to bite has been set at 10 days. Earlier drafts stipulated only a five-day window. However, a survey conducted earlier this year for the International Primary Markets Association, which represents the big new issue underwriters, found that a 'material balance' of most Eurobond issues remains unsold even 10 days after launch. How much underwriters of slow-moving Eurobond issues will be penalised depends on the formula governing how fast and how hard capital requirements start to bite once the underwriting window closes. But the capital cost of underwriting a bad new issue is likely to be higher than under current regulations set by the UK Securities and Futures Authority. One implication could be that firms will be less willing to underwrite new issues which are likely to sell slowly. But it could also lead firms to demand higher fees to underwrite bond issues aimed at retail investors - which by nature take longer to distribute. This could increase the cost of funds for issuers of retail-targeted bonds. The Eurobond lobby failed to win greater allowances for hedging activities of new issue underwriters: for example, where a firm limits market risk by using derivative financial instruments or by taking matching short positions. The directive will certainly recognise hedging activity overall. One of the advantages of the complex 'building block' approach to market risk which underpins the CAD is that hedged positions can be recognised. However, the directive will not make full allowances for hedging during the underwriting process. There will be no lower capital requirements for hedged underwriting positions. In May, IPMA identified this as a fundamental flaw. Indeed, several firms surveyed by IPMA said 'they would be unwilling to continue underwriting activity in Europe unless the CAD were amended to make proper allowances for hedging, particularly the hedging of interest rate risk on debt securities'. EC officials said last week that there was no prospect of change on this point. It remains to be seen whether firms really are prepared to carry out the threat to stop underwriting. One notable area of success was an agreement that all securities borrowing or repurchase agreements should fall under the CAD, rather than tougher banking regulations. Under earlier drafts of the directive, stock borrowed from institutions not themselves regulated at an EC level - including pension funds and companies  -would count as loans rather than trading positions. This would entail higher capital requirements and increased cost of securities borrowing, damaging the liquidity of the market. The agreement reached last week should safeguard stock borrowing and 'repo' in the Euromarket, which has sharply increased over the past two years. These points aside, bond market participants noted that implementation of the CAD will be linked to agreement on the Investment Services Directive, which could be months - or years - away. While the CAD lays down a system for prudential regulation of the securities industry, the ISD aims to give banks and firms a single passport to operate in all EC centres and lay down rules for the conduct of business. Capital adequacy rules are only a safety net for the broader aim of a single European market for securities business. While the CAD could disturb the equilibrium of the Eurobond market, the Investment Services Directive could legislate it out of existence. The latest drafts of the ISD contain a clause which would restrict trading of securities to 'regulated markets'. The Eurobond market would not qualify as a regulated market, not least because it has no formal listing or reporting requirements for issuers. The idea is vigorously rejected by the UK government, which is keen to protect the London-based status quo. It has a powerful ally in the European Commission. Against this, several European governments including France, Spain and Italy, are pressing for tougher regulation in the guise of investor protection. It remains unclear whether the deadlock will now be broken. On an optimistic note, there is a broad sense in which the evolving system of European regulation should work to the advantage of all securities markets. The capital rules governing holdings of securities look likely to be less stringent than those applying to loans. Last week, however, no Eurobond market participants were uncorking champagne in honour of the CAD. Market participants recognised there will be hard bargaining and horse-trading before the package of European securities industry regulation is agreed.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / NZ drought threatens industries NEW ZEALAND is facing a growing electricity crisis as South Island lakes which normally supply 60 per cent of the country's power dry up. Many industrial plants are being forced to cut production, and New Zealanders have been warned they may soon have to work a four-day week to conserve dwindling power. One of the biggest users, Comalco, owner of the big Bluff aluminium plant, has already cut electricity consumption drastically, and is likely to get compensation from the government. Comalco is considering the expensive option of closing a third of its capacity. Electricorp, the national power utility, has been forced to bring two thermal stations, one coal and the other oil-fired, back into production. At one such station the state-owned corporation had to rehire workers whom it had made redundant less than three weeks before. Domestic customers are already having their power cut for several hours a day, with the electricity system stretched to the limit as North Island gas, hydroelectricity, and geothermal generating stations are run at full capacity to try to replace the South Island's shortfall. Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, has castigated Electricorp for not preparing the public for the crisis, which he says is doing immense damage by cutting industrial output as the economy is struggling to emerge from recession. At present legislation charges state-owned corporations with maximising revenues.</p>

Nazarbayev had arrived  in the United States for an official visit. [passage omitted]    The talks centered on matters aimed at further refining  bilateral cooperation and at strengthening security in the  world, the development of the situation in the Commonwealth of  Independent States and in Central Asia.    The signed charter on democratic partnership "marks a  qualitatively new stage in our relations which gain in scope and  assume a long-term character", Nazarbayev said.    During the visit, the two sides signed a memorandum of  understanding and cooperation between the Defence Ministries of  the two countries, an agreement on cooperation between the U.S.  and Kazakhstan in science and technology, as well as a bilateral  agreement on the exchanges of technical information and  cooperation in nuclear safety.    Later on a three-sided agreement was signed between  Kazakhstan, the U.S. and Russia on technological guarantees in  view of the launch of a U.S.-made Inmarsat-3 satellite from  Baykonur cosmodrome by a Russian Proton booster rocket.    Nazarbayev later visited the Pentagon. A U.S.-Kazakh accord  was signed on joint defence cooperation and providing U.S. help  to the new republic in converting its arms industry to civilian  use.    Defence Secretary William Perry said he would visit  Kazakhstan next month to begin implementation of the accord.</p>

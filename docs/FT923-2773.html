			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Government purchase of services Sir, Michael Smith's report, 'Treasury spells out preference for private sector' (September 10), repeated a misleading statement by Civil Service unions on government policy. The unions quoted from a document about selling government services into outside markets and claimed that this conflicts with our statements on Competing for Quality. This is not so. The two are different. The first deals with government competing with the private sector in markets outside government, the second with government as purchaser of services for its own use. Our guidance on market testing sets out very plainly our policy on the government's purchase of services for its own use on behalf of the taxpayer. We want to improve the quality of services. A key element of this is to ensure that services currently provided in-house are tested against the market. The contract will be awarded on the basis of who can provide the best combination of quality and price. Staff will be encouraged to prepare a proposal and bid on the same basis and time-scale as the private sector. This is fair to those who work in the public sector, to the taxpayer and to those dependent on services purchased by government. When the government may be in competition with the private sector in the supply of services outside government, it is important that it does not use what may be its cheaper access to capital or other advantages to compete unfairly; and where the private sector operates satisfactorily, there has long been a presumption against expanding the role of state as trader. Market testing will be conducted with fair and open competition for internal and external bids and with no dogmatic preference for either.

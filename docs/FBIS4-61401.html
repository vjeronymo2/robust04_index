			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Davydov report in the "Press" column: "The Minimum </F> Task Is To Survive. The Russian Press Committee Is Fully Aware  of This"]    [Excerpt] It has been decided to allocate an additional 64  billion rubles in subsidies to the Russian press before the end  of 1994. This was announced at a press conference in the  Russian Press Committee. Asked where this money will go,  Committee Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov said that this will be  decided by a subsidy distribution commission that will include  journalists, politicians, and government officials. A priority  right "to survive" will be given to publications which, by the  committee's recognition, have "a worldwide reputation."    It was stated unequivocally that the issue today is  precisely  survival. The press is in such a condition that it needs a  trillion rubles only in subsidies! Such funds, it was said, are  unavailable.    Yet the Press Committee does not see the fact that  newspapers  are dying as anything tragic: After all, factories and mines  are also dying! The only thing that really bothers it is the  authorities' cynical attitude to books and the press. They, in  Mr. Gryzunov's expression, have been put next to vodka and  tobacco.

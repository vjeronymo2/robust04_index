Team leader Olli Heinonen refused to comment on how the  inspections went or to answer questions concerning rumors that  the North Korean Government denied the team access to some of  the seven agreed-upon nuclear sites.    "We don't give any statements. That will be done in Vienna  tonight," Heinonen said. "We had a nice pleasant trip. We all  want to go home now."    Upon arrival, the team immediately booked tickets out of  Beijing, with five members scheduled to arrive in Zurich later  Tuesday.    The IAEA will release a statement in Vienna concerning the  trip later Tuesday, Heinonen said.    Prior to this round of inspections, North Korea had delayed  for more than a year IAEA inspections of its nuclear program,  fueling accusations that it was trying to develop nuclear  weapons.

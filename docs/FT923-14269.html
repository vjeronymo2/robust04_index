			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex set to mix it with European heavyweights THE pace of takeover activity in Europe's troubled cement sector shows little sign of slackening as producers struggle against falling sales and accusations that they have been involved in illegal market-sharing agreements. Yesterday's agreed offer by Cementos Mexicanos to buy Spain's largest cement producer, Valenciana de Cementos, for up to Dollars 1.7bn, represents the biggest takeover in Spain and the first significant purchase by a North American cement producer in Europe after a decade of heavy cement investments in the opposite direction. Spain is the second largest cement market in Europe, and the takeover bid by Cemex is a powerful challenge to European dominance of the industry on both sides of the Atlantic. It places Cemex in direct competition with the giants of the European Industry, Holderbank, Italcementi and Lafarge Coppee, which have all made big acquisitions in Spain in the past four years. But Cemex is entering a period of turmoil in the European cement industry. The European Community has written to 75 European cement manufacturers and their subsidiaries accusing them of breaching its competition laws. Investigations began three years ago after officials became concerned at the low level of cement exported between neighbouring European countries, particularly where works were situated close to borders. This has not prevented some of Europe's biggest building materials companies from buying substantial interests in cement industries in neighbouring countries. Acquisitions and strategic stake-building are increasing. A new development has been the recent arrival of Italian companies on the takeover trail. At the end of April, Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement company, paid FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) for a controlling interest in Ciments Francais, France's second-largest cement producer. A month earlier, Calcestruzzi, the Italian maker of ready-mixed concrete which is a subsidiary of the Ferruzzi group, in a joint venture with the National Bank of Greece took control of Heracles, one of the two biggest cement makers in Greece. It is unclear whether the recent purchases by Italcementi and Calcestruzzi will prompt further cross-border moves by Italian cement and concrete companies. Conversely, it could draw the attention of other manufacturers to Italy, which remains a highly fragmented market and boasts the world's second highest per capita consumption of cement behind South Korea. The driving force behind many cross-border acquisitions has been the desire of manufacturers to reduce their vulnerability to sharp falls in domestic construction output. Holderbank of Switzerland, Lafarge Coppee of France and Blue Circle of the UK, for example, bought heavily in North America in the 1980s. European purchases, in some cases, may have been also dictated by a desire to gain control of previously state subsidised companies in eastern and southern Europe which could undercut local prices by exporting surplus capacity. Mr Laurence Amboldt, construction analyst with Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Suez group, says: 'As the major groups look to spread their activities over a number of European regions in order to reduce the impact of local construction cycles, works with direct access to waterborne transport will be seen as particularly valuable as these provide economic transport of cement to various parts of Europe.' The result of all this activity has been to reduce the number of independent cement companies and to concentrate power in the hands of about eight large European cement groups. Italcementi, including its controlling interest in Ciments Francais, has overtaken Holderbank as the biggest seller of cement in Europe. Holderbank, however, is larger in the US and remains the world's biggest cement group. Cement prices, however, have remained surprisingly stable despite the recession in the construction industry, affecting many parts of Europe. This has led to accusations that relationships between the large cement manufacturers has become too cosy. Critics of the industry contrast the stability of cement markets with the very sharp price falls which have occurred for other basic building materials. Companies, meanwhile, have complained to the Commission that Turkish, Romanian and Tunisian companies have been dumping cut-price cement in Spain, damaging the local market. Cement prices along the Mediterranean coast of Spain fell by 15 to 20 per between June and December last year. Moves by Ciments Francais to establish strategic alliances with cement manufacturers in Romania - possibly as a prelude to an acquisition - is regarded by some analysts as a defensive measure to prevent cheap Romanian cement from flowing into other European markets. Spain, Europe's fastest growing construction market during the 1980s, has been a very attractive market for European cement manufacturers both for its size and the availability of local companies which traditionally have been family controlled. Most of the leaders have Spanish subsidiaries. Ciments Francais last month offered Dollars 44m to acquire the outstanding 22 per cent it does not own of Cementos Rezola the biggest cement producer in the Basque region of Spain. Unifund, a relatively obscure Swiss-based holding company with cement interests in Asia and South America, has just taken out an option worth more than Dollars 700m to buy Sanson, Spain second-largest producer, from the Banesto banking group.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               ESTIMATED EUROPEAN CEMENT SALES IN 1992                    (excluding associate companies)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                   Tonnes     Works controlled in                              (m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italcemenit/Ciment F.       27.0     Italy, France, Spain, Belgium,                                      Czechoslovakia, Greece Holderbank                  15.7     Switzerland, Germany, Belgium,                                      France, Spain, Hungary,                                      Czechoslovakia Lafarge Coppee              13.5     France, Germany, Spain,                                      Czechoslovakia.

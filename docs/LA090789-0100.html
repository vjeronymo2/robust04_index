			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VERES RESIGNS AS COACH OF TROUBLED OAK PARK  </P> <P> Following a meeting with school administrators, Ron Veres resigned Wednesday as  football and baseball coach at Oak Park High.  </P> <P> Veres, a 48-year old walk-on coach, met with Principal Jeff Chancer and  Athletic Director Fred Yamano to discuss the shortage of players on the Oak  Park roster.  </P> <P> Injuries had reduced the roster from 19 to eight players and Veres feared he  would not be able to field a team for Friday's opener against Boron.  </P> <P> Yamano and Chancer had said Tuesday they were unaware of a roster problem.  </P> <P> After a one-hour meeting with the two administrators, Veres cancelled team  practice and informed his six assistant coaches that he was resigning. He later  handed a resignation note to Yamano that read: "I resign my position as head  football coach, effective immediately."  </P> <P> Veres later read a statement from his home in Moorpark.  </P> <P> "There comes a time in one's life when you have to stand up for principles you  believe in," Veres said. "There exists some philosophical differences between  the administration and myself and at this time these differences are  irreconcilable. I find it extremely difficult to be an effective influence on  the football program at Oak Park."  </P> <P> Oak Park had an 0-9-1 record in 1986 before Veres took over the program. In two  years, he compiled a 17-6 record and guided the Eagles to consecutive  appearances in the Southern Section playoffs.  </P> <P> "He's the best coach I've ever had," said Jess Garner, an assistant coach who  played the past two seasons under Veres. "He was a perfectionist and strived  for perfection in his players. He gave all the knowledge I needed to be a good  player and coach."  </P> <P> Yamano and Roger Newell, an Oak Park assistant last season, are expected to run  the team until a successor can be found.  </P> <P> "We're going to field a team for Friday," Yamano said. "The team captains  voluntarily came to inform me that they will continue to prepare for the game."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] It has been announced that the public is well aware  of and appreciates the fact that the Turkish Armed Forces are  not the authority or organ for establishing governments.    A statement to Anatolia Agency by the General Staff Press  and  Public Relations Department recalled that today certain  newspapers carried false reports regarding political quests and  new structures based on assumptions that do not correspond with  the actual task of the Armed Forces. Pointing out that the  public is well aware of the fact that the Armed Forces are not  the authority or organ for establishing governments, as  suggested by these reports, the statement remarked that the  terms in office of the chief of staff and the force commanders  are determined in line with the need for service within the  framework of the law. The statement also asked the public not  to heed any concocted reports other than announcements made by  authorized bodies.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CHINESE HALF-CENTURY OF SATIRE AND DISSENT  </P> <P> We often use the terms "reining in" and "letting out" to describe the political  climate in China. The fact is that what we mean by "letting out" is lifting up  the bird cage cover, and what we mean by "reining in" is lowering the same  cover.  </P> <P>  -- Wang Ruowang, autumn, 1988  </P> <P> Exactly two years have passed since the Chinese Communist Party launched its  latest political campaign against intellectuals it perceived as too  liberal-minded and anxious for political democratization. In January, 1987, the  party expelled three controversial but eminently popular figures: Fang Lizhi,  the internationally known astrophysicist who recently wrote an open letter to  Deng Xiaoping asking for the release of Chinese political prisoners; Liu  Binyan, the reporter/whistle-blower on party corruption, and Wang Ruowang, the  satirical essayist, who is scorned by the authorities for his exceedingly  audacious broadsides against the party and its pace of reform. All three are  veterans of political persecution, having earlier been victims of China's much  more noxious campaigns, and all have enjoyed the fruits of political  rehabilitation under Deng Xiaoping's regime. Since Deng's resumption of power  in the late 1970s, however, all have been equally subject to periodic, if  relatively minor, campaigns against intellectuals critical of the status quo.  </P> <P> Despite or because of this continuing victimization, Liu Binyan has gained a  hero's status among the Chinese populace for his courageous exposure of the  dark side of party ethics. Fang Lizhi has built an almost universal respect  among Chinese students and other intellectuals for his liberal political  philosophy, expressed openly during his vice presidency of one of China's  leading science universities. Wang Ruowang, too, has had his audience, mainly  in literary magazines, legal journals and newspapers, and by the mid-1980s, at  the podiums of standing-room-only university halls.  </P> <P> World reaction to the 1987 expulsion of these three men for their alleged  encouragement of university student demonstrations in December, 1986, was swift  and effective. In response to the international outrage that took Chinese  government leaders by surprise in 1988, the authorities permitted Fang and Liu  to travel abroad. Wang has been consistently denied permission to leave China,  despite invitations from groups in the United States.  </P> <P> Wang is the oldest of the three and had been a party member longest -- 50  years. Since his satirical criticism of the Kuomintang government in the 1930s  (he was imprisoned as a youth of 16), Wang has always taken great pleasure in  launching direct, humorous attacks against authority, speaking out for the  underdog, advocating good over evil, "truth" over fiction and a change from the  status quo.  </P> <P> Liu became known outside China, in part, from the English translation of his  reportage in the early 1980s by American China scholars, most notably E. Perry  Link Jr. of UCLA. Fang was a noted figure to American scientists who worked  with him during his 1986 research stint at Princeton's Institute for Advanced  Study, among other places. Thus, Chinese leaders felt great pressure to be  lenient with these two individuals. Wang, on the other hand, is less a  household name to the general China-watcher; although this author has begun to  introduce his views to an American audience, Wang's critical essays and pungent  wit have not been given much international exposure.  </P> <P> Wang's great popularity in China and Hong Kong has protected him from any sort  of punishment even mildly resembling the prosecution of the Cultural  Revolution. He is living comfortably in Shanghai, free to speak with foreigners  and to publish once again, although he must still resort to publishing anything  of a political nature outside of China.  </P> <P> What follow are translated excerpts from a lengthy interview Wang recently  granted to Chen Yige of the Nineties (a Hong Kong monthly magazine, December,  1988). Here, he dispenses with his usual humor and wit, choosing instead to  spell out a no-nonsense critique of the Chinese political and economic scene of  the 1980s. The excerpts focus on Wang's view of the inevitable demise of the  Chinese Communist Party and how the present government might even take a lesson  from Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Does Wang advocate the demise of the Communist  Party? One suspects not, but rather that he puts forth extreme views as a way  to prod the Chinese leadership.  </P> <P> Wang Ruowang is now 71 years old. These excerpts suggest that the youthful Wang  who poked vicious fun at the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek in the  early 1930s is very much alive -- in his own words, still "the naive" person he  has always been, compelled to speak out despite the odds against him and his  convictions.  </P> <P> For clarity, I have grouped these excerpts topically; the subtitles are my own.  </P> <P> The Advantages of Capitalist Democracies and the Hypocrisy of Socialism:  </P> <P> Capitalist political democracy is an intelligent and noble system. It has the  function of regulating contradictions among different classes and it bestows  upon each political party equal rights to free elections and free activities.  Yet in socialist countries ruled by proletarian dictatorship, these superior  features not only do not exist, they are perceived as reactionary and are  summarily rejected.  </P> <P> The character of the Russian and later the Chinese Revolution was not actually  proletarian at all. The proletariat in these two countries has not obtained any  of the rights accorded to masters of one's own country, since even the labor  unions are run by the state.  </P> <P> Wherever the socialist model of state ownership has been implemented, people  have become destitute and the nation backward. We must have the courage to  discard this harmful model. Ready-made models are all around us . . . . All we  have to do is let go of two premises: that the leadership of the Communist  Party is infallible, and that socialism is wonderful.  </P> <P>  The Party's Road to Self-Destruction:  </P> <P> I think the Chinese Communist Party is in the process of accelerating its own  decline. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that it is in a crisis of being down  on all fours, neither dead nor alive. There is a new concept, new for China, at  least, that asks, "Why should a whole nation and a whole people die because of  the degeneration and deterioration of one party?" In a multiparty nation, if a  party has lost the support of the people, its organization disintegrates, but  this does not affect the everyday political and economic workings of the  country. The party doesn't get elected and no longer participates in politics  and that's the end of it.  </P> <P> Looking back at the wounds left by Mao on modern Chinese history, one must  agree that his series of perverse acts and policies paved the way for the death  of the Chinese Communist Party. Even today, what we have is the implementation  of the Maoist line without Mao Tse-tung. The regime won't tamper with the  Mao-era system of one-party, one-man rule.  </P> <P>  One thing that people are very dissatisfied with is the fact that the party  leaders can't be trusted to tell the truth. They say one thing and do another.  Take this year's National Day editorial, for example. Recognizing how alienated  they've become from the masses, the editorial was entitled "Our strength is in  the masses." On the very same day . . . the Public Security Bureau entered  university and college campuses to set up police stations and permanent  public-security organizations. This was a clear case of deeds betraying words.  </P> <P>  The Problem with the Current Reform Strategy:  </P> <P>  To regulate the economic environment without attempting to improve the old  political system of one-party dictatorship is like walking on one leg, like  sending an isolated force into enemy territory.  </P> <P> After five years of purging within the party ranks, there are still no results.  Can corruption be conquered by relying on the Maoist practice of sending down  work groups, survey groups, price investigators and the like? Making this a  temporary task by ferreting out a few corrupt elements and making a big deal  about nabbing one or two major cases and imposing heavy sentences on these few,  while not dealing with serious corruption at the roots, only creates the  following:  </P> <P>  -- Loud thunder, small rain: things get better for a while, then spout up  again as soon as the rain tapers off.  </P> <P>  -- The bottom gets purged while the top is left alone; a few living targets  are nabbed as an example, a few companies whose papers are not complete are  decapitated while large powerful companies that perpetrate outrageous crimes go  their merry way.  </P> <P> Honest advice is grating on the ears. I suspect that these words from the heart  of an expelled former party figure will not sit well with the higher-ups. I  would be forever grateful if only they do not censure me for inciting student  demonstrations again.  </P> <P>  In Reform, Learn From Gorbachev:  </P> <P>  I think Gorbachev's reform strategy is worth emulating. The Soviet Union is  under a socialist system whose source is the same as our own. Its bureaucratic  system of stagnant cadres, leader worship, extreme leftist thinking and corrupt  perversions of the law are particularly deep-seated and are much more serious  than our own.  </P> <P> The difficulties of Soviet reforms are much greater than China's, and they  began their reforms six to seven years later than ours. But Gorbachev . . . has  clearly laid out the aims of reform and defined the unavoidable ideological  struggles. Second, he is purging the top rather than the bottom . . . in stark  contrast to our reforms, which have purged those below rather than those at the  top -- the feet rather than the head.  </P> <P> Third, Gorbachev is stressing political openness and encouraging public  participation in policy-making and unrestrained criticism and discussion,  relying first on intellectuals and granting large-scale freedom to previously  shackled newspapers, television, film, literature and art.  </P> <P> Fourth, he is thoroughly repudiating Stalin's wholesale murder of Bolsheviks  and rehabilitating all wronged victims.  </P> <P> China, too, has rehabilitated the unjustly accused. This good deed cannot be  overlooked. But at the same time, we protect the very instigators of these  trumped up cases and we do not punish the inhumane accomplices who helped  fabricate them to begin with. This perpetrates the impression that bad people  are, as always, in the right, and human-rights abuses are nothing to be ashamed  of.  </P></p>

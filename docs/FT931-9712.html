			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Czech steel maker calls for help A SECOND big Czech company in less than a week has called for urgent financial help from the government to overcome a financial crisis. Poldi United Steelworks, which has already been forced to shut two large plants and has reduced its workforce by half to about 10,000 during the past two years, says it urgently needs 2bn crowns (Pounds 47.6m) to begin to pay back debts totalling 5.1bn crowns. Mr Karel Snabl, Poldi financial manager, wants a loan of 1bn crowns from the government and says the company could raise another 1bn crowns through the sale of property. The crisis broke when the state-owned electricity utility reduced power supplies to the company, which, it says, owes it 260m crowns. Poldi itself is owed 2.8bn crowns by over 200 customers, including some of the Czech republic's largest companies.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / People: Finding a shell in the Channel Tunnel After 111 years the managers of Channel Tunnel Investments, which was set up to dig the first channel tunnel, have called it a day. Sir John Lambert, a 71-year-old retired diplomat who has chaired the shell company since 1986, is handing over to a young team which plans to change the company's name and move into the locking wheel nut business. Philip Ling (right), a 46-year-old industrialist, is heading a new team of directors who plan to use CTI's stock market quotation to take over Carflow Products, the market leader in the supply of car and truck locking wheel nuts, and raise new capital. Subject to the approval of an egm on August 3, the intention is to change the company name to Channel Holdings and build up an industrial group through acquisitions. Apart from Ling, who will be chairman, the proposed new board will be Patrick Rogers, 41, chief executive, Barry Treacy, Carflow's 49-year-old managing director, and Desmond Mitchell, a 34-year-old merchant banker, who will be finance director. Sir John Lambert will retire along with Rodolphe d'Erlanger, a descendant of one of the company's founders, and Roy Treacher. Sir John said that 'although it is a matter of sadness to sever our links with the company's original objective, the board has concluded that it would be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to revivify the company by the acquisition of a successful business with an established profit record.'</p>

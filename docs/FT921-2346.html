			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Sharp rise in jobless may damage Major's prospects - Unemployment: Whichever party wins the election will have to face mounting figures UNEMPLOYMENT has haunted British governments of both parties since the 1970s. It was one of the issues on which Mrs Margaret Thatcher won power in 1979, though it proved no obstacle to her re-election in 1983 or 1987. Mr John Major may not be so lucky. Today, government figures will confirm that unemployment is rising faster than it was in October when Mr Major flirted with calling an election. Government figures put the total out of work at 2.6m in January  - 9.2 per cent of the workforce. City economists expect February's total to rise by at least 35,000. More worrying for the government, unemployment is rising fastest in the south-east and Midlands where many Tory marginals are clustered. Unemployment was higher in both 1983 and 1987 but it is rising more quickly now  - twice as fast over the past year as in the 12 months before the 1983 election. The number of voters worried about losing jobs, homes and security is much larger than the number of unemployed themselves. In any case, 50 per cent of people who become unemployed find jobs within three months. Tory poll readings reached rock-bottom in 1981 when unemployment was rising fastest, even though the jobless figures carried on rising for another five years. In 1987, when the Thatcher government's popularity reached its pre-election peak, unemployment was only marginally below 3m, but it had been falling for almost a year. For many voters in marginals in the south, the fear engendered by the current recession is a new and frightening experience  - unemployment is rising as never before among service-sector and professional employees in the south-east who once believed they were immune. Unemployment is no longer something that happens only to Labour-voting manual workers in the north. It has risen by 386,000 in the past year in the south  - where the Tories hold 66 of their 139 most marginal seats. This is more than three times as fast as in 1983. The north, with a mere 14 marginals, has seen a rise of only 52,000  - albeit from a higher base  - at half the rate of the south. The Conservatives appear surprisingly unflustered by rising unemployment  - Mr Norman Lamont said unemployment was 'a price worth paying' for low inflation. The evidence does suggest that Britain's pay-setting system requires the discipline of unemployment: when unemployment hit its post-war peak of 3.2m in 1986, inflation was at a 20-year low; over the next 44 months unemployment halved and inflation rose to a peak of 10.9 per cent. The government can argue that the 1983 and 1987 general elections proved voters would support the party they believe to have the broadest competence in economic management  - the Tories  - and not the party with the greatest concern for the unemployed  - Labour. Rising unemployment in Tory heartlands need not change this. Traditional Tory voters may continue to believe that Majorism is the best hope for the economy, and thus for their unemployed neighbour. Yet as the campaign develops, the Tories may suffer from the relatively low priority they have given to reducing unemployment since it started rising again in 1989. In real terms, the government is spending a fifth less on tackling unemployment than it did in 1986-87. Deregulation has been the basic Tory answer to unemployment and if the party wins it will offer more of the same. But easing hire and fire regulations has cut both ways, creating jobs quickly as the economy expands yet losing the jobs rapidly in recession. Labour makes no specific pledges on cutting the number of unemployed, unlike the Liberal Democrats who are promising a 600,000 reduction over two years. However, it has promised to eliminate long-term unemployment  - people unemployed for a year or more, currently a third of the total  - within one parliament, and says guaranteeing unemployed person a job or training place after six months can soon be self-financing. Labour's short-term programme to boost training and combat unemployment will cost Pounds 800m. This will include restoring government cuts to Employment Training and Youth Training, and establishing a new work-experience programme which will pay the going 'rate for the job'. However, independent studies estimate that its proposed minimum wage of half of median male earnings will reduce employment by upwards of 100,000, mainly among women and the young. Whoever wins, unemployment is likely to top 3m later this year and, judging by French experience in the European exchange rate mechanism, it could remain close to 2m for a number of years after economic growth resumes. The new employment secretary will be announcing repeated increases in unemployment for many months. The Tories have had a decade of practice; for Labour it could prove a rude awakening to the impotence of political power.</p>

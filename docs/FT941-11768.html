			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / West German output better than expected West German industrial output rose a provisional 0.7 per cent in December last year, supporting the widespread view that the economy has seen the worst of the recession. The improvement followed an unexpectedly sharp drop of 2.1 per cent in November, when cold weather severely hampered construction work. Milder conditions in December bolstered output from the building sector by 5 per cent. Although the figures were better than expected, the Economics Ministry warned it expected a downward adjustment when all the data were available. The warmer weather depressed electricity and gas production by 2 per cent, but all other sectors showed increases. Output from manufacturing industry, excluding energy, mining and construction, rose 0.5 per cent. For last year as a whole, output was 7 per cent down on 1992, but only 2.9 per cent lower in the fourth quarter than a year earlier. Economists said the figures supported their forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth in west Germany this year, but stressed they depended on export demand. Since real incomes were falling, and government spending was being cut, few saw any prospects of growth in domestic demand. This view was supported yesterday by figures from the specialist retail trade which showed a real 5 per cent decline in sales in December. There were also warnings that strikes in the engineering industry could wreck economic growth prospects. Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the government's independent economic advisers, said if the current wave of warning strikes developed into protracted official stoppages, Bonn's hopes of 1.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product would be dashed. While the IG Metall union had already rejected employers' calls for a pay freeze, Mr Pohl suggested real wage cuts were necessary.</p>

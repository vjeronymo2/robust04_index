			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru expects oil contracts of Dollars 500m PERU expects to sign oil contracts worth Dollars 500m (Pounds 279m) this year with foreign investors, according to Mr Fernando Sanchez Albavera, mines and energy minister. At the opening of Peru's 20th annual convention of mining engineers in Lima on Monday night, the minister said that exploration contracts with Texas Crude and American Petroleum would be signed within days. He also hinted that half a dozen other important oil investments were upcoming. Negotiations over the development of the large Camisea gas and hydrocarbon deposits in the central jungle were 'coming along well', he said. Mr Sanchez Albavera also revealed that Inter-American Development Bank financing for Dollars 140m to rehabilitate Peru's state-owned mining and refining company, Centromin, was 'all but approved'. Mr Enrique Iglesias, IADB president, considered it the Bank's 'star project', the minister said. Other government priority investments include Dollars 60m for the high-grade Tintaya copper mine, now transferred from the state to the Cuzco regional government; the modernisation of HierroPeru, the state-owned iron concern; and the expansion of the zinc refinery at Cajamarquilla, which requires Dollars 60m funding in its first stage. The state will no longer invest in mining projects, according to the minister, but become instead a 'promoter of new private sector investments'. Large modifications to Peru's mining laws and the recent ratification by Congress of the World Bank-organised multilateral investment guarantee agreement (MIGA) would also encourage foreign investments, he said.</p>

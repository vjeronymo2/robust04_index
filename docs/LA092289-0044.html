			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALICE B. AT HIGHWAYS  </P> <P> Intelligence, droll humor and considerable theatrical adroitness are the major  charms of Alice B. Theatre, a Seattle-based gay and lesbian performance group  that opened Wednesday night at Highways in Santa Monica for a five-day run.  </P> <P> Associate artistic director Susan Finque is easily the group's most compelling  actor. In one of the tart black-out sketches that make up "Portrait of Iowa,"  she is a matron in a dowdy dress who talks wistfully about the things she looks  forward to: birthday parties, summer camp, Fridays . . . and love with another  woman. With her arms plastered demurely to her sides, Finque creates a rounded  character with the pucker in her mouth, the lift of her chin and the honest  appeal in her eyes.  </P> <P> In excerpts from her own "T.S./Crossing" -- a restless, deliberately  self-conscious undermining of conventional notions of sexual identity -- Finque  begins with a display of rippling musculature and tensile poses as she sits  topless with her back to the audience. Eventually, she dons a man's suit, and  delivers the monologue of an up-tight family man with uncannily convincing body  language.  </P> <P> The teaser is a selection of walks -- woman as man, man as woman, woman as man  as woman -- offered up to the audience as so many actor's tricks.  </P> <P> Artistic director Rick Rankin's "Attack of the Zombie Back-Up Singers" features  him as a fast-talking guy in a white coat telling the campily baroque title  story with the aid of a flip chart. Larry Lefler is a vamping zombie in white  formal gloves and a sequined dress. The piece is a hoot until the end, when a  hokey set of metaphors lumbers in.  </P> <P> The fourth company member, appearing in "Portrait," is Timothy Jones. His  delivery is often forced, as if he has heard his lines before and doesn't quite  believe them. CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

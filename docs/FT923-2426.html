			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Depressed spending levels leave AMV lower ABBOTT MEAD Vickers, the advertising agency, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.54m for the first half of 1992, a modest fall from the comparable Pounds 1.9m. Turnover increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 77.7m (Pounds 73m) during a period of generally depressed client spending. Excluding income from BBDO and minor agencies, turnover expanded by less than 1 per cent, reflecting a reduction of client spending of about 10 per cent. AMV, which in March 1991 acquired BBDO, the London agency of BBDO Worldwide, said that it had new business worth Pounds 42m in the first half and was currently pitching for a further Pounds 39m. New accounts won so far this year include ICL, Pillsbury, Adidas and Weetabix. Operating profits fell to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.5m). Mr David Abbott, chairman, said: 'We have continued to pay close attention to costs, giving selective salary increase only, holding property costs and minimising ancillary expenditure.' Earnings per share dropped to 6p (8.63p), but the interim dividend goes up 7 per cent to 3p (2.8p). James Capel, the broker, is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.1m for the year (Pounds 5.02m).</p>

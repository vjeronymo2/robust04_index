			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Prosecutors raid Japanese MP's office: Nakamura ready for battle Japanese prosecutors moved against a national politician yesterday for the first time in their year-long investigation into widespread corruption involving the construction industry and the political establishment, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office raided the offices of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, former construction minister, whom they allege may have taken cash in exchange for quashing an anti-trust investigation into bid rigging among big builders. Prosecutors set in motion a rarely-invoked constitutional procedure for stripping a lawmaker of his immunity from arrest. It would be the first time in 27 years that a Japanese lawmaker was subject to such humiliation. But Mr Nakamura, from the conservative opposition Liberal Democratic party (LDP), said he was willing to be arrested and fight the charges. Earlier he had rejected repeated requests to show up at the prosecutor's office for voluntary questioning. But yesterday he issued a statement through his lawyers, saying he was ready for a court battle. 'I dared to opt for being arrested. I am determined to reveal the truth of the matter in court,' he said. 'As for my arrest, I want the prosecutors to designate the time and date. I strongly hope to be arrested at the main entrance of the Diet (parliament) building.' Since the inquiry started in March last year, more than 30 executives of Japan's six biggest building companies have been arrested along with four local government leaders. So far, no national politician has been arrested. Lawmakers cannot be arrested while parliament is in session. Normally anyone who comes under scandal allegations submits to voluntary questioning to avoid public exposure. Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki described Mr Nakamura's case as 'historic' and voiced his full support for the prosecutors. 'This is a historic scandal. I believe it will turn the history of Japanese politics,' Mr Mikazuki said. The LDP ruled Japan for 38 years but lost its majority in general elections last year, ceding power to a coalition headed by Premier Morihiro Hosokawa. 'This is a very serious matter for our party,' the LDP parliamentary business manager Mr Sadatoshi Ozato said. The LDP has launched a campaign against Mr Hosokawa, attacking him for bungling the economy, botching a US-Japan trade summit meeting and failing to settle divisions within his coalition. Mr Nakamura's status in the once-dominant party might explain why prosecutors singled him out first among 12 national politicians said to be on their list.</p>

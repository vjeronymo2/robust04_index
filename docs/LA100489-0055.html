			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURRECTION IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY VIEWED AS FLAWED IN WAKE OF ANOTHER COUP FAILURE  </P> <P> The failure of Tuesday's coup in Panama exposed a major flaw in the  longstanding U.S. strategy of trying to turn that country's military against  strongman Manuel A. Noriega, according to experts on Panama's military.  </P> <P> Internal dissent may be easy to foment -- Tuesday's coup began with only four  officers. But Panama's officer corps is so small and heavily salted with  Noriega loyalists that conspiracies are difficult to execute successfully, the  experts say.  </P> <P> With only half a dozen colonels and roughly a dozen lieutenant colonels in the  entire army, Panama's "is the most pyramidal officer corps in Latin America,"  said one of the experts, Richard Millet, a historian at Southern Illinois  University. Noriega's intelligence agents "watch them like a hawk."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Officer Corps  </P> <P> Keeping the officer corps small "is how they've maintained control all along,"  said Millet.  </P> <P> And "the fact that these were reasonably low-level officers" who staged  Tuesday's uprising -- a major and three captains -- "shows that Noriega has  been reasonably effective" in keeping that control intact, said Robert Kurtz of  the Brookings Institution.  </P> <P> For several years, U.S. officials have been trying to prod the Panama Defense  Forces into staging an anti-Noriega coup. A succession of U.S. officials,  including President Bush, have made public statements emphasizing that the  United States has a grievance against Noriega, personally, but not against the  Panama Defense Forces as an institution.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have repeatedly told reporters that those statements, which were  repeated Tuesday, were designed to send a message to the military that a coup  would be looked on favorably.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beyond Rhetoric?  </P> <P> There have also been reports that U.S. support for a coup had gone beyond  rhetoric. Members of Congress who have been in close contact with Panamanian  opposition figures said Tuesday that U.S. officials had promised to aid a coup  attempt.  </P> <P> However, Noriega in recent months has moved to increase his control still  further by promoting his own loyalists within the defense forces, forcing other  officers into retirement, said Prof. Steven Ropp of the University of Wyoming,  who is also an expert on the Panamanian military. Those moves may have  contributed to Tuesday's "palace coup," Ropp said, but they also solidified  support among the officers who benefited and supplied a strong incentive for  the loyalist counterattack that reasserted Noriega's control.  </P> <P> The techniques of control in the Panamanian military have been carefully honed  by years of experience. Noriega, himself, first became a major wielder of power  in Panama by playing a part in a successful coup that brought a group of  captains and majors to power in 1968. One year later, he helped put down a coup  aimed at his patron, Gen. Omar Torrijos, Panama's strongman at the time. And  over the years, Noriega has put down several other coup attempts and intrigues  aimed at removing him from power, emerging stronger from each one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Led by Four Officers  </P> <P> Tuesday's coup attempt appears to have begun with only four officers led by  Maj. Moises Giraldi Vega, a company commander in the Urraca battalion, a unit  assigned primarily to guard the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters in  Panama City. The headquarters are about a half mile from the Pacific entrance  of the Panama Canal and a similar distance from the headquarters of the U.S.  Southern Command. Several junior and senior officers of the Urraca Battalion  were passed over for promotions last summer.  </P> <P> "My best guess is what we have here is a palace coup" with no political  content, said Ropp. Part of the motivation may have been disgruntlement on part  of officers who have been passed over for promotion, he said. "There have been  a lot of junior officers that have been retired in the last couple of months."  </P> <P> Giraldi appears to have timed his coup attempt for a period when the main  combat force of the Panama Defense Forces, the so-called Battalion 2000, would  be away from its bases outside Panama City on a training exercise. His company,  U.S. experts said, is a lightly armed unit with fewer than 200 soldiers. But,  they noted, in an army as small as Panama's -- only about 6,000 troops  nationwide with few heavy weapons -- a force that small would be enough to get  an insurrection started.  </P> <P> Battalion 2000, which was set up earlier in this decade to be the force that  would guard the Panama Canal once Panama retakes control of the waterway, does  possess some armor and enough force to put down any rebellion. On Tuesday, it  did. Within a few hours after shooting had started, reporters in Panama City  saw Battalion 2000 troops returning to the city and surrounding the  headquarters barracks where Giraldi and his men were based.  </P> <P> And so long as Noriega retains the loyalty of the Battalion 2000 officers, U.S.  hopes of a coup that would unseat him are unlikely to come true, military  experts agreed.  </P> <P> "I suspect there are a lot of officers who'd like to see him go," said Millet.  "But they're not willing to risk their own rear ends to do it."  </P></p>

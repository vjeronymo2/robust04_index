			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Blazer furnishes its one-off image BLAZER has always been one of those cult stores whose influence was infinitely more important than its size. Started by David Krantz (who now is looking after his newest baby, the mail order clothing company Racing Green), from one shop in Golders Green in north London in 1979, it is now part of the Storehouse Group; it has 24 branches all over the UK and a niche in the hearts and minds of many a snappy man about town. Its strength has been its commitment to understated, classic clothes of high quality with a distinctly English look - navy wool blazers, crisp Oxford shirts, cotton chinos. According to Robert Jenkins, its new young managing director, Blazer, largely because of its quality image, has not been as seriously affected by the recession as some more prosaic lines. Nonetheless, he says: 'I wouldn't have liked to have lived through the last two years without the backing of Storehouse.' Given the brief by his masters 'to make it gallop' he felt he had to do something. The first thing was to initiate some qualitative market research which revealed that the typical Blazer man reads the FT (wise fellow), The Times and The Economist. He also prefers Virgin Atlantic Airways to any other, takes two holidays a year (one skiing in the winter, one long-haul), drives a Golf GTI or a BMW and is likely to live in Fulham, Hampstead or Richmond. It also revealed that as customers' spending power decreased, fashion had increasingly to compete with other things (like the skiing, the long-haul holiday and the cars), in particular with reasonably priced one-off design products, which were doing surprisingly well in an otherwise gloomy retailing scene. It also emerged that 26 per cent of the adult population in Britain bought at least one example of British crafts during last year, and that the same number visited at least one crafts exhibition. From there Jenkins developed an idea of linking the Blazer shops with individual, distinctive, one-off craft pieces. Having discovered that his customers disliked frequent sales ('it undermined their confidence in the product') he decided to generate interest and excitement in his shops by commissioning a piece of furniture from several distinguished designers. Each piece would feature prominently in one of the stores, and a brochure was produced showing each designer (almost all of whom were already Blazer customers) wearing some of the clothes. The exhibition is shortly to finish, so anybody interested should hurry along to their nearest Blazer branch where every one of these pieces can be bought. Even if it has already been sold the shop can link designer and potential customer or client so other pieces in similar vein can be bought or commissioned. In the meantime, the splendid brochure shows Designer Man looking very creative in a series of Blazer clothing, reaching out to creative directors, art directors, film directors, interior designers and showing that there is more Blazer than mere Yuppiedom. Malcolm Temple, a painter turned furniture maker, for instance, is shown wearing a pinstriped suit teamed with a T-shirt and grey flannels and a classic blazer with a two-buttoned woollen polo shirt instead of a shirt and tie. Matthew Hilton looks arty and relaxed in jeans and informally formal in grey flannels, a blazer and a white polo-shirt. So far this link between the shops and creative design looks to be very fruitful. Customers are interested, the designers have had some new customers and Robert Jenkins is already wondering what he will do next - paintings, sculpture? It will be something, you can be sure. The promotion is currently on at Blazer shops in London in Derry Street, Kensington; 33a King's Road, SW3; Long Acre, Covent Garden WC2; New Bond Street, W1; 170 Oxford Street W1. Out of London: 8-10 Old Bond Street, Bath; 31a-32 East Street, Brighton; 10 High Street, Nottingham; 15 Hill Street, Richmond, Surrey; Above Bath Street, Southampton.</p>

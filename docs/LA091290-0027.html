			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PAEZ ACCEPTS BASKETBALL POST AT L. A. BANNING  </P> <P> Three months after he resigned as a coach and teacher with the Los Angeles  Unified School District, former Cleveland High basketball Coach Marc Paez is  back doing both -- at Banning High in Wilmington.  </P> <P> Paez, 30, who left Cleveland in June after leading the Cavaliers to a 21-6  record and into the City Section 4-A Division semifinals in his only season  with the team, was hired last week.  </P> <P> Paez, who cited external distractions and the pressure to win at Cleveland as  prime reasons for resigning, said he does not expect to have such problems at  Banning.  </P> <P> "Obviously, time will tell, but I suspect that it'll be closer to what I hope  to find at the high school level," Paez said. "I anticipate less off-the-court  distractions. It should be closer to what I think high school basketball is all  about."  </P> <P> Paez replaces Gary Cain, who coached the Pilots for four seasons and will focus  on his duties as a counselor. Banning is a member of the City 4-A Division and  competes in the Southern Pacific Conference against teams such as Dorsey and  Crenshaw. The Pilots finished 11-13 overall in 1989-90.  </P> <P> Paez said he had turned down several offers -- including coaching posts with  professional teams in Ireland and Turkey -- before Banning Principal Augie  Herrera called last month.  </P> <P> "Ireland wasn't exactly a hotbed for European basketball," he said. "And  besides, the money was marginal."  </P> <P> He said he was seriously considering accepting the position in Turkey until  Iraq invaded Kuwait. Turkey borders Iraq.  </P> <P> Banning contacted him at the recommendation of City Section Commissioner Hal  Harkness, whom Herrera had contacted to discuss prospective coaches.  </P> <P> "From what I know about him and from the endorsements from (Cleveland Principal  Ida Mae Windham), I thought that if somebody of his caliber and character was  available, we should try to keep him around," Harkness said.  </P> <P> Paez said he welcomes the job of building a program that has struggled.  Banning, a perennial City power in football, traditionally has fielded .500  teams in basketball.  </P> <P> "It's a completely different set of challenges," he said. "The goal at  Cleveland was to maintain that tradition and take it a step further. But just  because we don't have the same kind of talent here that we had at Cleveland  doesn't mean I won't put in the same kind of effort."  </P></p>

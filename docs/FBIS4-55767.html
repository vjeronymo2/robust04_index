			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- Commenting on the latest  accord between the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) and  the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), FKGP Chairman  Jozsef Torgyan said the Christian Democrats have recognized the  need for inter-party cooperation in pursuing a national-oriented  and populist policy which may be joined by all who wish to  prevent a communist restoration and a shift to the left in  Hungary.    Addressing an FKGP rally at Soltvadkert, southern Hungary,  Torgyan said that his party, which won almost 9 percent of votes  in the first round of the parliamentary elections and thus  remained a parliamentary party, has clearly demonstrated that it  is the only legitimate smallholder party which is accepted by  the Hungarian people.    Torgyan qualified the outcome of the first round, the great  rout by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), as a tragic  development. In his view, "after four and a half decades of  communist rule, four years were enough for the Hungarian nation  to vote communism back in voluntarily."    Torgyan said that although the MSZP leaders do not seem to  seek the restoration of communism, the party carries a mass of  dead-weight, 99 percent of which came from the former state  party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The FKGP  chairman pressed for every possible step to be made to prevent  the MSZP's further strengthening.    "Since the nation has not time to wait for four years and  put  its hope in changes, the Smallholders offer their support for  the winners if they truly act in the interest of the Hungarian  people. However, should the winners worsen the fate of the  people, who already carry unbearable burdens, the FKGP will  become a tough opposition," Torgyan said.</p>

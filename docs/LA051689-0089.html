			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> IBM, APPLE COPY EACH OTHER'S MAIN STRENGTHS  </P> <P> In a curious twist to the long-running battle for control of the personal  computer market, industry rivals International Business Machines Corp. and  Apple Computer Inc. are aping each other's greatest strengths, industry  analysts say.  </P> <P> In its most significant software move in years, IBM will introduce today a  collection of software that will streamline the programs run on its machines,  giving them a "look and feel" much like Apple's highly successful Macintosh.  </P> <P> The new software, analysts said, will allow IBM's machines to become more  compatible by using a single system for controlling machines ranging from  personal computers to mainframes.  </P> <P> The Macintosh has long benefited from such a software system, which allows  computer users to learn other programs more easily once they have mastered one  program.  </P> <P> Big Blue's innovations are not lost on Apple.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New System  </P> <P> At a meeting of software developers last week, the Cupertino, Calif.-based  computer maker said it was designing an operating system that will provide  easier access to mainframe computers such as IBM's for Apple users.  </P> <P> Apple also said the operating system would have the ability to do several  computations at once, one of the strengths of IBM's PS/2 line of personal  computers.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said both computer makers are trying to make the most  powerful machines on the market -- mainframes -- far more accessible to  personal computer customers.  </P> <P> IBM can use its new linking capacity to sell packages that include larger,  higher-end machines, while Apple will emphasize its new ability to work with  other computer systems, analysts said.  </P> <P> The software introductions by IBM, the major producer of mainframes, would also  test its ability to sell the PS/2 line of personal computers introduced two  years ago.  </P> <P> Since then, IBM's PC market share has slid, partly because of the lack of  programs taking advantage of PS/2's Micro Channel architecture, which enables  the system to do several tasks at once.  </P> <P> Last year, IBM trailed Apple in the number of personal computers shipped --  1.23 million to 1.27 million -- for the first time since it entered the market  in 1982, according to San Jose-based Dataquest Inc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expensive Memory  </P> <P> One reason for the slide: IBM's OS/2 operating system, which controls the basic  functions of the PS/2, requires a large amount of memory, which is expensive.  Last week, IBM announced rebates of up to $800 on memory packages to entice new  customers.  </P> <P> "They came out with the price cuts because people are not migrating," said  Paine Webber analyst Stephen Smith.  </P> <P> Smith said IBM still needs more software applications, such as spreadsheets,  that take full advantage of the speed and power of the PS/2.  </P> <P> Other analysts said applications taking full advantage of the PS/2 would not be  out until the fall, which is still months ahead of when Apple expects its  System 7.0 upgrade.  </P> <P> The degree to which PS/2 sales pick up will certainly affect Compaq Computer  Corp., the largest producer of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones.  </P> <P> Houston-based Compaq's sales have soared as IBM struggled through the  transition to the PS/2.  </P> <P> Compaq supplies about 7% of the computer units used by large companies,  according to La Jolla-based Computer Intelligence.  </P> <P> Analysts say rising PS/2 sales would cut into Compaq's market share, which  already dropped one point last week after IBM introduced its price rebates and  two upgraded machines.  </P> <P> As Apple and IBM continue to duel over leadership, other manufacturers have  hedged their bets on whether the OS/2 system will become a standard.  </P></p>

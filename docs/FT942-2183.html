			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil dominate Russia in comfortable victory Rai hit the first penalty of the 1994 competition and Romario scored his first World Cup finals goal as Brazil beat Russia 2-0 last night at Stanford stadium near San Francisco. Barcelona striker Romario turned in a corner from strike partner Bebeto in the 27th minute and Rai fired home a spot kick in the 53rd after Romario had been fouled. A sellout crowd of 81,061 saw the Brazilians create many more chances in a one-sided game in which Russia's goalkeeper, Dmitri Kharin of Chelsea, made two stunning stops. The Russians, depleted by the absence of overseas stars such as Manchester United's Andrei Kanchelskis following a dispute with coach Pavel Sadyrin, also had their captain, Viktor Onopko, missing through suspension. Following their victory, Brazil were installed as 9-4 favourites to win the tournament with both William Hill and Ladbrokes bookmakers.</p>

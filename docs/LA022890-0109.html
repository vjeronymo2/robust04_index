			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOP-UP 'TURNS CORNER' AS MORE SHORE REOPENED;  </P> <P> OIL SPILL: BIOLOGICAL TESTS FIND NO PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. OFFICIALS SAY BEACHES  IN MANY AREAS ARE CLEANER THAN BEFORE THE DISASTER.  </P> <P> About a mile of beach between the Newport and Balboa piers was reopened Tuesday  after a battery of biological tests found no public health threat from crude  oil that blackened long stretches of Orange County shoreline after the Feb. 7  spill.  </P> <P> Officials announced that several more miles of shoreline in Newport Beach and  Huntington Beach could be reopened to sunbathers and surfers today, a sign that  the massive $12-million cleanup of the 394,000-gallon spill from the tanker  American Trader may soon end.  </P> <P> "We've definitely turned a corner," said a smiling but exhausted Huntington  Beach Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard.  </P> <P> Mop-up operations have been so thorough that Picard and others say beaches in  many areas are cleaner than before the spill -- a bonus to beach-goers who have  been banned for three weeks from 10 miles of some of California's most popular  strands. Gone are bottle caps, cigarette butts and candy wrappers. "It's  amazing," said one Newport Beach lifeguard. "It's never been this squeaky  clean."  </P> <P> Picard said that repeated sanitizing of beaches with heavy machinery has  removed oil globs and even "fluffed" the sand.  </P> <P> "If you pick this sand up and put it on a slope, you could ski on it," said  Picard, the city's oil spill operations commander.  </P> <P> As beaches began reopening, British Petroleum Tuesday consolidated its cleanup  operations at the lifeguard headquarters at Huntington State Beach near  Magnolia Street, about a half mile from the Santa Ana River where scores of  workers scrubbed oil-stained rock jetties.  </P> <P> At a press conference in Long Beach, Admiral Paul A. Yost, commandant of the  U.S. Coast Guard, said the spill recovery effort stands as "a textbook case of  an excellent cleanup. . . . The job is basically done. There is very little  left."  </P> <P> In Huntington Beach, concern eased about damage to a newly restored wildlife  habitat fouled last weekend by a thin layer of oily residue carried into the  marsh by high tides. Most of the oil sheen in the channel linking the marsh  with the ocean had been removed by Tuesday, and biologists decided to leave the  brownish residue that lightly coated several of the wildlife nesting islands,  fearing that cleanup efforts might disturb the ecologically sensitive mud  flats.  </P> <P> "We're going to let it dry and bake in the sun and hope nature takes care of  it," said Gary Gorman, executive director of the Huntington Beach Wetlands  Conservancy.  </P> <P> Along the shoreline, public health and safety remained the chief concern, and  the release Tuesday of the first results from tests on samples of sand fouled  by the spill were encouraging. The tests are required by local municipalities  and county health officials as the last step before bans on beach use from  Newport Harbor to Bolsa Chica State Beach near Warner Avenue could be lifted.  </P> <P> State and local officials have agreed that a beach is safe for public use if  the average levels of petroleum hydrocarbons -- including benzene and toluene,  both cancer-causing agents -- are below 100 parts per million. The average for  84 samples -- taken every 500 feet between the Newport and Balboa piers -- was  14.3 parts per million, said Richard Wade, president of Med-Tox Associates  Inc., an Anaheim-based environmental health firm hired by British Petroleum to  conduct the tests.  </P> <P> "We are satisfied that the beach is safe," said Newport Beach Fire Capt. Randy  Scheerer. "We opened the beach about noon. It's a step in the right direction."  </P> <P> More beaches may reopen today when test results are expected for a stretch of  shoreline from the Balboa Pier to Newport Harbor and for much of Bolsa Chica  State Beach. It takes about 30 hours to complete the tests on sand collected at  depths ranging from six to 10 inches below the surface, Wade said. Chemists  took samples in Huntington Beach on Tuesday for the first time, and officials  said some of the city's shoreline there may be reopened, if tests are  favorable, on Thursday.  </P> <P> Once beaches reopen, Ronald Rasmussen, an associate adjunct professor of  community and environmental health at UC Irvine, said exposure to any leftover  oil could cause minor skin irritation. But he emphasized that any oil residue  on the beach would not cause long-lasting toxic effects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ON THE BEACH  </P> <P> Officials began Tuesday to open more portions of the Orange County shoreline  that had been tainted by Alaskan crude spilled Feb. 7 by the tanker American  Trader.  </P> <P> WHAT'S OPEN  </P> <P> All beaches south of Corona del Mar  </P> <P> About a mile of beach between the Newport and Balboa piers  </P> <P> All beaches north of Bolsa Chica State Beach from Warner Avenue to the  Orange-Los Angeles county line.  </P> <P> WHAT'S CLOSED  </P> <P> Bolsa Chica State Beach  </P> <P> All city and state beaches in Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Newport Beach from the Santa Ana River to Newport Pier and from Balboa Pier to  Newport Harbor  </P> <P> Source: County and city officials.  </P></p>

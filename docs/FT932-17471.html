			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Amato asked to stay at helm ITALY'S President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has asked the Amato government to stay on in office - at least until the referendums due on April 18 - in the absence of early agreement on an alternative. This is the upshot of an exhaustive series of consultations held throughout Tuesday by President Scalfaro. The main parties, while unanimous in calling for a government based on broader support than the current four-party coalition, are deadlocked on how this should be achieved. The lira, under strong pressure since the beginning of the week because of political uncertainties, recovered slightly yesterday. But this appeared to reflect the market's view that the currency was undervalued at close to L1,000 to the D-Mark rather than confidence in a satisfactory political solution. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, is now in the hapless position of being obliged to soldier on, heading a government whose days are numbered. One of the main stumbling blocks to finding a broader based government is the reluctance of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the Republicans to join forces, albeit for a limited period, with the ruling parties whom they regard as discredited. The impermanence of the government was underlined yesterday by Mr Amato's decision not to fill the finance ministry portfolio. This was left vacant on Tuesday by the resignation of Mr Franco Reviglio, a Socialist senator, because of his alleged involvement in the corruption scandals. When Mr Gianni Fontana resigned as minister of agriculture on March 21 for the same reason, Mr Amato replaced him to show his determination to keep the government alive. Mr Reviglio, the fifth minister to resign because of the corruption investigations, is alleged to have received illicit funds while chairman of Eni, the state oil concern, from 1983 to 1989. The gap between what Italy's political parties said they received in revenue and what they said they spent quadrupled during 1992 to L27bn (Pounds 11.3m). According to the parties' balance sheets published yesterday, just a week after their 1991 accounts, revenues totalled L279.4bn while outgoings were L306bn. The accumulated deficit of the parties reached L134bn, a 24 per cent rise during the year. The accounts, prepared in the light of investigations into illicit party funding, still fail to reflect the true picture.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / National Savings rates cut: Mortgage lenders say move eases pressure to raise cost of borrowing THE GOVERNMENT cut National Savings interest rates yesterday in a move apparently aimed at avoiding mortgage rate rises by building societies. This was the second rate cut by National Savings in just over two weeks. The reduction comes at the end of a week of repeated warnings by the Council of Mortgage Lenders and building society executives that they would soon be forced to put up mortgage interest rates because of competition from National Savings. National Savings rates have been cut on a variety of products by between 0.25 and 0.8 percentage points. The 37th issue of tax-free certificates, introduced only in May, has been withdrawn. The new 38th issue will pay 7.5 per cent if held for five years, against 8 per cent on the 37th issue. Mortgage lenders welcomed the news, saying it removed the likelihood of an immediate rates rise. Halifax, the largest UK mortgage lender, which earlier in the day called for the stamp duty threshold to be doubled to Pounds 60,000 to help the housing market, said the National Savings decision eased some of the competitive pressures on interest rates but added: 'We will still need to watch the situation closely.' Nationwide, the second-largest society, said it might be able to make a small reduction in its savings rates. Yesterday's cuts followed a sharp increase in the contribution of National Savings' products to funding the public sector borrowing requirement in recent months. National Savings estimated that it contributed Pounds 600m to funding the PSBR last month, lifting its total contribution to financing the government deficit to Pounds 2.1bn in the first four months of the financial year. The government's official PSBR target for 1992-93 is Pounds 28bn, but the outturn is expected to be several billion pounds higher. Treasury officials said this inflow was well ahead of the share of funding allocated to National Savings. Explaining yesterday's cuts, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government did 'not wish to see National Savings interest rates kept any higher than is necessary to make their contribution to funding'. Treasury officials denied that this third cut in National Savings rates since the election was a direct result of pressure from the building societies to make National Savings rates less attractive. But they admitted that ministers had taken into account the effect of the high level of inflows into National Savings on building society finances. The officials added that the decision had no implications for UK bank base rates, which have been at 10 per cent since May 5. Base rates would be kept at whatever level was necessary to maintain sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism and to continue to bear down on inflation, they said. City economists said the cuts showed that last month's half-point reduction in the First Option Bond rate had failed to bolster building society inflows. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the cuts, so soon after the July measure, gave the impression the government was panicking in its desire to avoid higher mortgage rates. It was unclear that the latest move would be sufficient 'to do the trick'. The move was welcomed by senior Tory backbenchers, some of whom have been critical of the government's economic policy in recent weeks. Mr Terence Higgins, former chairman of the all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee, said it was 'entirely sensible' for the government to adopt a 'flexible attitude' in current circumstances. Mr Nick Brown, Labour's frontbench Treasury spokesman, described the move as 'a very small adjustment' which was 'unlikely to meet the needs of the present situation'.

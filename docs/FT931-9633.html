			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Observer: Off with the motley Few resorts have seen tourism collapse so much in the last few years as has Rio de Janeiro. Petty crime is now so common there that the US Traveller's Advisory Service warns visitors not to walk in the streets at any time. The city's new administration is hard at work with hotel-owners on a remedial campaign. Its main emphasis is on repolishing the image of the Cidade Maravilhosa (marvellous city), largely by claiming the situation to be exaggerated by foreigners. Hence the authorities' horror on hearing of the display to be mounted on one of the giant floats in next week's Carnival parade, the city's main annual attraction. The theme, presented with great verve by the Caprichosos de Pilares samba school, is hapless tourists being not only robbed and assaulted by street children, but molested by transvestites. Out went a formal protest from a furious secretary of tourism to the League of Samba Schools, fulminating about 'profoundly bad taste', and trying to ban the offending display. But, brandishing the right to free expression, the particular school concerned is having none of it, and a legal battle is under way. Oddly enough, last year there was a float depicting England, which consisted of a double-decker bus being smashed up by football hooligans and the like. It raised no protest at all.</p>

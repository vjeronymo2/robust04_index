			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (11): An endangered species - Traditional cafes / These familiar French institutions are closing at the rate of 5,000 a year and the more famous survivors have become objects of nostalgic fascination for tourists WHENEVER the French newspapers, or television news crews, are short of a story they rush off to one of the tiny tabac bars, the cafes au coin along the Parisian back streets, dust down a few Robert Doisneau photographs, and publish yet another obituary of the cafe. The French cafe, with its prim patronne and zinc comptoir, is an endangered species. There are now only 70,000 cafes in France, compared with 510,000 in their early 1900s heyday. The decline continues with at least 5,000 more cafes closing each year. The cafe au coin is a victim of modernity. Almost every innovation in the 20th century has hit it in one way or another. The decline of heavy industry has taken a toll on its blue collar clientele. The spread of takeaway sushi bars means that fewer Parisians pop out for snacks at their local cafes. Rising living standards have made cafe staff far stroppier about working long hours for low pay. Anyone who cherishes the idea of reliving one of Doisneau's 1950s cafe scenes on their next visit to Paris is probably doomed to disappointment. The grand cafes, Aux Deux Magots on boulevard Saint-Germain and the Cafe de la Paix on boulevard Haussmann by the Opera, are now teeming with tourists and most of the cafes aux coins, once Art Nouveau idylls, are smoke-filled monuments to 1960s retail redesign with vinegary vins and formica-like food. There are still a few really pretty cafes with authentic interiors dotted around the city, although they have probably survived by accident rather than design. Le Cochon a l'Oreille on rue Montmartre has weathered the disappearance of its original customers, the workers from the nearby Les Halles fruit and vegetable market. It now serves basic, but tasty bistro fare from its sumptuous ceramic-lined interior to the new community of office workers, and journalists who have converged on Les Halles. The tiny cafe-tabac a few streets away on the corner of place des Petits-Peres at the back of place des Victoires, serves even simpler fare. But it does sell reasonable wines and excellent espresso from an unspoilt Art Nouveau interior. There is also a sprinkling of pleasant cafes and bars along rue Vieille du Temple in the Marais and on the side streets straddling rue de l'Universite in Saint-Germain. If you still long to while away an hour over a cafe-creme at a grand Parisian cafe, the best choice is Cafe de Flore on boulevard Saint-Germain. Cafe de Flore's coffee and carpaccio are delicious, and there are not quite so many tourists as at Aux Deux Magots a few doors away. Alternatively you could plump for one of dozens of salons du the that have popped up across Paris in recent years. The rise of the salons du the is one of the main reasons for the demise of the Parisian cafe, as they tend to offer fresher food - generally salads, tartes and cakes - in prettier surroundings than the traditional cafes au coin. A Priori The in the lovely old Galerie Vivienne by place des Victoires is an excellent example, with delicious salads and tartes, served on simple wooden tables with pretty wicker chairs. The best tables are outside on the mosaic floor of the galerie, where you can watch the sunlight shafting through the glazed roof in the summer, or, if you are very lucky, snowflakes settling on snowy winter days. The only hitch is that A Priori The is packed every lunchtime - so arrive early. Tea Follies on place Gustave-Toudouze just below Pigalle is another classic Parisian tea room serving traditional teas with scones, laced with local delicacies such as its delicious savoury tarts and chicken pies. Le Loir dans la Theiere is another old-fashioned tea room on rue des Rosiers in the heart of the Marais, where you can sink down into the battered armchairs to choose from a delicious selection of cakes, salads and tartes (the pascualina spinach tarte is the house speciality) among its Alice in Wonderland wall murals. If you are in too much of a hurry to contemplate languishing at a cafe, the best places in Paris for really speedy snacks are the branches of Lina's, the chain of deluxe sandwich bars, on rue Etienne Marcel along from Place des Victoires, on rue Marboeuf off the avenue Champs-Elysees and on the third floor of the Galeries Lafayette department store. The system of service at Lina's can seem a little bizarre to the uninitiated. You queue at the counter to give your order to one of the sandwich makers (most of whom seem to have been selected for their looks rather than their skill at spreading moutarde on your jambon only to then queue again to pay at the cashdesk. You then return to your original queue - hopefully elbowing your way through to the front - to collect up your order from the sandwich-maker. It is all worthwhile. Lina's does make the very best sandwiches in Paris. Its chunky pain pave is particularly tasty, especially when rounded off by the house speciality, a Lina's chocolate brownie.</p>

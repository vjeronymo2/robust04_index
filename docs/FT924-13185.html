			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Green spirit of America The great green hope of the US presidential election is Senator Al Gore. He is a man of quality, perhaps more so than Governor Bill Clinton, whose behaviour as president is unpredictable. As vice-president, Mr Gore would press for strong environmental policies. He is, happily, obsessed with the subject. He would be at least as much of a positive force in favour of strategies that protect the planet as Vice-President Dan Quayle is a negative one. Those of us who regard the threat of global warming as the most important political issue since the fall of communism will feel a certain quickening of the pulse at the prospect of an actively conservationist presidency of the US. This matters more than the little local question of how Britain came to be governed by a sorcerer's apprentice and his pals. The Clinton-Gore manifesto promises US environmental leadership. Whether we believe its fine words or not, the pair of them can hardly do worse than President Bush. The chances are that Mr Clinton would put Senator Tim Wirth in charge of Washington's environmental protection agency. Now retiring from the senate, Mr Wirth is a Gore ally. He is also working hard on the Clinton campaign. He could attend earth summits with the support of the new president, in contrast to the recent fiasco at Rio, where Mr Bush undercut everything the EPA stands for. Hold on. For any of this to happen Mr Clinton has to win the election. The conventional wisdom is that he will, but those of us who observed the British contest in April will want to see the votes counted before being certain. Mr Clinton is not wholly impervious to assaults on his integrity. That is why Mr Bush is fighting dirty. If the Democrats do win, they will be reminded of their green promises, of which the central one is to 'shatter the false choice between environmental protection and economic growth by creating a market-based environmental protection strategy that rewards conservation and 'green' business practices while penalising polluters.' The sentiment is unexceptionable, but in the US the opportunities for lobbies to sabotage the implementation are infinite. On his showing in the debate with Mr Quayle this week Mr Gore is not an ideal campaigner for what should be a popular cause. Mr Quayle, of all people, roughed him up; Mr Gore came across as tight, pre-programmed, a little priggish. 'Lighten up Al - inhale,' smiled the vice-president, getting in a reminder that Mr Clinton had once smoked marijuana without breathing in. As vice-president, Mr Gore would have to develop a quicker response mechanism to match the sound-bites put out by the despoilers who deride greens as extremists or, worse, 'fern-feelers'. If you read Mr Gore's passionate book, Earth in the Balance, you see the public relations problem. It is a splendid work, but there is an air of talking to the plants in it. The sub-title, Ecology and the Human Spirit, says it all. This is not an age in which you can easily speak or write of spiritual matters. Mr Gore does, at length. Over-industrialisation and the frenetic pursuit of the fruits of growth at the cost of asset-stripping the earth are seen as manifestations of human emptiness. The rot set in when Plato, later followed by Descartes, sold the idea that we are disembodied intellects, separate from nature, free to exploit it. Mr Gore is mystic in his affirmation of the opposite view. He assures us that the proportion of water in our bodies is about the same as the proportion of water on the earth's surface, while the salt content in our blood is nearly equivalent to the salt content of the sea. It is easy to mock, but I am with Gore's analysis all the way. The civilisation that seems to have narrowly escaped death-raying itself with nuclear weapons is destroying itself slowly by pumping carbon accumulated over thousands of years into the air in a few decades, while allowing the earth's population to quadruple in a single lifetime. The senator makes short shrift of the tiny minority of scientists who doubt this. He enters the debate with essays on history (the catastrophes resulting from past, nature-made climate changes), economics (which avoids issues not related to increasing output), science, politics and religion. He goes way over the top, as in comparing contemporary hesitations on green policies with the 1930s prevarications over facing the Nazi challenge. The thrust of his argument is, however, sound. Yet in the end he is a compromiser. He is, after all, a politician. Read his high-flown prose and you will assume that he believes that only 'deep' greenery, which implicitly denies growth, will ward off global warming. Mr Clinton is campaigning on a promise to get the US economy moving again. His environmental trumpet is relatively muted. Mr Gore ducks this contradiction. With conservation and intelligent investment, he argues, you can get richer and save the earth. These are weasel-words. But I remain an optimist. There are green shoots in there somewhere.</p>

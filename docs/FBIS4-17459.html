			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol, 22 Apr -- An agreement in principle to  divide the Black Sea Fleet was reached today at the talks  between the military delegations of Russia and the Ukraine in  Sevastopol. They were led by the two countries' defense  ministers, Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy.    Of the 833 Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels, 669 units will  go to Russia, which makes up nearly 85 percent. The Ukrainian  side will receive 164 ships and boats (15 percent). Moreover,  proceeding from the previously reached accords, Russia will pay  the Ukraine compensation for 255 vessels.    No agreement has yet been reached on the problem of the  separate basing of the fleets. Ukraine insists on siting the  headquarters of its navy in Sevastopol, and does not rule out  the basing of its ships there as well.    Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister,  stressed that this stance deviates from the agreement signed on  15 April in Moscow by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk.    The Russian minister declared that it is unlikely that a  start can be made on dividing up the fleet without resolving the  problem of the separate bases.    Pavel Grachev left Sevastopol for Moscow today.</p>

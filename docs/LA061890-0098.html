			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCRATCH AN ADULT, FIND A CRAYON KID  </P> <P> Not that anybody was frightened or outraged to learn Binney &amp; Smith, the  maker of Crayola crayons, is replacing eight colors, but in the manner of  sleeping dogs lifting their heads at the first sound of thunder, we paid  attention.  </P> <P> TV news was all over this story, and USA Today put it on the front page. No  wonder. Messing with Crayola crayons is like messing with the rainbow or the  spectrum, with the prism of the American psyche.  </P> <P> The facts: Binney &amp; Smith is replacing blue gray, green blue, violet blue,  orange red, orange yellow, lemon yellow, maize and raw umber, which will go  into the Crayola Crayon Hall of Fame in Easton, Pa., according to company  spokeswoman Lina Striglia. In fact, they will be the only things in the Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> They will be replaced by fuchsia, vivid tangerine, jungle green, cerulean,  dandelion, teal blue, wild strawberry and royal purple. Only the first four  will go into the box of 24, five in the box of 32, six in the box of 48 and all  of them in the box of 64 -- the one with the sharpener -- and, of course, in  the box of 72, which includes the fluorescents and pastels, but not the  legendary flesh, which was renamed peach in 1962 when the company recognized  that flesh comes in different colors.  </P> <P> Not all change is bad.  </P> <P> The new ones sound better, to judge from the names. Besides, even if they  weren't, it's not as if the company were replacing the original eight crayons  introduced in 1903, ones you can still buy today in boxes that say "different,  brilliant colors": red, blue, green, yellow, orange, brown, violet and black,  double-wrapped in that soft, gripable paper and smelling of rainy days and car  trips; a smell of paraffin so memorable it's one of the 20 most recognizable  smells among American adults, according to Binney &amp; Smith (the first two  being peanut butter and coffee), although it's strange that something that  smells as distinct as a crayon has almost no taste, just the feel of those waxy  crumbs in your mouth.  </P> <P> We don't need lots of the colors in the bigger crayon boxes -- think what a  disappointment silver and gold always were. They looked great, you figured you  could do great ray guns and crowns with them, and then they just came out shiny  gray and brown. (The company, though, says the "metallics," as it calls them,  are often mentioned by adults as their childhood favorites.)  </P> <P> We have all crayoned.  </P> <P> Think of this the next time you see some pin-striped executive gliding down the  sidewalk toward you in all his dignity -- picture him working away at a  spaceship-monster shoot-out. Know that he felt bad just as you did when he  broke one and said to himself he shouldn't have pressed so hard and tried to  pretend it hadn't happened. Finally he had to tear the paper and crayon in half  to make two short crayons. These always fell to the bottom of the box when he  put them back, which made the other ones stick up too high, and so those  perfect rows of crayons that were lined up in the fresh box like organ pipes or  a choir were ruined.  </P> <P> Ah, the pristinity, the virginity, the infinity offered by a brand-new box of  crayons. And then you'd look around the floor of your room at the end of an  afternoon of coloring and see the squalid mess of paper and crayons and the  stuff your kid brother had scribbled on the wall just as you heard your mother  say the three sentences that awoke you from so many reveries:  </P> <P> "Oh.  </P> <P> "My.  </P> <P> "God."  </P> <P> Anyway, after the shock of hearing about the new colors -- the first since the  fluorescents (hot magenta, ultra green, ultra orange, ultra red, ultra blue,  ultra yellow, chartreuse and ultra pink) of 1972 -- they sound OK. They come  out of interviews with 150 kids. The discarded colors are not apt to be missed  -- they tended to be the ones you used when you ran out of another color,  except they never quite matched unless you colored the whole thing over.  </P> <P> "Violet purple -- who cares?" says Peter Dunne, 46, a corporate communications  manager who lives in North Haledon, N.J.  </P> <P> He learned how to color in his cousins' apartment in Brooklyn. "They had a shoe  box full of crayon pieces, two girls. Girls color better than boys. It was  there that I learned how to outline areas in the same color. As you get older  you learn to color in the same direction, instead of like an asterisk. If you  had to fill in big areas it was best to color in circles that overlapped. If  you colored until there were layers built up, the crayon clicked when you took  it off the paper. When you grow up, you can use oil pastels -- they're more  like lipstick. The color saturation is great but you don't have the edge  control. Grease pencils are fun. When you were a kid, remember how you'd always  pull that string back one dot too far?  </P> <P> "I still like to color. If it rains at the beach and you've already bought  sandals, you go to the Ben Franklin and get crayons and a coloring book, except  they call them activity books now. I leave them behind at the house, and the  next tenants come in and their kids say, "Wow, a major leaguer was here.' "  </P> <P> Binney &amp; Smith make 2 billion crayons a year. Crayons begin life when you  open the box and see that gorgeous chord of color in 72-part harmony (or that  perfect octet of the original eight). They end up in dusty cacophony under car  seats, behind bookcases, under porches. They melt on sidewalks and windowsills,  and they are never the same again.  </P> <P> Your mother carried them in her purse, and after you got tired of looking at  the tropical fish at the dentist's office, she'd take them out with a coloring  book and say: "Color me a picture."  </P> <P> You'd come back and show it to her.  </P> <P> "I went outside the lines," you'd say.  </P> <P> "That's the best part," she'd say. You still thought it looked stupid.  </P> <P> Your parents told you not to sharpen them in the pencil sharpener because they  would ruin it; you did anyway, and they ruined it.  </P> <P> You could take a fistful of them and draw a whole bunch of colors all at once,  and it would look like when the fighters go over at the air show and let out  the different-colored streams of smoke.  </P> <P> When they got small enough, you peeled the paper off and pushed them sideways  across the page, but without the label you couldn't be sure what color they  were anymore.  </P> <P> These things will not change.  </P></p>

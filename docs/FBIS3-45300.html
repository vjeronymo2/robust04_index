The details of the accord were not immediately available.    The signing coincides with the January 17 deadline set by  Washington for a bilateral agreement to be reached or for China  to face quota cuts of up to 35 percent in textile exports to the  United States.    The accord will be signed by Chinese foreign trade minister  Wu Yi and a U.S. delegation led by Jennifer Hillman, the  spokesman told AFP, without elaborating on the nature or  duration of the agreement. The US delegation opened talks with  the Chinese side here Saturday in a last-ditch attempt to reach  a new agreement following the expiry of a previous accord on  December 31.    Washington threatened the quota cuts to protest against  alleged Chinese textile trans-shipments to the United States  through third countries -- valued at two billion dollars -- in  violation of the previous quota agreement. China, which feels  it has been unfairly targetted by Washington, had responded by  threatening retaliatory action should the United States go ahead  with the unilateral cuts.</p>

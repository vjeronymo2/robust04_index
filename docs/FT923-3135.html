			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Vienna closes its hostels to Bosnians THE city of Vienna, fearing civil unrest similar to that in Germany and facing a shortage of accommodation suitable for the winter, has closed the doors of its refugee hostels to new Bosnian refugees. Other Austrian lander are expected to follow the city's lead. Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's democratic socialist mayor, said that the city's 'emotional capacity' to absorb refugees had been exhausted. The estimated 15,000 Bosnian refugees in the city have added to a pool of roughly 300,000 first generation immigrants among a total population of 1.5m. Bosnian refugees have been arriving at the rate of 100 to 150 a day in recent weeks. The ban applies only to publicly supported hostels. Buses arriving from Bosnia will still be allowed into Austria. Provided they can find shelter through private friends or the charitable agencies, refugees can still enter Vienna. Mr Zilk said the ban was only temporary and there was speculation at the weekend that it could be lifted within a few weeks, especially if the Croatian government took up Vienna's offer to underwrite the costs of housing up to 1,000 Bosnian refugees in empty hotels on the Istrian peninsula. Mr Franz Loschnak, the Austrian interior minister, said it was scandalous that the Croatian government had not yet replied to Vienna's offer. Mr Zilk said Austrian authorities had been shaken by the anti-immigrant riots in Germany, and wanted to prevent similar outbreaks of xenophobia or disturbances in the hostels. Last week, two Bosnians were arrested for trying to recruit men in Vienna refugee camps to go back home to fight. This infringed Austria's neutrality. The authorities are also acutely aware of the risk of instability in other eastern European countries, and the consequent potential for more large flows of refugees into Vienna in coming years. The Green party, one of the main opposition forces in the Vienna assembly, was sharply critical. 'This is the peak of inhumanity,' a spokesman said. He claimed there were plenty of buildings suitable for winter habitation in the city, including military barracks. He feared that other western European cities and countries would follow Vienna's lead.</p>

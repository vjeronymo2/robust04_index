			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Air Canada fights approval of American Airlines deal AIR CANADA is appealing against the National Transportation Agency's approval of American Airlines' plan to pump CDollars 246m (USDollars 193m) of equity into ailing Canadian Airlines International in exchange for a 25 per cent voting stake and close operational links. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chairman, said he was taking his appeal to the Federal Cabinet because of doubts over whether Canada could sustain two international airlines. He maintained that if the two airlines were consolidated, they could create 'a strong independent carrier taking a leadership role in the world airline industry'. Canadian can still not consummate the deal with American because it is locked into a joint reservation system with Air Canada. It is now trying to negotiate its way out of this.</p>

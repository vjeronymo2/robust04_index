Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA) to include observation  of the country's elections on April 27, as suggested by the U.N.  chief.    At the request of the transitional Executive Council of  South  Africa, Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had proposed the  United Nations provide some 1,800 observers. Along with those  from the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the European  Union, the commonwealth and individual states, the total number  of international observers would probably exceed 5,000.    The UNOMSA would have a significant role "not only in  assessing the freedom and fairness of the elections, but in  monitoring each stage of the process," the U.N. chief said in  his recent report on South Africa.    The unanimously-adopted Resolution 894 urged all parties in  South Africa, including those which did not participate fully in  the multi-party talks, to respect agreements reached during the  negotiations, to adhere to democratic principles, and to take  part in the elections.    It also called upon all parties to take measures to end the  violence and intimidation and thus contribute to the conduct of  free and fair elections, and expects that anyone who seeks to  disrupt the elections will be held accountable.    Speaking at the Security Council meeting today, Li Zhaoxing,  Chinese permanent representative to the U.N., said the success  of the election depends on the South African people themselves,  and hoped that all parties in the country will make efforts to  ensure the election be held on schedule.    At present there are 100 observers in UNOMSA, which was  established in 1992 to assist in creating conditions for  negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a  democratic, non-racial and united South Africa.</p>

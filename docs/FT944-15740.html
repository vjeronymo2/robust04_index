			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Amstrad - Other Companies The consumer electronics group is expected to report full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 5m on Thursday, hampered by the problems of the personal computer industry and tough retail competition in consumer electronics. The size of the losses will depend on a number of factors, including the cost of rationalising Italian operations. Particular interest is likely to be focused on the performance of Viglen, the UK-based direct PC manufacturer bought for Pounds 60m in June.</p>

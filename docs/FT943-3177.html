			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Observer: Forty years on There may be precious few new ideas in British politics, but it sometimes seems as if there is an even bigger shortage of political slogans. Take the late Iain Macleod who, when he was minister of labour, called on his Conservative party to face up to the challenge of automation and other developments with a pamphlet entitled Change is our ally. Now Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has produced a paper setting out his agenda for taking politics beyond the three-party system and into the 21st century. Its title? Making change our ally.</p>

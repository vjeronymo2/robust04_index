			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / French market hits high after rate cut THE Bank of France yesterday announced the first cut in its key interest rate since the summer's European exchange rate crisis, strengthening the franc and pushing the Paris stock market to a record high. The central bank said that the intervention rate, which acts as a floor for money market interest rates, would be cut by 0.3 percentage points, from 6.75 per cent to 6.45 per cent, with effect from Monday. The five to ten-day borrowing rate was cut by 0.5 percentage points to 7.25 per cent with immediate effect. The cut in the two interest rates is consistent with France's cautious policy of gradually lowering borrowing costs while shadowing the Bundesbank and maintaining the stability of the Franc. It comes at a time when the French government is under pressure to stimulate the recession-hit economy and cut the level of unemployment, now 11.7 per cent and rising. Economists in Paris said France would continue with its policy of gradual reductions in borrowing costs but could cut the intervention rate by a further quarter of a percentage point within the next few weeks following Thursday's half point cut in German interest rates. The CAC-40 index of leading French shares increased by almost 2 per cent, to 2230, as investors digested yesterday's cuts and anticipated further moves by France's monetary authorities. The Bank of France said that yesterday's action 'takes into account the general downward movement in rates in Europe and the objective of internal and external franc stability.' The French financial authorities have sought to maintain a stable franc/D-Mark rate since the franc was forced out of its narrow fluctuation bands within the European exchange rate mechanism by the summer's currency crisis. The French franc strengthened in response to the interest rate cuts, rising above FFr3.50 to the D-mark, compared with last week's all-time low of FFr3.548. The rise supported the view that foreign exchange dealers and investors are concerned principally with the need for lower borrowing costs to help lift it from recession. Economists said the modest cut could have an important psychological effect. Several commercial banks quickly responded, with the Banque Nationale de Paris, lowering base rates from 8.40 per cent to 8.15 per cent. Figures released yesterday showed housing starts increased by 8.4 per cent in the third quarter while industrial production for July and August showed a strong rise of 1.3 per cent over June. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said 1994 would see GDP grow by 1.4 per cent.</p>

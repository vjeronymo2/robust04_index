Saunders] </F>   [Text] Port Elizabeth Feb 16 SAPA -- All obstacles in the  way of an inclusive democratic settlement have been removed by  the concessions the African National Congress' [ANC] National  Working Committee took on Wednesday [16 February],  Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa said.    Speaking to Port Elizabeth's business community at a  function  on Wednesday night, Mr Ramaphosa briefed about 60 guests on the  committee decision to provide for greater regional powers and a  double ballot system to meet the demands of the Freedom  Alliance. "This is the best offer they can expect to get and we  expect them to respond positively," he said in answer to a  question. "If they respond in the negative, then we know all  they are interested in is disrupting the elections to frustrate  democracy and to have a civil war. We will not allow any party  to disrupt our march to democracy, or to disrupt the elections.  Then strong and hard measures will have to be taken against  them."    But Mr Ramaphosa said he preferred negotiations. "We have  made this gesture of conciliation today (Wednesday) so that  there should be no more talk of civil war or violence."    Saying the ANC recognised that the Zulu king should have a  place of honour as monarch in the province of Natal, Mr  Ramaphosa added: "The ANC is doing this to show it is not  irresponsible on the future of South Africa...To show we want an  all-inclusive settlement. We have built a house of democracy.  We expect them to come and live with us in this house now that  we have made these alterations."    Commenting on the Eastern Cape, Mr Ramaphosa said this was  the forgotten part of the country. "It's like the government  just closed its eyes to the Eastern Cape and walked away. We  must address unemployment throughout the country, but I would  say especially here in the Eastern Cape."    Mr Ramaphosa said the ANC had been in touch with the  government on Wednesday to inform them of the committee's  decision and they would hold a bilateral meeting in Pretoria on  Thursday to discuss it further.    The multiparty conference would reconvene either on Monday  or  Tuesday. "We will try to persuade all other parties that this  is the right decision so that we can have peace in our country.  We then expect parliament to meet in the course of next week,"  said Mr Ramaphosa.    After that the registration date for parties would be  extended for parties which had not yet registered.</p>

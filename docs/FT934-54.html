			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg SG Warburg was unlucky to drop from first to 12th place in the league of takeover advisers in 1993. But the table simply confirms the low level of merger activity. If demergers were included too, Warburg's role as adviser to ICI/Zeneca would propel it into first place. Since ICI was worth almost Pounds 9bn when Zeneca was spun off, Warburg would even make Kleinwort Benson, this year's leader, look like a bit player with just Pounds 1.3bn worth of transactions.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Heavy selling erases early Dow advance Wall Street HEAVY selling in the final hour of trading left blue chip stocks little changed at the close yesterday after computer program buying and selective bargain hunting had provided share prices with a solid early boost, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was just 0.81 up on balance at 3,240.87, after a day's high reached mid-afternoon when the index had been some 24 points ahead. Other indices did a better job of holding on to their gains. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.01 higher at 418.59, the American SE composite 2.10 firmer at 385.36 and the Nasdaq composite 5.23 stronger at 622.05, in the wake of good demand for small-capital growth stocks. New York SE turnover was fairly heavy at 197.5m shares. The impact of last week's presidential election on stock market sentiment began to wane yesterday. Although speculation remains concentrated on the likely make-up of President-elect Bill Clinton's cabinet - especially the question of who is appointed to the top economic jobs - comments from the Clinton transition team suggest that choices will not be made or publicised until next month. Consequently, investors were left to focus their attention on the bond market, which traded nervously ahead of the important afternoon auction of Dollars 15.5bn in three-year notes. Bargain hunters lifted Walt Disney Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 7/8 in turnover of 2.3m shares and IBM Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 67 5/8 on 2.2m traded. Ford firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 as speculation intensified that Mr Alexander Trotman, head of the group's North American operations, would soon be announced as Ford's new president and chief operating officer, making him the clear successor to outgoing chairman and chief executive Mr Harold Poling. Ann Taylor Stores rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 after higher third-quarter profits. First Bank System shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 1/8 after signing a merger agreement with Colorado National Bankshares in a deal that will cost First Bank about Dollars 525m. Colorado National jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 . Storage Technology plummeted Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 23 5/8 in turnover of 4.8m shares after saying that testing of its Iceberg Computer Disk-Array system will take longer than expected, extending into the second half of 1993. Biogen added Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 44 3/4 after broking house Hambrecht &amp; Quist raised its fourth-quarter profits forecast, the second such upgrade in the past week. Canada A WEAK gold shares sector took the Toronto market lower in busy trading. The TSE 300 index lost 17.1 to 3,293.8, while declines led advances by 360 to 259 after volume of 33.4m shares valued at CDollars 312m. The golds index fell 2.53 per cent as spot gold in New York lost USDollars 3 an ounce to a six-year low of USDollars 333.05.</p>

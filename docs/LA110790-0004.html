			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OF THE LOST CAUSE  </P> <P> The tiny cabal of white men who control the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors is really in trouble now. Another court ruled that they  discriminated against Latinos when they redrew district lines in 1981. Yet the  board may waste more taxpayers' money to further appeal its lost cause. The  supervisors should think again. Judge after judge is seeing the county's case  for the sham it is.  </P> <P> Last week the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision by U.S.  District Judge David V. Kenyon that ordered an election in a new, realigned 1st  supervisorial district.  </P> <P> Kenyon's decision had the unfortunate effect of nullifying the June primary  election to replace retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum. In that election,  Schabarum aide, Sarah Flores was the top vote-getter against Superior Court  Judge Gregory O'Brien. Both candidates still could run in a new election  against any other candidates.  </P> <P> While that's not especially fair to Flores or O'Brien, they knew the risk they  were taking when they ran while a lawsuit was pending. The fault lies not with  the courts, which are only upholding the Voting Rights Act, but with the  stubborn three-man board majority. They've already spent about $5 million on  this case at a time while denying many decent health care. Now they say they'll  appeal, if need be, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Before they do, they should ponder the dissent by a conservative member of the  three-judge panel that upheld Kenyon. While he questioned the new 1st district  lines, Judge Alex Kozinski agreed with Kenyon's "careful finding" in the case,  writing that it showed clear discrimination.  </P> <P> "This case will be remembered," Kozinski wrote, "for its lucid demonstration  that elected officials engaged in a single-minded pursuit of incumbency can run  roughshod over the rights of protected minorities."  </P> <P> The trio on the county board claim to be conservatives, but they're spending  public money liberally to protect themselves. If a smart conservative judge can  see through their case, the Supreme Court could, too. They should drop this  loser now. L.A. County's changing, boys, and it's time to get with the new  program.  </P></p>

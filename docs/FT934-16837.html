			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Hopes fade for Madrid pay pact: Angry union leaders threaten 'mobilisation' in attempt to shift government DOUBTS are growing in Madrid that the Spanish government, the two main trade unions and the country's main employer federation can reach agreement on a much vaunted three-year wage moderation pact. Following his narrow election victory last June, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez made the achievement of a 'pacto social' - agreement on wages, pensions and labour market reform - central to his efforts to help the economy recover from recession. But in three weeks of carefully structured talks before the 1994 budget was presented to parliament last Thursday, precious little headway had been made. The government, frustrated by the lack of progress on pension increases, civil service pay and unemployment benefits, simply put its own figures in the budget and now says these are not alterable. The budget figures include a civil service pay freeze next year, cuts in benefits and a less generous calculation of the way pension increases will take place next year. Angry union leaders have already threatened 'mobilisation' programmes to scare the government into softening its stance on some of these policies as the budget makes its way through parliament between now and the end of the year. Yesterday the three sides began a second phase of talks aimed at securing a three-year public and private sector wages agreement and a sweeping reform of many of Spain's rigid old labour laws that make it one of the most expensive places in Europe to fire people. Foreign investors, who in the past few months have invested heavily in the bond markets on hopes of Spain achieving this social pact and, consequently, being able to bring down interest rates, are watching this round of talks very carefully. But some senior government officials believe that the atmosphere has been so soured by the failure of the pre-budget talks that there is little hope of agreement being reached. The government believes it may no longer need a wages deal to stave off further pressure on the peseta. The economy is likely to begin growing again next year, according to budget forecasts, and the markets have been impressed with a budget promise of a real fall (1.3 per cent) in central government spending next year.</p>

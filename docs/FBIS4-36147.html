			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Aggressive Designs and our </F> Responsibility"]    [Text] According to the report of a U.S. Senate committee,  the Central Intelligence Agency is confident that hydrogen bombs  are being manufactured in the Bhaba Atomic Research Center in  Bombay. By conducting a nuclear test in 1974, India proved its  nuclear capability. According to the deposition of former CIA  chief William Casey, India's nuclear program has advanced to a  dangerous level and India has enough enriched uranium to make 60  to 80 atom bombs. For quite some time, international agencies  have been giving hints about India's hydrogen bombs, and now the  U.S. Senate report has endorsed them, thereby exposing India's  designs. The other day, there was also a reference in the press  about India's plans to manufacture Surya missiles. These will  be of intercontinental ballistic missile type and have a  capacity to hit a target up to 12,000 kms. Prior to this, India  had also manufactured the medium-range Prithvi missile, whose  final test preparations are nearing completion at Chandipur in  Orissa. The other missiles manufactured by India include the  Agni, Trishul, and Nag. India began a long-range missile  program only to launch nuclear weapons, and it is surprising  that the Cold War era has ended and the contemporary superpowers  like Russia and the United States have also agreed to limit  their missile programs. On the other side, even now, there is  pressue from international monetary agencies to make  considerable cuts in defense spending and give priority to the  welfare of people rather than spending money on weapons. The  irony is that India does not even care for international  pressure. India did not even take the American message on the  nuclear issue into consideration, which was acknowledged by  President Clinton during his joint press conference with  Narasimha Rao. It has made the acquisition of arms for all  branches of its land, air, and naval forces a routine thing.  India's blue water navy, which contains aircraft carriers and  nuclear submarines, is 10 times larger than that of Pakistan.  The Indian Air Force has sophisticated MiG-29 aircraft. In  view of its size, the Indian Army is larger than those of all  its small neighbors put together. In fact, India does not face  any threat to its national security from any quarter. Until  now, India took the lead in provoking its small and large  neighbors. Pakistan became the target of Indian aggression  three times in 1948, 1965, and 1971, and even now the target of  all its preparations will only be Pakistan. India's aspirations  and efforts are to accomplish the dream of Greater India and do  away with the partition of mother India. Only Pakistan is an  obstacle in the accomplishment of these despicable designs, and  India can become a threat on our border at any time. India was  constrained to reach an understanding with China. First, it is  not possible for India to subdue China and second, it has  realized that China does not have aggressive designs against any  of its neighbors. Hence, the Indian forces, which were earlier  deployed along the borders with China, have been moved and are  now being deployed along the borders of Sindh, Punjab, and  Kashmir. India has threatened several times that the continuing  freedom movement in Kashmir can flare up into a "limited war".  During his visit to the United States, President Leghari also  spoke about the threat of a nuclear war. On the other side, the  international powers have also identified the threat of a  nuclear war in the subcontinent. It is definite that India may  commit aggression in the future as it did in the past. To  counter the situation, it is first the responsibility of  Pakistan to not give up its policy of deterrence, and second, to  make its defense impregnable. It is better to create political  stability, as India will not have the guts to indulge in  conflict. The global powers should also try to be aware of  India's designs and not allow it to destroy peace in the region.</p>

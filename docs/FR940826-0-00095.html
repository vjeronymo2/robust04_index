			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may only be used in portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the fire hazard. Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (c) [HCFC Blend] D._[HCFC Blend] D is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This blend is comprised of HCFC&hyph;123 plus a proprietary additive, and is intended for large outdoor uses such as wheeled extinguishers, HCFC&hyph;123 is currently listed as acceptable for use in non-residential streaming applications. This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may only be used in portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the fire hazard. Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (d) Gelled Halocarbon/Dry Chemical Suspension (formerly Powdered Aerosol B)._Gelled Halocarbon/Dry Chemical Suspension is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This class of agents is comprised of a variety of blends developed for particular markets. Each blend contains one or more halocarbons, a dry chemical, and a gel which keeps the powder and gas uniform. Both the halocarbon and the dry chemical act on the fire, while the gel is consumed by the fire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's acceptability listing is extended to any blend comprised of a halocarbon with a cardiotoxic LOAEL of at least 2.0 per cent, in combination with a dry chemical or multipurpose dry chemical that is currently widely used, including monoammonium phosphate (ABC powder), potassium bicarbonate (Purple K powder), and sodium bicarbonate. This listing decision also includes ammonium polyphosphate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The manufacturer of this technology proposes using several different halocarbons singly and in blends, in combination with one of several dry chemicals or multipurpose dry chemical powders. The halocarbons included in the SNAP submission include HFC&hyph;227ea, HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;134a, and HFC&hyph;125 blended with HFC&hyph;134a. The cardiotoxic LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC&hyph;227ea is, respectively, 10.5 per cent of 9.0 per cent; the LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC&hyph;125 is 10.0 per cent and 7.5 per cent; and the LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC&hyph;134a is 8.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively. Previous personal monitoring tests of streaming agents using pure HCFC&hyph;123 (LOAEL 2.0 per cent; NOAEL 1.0 per cent) and HCFC&hyph;124 (LOAEL 2.5 per cent; NOAEL 1.0 per cent) indicate that actual exposure to the breathing zone does not exceed these values. Such tests with agents which pose greater risk of cardiosensitization indicate that HFC&hyph;227ea, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;134a can also be used safely in well-ventilated areas. In addition, the quantity of the halocarbons in this technology is approximately half of what a pure halocarbon extinguisher would contain and thus there is a built-in margin of safety as it relates to cardiotoxicity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While all of the proposed halocarbons have no ODP, the GWP and atmospheric lifetime of HFC&hyph;227ea is 2050 and 31 years; of HCF&hyph;125 is 3400 and 41 years; and of HCF&hyph;134a is 1200 and 16 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dry chemical powders proposed by the manufacturer include ammonium polyphosphate, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), potassium bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate was among the original dry chemical extinguishers, followed by potassium bicarbonate and monoammonium phosphate which were developed in the 1960s. Thus, these dry chemical agents have been in use for decades. These powders have been considered generally nontoxic, although if not used according to manufacturers directions they can cause temporary breathing difficulty during and immediately after discharge. Discharge in large quantities may decrease visibility. These powders typically have particle sizes of less than 10 microns up to 75 microns, with most being optimized at 20 to 25 microns. Ammonium polyphosphate has previously been used as a fire retardant additive to products and coatings, and the manufacturer is introducing it for use as a streaming agent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monoammonium phosphate, commonly known as ABC powder, is a general purpose agent which can be used for class A, B and C fires. However, it is corrosive on hard surfaces. Potassium bicarbonate (Purple K) and sodium bicarbonate cannot be used on class A fires, but are used for specific class B and C applications, generally in the commercial sector. Ammonium polyphosphate is most suitable for military uses, because it is not corrosive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An initial assessment of inhalation toxicology of fine particulates indicates that some risk is posed when the particles are below a certain size compared to the mass per cubic meter in air. Particle sizes less than 10 to 15 microns and a mass above the ACGIH nuisance dust levels raise concerns which need to be further studied should these agents be used in a total flooding application. However, in a streaming application, it is unlikely that the exposure level will exceed ACGIH dust levels. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices, Fifth Edition, 1986. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The particle size distribution for these powders was analyzed with a Micromeretics Sedigraph using Sedisperse A&hyph;11 as the settling medium. Mesh of various sizes ranging from 40 mesh (420 microns) to 325 mesh (45 microns) is used to filter the powders into a pan, thus leaving a `pan fraction' of powder particles which are smaller than 45 microns. A sample of the sediment in the pan is mixed in the Sedisperse medium, which is a heavy, high viscosity fluid. An X-ray beam shines through the sample and counts the particles as they drift down. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using this method, 50 to 75 per cent of the monoammonium phosphate is smaller than 45 microns. Of that portion which is smaller than 45 microns, the median particle size is 20 microns, with 19.5 per cent of the particles being smaller than 10 microns, and 3.0 per cent being smaller than five microns. Thus, up to 15 per cent (.75&times;.195) of the entire MAP product is smaller than 10 microns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seventy-four to 88 per cent of the potassium bicarbonate is smaller than 45 microns, with a median size of the pan fraction being 17.4 microns. With 28.4 per cent of the pan fraction being ten microns in size, then up to 25 per cent (.284&times;88) of the total potassium bicarbonate product is under ten microns. 11.3 per cent of the pan fraction is under five microns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

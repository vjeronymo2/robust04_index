			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property revival quashed THE FRAGILE recovery in the property sector was brought to an abrupt halt yesterday as investors rushed to sell stock following a pessimistic breakfast meeting hosted by Savills, a leading property consultancy. The meeting, attended by fund managers, analysts, receivers and bankers, heard Savills quash any talk of a short-term property revival and forecast continued weakness in the rental sector until the end of 1994. The meeting coincided with equally bearish analysis by the Investment Property Databank and a gloomy report from County NatWest, the latter suggesting that a secondary market and debt securitisation may be needed to inject liquidity to lift the sector from its malaise. A late rally limited most damage to those stocks with a large exposure to the central London office market. Great Portland Estates lost 5 to 154p, while Land Securities, off 12 at one stage, rallied to end 3 down at 428p. MEPC also found late support to finish 4 off at 339p after good volume of 2.3m. Midland climbs The well flagged counter-bid interest in Midland Bank came through yesterday and the shares responded accordingly. They were marked up 15p at the start of trading and were then bought up to 400p, a five-year high. Later, Midland shares drifted as speculators who had bought stock when it was sold as part of the Kuwait Investment Office's recent 60m-share placing decided to take profits. Midland closed 13 ahead at 394p with more than 27m shares traded. Lloyds Bank, which announced it was interested in bidding at 457p a share, was marked down 14p at the outset. Now that Lloyds has declared itself, the potential uncertainty of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry hangs over the bank. The shares ended a net 10 off at 417p. Gas downgrade Concern that the mild winter would impact on forthcoming first-quarter results from British Gas lay behind a sharp fall in the share price. Gas, which is a highly liquid stock and rarely moves by more than a few pence in any one day, closed 7 1/2 down at 262p with 11m shares traded. Analysts were said to be cutting their forecasts for the figures, due on May 14, by Pounds 50m to around Pounds 650m. Mr Keith Morris of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said: 'Gas makes about 50 per cent of its money in the first quarter and this is likely to impact on full-year figures.' Mr Morris reduced his own full-year forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 1.225bn and his dividend estimate to 14.25p from 15p. The revived interest in oil shares continued. Some traders attributed it purely to US investors but others said that even UK customers were beginning to feel that the selling might have been too savage. BP, which has been the hardest hit, rose 7 1/2 to 263 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 23m shares, building on Monday's gain. Shell picked up 3 to 474p. Outside the majors, Lasmo, believed to be about to announce the prospective bidders for its Wilmington refinery, rose 11 to 239p. Enterprise improved 7 to 420p. FKI moved ahead 4 to 78p on high turnover of 12m after SG Warburg reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock and following a favourable presentation to City analysts by managing director Mr Bob Beeston, who joined the company in January. Yesterday it was the turn of investors to be addressed by the new man at FKI, at the company's broker Panmure Gordon. Warburg said: 'Mr Bob Beeston is a professional operator with the right credentials to improve FKI's profitability.' French cement maker Cement Francais became the latest rumoured target for Hanson, with talk that the conglomerate was interested in agreeing to take a controlling stake in the company. However, institutional buyers reported that Paribas, Cement Francais' owner, was offering stock to institutions, making an agreed bid seem unlikely. Hanson finished a penny off at 234 1/2 p. Wellcome, buoyed by a press report that it could be seeking a US listing for its shares, recovered 14 to 1029p. British Aerospace lost 6 to 349p after Henderson Crosthwaite cut its current year profits forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 160m. Rolls-Royce put on 3 to 172p on turnover of 3.7m ahead of an analysts' visit to the NEI plant which begins tomorrow. After Monday's hectic activity, hotel issues were largely friendless. Forte tumbled 7 to 255p in spite of a large institutional presentation at Paribas and a consequent buy note from the French-owned broking house. Rank Organisation, which rose on Monday after announcing the disposal of its main UK hotels, receded 12 to 727p as investors reflected on less than enthusiastic press and broker comment. A 1.3m line of shares in holiday group Owners Abroad was placed at 103p. The stock lost  1/2 to 104 1/2 p. Food group Dalgety advanced 12 to 418p, although market observers tended to play down suggestions of a possible takeover offer. Turnover in Asda remained very high, totalling 20m shares after 17m on Monday and similar volumes on Thursday and Friday of last week. Profits downgrades continued to burden the shares, which dipped a penny to 26 1/2 p. Questioning of supermarket chains' property valuation and accounting policies by Mr Tony Shiret, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, tended to depress the sector.

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Greenspan backs Clinton's plan to deal with US deficit PRESIDENT Bill Clinton won important backing for his economic programme yesterday when Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, praised the plan as a 'serious proposal' to deal with the US budget deficit. Mr Greenspan, who annoyed some Republicans by sitting next to Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton during President Clinton's presentation of his programme to Congress on Wednesday night, commended Mr Clinton for proposing specific spending cuts and tax increases in-stead of the vague caps on programmes proposed in the past. The Fed chairman's support gave Mr Clinton a helping hand as he travelled across the country to drum up popular support for his proposals. Delivering his Humphrey-Hawkins monetary testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr Greenspan was pressed by Democratic senators to support the Clinton plan with 'complementary' monetary policies. However, Mr Greenspan refused to commit himself to lowering interest rates to offset an negative impact on growth from cuts in the deficit. The Fed 'could not specify in advance what actions might be taken in the presence of particular fiscal policy strategies'. It was crucial to reduce the deficit which would otherwise 'increasingly threaten the stability of the economic system'. However, he warned against relying too heavily on tax increases. Since many programmes were growing faster than the tax base, stabilising the deficit by this route would require 'ever increasing tax rates'. There was thus no alternative to much slower growth of spending. 'I trust the president's endeavour to rein in medical costs will contribute importantly to this goal,' he said. In Chillicothe, Ohio, Mr Clinton said he was trying to present a balanced programme. 'Congress will decide to vote for it in part based on whether people in towns like Chillicothe all over America think it's a good deal,' he said. The administration might have to look at the introduction of a national sales or value added tax in the years ahead, Mr Clinton said, but he did not want to confuse the need to reform the US tax system with the more immediate imperative of reducing the deficit. 'I mean, there's only so much change a country can accommodate at one time,' Mr Clinton said. The Clinton plan would raise Dollars 246bn of new taxes in 1994-97, mostly from higher income taxes on the wealthy and from a new energy tax, with Dollars 247bn of spending cuts. This would be offset by spending increases and tax breaks totalling Dollars 169bn over the same period, but would still reduce the expected 1997 deficit to Dollars 206bn, Dollars 140bn less than the current projection.

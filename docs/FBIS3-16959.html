The polemics which tends to involve more and more political  forces has distracted the Ukrainian public from yet another  plebiscite in the Donbass coal basin scheduled for March 27.    Residents of the region were supposed to say whether or not  the Russian language should be considered as a second state  language in Ukraine and express their attitude towards Ukraine's  administrative division and participation in the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    The decision to hold the referendum was adopted by the  regional council on February 22. However, it had taken Kiev  authorities a month to respond by ordering the public prosecutor  to protest the council's decision. The Russian-speaking region  said it will convene an urgent session of the regional council  on March 23 to discuss further steps.    Meanwhile, the Lugansk region of Ukraine has announced its  decision to hold a similar poll on the state language.</p>

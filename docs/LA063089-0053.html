			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CAMPAIGN REFORMS SEEK CURBS ON PACS  </P> <P> President Bush, unveiling a campaign finance program intended to "free our  electoral system from the grip of special interests," called Thursday for the  elimination of corporate and union committees that pump millions of dollars  into congressional election campaigns.  </P> <P> Bush also proposed measures intended to reduce the advantages of congressional  incumbency, to boost the role of political parties by increasing the amounts  that they can spend on congressional races and to limit free congressional  mailings. And, raising what has proved to be a particularly thorny issue, the  President said that he would work with Congress on developing a plan to raise  House and Senate salaries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accent on Individual  </P> <P> "We need reforms that curtail the role of special interests, enhance the role  of the individual and strengthen the parties," Bush said.  </P> <P> His plan was criticized by Democrats as one that would favor Republicans, who  are in a minority in the House and Senate, by trimming the campaign advantages  of incumbents. In the 1980s, 97.7% of House incumbents seeking reelection have  been successful, according to the White House.  </P> <P> Bush acknowledged such a likely result, saying in an interview Wednesday with  The Times as he looked ahead to the proposal: "Well, I have a good reason to  want to lock out the status quo in terms of control of the House or control of  the Senate."  </P> <P> The trouble the proposals, if enacted, might cause for incumbents led to  predictions that they never would make it through Congress without major change  or -- as a senior White House official acknowledged -- without a major public  effort by the President to put pressure on the House and Senate.  </P> <P> And Michael Berman, a Democratic Party expert on campaign finance, pointed out  that the proposals would not prohibit individuals from creating political  action committees and using their own contributions to pay for the committees'  overhead. He argued that the proposals favor candidates supported by wealthy  business leaders who could more easily create such groups to circumvent a ban  on corporate committees, than could union groups that also would be banned.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said: "While I welcome the President's  willingness to join our ongoing reform efforts, I regret that he has chosen to  submit proposals that blatantly favor the Republican Party and jeopardize  bipartisan efforts already under way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Soaring Costs  </P> <P> "I also regret that the President failed to address the overriding issue in  campaign reform, namely, the skyrocketing cost of campaigns. Any real reform  package must include some proposal to bring this runaway spending under  control."  </P> <P> In addition to eliminating the political action committees run by unions,  corporations and trade associations, which the White House said accounted for  nearly 90% of the approximately $160 million spent by political action groups  before the 1988 election, the President's program would:  </P> <P>  -- Reduce from $5,000 to $2,500 the limits on contributions by independent  political action committees.  </P> <P>  -- Prohibit all organizations except political party committees from  soliciting contributions from employees or members and then sending them as one  contribution to a candidate, without the amount counting toward overall  contribution limits.  </P> <P>  -- Increase, from approximately $46,000 to $115,000, the amount that the  individual political parties can spend on House races. The sizable increase in  this ceiling would be likely to favor the Republicans, who have had better luck  raising funds than the Democrats.  </P> <P>  -- Prohibit the forwarding of a congressional or presidential candidate's  leftover campaign funds to the next election campaign. Such funds have helped  incumbents build long-running war chests. Under the proposal, the money could  be handed over to the political parties, to the U.S. Treasury or returned to  contributors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Curb on Free Mailings  </P> <P>  -- Limit the use of the "franking" privilege by members of Congress so that  huge quantities of newsletters and other brochures that can boost their  campaigns could no longer be mailed without the cost of postage.  </P> <P>  -- Require greater public disclosure of campaign funding, in particular the  contributions by individuals to "get out the vote" efforts. In the 1988  campaign, the lack of limits on such contributions allowed individuals to give  thousands of dollars -- in some cases $100,000 -- to party efforts that were  devoted to individual candidates, despite a $5,000 limit on an individual's  contribution to any one candidate.  </P> <P> In addition, the proposal called for drawing up borders of congressional  districts along community boundaries, to eliminate "gerrymandering" of  districts that critics say can give advantages to one party or another by  creating congressional districts that encompass specific groups of voters.  </P> <P> Bush avoided tying his proposals to other ethics issues, including honorariums  given to members of Congress and the related question of congressional  salaries. But he said that he would, within a few days, propose a ban on  honorariums and recommend a 25% pay increase for judges and an increase for  certain professionals in the government, such as surgeons and scientists, to  make government service more attractive.  </P> <P> In recent years, as their influence has grown, the political action committees  have attracted increasing criticism. They represent an opportunity for  individuals or groups with common policy goals to gather large sums and funnel  them to candidates -- presumably with the goal of influencing their votes on  legislation, if their campaigns succeed.  </P> <P> "Today, special interest political action committees and their $160-million war  chest overshadow the great parties of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln,"  Bush said in a speech to congressional and Administration interns at the  Library of Congress. "And, as the strength of our parties erodes, so does the  strength of our political system.  </P> <P> "By necessity, members of Congress engage in time-consuming and often degrading  appeals for money outside the party structure," he said.  </P></p>

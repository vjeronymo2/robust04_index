			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / How to Spend It: How green is my trolley - Peter Knight offers some environmentally- friendly advice to shoppers You are about to choose between two premium brands of ice cream. One has an odd name, is heavily promoted with advertisements dripping sexual innuendo and the company is part of the Grand Metropolitan conglomerate, the chairman of which is on the management committee of the Conservative Party. The other ice cream is packed in a folksy tub, it is called Ben &amp; Jerry's and it comes from 'family' farms in Vermont, in the US. Ben and Jerry (real people) are multi-millionaire former hippies who listen to Grateful Dead and give 7.5 per cent of their considerable profits to charities. Which do you choose? Shopping has become a nightmare for those with a social conscience. It is especially hellish for those who see their purchasing power as a political tool, used to bring about change. Everything from clothes (Esprit and others), household goods (Traidcraft), coffee (Cafe Direct), toiletries (Body Shop), DIY (B &amp; Q and others) and meat and eggs (Freedom Foods from the RSPCA) are now promoted for being more than just another product. The problem was highlighted this week with the news that a US ethical investment fund had recommended holders of Body Shop shares to sell before the appearance of an article critical of the company's environmental claims. But how do you know whether the assertions made in this hug-a-tree-today-style marketing are genuine or particularly cynical attempts to use our guilt to sell their products? Attempts have been - and are being - made to come up with universally-accepted environmental labels but progress is snail-like. The EU launched an eco-labelling scheme last year but it has only agreed the criteria for one set of products - washing machines. Plans to issue labels for products including hair sprays, light bulbs, paper and soil improvers, have been stymied by disagreements on the criteria, bickering between member states and failure to promote the scheme. The UK has stuck to the original plan to work with the European Commission on a Europe-wide scheme, but other countries, such as France, are developing their own national labels in tandem with the EU. Germany's Blue Angel label, which existed long before the EU launched its scheme, continues to provide the only wide-ranging set of labels within the EU. The process of determining the environmental credentials of a product is perplexingly difficult. Vast amounts of information about the product (source of original materials, the production process, amount of energy used, type of packaging etc) has to be collected and the environmental good weighed against the bad. For most products this balancing act demands subjective judgments on weighting. For example, is a locally-made product (less transport) better than one from abroad, even if the imported product is made with cleaner technology? The fashion business is finding it particularly hard to agree on what fabrics are environmentally superior to others. For example, the belief that natural products, such as cotton and wool, are better than synthetics may be misguided. The intensive farming of cotton is environmentally destructive because it uses large amounts of water (the disappearance of the Aral Sea in the former Soviet Union is largely due to cotton irrigation schemes). Large amounts of insecticides and pesticides sap the soil of nutrients and often displace much-needed food crops in developing nations. Processing cotton consumes energy and pollutes the air and water. Much the same can be said for wool. Oil-derived synthetics (nylon, polyester etc), it can be argued, might come from a non-renewable resource and might need a lot of energy to produce, but they cause less water pollution (because they absorb dyes easily) and can be easily recycled. Wood-based fabrics, such as viscose, are often trumpeted as environmentally sound, but much depends on where the trees come from, how well the forests are managed and how clean the production process is. There are no simple answers. Until an accepted labelling system is produced, all assertions should be viewed with a great deal of scepticism. Some recommendations: CLOTHES. While the fashion business is one of the world's largest employers, the production of clothes causes serious pollution and consumes many natural resources. Problems include agrochemicals (cotton and wool), use of energy and non-renewable resources (synthetics), pollution from dyes and chemicals used in processing, emissions from energy generators, and the exploitation of under-age labour. Environmental and social issues now occupy an important position on the business agenda of the fashion market, instigated mainly by innovative companies who are genuinely responsible but who also see market benefits from getting out in front. Esprit, the fast-expanding Californian company has developed - through genuine efforts - a sound reputation for being socially and environmentally responsible. It has begun to integrate environmental issues into its design and production, using organically-grown cottons, natural dyes, recycled materials and clean technology. Marks and Spencer might not promote its products on environmental grounds but it does insist that suppliers conform to a range of strict environmental, social and health criteria. Other high-street names, such as Hennes, Next and Principles offer eco ranges (such as unbleached cottons) and there are smaller companies, such as Evolve and Disappearing Earth, which promote products on environmental grounds. Without an environmental audit, however, it is difficult to differentiate between companies making genuine efforts to become environmentally sound and those which are merely testing - or exploiting - the demand for green products. Ask suppliers offering eco lines for their environmental policy and evidence of its application. TOILETRIESBody Shop sells natural cosmetics and toiletries worldwide. It is easy to be cynical about this maverick - and sensitive - organisation that behaves more like a pressure group than a traditional business. But even in the light of the criticism made by a US ethical investment fund this week Body Shop has shown that it is possible to be socially and environmentally innovative and profitable. Boots, while unable to compete with the Body Shop's overall image, is a responsible manufacturer and retailer. Among large UK companies it has pioneered a far-reaching environmental policy which affects all stages of its manufacturing and retailing. It still has a long way to go, but Boots has made far more progress in areas such as packaging, recycling and raw material sourcing than its competitors in the toiletries sector. HOUSEHOLD/GIFTS'Trading for a fairer world' is the motto of mail-order company Traidcraft. Based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, it sells goods from developing countries. The company sources its stock for a fair price and encourages entrepreneurial activities in undeveloped countries, similar to Oxfam. Traidcraft offers three catalogues: paper and cards, alternatives (clothing, jewellery and accessories) and interiors. (Tel: 091-491 0591). COFFEESmall coffee producers - all in developing countries - are among the most exploited groups of farmers, reliant on the unpredictable world coffee market. Oxfam and other charities sell coffee direct through their stores and health shops. But until now these efforts failed to win a wide enough distribution. Cafe Direct was launched in 1992 by a group which includes Oxfam Trading, Traidcraft and Twin Trading (tel: 071-628 6878). It has managed to get prized space in most supermarkets. DIY and TIMBERWood can be produced without damaging the environment. Attempts are being made to introduce certified labels but progress is slow. The World Wide Fund for Nature has signed up 24 companies in the UK who are committed to selling timber and wood products from sustainable sources by 1995. B &amp; Q, Do-it-All, Homebase and Texas Homecare are among the WWF 1995 Group. ANIMAL PRODUCTSThe RSPCA has launched a label called Freedom Foods, guaranteeing that meat and egg products bearing it have been produced following a strict animal welfare code. The label is on pork and egg products in Tesco and the Co-op, but will be extended to more stores and other products. Finally, what is the right choice for the ice cream shopper? In the UK, buy Loseley: it is just as good, if not better than, other products. It is cheaper and it is made locally (no long-haul transport) with good ingredients by a respected company. Some shopping decisions are just so much easier than others. New Consumer Briefing, published by New Consumer, researches the social and environmental performance of companies.

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Data watchdog to meet bank chief A SENIOR manager of Barclays Bank is to meet a representative of the data protection registrar this week to defend the bank against the claim it may be breaking the law by insisting that new customers' details can be used for the marketing of other bank products. Barclays said yesterday it believed it was neither breaching the 1984 Data Protection Act nor evading the banks' code of practice for personal customers by refusing to allow applicants who reject this to open new accounts. The bank acted as Labour demanded that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, establish whether any bank is turning away customers who refuse to allow their details to be made available to all the bank's subsidiaries. Labour's move followed the disclosure that Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar with responsibility for financial services, was worried about possible breaches of the act and evasions of the personal banking code. Mr Lamidey cited clauses in application forms for Barclays products, such as its Barclaycard credit card, which say that the bank will enter the information on its central database for use by any company within the Barclays group. Barclays said yesterday it had written to all customers in 1990 to ask their permission to enter details on its customer information system database. Only a small fraction had refused such permission. The code of practice says that banks should not disclose information about customers' accounts or their names and addresses for marketing purposes except in circumstances such as when the customer requests it or gives consent. The British Bankers' Association said its committee on data security was still discussing concerns raised by Mr Lamidey. It expected to meet him again to discuss data security after individual banks had considered them. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's city spokesman, tabled a series of parliamentary questions to the Treasury after Mr Lamidey expressed concern on Monday about how banks were obtaining and using personal and account details. Mr Darling has asked Mr Lamont to request a report from the governor of the Bank of England on whether personal financial information on customers has been disclosed to third parties without the knowledge and consent of the customer. Mr Darling also wants to know if any bank is turning away customers who do not agree to their personal financial deta being disclosed to third parties such as their own subsidiary financial services companies. He said there was 'legitimate public concern' about whether the existing regulatory system was being adequately enforced. The Treasury is likely to respond to Mr Darling's questions within a week. Banks have become keen to gain customers' permission to disclose details to all their subsidiaries because they want to raise more income from selling products such as insurance and credit cards.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, proceeding from  the President's Decree "On measures to liberalize Ukraine's  export policies" (see UBN no. 19), adopted a resolution on 6 May  to set up the Ukrvneshtorg (Ukraine's Foreign Trade) Concern to  be composed of the state-owned Ukrvneshprom (Ukrainian Foreign  Industry), Slavutych-Ruda (Dnieper Ore), Slavutych-Stal (Steel),  Ukrtsvetprom (Ukraine's Nonferrous Metallurgy), and  Ukrvneshkhimprom (Ukraine's Foreign Chemical Industry) foreign  economic associations.    Ukrvneshtorg is designed to export produce (commodities and  services) within the framework of the State Order and State  Contract involving nomenclatures to be determined by the Cabinet  of Ministers.    The State Contract's amounts were specified by the Cabinet's  resolution, which was adopted in mid-March 1994.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rolled ferrous metal, ths. t.

Presently, Vadim Plotkin is  its acting president. He is to register the Concern within a  10-day period.    Commenting on the resolution at UKRINFORM's request,  Alexander Nasekan, the Industry Ministry's foreign economic  relations agency superintendent, said the Ministry would, to a  certain extent, take part in Ukrvneshtorg's activities. However,  specific forms will be clear only after its statute has been  drafted and approved.    The role to be played by the former so-called "special  exporters" remains unclear. One is left to wonder, if the move  was purposefully prompted by the director corps to make a show  of supposedly rigid control under the Cabinet's pressure, or  whether it should be interpreted as the government's step toward  a more centralized system of effort distribution and sharing  export incomes.    However, the details and underlying goals of the changes  underway are likely to surface in a matter of days.</p>

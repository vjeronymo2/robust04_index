			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bolivian foreign affairs and finance ministers  begin an official visit to Spain today in Madrid in search of  business partners among Spanish firms for their state  telecommunications, electricity, petrol, gas, air transport, and  railway companies.    Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga and  Finance Minister Fernando Alvaro Cosio [name as received], have  a full agenda including meetings with King Juan Carlos, Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Foreign Minister Javier Solana, as  well as Justice Minister Alberto Belloch, Interior Minister  Antoni Asuncion, and Trade Minister Javier Gomez-Navarro. In  addition, they will have a business breakfast with Spanish  businessmen.    Bolivia has started a program of state company  privatizations  in which the private partner will take total control of the  management for an ongoing term and will be the sole owner of the  profits.    Spanish aid for Bolivia is another item on the agenda. Since  1989 Spain has granted credits to Bolivia worth $200 million,  half of which have been used, while the rest is waiting for the  Bolivian projects to be financed to be identified.</p>

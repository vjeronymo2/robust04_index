The President Begins a Realignment of Forces"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The president's unwillingness  to turn to the Constitutional Court (the sole body with the  power to overrule the Duma's resolution) suggests that his  attitude to the amnesty decision is not as negative as some of  his associates (Sergey Filatov and others) make out. This  version is also corroborated by the fact that all measures to  prevent the execution of the sacramental resolution came a  little late in the day.    Indeed the Duma made its amnesty decision on 23 February  while the president's response (letters to speaker Rybkin and  General Prosecutor Kazannik) did not come out until the 26th.  Of course, such a belated reaction can be attributed to the  general lack of coordination in the presidential services and  their unreadiness for such a turn of events (although it is very  hard to describe the Duma's decision as totally unexpected).  Yet it can be supposed that all these "impeding" actions on  Yeltsin's part are no more than an artful stage production  devised not only to prevent an investigation which is unwanted  by the president, but first, to demonstrate to the radical  democrats the president's solidarity with their position; and  second, to facilitate Aleksey Kazannik's transfer from the  General Prosecutor's Office to the Constitutional Court. It  this is correct, Yeltsin's acceptance of Kazannik's resignation  is not a sign of disgrace but only part of a calculated plot.  It is not ruled out that the aura of a principled and  independent man will help Kazannik take the vacant seat of the  Constitutional Court chairman. (It should be noted  parenthetically that Aleksey Ilyushenko, currently acting  prosecutor general, can hardly ever become an object of such a  complex intrigue. His political reputation is quite certain:  He is a former member of the Interagency Anti-Corruption  Commission which charged Rutskoy with signing some compromising  documents).    To be sure, the State Duma's amnesty decision hardly pleased  the president. Signs are, however, that the upper hand was  gained by those members of the presidential team who maintained  that the "Octobrists" are much more dangerous in the symbolic  image of martyrs than as real political figures.    The complaints by the radical democrats who treat this  action  as a step toward civil war appear unsubstantiated. After all,  the amnesty decision does not restore the political power  duality September 1993-style but only increases the number of  opposition leaders by a few men.    The liberation of Anpilov and Konstantinov will hardly  consolidate the opposition and inspire it to take to new  barricades. The performance by these political figures in  September and October aroused criticism even among Yeltsin's  forthright opponents while the associations led by them -- the  National Salvation Front and Working Russia -- are now in a  profound organizational crisis.    As for Aleksandr Rutskoy, as a politician he certainly  enjoys  great authority. But it should be remembered that he became  leader of the whole opposition and a real alternative to Yeltsin  by virtue of his high post, in the extreme situation of a coup  d'etat. Now opposition politicians (Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and  Baburin) should see him rather as a potential rival: According  to people close to Rutskoy, he intends not only to return to  politics but even to contest presidential elections.

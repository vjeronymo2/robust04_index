			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Still banking on being able to take off - A look at Davies &amp; Newman, which has seen its share price slide to 12p AMONG the sorriest sights in the recession-depressed stock market are companies which once looked great recovery plays. Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is an extreme example. After nearly going bust, it was virtually refloated last October in a Pounds 49.3m equity issue that swamped the old shareholders - notably the Newman family. With debt greatly reduced and Pounds 20m pre-tax profit forecast for 1992 (after losses of more than Pounds 35m in both 1990 and 1991), the issue price of 50p looked very attractive, indeed one disgruntled shareholder described it as a giveaway. It represented a prospective p/e of four and was only a third of the opening price on the day the rescue was announced. Yesterday the share price closed at a new low of 12p. The background was described by Mr David James, the company doctor-chairman, at the annual meeting on May 29. 'In our listing particulars we drew attention to the fact that passenger traffic generally grows at twice the rate of gross domestic product. Whereas we had adopted the widely expected GDP growth of 2.6 per cent to give passenger growth of 5.2 per cent, the growth so far in 1992 has been negligible.' Results forecasts have been continually downgraded. One forecast obtained this week was for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7m. Questions have been raised about whether the Pounds 35m bank credit facility will be adequate to see the company through the traditional winter drain on cash, and about whether bank covenants will be breached. Speculation has even surfaced that D&amp;N may have another October crisis - its third in a row - and return to shareholders for cash. Mr James stresses that 'there is no cash problem'. He says only a small percentage of that Pounds 35m facility is being used and the cash position will continue to improve until the autumn. 'The seasonal best position is mid-September to late October, the worst is mid-April to mid-May.' Previous crises arose in October because the old bank facility expired at the end of that month. The new facility runs until December 31 1993. Will the company stay within its Pounds 35m limit? 'I am looking at the maximisation of cash resources. I have not said to shareholders that I am turning to them for additional support. I am looking at other strategies within management control and I am confident that we shall have adequate resources.' He added that with two years of recession in view, he was planning not only how to cope with the borrowing peak in April 1993, but also with that of April 1994. What about banking covenants? There is only one and it has 'a formula which links to an expectation on profit'. There can be no breach until the audited results for 1992 are declared in May next year. The most recent figures for borrowings came in the 1991 annual report. On December 31, gearing stood at two-thirds of shareholders' funds of Pounds 42.8m. The Pounds 29m debt was split between bank borrowings and finance leases for the aircraft. The Pounds 35m limit only applies to the bank loans. A great deal of faith is placed in Mr James's ability to negotiate with bankers, a view enhanced by the Pounds 180m debt-for-equity swap that he pulled off last week for one of his other charges - Lep Group, the freight forwarding and security concern. In D&amp;N's case, some good will is also expected from the banks. The issue proceeds paid off a chunk of debt and nearly Pounds 9m was paid in 'special fees'. As for the lessors, one analyst commented that it was a buyers' market and some airlines had even negotiated moratoria on payments. Mr James says that his close dialogue with bankers and other financial supporters has never ceased. And if anyone wonders how he has time for such discussions on behalf of both D&amp;N and Lep, not to mention Eagle Trust, he says: 'It's largely the same banks,' with Lloyds and NatWest as the most heavily involved. While the stock market view of D&amp;N looks dire, some reassurance about Dan-Air's recent operations is offered by Mr John Olsen, appointed chief executive in April. On the charter side, 'although the market is volatile, our participation is satisfactory'. In the scheduled sector, towards which Dan-Air is shifting its emphasis, quite a strong recovery is emerging after a poor first half for all carriers. Dan-Air had one or two particular problems in the first half, for instance with its marketing effort prior to Mr Olsen's arrival. The threatened launch of a rival airline also caused some nervousness. A much improved performance is in prospect for this quarter on the back of leisure traffic. Whether business travel will recover in the autumn is another question. Shareholders may, however, derive more comfort from the thought that D&amp;N has some attractive assets in its strong position at Gatwick airport and its portfolio of European routes. One recent buyer of the shares said the gamble this time rested more on the prospect of a deal with another airline than on erstwhile recovery hopes.</p>

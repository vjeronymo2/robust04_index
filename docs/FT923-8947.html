			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / OFT to probe ITV network THE Office of Fair Trading warned yesterday that it had identified three potentially anti-competitive elements of the new ITV networking arrangements which it intends to investigate. In a consultative paper the OFT said it would be looking at the possible anti-competitive implications of: Proposals that prevent independent producers contracting directly with the ITV network. Instead they must go through a regional ITV company. The extra costs and possible disadvantages arising from that system. The fact that ITV companies want to buy programme rights for 10 years with a further five-year option. The OFT - which has a legal responsibility to ensure that the central network system is fair - emphasised that it had not yet taken any firm decisions. Mr John Woodward, chief executive of Pact, the independent producers' group, said: 'I think ITV has a major problem. If the OFT had not recognised what we said, it would not have raised them as issues. Every single foundation stone of the ITV proposals has been criticised.' The OFT said terms on programme rights were 'unparalleled both in relation to UK experience and relevant overseas experience'. It said preventing independents dealing directly with the network may put them 'at a competitive disadvantage when competing with licencees to supply programmes to the network'. The OFT hopes to rule on the networking arrangements before the end of this year.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / WPP falls 38% and pays no dividend WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, yesterday reported a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1991; they fell from Pounds 90m to Pounds 56.1m, although without exceptional items, pre-tax profits were Pounds 38.36m. Group revenues fell by nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.26bn), on turnover down 7 per cent to Pounds 5.08bn (Pounds 5.46bn). Earnings per share fell 64 per cent, from 78.1p to 27.9p and, as in 1990, no dividend is to be paid. The results were slightly worse than expected by analysts and WPP blamed falling advertising expenditure for its profits' collapse. 1991 was the first year since 1983 when the group's profitability did not improve. The group shed 8 per cent of its staff during the year (from 22,308 to 20,514), but salary costs shrank only 2.3 per cent. Staff costs amount to 55 per cent of group revenues. WPP also has 10 per cent of its worldwide office space surplus to requirements, costing about Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.7m) annually. The group sector revenues most badly affected were non-media advertising (such as sales promotion and design), down 13 per cent; and public relations, down 11 per cent. Hill and Knowlton, WPP's public relations branch, recorded a loss. However, strategic marketing services' revenues grew 8 per cent, and the group gained net new accounts worth Pounds 995m during the year, equivalent to more than Pounds 149m of net new revenues. Revenues fell 8.8 per cent in the US and 5.5 per cent in the UK but rose 1.4 per cent elsewhere. Operating margins fell to 7 per cent from 10.5 per cent; WPP's interest bill was Pounds 45.8m in 1991 against Pounds 42.9 in 1990. By the end of the year, net debt increased to Pounds 334m against Pounds 297m at the end of 1990, although the group traded within its banking covenants during 1991. WPP warned that, as little prospect of economic recovery was in sight for 1992, debt repayments scheduled for 1993 might need renegotiation. Last April, WPP completed a financial restructuring package; consolidating Dollars 270m of working capital facilities, a Dollars 604m medium-term loan and Dollars 100m of uncommitted facilities into a committed medium-term facility. The Dollars 604m loan must be repaid over four years from June 1993. The rest is to be repaid or refinanced by June 1993. WPP's banks are now likely to push for asset disposals in the US - particularly the advertising agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves - and in Asia to smooth debt renegotiations. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 55m and Pounds 75m for 1992. Lex, Page 22; Soft seller, Page 25; Market, Page 42</p>

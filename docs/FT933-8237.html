			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Speculators as the scapegoats TRUE TO past form, a number of European policymakers, notably in France and Belgium, have reacted to the exchange rate mechanism debacle with loud calls for measures to curb speculators, condemned as either errant or malicious. These politicians reveal a worrying misunderstanding about markets. But they are right in their belief that the European Community cannot return to where it was a few weeks ago. What it must not do, however, is try to go further backwards still, to the era of exchange controls. Belgium's finance minister, Mr Philippe Maystadt, has condemned currency speculation as 'a type of transaction which does not know any rules, no costs and no taxes'. Earlier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, argued: 'The crisis wasn't due to concern about the franc itself, but to a desire to destroy the European monetary system.' This, he added, was because speculators want the world's currencies to float freely so they can make more money. These views would be funny if they were not so disturbing. Mr Balladur seems unaware that even a shrewd speculator is unlikely to make a consistent killing in a free market. The most profitable currency markets are ones in which governments put themselves forward as pigeons for investors to pluck. It would be surprising therefore if the latter were not praying for immediate recreation of the narrow-band ERM. This the EC says it intends to do. The question is whether its intention reflects the interests of the people of Europe. Unnecessary recession Mr Balladur believes the security of his country has been endangered. But perhaps what has been endangered is the reputation of its policymakers. Those in office usually believe that their policies express the long-term interests of their people, while speculative attacks reveal the irresponsibility, if not wickedness, of markets. But that conclusion is not self-evident. In this case, speculators doubted the willingness of the French people to tolerate an unnecessary recession in the name of European integration. By doubting it, they created the conditions in which that policy could change, a result that seems benign. Whenever a perfectly good explanation can be found for the behaviour of individual investors, conspiracy theories are unnecessary. Currency markets are the largest and most liquid in the world. The envisaged collusion among participants is inconceivable. To argue otherwise is to indulge in paranoia. Freedom of movement Exaggerating the wisdom of governments and the follies or even wickedness of markets is, unfortunately, not the only mistake that has been made. As important has been the undue identification of the cause of the European integration with a particular monetary mechanism, a mistake that parallels earlier worship of the common agricultural policy. The foundation for European integration has, in fact, been the integration of the economies of member states by the progressively increasing freedom of movement of goods, services, labour and capital. The ERM, or even economic and monetary union, can be justified largely to the extent that they support such integration. This is why talk of exchange controls is self-defeating. In the absence of some kind of global tax on foreign exchange transactions, which seems infeasible in practice and questionable in theory, the only way to try to prevent what happened to the ERM would be a return to tight national exchange controls. But this would fragment the single market for capital and severely hamper those in labour and services. Since the ERM has often been justified as the monetary counterpart of the single market, it would be perverse to adopt measures that would destroy what the mechanism is supposed to preserve. Apart from being perverse, exchange controls would probably also be infeasible. The EC must move in a different direction. One alternative would be faster movement towards monetary union. But this the Germans seem unlikely to accept. Another would be to make the present wide bands work, perhaps in the context of greater global exchange rate co-ordination. But one thing is quite clear. There is no future for the EC in going backwards. It must move forward instead.</p>

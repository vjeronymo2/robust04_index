			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Trainee Ma Qiang (7456 1730) and Reporter Guo Yingyan </F> (6753 3467 3601): "Liaoning Provincial Government Holds Forum on  Overall Agricultural Development"]    [Text] From 1 to 3 December, the provincial government  held a forum on overall agricultural development in Fuxin city.    The participants maintained: Since the implementation of the  overall agricultural development project and the principle for  comprehensively improving mountainous areas, water courses,  forestry, farmland, and roads and comprehensively developing  agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations,  and fishery, the province has noticeably improved agricultural  production conditions and the ecological environment, promoted  the popularization and application of new varieties and new  technologies, and upgraded overall agricultural production  capability. In the past five years, 1.879 million mu of medium-  and low-yield land, covered in the state-listed development  projects, were transformed; 568,000 mu of wasteland suitable to  agricultural production were reclaimed; 30,000 mu of grassland  were improved; and 207,000 mu of shelter belts were built.  Three million mu of key farmland was built in the western part  of the province and Chaoyang area. Some medium- and low-yield  land of the mountain areas in the eastern part of the province  were transformed with the focus on improving the soil's acidity  and transforming frozen land. All localities across the  province rapidly developed the production of wheat and  vegetables, fruit trees, the cattle breeding industry, coastal  areas, and beaches.    The participants maintained: Although the province has made  great achievements in overall agricultural development, some  problems still persist that cannot be ignored.    Xiao Zuofu set forth six opinions on overall agricultural  development to which we should pay attention. First, we should  persist in the principle of never ignoring grain production and  positively developing a diversified economy. We should focus  the overall agricultural development on grain production, ensure  a stable improvement in overall grain production, strengthen the  construction of agricultural infrastructural facilities,  ceaselessly improve agricultural production conditions and  agricultural service means, and vigorously develop high-yield,  good-quality, and high- efficiency agriculture. Second, we  should develop areas on a large scale and stress efficiency of  scale. We should persistently make unified plans and  arrangements and make reasonable distribution to set up  agricultural production bases and comprehensively develop  agriculture in line with the orientation of regional economy,  commercialization, intensive economy, and modernization; and  build the overall agricultural development areas into ones  experimenting with the development of high-yield, good-quality,  and high- efficiency agriculture; modernized agricultural model  areas; and areas advanced towards the target of becoming fairly  well-off. Third, we should organize overall agricultural  development in line with the requirements of industrialization  and coordinate small- scale production with large markets. We  should comprehensively develop agriculture in line with the  ideology that the government cultivates markets, markets guide  production, production meets the demands of markets, support and  protection policies, and according to the requirements of  industrialization; organize each and every household to engage  in decentralized management; develop key industries and key  products in line with regional distribution, specialized  production, coordinate management, socialized service, and  enterprise management; and carry out the cropping-breeding-  processing, production-supply-marketing, domestic-and-foreign  trade, and agricultural-industrial-commercial production and  management system where markets play a leading role, production  bases are set up according to market demands, and production  bases establish contacts with peasant households. Fourth, we  should pay attention to scientific and technological input and  persist in high starting points, high standards, high quality,  and high efficiency in overall agricultural development. We  should try every possible means to try out increasingly more new  agrotechnological findings and improved varieties; strengthen  technological training; improve the peasants' quality and  scientific and technological level; set up areas experimenting  with the development of high-yield, good-quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture; increase the input of new high-tech  and improved varieties; and increase the scientific and  technological contents of agriculture. Fifth, we should  arrange, in a unified manner, various funds in line with overall  agricultural development. We should collect funds from all  fronts and increase the input to agriculture. We should define  projects according to their efficiency and determine the amount  of capital in line with projects. Instead of making equal  distribution or dividing the proportion of investment according  to conventions, we should select and increase input to areas  with high enthusiasm and the guarantee for timely supply and  allocation of capital. In regard to the capital input  orientation, we should grasp the construction of both  infrastructural facilities and key projects so as to make full  use of the limited capital. Sixth, we should gradually conduct  development in management. So far, some localities have made  appropriate achievements by organizing and setting up entities  and increasing machines. All localities should positively make  explorations, accumulate experiences, and embark on a sound  orbit of overall agricultural development.    Xiao Zuofu stressed: 1994 is the last year to implement the  project to comprehensively develop agriculture on the Liao He  plain as well as the first year to work out the next overall  agricultural development project and the project for developing  Songliao Plain with World Bank loans. Therefore, it is of great  importance to achieve this winter and next spring's work. All  localities and all departments concerned should firmly grasp the  formulation of the overall agricultural development plan. All  localities should comprehensively fulfill the tasks for  comprehensively developing Liao He plain and attain the desired  results by 1 May 1994.    Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, made an important speech at the forum. He  particularly stressed the necessity to accurately handle the  relationship between industry and agriculture and the  relationship between large and medium-sized enterprises and town  and township enterprises. In regard to the further development  of the rural economy and the overall development of agriculture,  he pointed out that in line with the reality of the province, we  should work out ways to develop agriculture and elevating  agriculture to a new height. A ratio of fifty-fifty exists  between urban and rural populations of the province. Our  province has more large and medium-sized cities and large  industrial enterprises. All this has helped provide a vast  market for developing agriculture. We should focus the  development of the rural economy on grain production, take the  construction of farm and sideline products bases as a starting  point, and gain the advantages of large-scale management. Our  province has great potential in this regard. Now that  foodstuffs and vegetables from the southern areas have entered  the markets of the north, it is time to set up large markets in  northeast China. Only when there is an ample supply of  materials will markets become more brisk.    In regard to the overall agricultural development, he  stressed that we should achieve the construction of farmland  water conservancy projects; pay attention to the development of  sea and road transportation and the construction of small towns;  and develop roads linking counties with townships and linking  townships with villages. With convenient transportation  conditions, we are able to promote commodity circulation. We  should work out plans to build small towns. Only when small  towns are well established and the town and township enterprises  relatively concentrated will we be able to achieve big  development. In short, Liaoning has great potential for  agricultural development. Leaders at various levels should pay  attention to agriculture and rural work. So long as we do solid  work we will be able to turn expectations into reality.    Present at the forum were vice mayors in charge of  agricultural work and responsible comrades of the  provincial-level departments concerned.</p>

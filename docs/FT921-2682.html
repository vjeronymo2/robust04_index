			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Beijing urged to dismiss officials blocking reforms A SIGNED article in a Chinese official newspaper said yesterday that officials who blocked economic reform should be fired - a sign that a current power struggle could lead to major personnel changes, Reuter reports from Beijing. 'We must resolutely dismiss from their leading positions those officials who lack the spirit of blazing new trails, who are incompetent and mediocre and cannot make new developments,' the article in the Economic Daily said. 'By dismissing one person we might be able to move a group.' Almost nothing appears in China's press by accident. While signed articles lack the authority of editorials they often represent the opening salvo of a campaign, especially in a newspaper such as the Economic Daily, the official organ of the State Council or cabinet. An official at the newspaper said the author, Li Dawei, was a provincial official involved in economic work. 'We believed his article was very well written but we didn't think much about his background,' the newspaper official said. Li's article, while unforgiving of opponents of reform, said proponents of change should be forgiven their faults. 'We should not demand perfection of reformers and we certainly must not make exaggerated criticisms of reformers' faults.' Reformers were blamed for causing economic overheating in the late 1980s which in turn led to widespread public unrest over runaway inflation and corruption.</p>

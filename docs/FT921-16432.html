			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Rivers watchdog curbs ICI effluent THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority, the environmental regulator, yesterday announc-ed new controls on emissions from ICI's outfall at Wilton, Teesside. It is believed to be the largest industrial effluent discharge point in the UK. The NRA described the new legally enforceable limits, which take immediate effect, as 'tough', but said the further reductions it required in discharges from the outfall were to be phased in over four years. Until now there has been little legal control on the concentrations and types of chemicals released from ICI's Wilton petrochemical and plastics plants into the Tees estuary through a pipeline which discharges 33m gallons of effluent a day. The new NRA consent imposes limits on concentrations of components of the discharge for the first time. It also requires reductions of 50 per cent and more in discharges of significant pollutants, including organic acids and salts, by 1996 and reserves the right to impose additional conditions in the next two years. The NRA is now reviewing the consents under which thousands of effluent pipelines around Britain have operated for decades. It faces pressure from Greenpeace, the environmental group, to make an example of ICI by imposing immediate heavy cuts in its Tees effluent discharges. But the NRA said yesterday the reductions had to be phased or ICI's operations would be threatened. ICI welcomed the new limits, saying they were in line with its corporate aim of cutting discharges by 50 per cent by 1995.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT on 17 February carries in  its regular 19-minute newscast two reports on the fighting in  the republic.    Doboj correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic reports on the  situation in the 7-South Operative group operational zone, and  says that "this morning the area of Tesanj came under attack,  particularly (?Mrkovcici) and Sije. Despite the low  temperatures, the Chetniks shelled the villages using tanks,  [word indistinct], and 82-mm and 120-mm mortars. Everything  implies that the enemy will continue the attacks during the day,  particularly along the [word indistinct] communication  Doboj-Teslic."    Velid Djindo, the Olovo correspondent, reports that "this  morning from 0530 [0430 GMT] to 0630, the districts on the  southern access points of Olovo were again exposed to fierce  howitzer fire. We still have no information on the consequences  of the latest bombardment of civilian targets. As I am filing  this report, just after 0900, enemy antiaircraft machine gun,  antiaircraft gun, and small arms' fire can be heard along the  southern parts of the front."</p>

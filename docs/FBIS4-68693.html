			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent Valeriy Orlov, </F> Nizhniy Novgorod, under rubric "Response": "People Want To  Create a Construction Boom in Nizhniy Novgorod"]    [Text] The article "House-Warmings in Nizhniy  Novgorod" in the 12 April issue of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has  received a large response. The newspaper's correspondent center  in Nizhniy Novgorod has already received a large number of  telephone calls and letters. The readers ask whether, during a  period of economic instability, it is really possible without  state support to engage successfully in such an expensive matter  as the construction of housing. And who is this Vyacheslav  Rasteryayev?    I admit that, prior to my acquaintance with the affairs of  the Nizhegorodskiy Dom company, I myself was a big skeptic in  this regard. But now I am convinced that such structures have a  real future. It is precisely these structures that will create a  healthy and massive housing market.    The creator, brains, and chief motivating force of  Nizhegorodskiy Dom is Vyacheslav Rasteryayev. He is 43 years  old. Born in Tver. After graduation from the Moscow Motor Roads  Institute, went to Gorkiy. And he has been working there for  more than 20 years. He was a foreman and chief of an SMU  [construction-installation administration], managed the city's  water canal, and worked as the deputy chairman of the rayon and  city Soviet.    Why did he undertake not the trading of Snickers, but the  erecting of housing?    "The construction conveyor belt began to fall apart as a  result of the sharp slump in centralized investments,"  Vyacheslav Alekseyevich says. "The collectives that had become  accustomed to sensing the constant concern 'from the top' were  left without work. But I had communicated with construction  workers for my entire life, and I was convinced that I could  rectify the situation. But at first I decided that it was  necessary to seek new approaches to the formation of sources of  construction. Namely, to work with the population, because  people do have money. "    Having proved by deeds its probity, Nizhegorodskiy Dom acted  as the initiator of the construction of the first municipal bank  in Russia, which would operate only with the population, but  would direct the attracted monetary amounts to the construction  complex. The idea was supported by the city administration,  which also acquired the controlling block of several large-scale  enterprises. That is how the Nizhegorodskiy Kredit municipal  investment bank appeared, and Vyacheslav Rasteryayev was  elected, ex officio, chairman of its board of directors.    The new bank immediately became the most popular one with  the  people of Nizhniy Novgorod. First, because people had become  accustomed to trusting their authorities. And, secondly, it is  simply advantageous to deal with it! The Nizhegorodskiy Kredit  bank has approximately 20 types of deposits, and they all  operate for the benefit of the local residents.    Take, for example, the housing-accumulation deposit. By  using  it, it is possible without hurrying, over a 15-year period, to  accumulate enough money for an apartment. It is aimed basically  at parents who are thinking about their children's future. After  concluding a contract with the bank, the depositor of the  housing-accumulation deposit, through his accounting office,  transfers two to three minimum wages every month. Today the  minimum wage is approximately 15,000 rubles. For a family in  which everyone is working, it is not difficult to pay  30,000-40,000 rubles a month. Then, when the child is grown, he  is assured of having housing. Incidentally, whoever wants to can  transfer even more, and then, naturally, he will get the  apartment more quickly.    Figures give convincing evidence of the popularity of the  municipal bank among the people living along the Volga. During  the past four months more than 4 billion rubles were attracted  from the population. And the monetary stream is building up.  Currently the bank takes in from the people of Nizhniy Novgorod  120-140 million rubles a day. All this money will soon be  converted into comfortable apartments.    "Currently we are beginning to carry out a new idea," V.  Rasteryayev says. "It is the housing municipal loan. Its bonds,  of three types, are planned for a three-year period. The first  is at a rate of 700,000 rubles per square meter of housing  space. If, for example, you want to purchase a one-room  apartment over a one-year period, you purchase the necessary  number of bonds that correspond to the metric area at that  price. But if you need an apartment the next year, that bond  will cost 550,000 rubles. If, however, someone is in too much of  a hurry and he can be patient for three years, then he must pay  for each bond, and, consequently, for each square meter of his  future housings, not 700,000 rubles, but only 480,000. The bonds  in this loan will also participate simultaneously in the drawing  of apartments."    "But what about inflation?"    "We have gotten away from this insidious concomitant of our  day reducing the construction periods. Whereas the 'usual'  construction workers will erect homes in two years, we will  build them in six months. We achieve this by working in two or  three shifts, with the smooth operation of the entire  construction conveyor belt. There is also no problem with  materials. We always have them on hand. And any kind that is  needed, whether they come from Finland or Italy, or even from  Chuvashia."    Chuvashia was mentioned, of course, not accidentally. It  turns out that it is more advantageous to bring in and install  reinforced concrete from the neighboring republic than it is to  buy it from the nearby Nizhniy Novgorod enterprises. The quality  of the shipped-in concrete is better, and the concrete costs  less. But many of the local suppliers of building materials  continue to operate the old way: the more metal and concrete  they bang around, the better.    Rasteryayev has a different principle: reduce the amounts of  metal, the expenditures of electrical power, cement, and other  materials; reduce the construction periods; and take a serious  attitude toward cost accountability. Because most of the  construction builders have gotten so close to this line that  people will no longer be able to buy housing because it is so  expensive.    Rasteryayev was nominated as a candidate in the recent  election to the Nizhniy Novgorod city Duma.    "At first I had my doubts about whether I needed this," he  recalls, "but, after thinking that, instead of me, the person  elected to the Duma might be some sweet-talking temporary person  who would not help the city in any way, I gave my consent to  run."    And he won, as the expression goes, with a clear advantage.  At the first organizational meeting of the Duma, Vyacheslav  Alekseyevich was elected chairman of the commission for  construction, architecture, and land relations.    Rasteryayev has already proven to his constituents that he  had good reason for becoming a deputy. He proposed a unique  self-reproducing mortgage scheme. The city will allocate, for  example, to its municipal bank 14 billion rubles. By using that  money it can build 500 apartments this year. Naturally, the  expended money will not return rapidly to the city treasury.  Rasteryayev proposed doing this: these 14 billion "work" in the  bank and grow to 40 billion. From that amount the city will get  back its 14 billion, and with the remaining 26 billion it will  be possible to build, with a consideration of inflation, 350  apartments. The city will distribute these apartments -- to  doctors, teachers, people in the military -- and will transfer  the lists to Nizhegorodskiy Dom. The company will offer the  potential tenants the opportunity to buy those apartments by  installment payments, for example, over a 25-year period, with a  payment of one to two minimum wages a month. The average cost of  an apartment is currently approximately 40 million rubles. Over  a 25-year period that amount will be converted to a negligible  amount.    At the same time the mortgage fund will be constantly  augmented by the tenants' payments, guaranteeing a stable work  order for the construction workers. And there is monitoring,  since the bank is a municipal one. Thus, by investing the money  once, it is possible to force it to work for a long time.    Rasteryayev's scheme was reviewed and approved by the city  administration. Now it is up to the Nizhniy Novgorod Duma to  have its say.    This is a matter for the near future. But Nizhegorodskiy Dom  already has something with which to please its fellow city  dwellers during the current half-year. In a month a  200-apartment building will be able to accept new tenants. In  June the largest recuperation center in the Volga region, and  perhaps in all of Russia, will be turned over. It has a swimming  pool, saunas, practice rooms, and medical offices. The doors of  several bank branches are also opening. Work is actively  continuing to build three major housing projects simultaneously.    "In order to break through the dam of the depression, it is  necessary to create a building boom in the country," Vyacheslav  Rasteryayev states. "Only a construction flywheel can get the  country's economy moving again."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Baghdad, 30 Apr (INA) -- The Arab workers' rally  for solidarity with the workers and peoples of Iraq, Palestine,  and the Libyan Jamahiriyah began here today under the slogan:  "Arab Workers Take a Firm Position in the Trench of Great Iraq,  Palestine, and the Libyan Jamahiriyah." The rally will last two  days.    President Saddam Husayn's representative Taha Yasin Ramadan,  member of the Revolution Command Council and vice president,  delivered a speech in which he conveyed his excellency the  president's appreciation of all Arab workers for their  initiatives to defend Arab issues. [passage omitted]    He said the Arab nation is facing the most dangerous and the  largest of aggressions, designed to liquidate the Palestine  question and conspire against Iraq, the Libyan Jamahiriyah,  Yemen's unity, and Sudan's unity. This, he said, requires a  distinguished militant move by the free and militant sons of the  Arab nation to support the militant positions of these  countries, which are bravely resisting and standing firmly  against the aggressions and conspiracies of the enemies and  their agents.    Ramadan stressed that pan-Arab responsibility requires us to  stand by the nation and the right regardless of sacrifices, to  do what is right for the coming generations, and to be loyal to  all Arab values and divine messages. [passage omitted]    He praised the steadfastness of the Libyan Jamahiriyah's  people in the face of the unjust blockade, as well as their  refusal to bow to hostile designs. He hailed the great Somali  victory over the U.S.-led foreign invasion forces, the strong  Yemeni unity, and Sudan's steadfastness in the face of  conspiracies targeting its independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity.

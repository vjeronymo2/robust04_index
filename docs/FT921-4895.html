			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / School cuts alleged despite rising rolls INNER LONDON councils are cutting education budgets this year even though pupil numbers are rising rapidly, according to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, for the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities. The report, based on six Labour-controlled councils, revealed reductions in real terms in all six education budgets. With a 12 per cent increase in pupils remaining at school beyond 16, the ratio of secondary pupils to teachers had increased by 7.5 per cent. In most boroughs, cuts of up to 75 per cent in adult education and youth services have been imposed to protect schools. Four of the six boroughs - Camden, Haringey, Hounslow, Islington, Lewisham and Newham - have failed to allocate books and equipment to match increased numbers. The ALA blamed the cuts on the government's poll-tax capping rules. However, the report says that in spite of cuts 'the integrity of borough education services has been maintained'. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities said the position was similar in other inner-city authorities. It also alleged that the government's special education grant of Pounds 56.5m - intended to finance the 7.8 per cent teachers' pay settlement announced last month - had been divided unevenly, which particularly hit West Midlands and Greater Manchester. The AMA issued figures supporting its claim that the grant was distributed on the basis of school expenditure generally - not according to the number of teachers employed.</p>

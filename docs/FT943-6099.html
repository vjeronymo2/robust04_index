			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Lion withdraws from US Lion, a leading Japanese maker of household goods, is withdrawing from the domestic pet food and US consumer goods market, dissolving operations set up in the 1980s as a part of its diversification programme. The company will post a special loss of Y7bn (Dollars 7m) for the current year to March, but earnings projections will not be altered as the loss will be covered by profits from securities sales. Many Japanese companies are starting to restructure operations set up in the 1980s, when investment in new businesses was prevalent. The downturn in the Japanese economy and falling cash flow from their main businesses have prompted many companies to review diversification schemes. Lion entered the US consumer goods market in 1985, setting up Lion America, which sold toothpaste and other household products. However, increasing marketing costs and competition have squeezed its profit margins and the rise in the yen has pushed up its prices.</p>

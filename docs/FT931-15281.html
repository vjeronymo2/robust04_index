			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Shutdown of unused Thorp N-plant would cost Pounds 70m BRITISH Nuclear Fuel's Thorp re-processing plant at Sellafield would cost about Pounds 70m to decommission even if it never began operation, says an unpublished BNFL report to the government. Several thousand tonnes of radioactive fuel sent early to the plant by overseas customers have already contaminated storage ponds at the controversial Cumbrian plant, which has taken nearly 10 years and cost Pounds 2.8bn to build. The report by consultants Touche Ross was sent to the Department of Trade and Industry last month. It says failure to open Thorp would lose the UK between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m a year in overseas revenues for the next 10 years. The report is the basis of BNFL's claim a sound economic case exists for the plant. The DTI, together with the Environment Department and the Foreign Office, is debating whether the plant should be allowed to start operating. Since Thorp (Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant) won approval from the 1977 Windscale inquiry, the economic, environmental and political reasons for reprocessing 'spent' or used nuclear fuel have changed. The report's financial models, which BNFL refuses to publish but which have been seen by the Financial Times, were criticised yesterday by economists for underestimating the costs of running and decommissioning Thorp and relying on projections of revenue, mainly from Japan and Germany. Mr William Walker, a senior fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University and co-author of a report criticising the economic case for Thorp, said: 'The problem with models like this is that it is extremely difficult to predict what the actual costs of cancellation would be. In reality, Thorp and its customers would get together in a smoke-filled room and hammer out a deal.' Customers' contracts with BNFL specify that they must take back the plutonium, uranium and high-level waste generated by reprocessing, but the row over a recent shipment of plutonium from France to Japan has highlighted diplomatic and environmental concerns. The report assumes that if Thorp was not opened, the fuel which is already there would be sent back to the overseas utilities who sent it, but that the costs of storing and shipping it could exceed Pounds 10m a year for much of the next decade. BNFL said yesterday: 'We cannot comment on details of the Touche Ross report but we have always maintained that Thorp represents an excellent piece of business for the UK and for BNFL.'

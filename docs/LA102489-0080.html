			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWNS SHOW DITKA THE FLIP SIDE, 27-7  </P> <P> Now Mike Ditka knows how the other half lives.  </P> <P> Make that the other 99%.  </P> <P> For the first time in Ditka's seven years as head coach, the Chicago Bears are  on a three-game losing streak, courtesy of a 27-7 drubbing administered Monday  night by the Cleveland Browns.  </P> <P> "It looks like a day of reckoning -- not a day of atonement, but a day of  reckoning." Ditka said after Bernie Kosar completed 22 of 29 passes for 281  yards, including a 97-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter and a three-yard  toss to Eric Metcalf, who also ran seven yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> It's the first such streak for the injury-ravaged Bears, who started four  rookies on defense, since Nov. 15-26, 1981, the year before Ditka took over and  turned the team into one of the National Football League's most dominant teams.  </P> <P> In fact, their 4-3 record drops them a game behind Minnesota in the NFC Central  Division, the first time they've been out of first place in the division since  the final game of the 1983 season -- 85 games ago.  </P> <P> But unlike last week, when he exploded after a loss to Houston and suggested  the Bears might not win again, he was more optimistic, praising his defense,  which has allowed 102 points the past three weeks after surrendering just 61 in  the opening four wins.  </P> <P> "I believe in them and I believe we can turn it around," said Ditka, whose team  plays the Rams at home next week in a game that could have huge playoff  ramifications for a team that's made the playoffs the last five years. "I'm  more encouraged today than I have been the last two weeks."  </P> <P> They also have respect.  </P> <P> "When you beat a team like Chicago on a Monday night, that's something," said  Michael Dean Perry, who led the defensive effort for the Browns, who broke  their own two-game losing streak and moved into a three-way tie at 4-3 with  Cincinnati and Houston in the AFC Central.  </P> <P> Perry, whose brother, William, plays for the Bears, led a defense that knocked  Mike Tomczak from the game late in the third quarter after he went four of 14  for 76 yards. They also stopped the Bears on Cleveland's two-yard line midway  through the third quarter. One play later, Kosar hit Slaughter on the 97-yard  scoring pass play that was the longest play from scrimmage in Brown history.  </P> <P> The call was made by offensive coordinator Marc Trestman, who was under fire in  the past two weeks as the Browns scored just 17 points in two defeats. And it  redeemed Kosar, who last week had four passes intercepted in a 17-7 loss to  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Slaughter had eight catches for 186 yards.  </P> <P> Chicago's only touchdown came on a five-yard pass from Jim Harbaugh to Wendell  Davis with 3:47 left.  </P></p>

As shown in Figure 1 three  ternary borides exist at Rh-rich composition. The present paper  reports the crystal growth and crystal structure, and magnetic  and superconducting properties of the ternary compounds.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-29A>      Figure 1. Phase Diagram of Er-Rh-B System (Rh corner) </FIG>     The single crystals of ternary borides were successfully  grown by the flux method using a molten copper as a solvent. The  reagents used were 99.9% pure Er, 99.9% pure Rh  and 99.8%  pure B. They were weighed in stoichiometric proportion and mixed  with 99.999% pure Cu in a weight ratio between 1:8 and  1:10.  The mixture was placed in a recrystallized alumina crucible. The  crucible was inserted in a vertical electric furnace. A purified  He gas flow was used as a protecting atmosphere against  oxidation. The mixture of starting materials was heated at a  rate of 400Ch[.sup]-1[/], held at 1350[.sub]c[/]  for 10h, and then slowly cooled down at a rate of  1Ch[.sup]-1[/]. After the temperature reached  1080C, the furnace was rapidly cooled down to room  temperature. The crystals were separated by dissolving Cu in  dilute nitric acid.    ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/]: Hexagonal rods of  silver metallic luster were obtained. The crystal structure of  the ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] belongs to a monoclinic  system isomorphous with ErIr[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type  structure. Lattice parameters of the  ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] are a=5.3547(3)  Angstrom, b=9.2824(5) Angstrom, c=3.1017(2) Angstrom,  _b_=90.893(5) Angstrom, V=154.15(2) Angstrom[.sup]3[/]. This  compound shows strongly anisotropic properties and takes a  ferromagnetic ordering at 27K with its easy axis along the  c-direction.    ErRh[.sub]4[/]B[.sub]4[/]: Needle like  rectangulars of silver metallic luster were obtained. The  crystal structure is primitive tetragonal with the  CeCO[.sub]4[/]B[.sub]4[/] type. The lattice parameters are  a=5.304(1) and c=7.395(2) Angstrom. This compound is interesting  because of the coexistence of superconductivity and  ferromagnetism in it. From the electrical resistivity  measurement, the superconducting transition temperature is found  to be 8.55K with thetransition width _D_T[.sub]c1[/] = 3OmK.  The reentrant transition temperature T[.sub]c2[/] is 0.84K  for cooling run. The residual resistivity ratio  RRR=(300K)/R(T[.sub]c1[/]) is 7.8.    ErRh[.sub]3[/]B: Silver metallic luster cubes were  obtained. This compound has a cubic perovskite structure. The  lattice parameter is a=4.146(1) Angstrom. This compound exhibits  normal paramagnetic behavior.  <H5>  Acknowledgement </H5>   The authors would like to thank Dr. H. Kitazawa of RIKEN  (Japan) and Professor J.

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: UK offshoot shows 38% advance THOMSON Travel Group, Thomson's UK-based travel subsidiary, saw full-year pre-tax profits rise 38 per cent to Pounds 70.2m (Dollars 123.6m), writes Michael Skapinker, Leisure Industries Correspondent. Although the UK travel industry was hit by the Gulf war, Thomson, Britain's biggest holiday company, benefited from the collapse last year of the International Leisure Group (ILG), its largest competitor. Thomson  - whose interests include package tours, Britannia Airways and Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest chain of travel agents  - announced sales revenue up 10 per cent to Pounds 1.16bn. Operating profit and interest rose 61 per cent to Pounds 68.8m while profits from aircraft disposals fell to Pounds 2.9m from Pounds 25m in 1990. Profits from tour operations more than trebled to Pounds 37.5m. Although the figure of 3m holidays sold was the same as in 1990. a reduction in price discounting led to an increase in gross margins. Profits from Britannia Airways rose 8 per cent to Pounds 28.9m before aircraft disposals. Lunn Poly's profits fell 16.7 per cent to Pounds 6m after a Pounds 2.3m provision to cover losses following the collapse of ILG. Lunn Poly expects to cover this amount this year from the bond put up as security by ILG.</p>

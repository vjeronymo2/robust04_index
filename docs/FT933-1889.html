			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / US outlines blueprint for foreign policy: Clinton strategy sees expansion of market democracies THE Clinton administration is proposing a new US foreign policy strategy of 'enlargement', to replace the containment doctrine of the cold war years. Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, yesterday drew a blueprint of the strategy to expand the reach of democracy and market economics. 'During the cold war even children understood America's security mission; as they looked at those maps on their schoolroom walls they knew we were trying to contain the creeping expansionism of that big, red blob,' Mr Lake said in a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University in Washington. 'Today, at great risk of oversimplification, we might visualise our security mission as promoting the enlargement of the blue areas of market democracies.' Mr Lake's speech, given before the latest crisis in Moscow erupted, is the most elaborate articulation so far of the administration's vision of a foreign policy for the post-cold war era. He argued that while US efforts in Bosnia and Somali were 'important expressions of our overall engagement', they did not by themselves define the broader US strategy. The US, he said, still supported lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia - a proposal rejected by its European allies - and remained committed to helping implement an acceptable peace agreement. 'But while we have clear reasons to engage and persist, they do not obliterate other American interests involving Europe and Russia, and they do not justify the extreme costs of taking unilateral responsibility for imposing a solution,' Mr Lake said. Instead, he suggested, the first concern in the US's enlargement strategy should be strengthening the core of market democracies in North America, Europe and Japan. The US should also seek to foster and consolidate democracy and market economics, particularly in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe but also in key countries which could influence an entire region, such as South Africa or Nigeria. Mr Lake said the US must isolate and, if necessary, strike back at the states which combat democracy, especially those, such as Iran and Iraq, which are regional powers. Finally, he said the US must intervene in humanitarian crises, but warned that few intra-national ethnic conflicts would justify military intervention.</p>

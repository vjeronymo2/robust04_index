			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Brother of Berlusconi 'provided bribe cash' Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of the Italian prime minister, provided money to pay bribes to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, on behalf of Fininvest, the Berlusconi family's media empire, according to lawyers acting for a senior Fininvest executive. This new twist to the problems of Fininvest and its proprietor, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, came after Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of the group's tax department, had been interrogated by Milan magistrates on charges of corruption. In comments reported yesterday by Ansa, the national news agency, Mr Guido Viola, Mr Sciascia's lawyer, said bribes paid by his client to the Guardia di Finanza had been provided and approved by Mr Paolo Berlusconi. Mr Sciascia was one of two people handling Fininvest's tax affairs who were issued with arrest warrants last Saturday. On Monday Mr Sciascia admitted paying a total of L330m (Pounds 137,000) to members of the financial police to cover inspections of three Fininvest subsidiaries between 1989 and 1992. It was not clear whether the money paid out had been accounted for in Fininvest's balance sheets. Mr Paolo Berlusconi, whose lawyers last night made a surprise visit to the Milan magistrates, was a board member of Fininvest, while his brother Silvio, the founder of the group, was chairman - a post he surrendered when he entered politics in January. Yesterday, police searched Mr Sciascia's offices and also issued an arrest warrant for a third member of Fininvest's tax department. So far only Mr Sciascia has handed himself in. Among the aspects of Fininvest Milan magistrates are now reportedly investigating is the ownership structure of Telepui, the pay-TV channel. Mr Berlusconi was only permitted a minority stake in Telepui because of anti-trust laws. The damage to the government's credibility by the investigations into Fininvest caused shares on the Milan bourse to fall by almost 3 per cent yesterday and the lira remained weak. The prime minister himself yesterday struggled to recoup some of his lost authority with a defiant speech to a congress of the Christian Democratic Centre, minor partners in his right-wing coalition. He criticised the judiciary for exceeding their powers and, in a clear reference to the Milan magistrates, challenged those who sought to take political positions to seek a popular mandate at the polls.</p>

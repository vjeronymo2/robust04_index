			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alison Wiseman] </F>   [Text] The gap between heterosexual and homosexual  transmissions of the AIDS virus is closing far more quickly than  predicted and looks set to disappear within the next three  months, according to a government specialist.    In the past quarter there have been 16 heterosexual HIV  transmissions reported compared with only one homosexual  transmission, narrowing the gap to just eight cases, according  to Health Department statistics.    There have now been 157 HIV infections in the territory that  were heterosexual transmissions compared with 165 homosexual  infections.    In January, the Health Department's AIDS consultant, Dr. Lee  Shui-shan, predicted that the heterosexual/homosexual  transmission gap would disappear by the end of the year.    But in a review of the HIV infection pattern during the  first  quarter of this year, Dr. Lee said yesterday heterosexual  transmission was likely to overtake homosexual transmission by  the middle of the year.    "What we are seeing is a dramatic rise in heterosexual  transmission of HIV although the important message is that this  gap is closing," Dr. Lee said.    Last month four men and two women were found to be infected  with the AIDS virus, bringing the total number of reported cases  of HIV in Hong Kong to 435.    One new case of full-blown AIDS was also reported to bring  the total to 100, 65 of whom have died.    "Although we are still seeing a steady increase in the  number  of HIV infections we are seeing an explosive increase in the  number of AIDS cases as more people infected with the virus are  developing AIDS-related illnesses," Dr. Lee said.    In the past quarter there have been eight new AIDS cases  compared with only one in the previous quarter.    Dr. Lee said the number of deaths from AIDS did not include  "several" people with HIV who had committed suicide.    The Health Department's AIDS unit is now setting up a  community charter to tackle the problem of discrimination  against HIV carriers in the workplace.    "Most of those infected are of working age and so there is a  need to actively educate people not to discriminate at work,"  Dr. Lee said.</p>

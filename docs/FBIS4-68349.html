			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Title page, preface, list of authors, table </F> of contents, summary (original text in English), and foreword of  special publication Natsionalnaya doktrina Rossii  (problemy i prioritety) (National Doctrine of Russia  [Problems and Priorities]) by authors' collective led by  Doctor of Historical Sciences and RAEN Academician A. I.  Podberezkin, president of the international nongovernmental  scientific-research organization "RAU-Korporatsiya," Moscow, RAU  Corporation/Obozrevatel Agency]    [Text]  <H5>  [Preface] </H5> <H5>  From the "Most Gruppa" [Bridge Group] Limited Partnership </H5>   Our time is defined as a "transitional period." Everyone  agrees with that. It affects all aspects of the country's life.  It is not possible for one part of society to be restructured,  while others await their hour. Such impulsiveness is harmful for  that society, although the objective nature of the reform  process does presuppose its own leaders and outsiders. But in  all cases, it demands new basic ideas.    From this standpoint, the collective work of the authors of  the National Doctrine of Russia (problems of  formation and priorities) is an interesting attempt, essential  to society, to outline and to a certain degree develop the range  of problems which society must comprehend in order to move  forward. The very science on society also demands development.    The reader will not find a precise and exhaustive formula,  the "National Doctrine of Russia," in the collection. If such a  thing is even possible, it is obviously the fruit of the labor  of more than one authors' collective. The fact that the labor is  collective inevitably entails a difference in the approach to  particular problems.    One may confidently predict that this work will elicit  criticism, controversy, and objections, and not only in  scientific circles.    Nor does the leadership of the "Most Gruppa" Limited  Partnership fully share certain ideas and principles of the  National Doctrine of Russia. Above all, we take issue  with the idea of its economic substantiation. It is distinctly  one-sided in nature. There is no constructive alternative  offered to criticizing the idea and practice of monetarism.  There is no new "model" of socioeconomic progress.    The thesis of the unification of the all-Russian people  clearly needs further development, modification, and  substantiation. Narrow "Russianism," which risks collapsing into  nationalism and chauvinism, and Russophobia are equally alien to  the all-Russian popular mentality. Patriotism combined with an  internationalist attitude toward all the nationalities  inhabiting Russia, which historically, culturally, and  socioeconomically have gravitated toward the nation with the  largest number of people--that appears to be the way to  all-Russian unity. This theme is an important and extremely  delicate one which requires exact and precise points of  emphasis. In this connection, it is clear that the problem of  the Russian-speaking population is growing into anxiety over the  fate of Russian Federation citizens in the states which have  emerged on the territory of the former USSR.    The section "Russia's Military Security and Military Policy"  also elicits some objections. It occupies a disproportionately  large place in the collection, although the topic itself is  undoubtedly very critical. But it turns out that the purely  military component has absorbed the authors to the detriment of  the constructive peace-keeping aspect of military policy.  History proves that it is better not to have enemies than to  fight with them. More specific but also important comments may  be made. Most likely, in speaking of the "population's health"  in contemporary conditions, it is wrong to ignore the system of  insurance medicine which is taking shape. Sufficient attention  has been devoted to the role of the Russian Orthodox Church, but  other religions have been ignored, above all Islam, whose  influence on politics recently has risen substantially.    Nonetheless, despite these and other possible comments and  guided by the motives mentioned above, the "Most Gruppa"  considers the publication presented useful and timely.    Ye.

Neither the authors nor the independent experts who  contributed to this issue, says the preface, make believe that  their materials are exhaustive and complete. We just attempted,  they assert, to find approaches to the solution of the problem.  Some problems are only raised in the text. What is important is  that those who have the power of decision-making could make a  choice out of a wide range of substantiated proposals. We offer  the following strategy of overcoming the crisis in which Russia  finds herself:    To begin with, it is necessary to stop the political  struggle  in its extreme forms. Efforts should be exerted to strengthen  the legality, the public peace and order, and the executive  discipline without which the authorities are helpless. In other  words, it is necessary to strengthen the State.    Secondly, it is necessary to improve the living standards of  Russian citizens and, above all, to increase the social  protection of the poorest and weakest sections of the  population--the old people retired on pension, the children, the  sick, and the disabled.    And, thirdly, it is necessary to uphold the unity, the  economic and political independence, and to restore Russia's  intellectual potential.    They all discuss a series of measures to consolidate the  State and to restore the nation through awareness of its  interests.    Let us recall what ran through all life and activity of our  glorious ancestors, beginning from the great princes of the Kiev  Rus. It was a struggle for the unity of the Russian lands. The  unity always spelled calm, prosperity, and welfare, whereas war  and conflicts always meant grief, bloodshed, and devastation.  This has always been the case, like it is today. We are all  witnessing a terrible phenomenon which is out of our  control--the decline of a great power with all traditionally  resultant consequences.    It is not accidental, therefore, that a central topic of the  report supported by all its chapters is "The Unity of the  Russian State." The foundation of this unity, claim the  independent experts, is civil peace and agreement. No matter  what the situation might be, the State should not be made  dependent on the "victory" of some views or political forces.  Ambitious politicians, even most conspicuous, come and go,  whereas Russia remains. Any political victory will turn into a  defeat if the State is hurt and confrontation in society becomes  rampant.    In this connection, the interests of the State warrant that  the mechanism of independent branches of power--legislative,  executive, and judicial--be brought into play. In other words,  it is vital to create real counterbalances that could guarantee  democratic development within the framework of law. It is also  of utmost importance to lead the country out of the crisis and  to gradually form strong democratic grounds of civil society,  because true democracy can exist only in a society free of the  deadly threat to the State and the nation.    The authors of the report hold that the krays and oblasts of  Russia as subjects of the Federation should be equalized in  rights with the Republics with a possible later transformation  into integrated entities (gubernias, lands). The broader is the  level of local self-government, the stronger will be the real  integration between the subjects of the Federation, including  the "Russian regions." The fuller is the integration, the less  is the opportunity of "self-dismemberment" of the Russian  nation. The rights of national minorities and guarantees of  cultural autonomy should be a part of the Constitution. In these  conditions, runs the report, a clearcut division of competence  between the central and local authorities and the  self-government bodies is very important, because excessive  "sovereignty" may turn the Federation into a weak, poorly  controlled confederation, which, under the presently weakened  government, spells an eventual collapse of the State.    Occasional threats to secede from the Federation run counter  both to the Constitution and the Federative Treaty and,  therefore, contend the experts, have no legal force and should  be resolutely rejected. It is wrong and out of the question to  extend the rights of subjects at the expense of the other  nations' interests and the interests of all peoples of the  Federation who also enjoy this right. The principle of  self-determination defends the interests of all peoples and  curbs nationalist egoism. For this reason, it continues to  underpin the nationalities policy.    The cause of ethnic conflicts is neither democracy nor the  extended rights of the peoples. The authors are inclined to  think that the off-shoots of democracy and the hopes of the  peoples for national restoration have become a hostage of  extremist forces, various political adventurers, and criminal  and corrupted structures. Some nationalist movements, which came  to exist as forces oriented towards preserving and restoring the  original cultures of their peoples and insuring their social,  cultural, and language survival, have slid down to political  radicalism and extremism. They are attempting to secure the  freedom and rights of their own people through infringing on the  freedom and elementary human rights of the neighboring peoples.    The report suggests that the Federal authorities should be  more consistent, constructive, and principled in these matters  because if the nationalities problems, which the extremists play  up and use for their interests, are not solved from "above" in  relatively civilized forms, they will be solved from "below" in  ugly forms. It is high time to summon a special meeting of  Russia's peoples to examine the strategic, political, and legal  aspects of inter-nationalities relations. We should bring back  to life the time-tested values of friendship between all  nationalities to unite them.    The main hotbeds of ethnic conflicts in Russia today are the  territories populated by the peoples severely repressed in the  past (Chechens, Ingushies, Kalmyks, Karachayevs, and  Balkartses). Russia's authorities have long since been seeking  to settle this problem, which dates back to bygone times. With  this aim in view, Russia's Parliament adopted the Law "On the  Rehabilitation of the Repressed Nations." It is a good law and  it has many positive features. But, according to experts, its  provision on "territorial rehabilitation" was a mistake. Many a  decade has passed since certain nationalities were resettled  from their native lands. They were moved over to other regions  of the country. Other nationalities came, or were often driven  under compulsion, to settle down on the vacated territories.  They have lived and worked here since, in the houses they built,  with their families, children, and grandchildren. And now, under  the above Law, they are to leave and move somewhere else.  Specifically, this is the root of the bloodshedding conflict  between the Ossetians and the Ingushies. They are fighting for  the possession of the Prigorodniy district of the Vladikavkaz  city, which used to belong to Ingushetia before the compulsory  resettlement. The struggle is fierce, with no compromises. And  although a moratorium was announced concerning the  above-mentioned article of the Law, it makes no difference now.  Blood has been shed, and both sides are still on the warpath.    The report makes a conclusion that the forcible resettlement  of citizens now inhabiting the lands formerly occupied by the  repressed nationalities is impermissible. Efforts must be made  to define the legal, economic, and social guarantees of their  protection. After the euphoria of adopting the new Constitution,  which is a roadblock to separatism, it is necessary to follow up  with resolute and prompt joint actions in the interests of  people.    The authors of the report are fully aware that neither of  the  former Soviet Republics, including Russia, could become within  such a short span of time a fully independent state capable of  functioning normally without each other.    The effects of the initial period of trying to win  sovereignty, when the Baltic countries and the Ukraine strove,  in fact and above all, for independence from Russia, are still  felt. The said countries sought power and strong statehood on  the basis of anti-Russian sentiments and laws. Paradoxical as it  were, they simultaneously wanted Russia to supply them as  before, on unprofitable for this country terms, with raw and  other materials, completing parts, and especially fuel and  energy. It is but natural that such approaches could not become  constructive and led to a host of problems, tensions, setting up  of frontiers, increasing debts, halted deliveries, and, in the  final analysis, the rupture of economic relations and the  general economic depression in all countries.    Therefore, the experts presume that in supporting the  process  of creating a common economic space, expanding the ruble's zone,  and promoting other re-integrational processes, Russia is  obliged to be aware of its own interests. Russia's support of  the above processes should be steady and insistent, but  extremely delicate and weighted. It must be based on the  following principles: search for common interests rather than  emphasizing differences; respect for own and others' interests;  recognition of the interests of people rather than those of  politicians; and historic responsibility for peace on  one-seventh part of the Earth.    The report also deals comprehensively with problems of  "Civil  Society and the Ways of Its Formation" and "Crimes in Russia and  the Country's Security."    Speculating about Russia's destiny and its national  security,  we cannot avoid touching upon the lot of the Russian people  themselves, who, contend the experts, are in a great jeopardy.  Having defended not only own independence, but also the  independence of other nations united by common historical  development, the Russian people find themselves today in a  difficult situation because a large portion of Russians (25.3  millions) live outside the boundaries of the Russian Federation.    For the first time in the history of Russia, we observe so  vast a breakup of the Russian ethnic space, which is in itself  fraught with potential conflicts. The "Russian problem" is  shaping up before our eyes. It includes the following  components: Russians and the Russian language speaking  population in the "Near Abroad" are being made "second rate"  citizens or citizens without nationality (adoption of laws on  national languages in the former Soviet Republics gave a start  to this process); ousting of the Russians from the newly formed  countries; an inevitable rising of Russian national movements in  these countries; the allying of these movements with the Russian  national (or nationalist) movement in Russia herself; and the  turning of the "Russian problem" into a decisive factor in the  interpolitical struggle in Russia.    In this connection, the report suggests that the Russian  statesmen should pursue the following aims: to introduce  bilingualism in all the new states--the national and the Russian  languages; Russia should actively support the establishment and  consolidation of Russian language communities, including  cultural and national autonomies; the "Near Abroad" countries  should grant double nationalities to all Russian-origin citizens  at their request; financial support should be extended to  Russian culture and education; to energize all Russia's foreign  policy endeavors to support her just demands for observance of  human rights and liberties in the "Near Abroad"; and to  immediately sign agreements with the former Soviet Republics on  issuance of citizenship, protection of the national minorities'  rights, migration, legal aid, pension schemes to retired old-age  people, mutual recognition of university and other academic  diplomas, and establishment of consular offices.    The conduct of a severe policy is recommended in respect of  those countries which defy civil rights, up to applying economic  sanctions.    The chapter on "Problems of the Socioeconomic Situation in  the Country" holds an important place in the report. It stresses  that the 2 years of drastic reforms have resulted in a 40  percent slump in production, a three-fold decrease in the  population's living standards, a 25 percent reduction in labor  pay, and a galloping inflation. By the end of 1993, Russia had  fallen out of the world labor division. Its economy was thrown a  long way back into the past.    Russia's share in world trade has dropped very  significantly.  Its relations with the West can be described as an economic  blockade. World markets are closed to Russia. Credits have been,  in the main, extended to enable poor Russians to buy grain from  the rich Western farmer.    In the last 2 years alone, investments in the Russian  economy  have shrunk more than two-fold, which is a roadblock not only to  economic restructure, but to elementary growth of production as  well.    The refusal of the State to regulate economic and social  processes turned into a total loss of manageability. The world's  experience of state regulation has been completely ignored,  especially the experience of the countries with  socially-oriented market economies. As the result, the vacuum of  state control is increasingly filled, on the one hand, by  expanding narrow-group and regional separatist interests and  elementary plundering of national wealth, and, on the other, by  the real and no less dangerous authoritarian rule. There is no  control over prices and incomes and the distribution and  redistribution of material and financial resources.    Especially important from the point of view of a  multimillion  country's national security is the agrarian economic sector  because the lack of own foodstuffs cannot be replenished in any  manner. Even kneeling for aid before its rich neighbors, such  country cannot escape starvation because no effective aid can be  furnished for 150 million starving people.    Unfortunately, there are grounds for concern in this sphere.  The experts argue that presently the financial, tax, prices,  crediting, and investment policy in the agroindustrial complex  has fully paralyzed the economic activity of agricultural  producers.    To begin with, the larged specialized production, which, in  the main, matched in efficiency the world standards, is falling  to pieces. In animal production, for example, only one-third or  a little more of its powerful capacities are used for lack of  feeds. It will take at least 12-15 years of the hardest work to  recover the losses in animal husbandry.    The state programs for better soil fertility and enlarged  production of farm machinery and implements have been suspended.  Practically all social programs to help the countryside--road  construction, gas and electricity supply, communications and  water supply, housing and cultural and welfare facilities--have  been canceled. From 1991 to 1993, investments in this industry  plummeted seven-fold.    More than 3 million hectares under grain crops remained  unharvested in 1993. Only 70 percent of acreage has been sown to  winter crops for 1994. Sixty-six percent of the needed areas  were plowed in the autumn. About 4 million hectares were  undersown to winter crops for lack of fuel and equipment.    The authors of the report opine that if the state fails to  support agriculture it will not survive. Together with it, all  other economic sectors are going to fall to pieces. The world  experience indicates that in countries with a highly  industrialized agriculture, the latter enjoys state support. The  report contains specific recommendations on this point.    The report also reviews the regional economic policy and a  package of social and financial measures, Russia's foreign debt,  and the ways to handle them.    From a deep study of the situation, the report arrives at  the  following conclusion: there is a progressing tendency to make  the Russian economy dependent on the world market and the  developed nations. Many measures of the Russian Administration  today are, in fact, anti-market, anti-entrepreneurs, and  anti-state.    Now it is clear that the transitional period to the new  economy will take many years. Taking into account this fact, the  Government and the Central Bank should formulate a long-term  economic, crediting, and monetary policy based mainly on state  economic regulation of the economy and the creation of favorable  conditions for entrepreneurs' production activity.    In the present conditions in our country, the high crediting  rates give rise to a quick growth of prices and continued  devaluation of money. According to the experts, the growth of  commodity production may be given a quick push through  decreasing the crediting rates, a speedier turnover of funds,  and mission-oriented crediting of the economy. Consequently,  these measures will enhance the economic effect for the creditor  and the producer and help overcome the inflation.    It is necessary to alter the economic policy and the  strategy  and tactics of the economic reforms, i. e., to give priority to  domestic manufactures, businessmen, agrarians, farmers, and  workers.    The next chapter of the report is entitled "The Creation of  Favorable International Conditions for the Reforms in Russia."    It is clear that the calmer is the international situation  around a country, the more opportunities it has to deal with its  internal problems. The experts presume that Russia's priority  task is to normalize and stabilize her relations with the CIS  nations and to work out a system of coordinating both the common  policies and the specific actions to insure mutual security.  Special attention should be paid to the conflicts underway in  the CIS countries and between them, including armed conflicts.    Russia's long-term security interests call for the  following:  to preserve the general world stability capable of withstanding  local armed conflicts; to maintain normal relations with all  countries, primarily with the European and Asian nations; to  turn these relations into partnership: to strengthen the  peace-making opportunities of the UN and the CSCE; and restore  Russia's prestige as successor of the former Soviet Union, a  power recognized by the world community.    Special attention should be turned to the NATO's changed  policy. The international community could not help being put on  the vigil by the NATO's attempt to dictate its will to other  countries, specifically its ultimatum to the Serbs. For the  first time during its existence, the NATO dared to shoot down  the planes in the no flying zone. A radically new element in the  NATO's latest policy was an extension of the bloc's "zone of  responsibility." The meeting of the NATO Council in Oslo decided  to conduct "peace-making operations" under the aegis of the  CSCE, which means that the NATO can use its troops all over  Eurasia--from Yugoslavia to Tajikistan. Thus, runs the report, a  concept has been developed oriented toward the bloc's  interference in the home affairs of other countries.    The authors of the report opine that the Russian politicians  should firmly oppose the NATO's extension at the expense of its  close neighbors--the CIS nations, the Baltic countries, and the  East European states. Strategically, the NATO's extension could  increase the possibility of the engagement of its troops over a  wide frontline--from the Baltic countries to the Black Sea--and  to the revision of the land and sea limits for hostilities. The  now transparent and friendly frontier could again become, with  the passage of time, an "advanced post." All this can  unprecedentedly restrict Russia's opportunities for insuring her  security.    The fifth and sixth chapters of the report ("Overcoming the  Conflicts and Collective Security" and "Russia's Military  Security and Military Policy," respectively) specify the two  most principled points of security touched upon in the preceding  chapter.    In the presentday conditions, the CIS nations should not be  as careless and nearsighted as to attempt individually to  provide own security. In this connection, the report supports  the Treaty on CIS Nations' Collective Security. The key  provision of the Treaty stipulates that any Signatory subjected  to an aggression shall be extended the necessary assistance,  including military aid. The Signatories agreed to form special  forces to maintain peace in the CIS countries. The principles of  forming and the procedure of functioning of these forces are  formulated in the Protocol on the status of military observers'  groups and the collective peacemaking forces. The principles of  instituting the central defense authority were discussed in 1993  in Ashgabad.    For the time being, these accords are only on paper and  Russia's task is to display maximum political will to make the  Treaty work.    The experts maintain that it is necessary to work out and  adopt, as soon as possible, the major principles of the military  policy of the parties to the collective security system and to  formulate the military doctrine of collective defense, focusing  attention, specifically, on coordination of all CIS nation's  defense efforts.    It is expedient to extend the guarantees of nuclear security  to all CIS countries, to establish within the CIS framework  powerful mobile peacemaking forces, and to coordinate the  mechanism of their employment.    Further on, the report draws attention of the Russian policy  makers to the obvious fact that military security is a part of  the common problem of insuring national security, which, in  turn, is interrelated with the problem of regional and global  security. Of course, the contemporary civilized world recognizes  that war cannot be used as a political instrument and that the  use or the threat to use military force for achieving political,  economic, or other aims should be ruled out.    However, it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that many  countries possess strong armed forces and the systems of their  basing near the Russian borders. Many American military bases,  which were created during the "cold war" period to exert  pressure on the USSR, are still functioning. Some reduction of  the armed forces by several large powers (the United States and  other NATO countries) is being compensated by the introduction  of new, more effective types of armaments.    Improvement of nuclear weaponry and other means of mass  destruction continues. Neither should we let out of sight the  lessons of history which teach us that the military and  technical superiority over a potential enemy were frequently  used to attack it.    Security, runs the report, cannot be considered achieved,  unless it is guaranteed and reliable.    The report clearly defines the defensive nature of our  military doctrine. The main tasks of Russia's military policy,  it points out, are to prevent war and preserve peace, and to  insure national, regional, and international security. Military  force can be resorted to for the sake of defending state  interests when diplomacy proves inadequate and ineffective. In  case a war is imposed on us, we must be ready to beat back the  aggression, to defeat the enemy, and to create the conditions  for a quick termination of the war.    The development of nuclear arms should serve to consolidate  the strategic stability through containing the enemy's plans to  use them. It is vitally necessary that Russia keeps its status  of a nuclear power over the foreseeable future. Apart from the  strategic defense tasks, this enables Russia to provide nuclear  guarantees to the former Soviet Republics as an element of the  agreement between them on military matters.    History teaches us that it is the people's strong spirit and  morale that helped our country to emerge victorious from great  difficulties and terrible troubles. Lack of high morals is the  first sign of a dying civilization. This is the main idea dealt  with in the chapter "The Formation of the People's Spiritual and  Moral Values."    The formation of the nation's spiritual and moral values,  runs the chapter, is the cornerstone of restoring the great  power. The national security doctrine must be based on a  national idea which, in turn, is the major condition for all  reforms.    Today, the public begins to understand that the economy as  such is only a means of society's development rather than the  aim, that it is a built-in part of a unique system of public  relations, cultural and intellectual life. And it is this system  that should be discussed in the first place.    The authors assume that Russia's self-consciousness, which  is  coming to life again, tends to restore its historical continuity  in all parameters. The period of unpunished Russophobia is a  bygone time. Hence, the struggle of various political forces for  personifying most precisely and truly the expression of the  "Russian idea" will be a major element in the struggle for power  in Russia. And this struggle has already commenced.    The chapter draws attention to the fact that there are quite  a few people who announce that this is "the end of Russia."  These are Smerdyakovs in a democratic wrapping. This country,  they say, "is unfit for human living." It is clear that the  people who have built a great power, who defeated the fascist  hordes in the last world war, and who produced world famous  thinkers, writers, musicians, and painters, cannot be defective  and inferior. It is clear that these "conspicuous," "famous,"  and "prominent" personalities are lying, and with a purpose in  mind. The transition to market relations makes everything,  including interpretations of history, a commodity. The law of  demand and supply govern the respective relations. The demand is  determined by the requirements of the economically and  politically strong powers of the world. Meanwhile, the  historical truth is necessary to all--the communists and the  liberals, the rightists and the leftists, the conservatives and  the progressive-minded people, provided they are seeking to  restore Russia's good name and standing. The past, even its most  tragic events, should be overcome and not rejected or betrayed.  Otherwise, the country becomes a hostage of its past.    The work underlines that the country's moral and  intellectual  potential depends on the development of its culture, science,  and education. Unfortunately, the existing situation in science,  according to Russia's leading scholars, is catastrophic. The  State's refusal to fund this sphere has led to such a "threshold  of lagging behind," which makes problematic real research  activity within the framework of the world's scientific system,  or even impossible in many fields.    The independent experts recommend that the Russian  Government  finance from the state budget in 1994 at the level of at least  2.3-2.5 percent of the country's GNP and increase the funding in  the next several years to avoid immigration of scientists abroad  and to make them interested in working in their native country  as effectively as they can.    The utilitarianism which is now prevalent in society, claim  the authors, has considerably dehumanized culture and destroyed  many cultural values, offering practically nothing as  substitute. We have substantially violated or lost the  traditions which underpinned the spirit and morals of the  preceding generations. The ability to reproduce the culture of  the people has lessened. Time is disjointed in the minds of the  young generation. They are not sensitive to the integrity of the  world which is a sine qua non condition for the reproduction and  development of culture. In this context the uppermost task is to  restore the continuity of generations, to implant in the young  people's minds the historical roots stretching from the past of  their people and all mankind to the present time and serving as  a connecting link between them. Unfortunately, the prestige of  high morals, intellectuality, education, and upbringing has  fallen in our country to the lowest mark in the history of the  20th century. Culture should hold a special place in this  process.    The cultures of the peoples of Russia, argues the report,  are  called upon to consolidate cultural unity and integrity because  Russia's multinational culture as such is a historically formed  integrity, a united culture.    The Russian Orthodox Church could serve as a spiritual  support in Russia, hold the authors. The Russian Orthodox Church  has a vast historical experience of uniting the peoples and  cooperating with other religious confessions in Russia.    The final chapter, "Russia Before the Elections" [correctly,  "Russia Faces a Choice"--translator], reasons out that the  central problem in 1994 will be to restore the authority of the  state power in Russia and to establish an effective mechanism of  enforcing the laws and controlling the fulfillment of adopted  decisions. The chapter offers a series of forecasts of Russia's  possible economic growth and the political situation in the  current year.    [end of English Summary]  <H5>  [Foreword] </H5> <H5>  To the Reader </H5>   In 1993, in a special issue of the information-analysis  weekly OBOZREVATEL-OBSERVER entitled "National Security: Russia  in 1994," the experts of the RAU-Corporation centers and the  authors of the journal proposed their variant of a solution to  the crisis. The report was intended for persons formulating and  making political decisions or actively participating in their  preparation. Above all for deputies of the Federal Assembly of  Russia. We received a multitude of responses and requests to  cover this topic more extensively and present it in a more  deeply political-philosophical perspective. That is why readers  are now offered a broader variant which may be the platform for  debate on the National Doctrine of Russia.    Today as never before, we need a critical analysis of the  path which has been taken, a clear objective of society's  continued development, and pursuit of the most efficient ways to  achieve that objective. A great world power now stands at a  historical crossroads: there is no way back, but the choice of a  new path is yet to be made. In a very short interval of time,  the country has moved from one historical period to another:     -  the state structure, institutions of power, and  the attributes of that power have changed radically;    -  in Russia the former political system, the basis of  which was the CPSU's monopoly on power and ideology, is  finished;    -  the ratio of forms of ownership in the RF [Russian  Federation] and the entire system of social  interrelations are changing rapidly;    -  interethnic contradictions within Russia and  problems with the former republics of the USSR which are now  sovereign states are increasing;    -  the status of our great power in the world community  and its interrelations with foreign states have fundamentally  changed;    -  the nation's spiritual potential, the basis on which the  power  of the Nation and the State have rested since earliest times,  has been weakened.       All these changes have fundamentally altered the situation  in  Europe and Asia and the entire geopolitical map of the world and  created a serious crisis which has affected not only the  republics of the former USSR, but a large number of other  countries of the world, which to one degree or another has had  an effect on all aspects of the life of humankind.    It is important to emphasize two fundamental features of  these changes which have led to an extremely serious crisis in  Russia.    First, objectively crisis phenomena are  characteristic of any "transitional period" and reforms of this  scope. Consequently, it is essential not so much to seek  subjective errors or even catastrophic miscalculations of  particular politicians and parties--history will evaluate  them--as to try to find the patterns and particular  features of this "transitional period" in order to use the  analysis of them as a basis to propose the right solutions.    Secondly, the crisis period must not be  chronologically restricted to any narrow framework: the  "Gorbachev period," the "Yeltsin period," and so on. The sources  of the crisis are much deeper, and each of the stages was only a  continuation of the chain of errors of the previous ones.    It is essential to clearly define present and future  Russian national interests which satisfy both the  interests of individual citizens on the whole and of the entire  human race. Among them those upon which our state's very  existence depends must be singled out and possible measures to  realize them must be proposed.    We think that the two top priority ideas in the  National Doctrine of Russia--the greatness of  Russia (the state) and the greatness of the  Nation (the national and the social aspects)-- must be  clearly and concretely defined in the political programs both of  the president and the Government, and of the parties, public  organizations, and other influential political forces. As soon  as that happens in practice, this will signify the  Authorities' actual choice in favor of  national-patriotic development (and in favor of the class of  owners and advocates of a socialist orientation forming on a  national basis) and rejection of a dependent "comprador"  [national servant of foreign companies] path of development.    In our opinion, the most important thing today is  to prevent the Russian State from becoming weaker and  collapsing. This is impossible using only traditional  administrative-state or financial methods: that is not enough  for Russia. We should revive the Russian idea and  form a foundation of unity--a national doctrine which  represents views recognized by most nations on the objectives  and tasks of development of the society, the Nation, and the  State, the character of the state order, and the direction and  methods of the state order's development. In light of that,  the national doctrine is based on the economic potential which  has taken shape and the existing system of interstate relations  and is formed and realized in the system of interstate relations  which has taken shape.    In the most critical periods of our Fatherland's history,  the  mighty reserves of the Russian people's spiritual power saved  the nation. The Russian idea plays a most important role here.  It is based on the concept of conciliarism [sobornost] as  uniting people for the sake of reviving the Orthodox faith and  the prosperity of the Fatherland. The Russian people's devotion  to the idea of statehood is historically established.  Only state power is capable of keeping the anarchic pursuit of  the truth on an evolutionary course.    Yet another crucial feature of the Russian idea is the  openness of the Russian national character to all peoples, that  is to say, tolerance of and receptivity to other beliefs and  traditions and amiability toward neighboring peoples. These are  precisely the qualities always used by people who would like to  dissolve universal love for one's neighbor into abstract "common  human values."    It has long since been time on the state level to  announce the need to restore great power status. Because of  its unique geopolitical position, Russia has the opportunity to  take a worthy place in the community of the 21st century and  become a truly highly developed world power. Russia's  geopolitical uniqueness is that it is not Europe and it is not  Asia. Russia is Eurasia. It is precisely by virtue of its  geopolitical position, history, particular features of spiritual  development, and many other factors that Russia appears as a  unique phenomenon in the development of all  humankind. Consequently, disputes over what country Russia  should focus on in its development are meaningless.    We have always been proud of our Russia, its past, its  ancestors, and its Legacy. People have tried to take  this pride in the Fatherland away from us, but the Nation did  not allow this to happen. The stormy process of restoring  national self-consciousness has begun. One of the mistakes of  our Government, the president, and his circle is that they  seldom talk about this with the people. The Nation must  restore its dignity, see historical perspectives clearly, and  feel confidence in tomorrow and its own strengths.    We must not allow extremism to triumph in Russia again. So  it  is essential that the idea of great power status is the  state ideology and political practice, and  ultimately--state policy. All citizens, state  institutions, and branches of power must give all-out support to  the idea of great power status, which must become the Nation's  dominant ideology.    The Federal Assembly began work in a critical and dramatic  period of Russia's history. The future of Russia largely depends  on the decisions the legislative and executive organs of power  make. Whether we continue to sink into crisis or begin to  recover slowly and with difficulty is the dilemma.    Let us recall that the year 1992 entered Russia's history as  a year where the mortality rate exceeded the birth rate for the  first time in peacetime. During the last 5 years, 25 million  fewer people were born in Russia than in the previous 5-year  period, and the nation's capacity for self-reproduction has  already been called into question. Even according to official  statistics, Russia's population in just the first 9 months of  1993 declined by 522,600 people.    Natural Movement of Population in Russia During the First 9 Months of 1993  and 1992 (According to Goskomstat [State Statistics Committee] Data)   Category         Number of people, in            Converted to Number per                   thousands                       1,000 in Population   1993             1992            1993            1992   Number of        1,063.4         1,240.4         9.6            11.1  People Born   Number of        1,586.0         1,323.6         14.3           11.9  People Who  Died   Natural          -522.6          -83.2           -4.7           -0.8  Increase      Today more people in the country die "random deaths"--from  accidents, mishaps, and the like--than die from cardiac and  oncological diseases taken together. The Nation is on the  threshold of degradation. This sad outcome is the result  above all of negative socioeconomic factors. That is the price  paid for the wrong path of development chosen. The country finds  itself without state borders, with an undetermined  social-economic order, and with a Constitution adopted by a  minority of the population.    What direction will future historical development take?  Where  is Russia's optimal path of development which best fits its  national interests and the interests of development of all  humankind?    In recent years, certain at times "Western" and at times, on  the contrary, "Eastern" models of development have been  aggressively thrust on society. But Russia cannot follow either  one of these paths which are acceptable for other civilizations  and peoples. Thus, for example, one representative of Western  society (the average statistical Western European or North  American) at the present time accounts for 50-70 times more  resources than one average statistical South American or  African. We must simply learn the obvious truth: Western  society lives at the expense of other countries.    No, we must seek a path of development based on using our  own  wealth and resources--which we have more of, incidentally, than  any other nation, but which are used extremely inefficiently.    Before beginning treatment, we must make an accurate  diagnosis, that is to say, we must soberly and impartially  assess the condition which the country is in. We must understand  the reasons for past tragic events. We must abandon the habit of  making the analysis and assessment of what is happening match  the objectives of particular political parties, ideas, and  leaders. We must make the interests of the country and the  people as a whole paramount. We must also abandon  reformer-neodogmatism, which is already becoming an obstacle to  development and progress.    On this basis we can start the path to accord among the  various political forces. It is impossible to formulate the  right policy and combine efforts to fulfill a joint program for  getting out of the crisis when we are divided.    The main barriers on this path are the distribution of  power,  the redistribution of ownership, and political and personal  ambitions. After rejecting them, we must make a search for a  strategy and tactics of cooperation in conditions of political  and socioeconomic crisis.    The authors' collective, independently of the experts, in no  way claims that the material presented is exhaustive and  complete. It is important that those who have the right to make  decisions have the opportunity to choose from a broad  range of substantiated proposals.    Today, unfortunately, there are frequent cases where wrong,  mistaken decisions are not only proposed but even made, and then  the state and society suffer from them. In order to avoid that,  it is important to use all possible ways to encourage  independent experts to develop different drafts and variants of  political decisions, and subsequently to discuss them  extensively.    Such an approach is especially important in working out  complex problems of the state's security and development  strategy, since up to now many important issues have been  researched and decided in practical isolation from each other,  which has done and continues to do enormous harm. For example,  the seemingly correct decision to reach weapons parity with the  NATO countries resulted in a severe weakening of our economic  security. The pursuit of gross indicators and the lack of a  systematic competent notion of the living environment created  ecological disasters involving serious violations of the  biosphere as a result of human activity (Chernobyl, territories  of the Far North, and many industrial regions).    Or take the latest examples. While truly striving toward  conversion, the country's leadership has in fact destroyed the  military-industrial complex, and we have ceded world weapons  markets to Western countries and now are incurring enormous  losses.    Curbing inflation is the task of any government. But the  anti-inflation measures adopted by the "reformers" resulted in a  paralyzed economy, strikes, enterprises shut down, a disastrous  drop in production, and... higher inflation.    All this was undertaken, it would seem, for the sake of the  supreme interests of the country overall, although the effect  was a negative one, not to mention the enormous amount of  material means spent irrationally.    In formulating the National Doctrine, after  defining priorities it is wise to formulate a program of  reforms in the interests of all society rather than in the  interests of particular groups. Obviously, such a program will  be nationwide in character. It must be  comprehensible, realistic, and pragmatic and free of any  ideological extremes. Citizens have the right, or are even  obliged to know what the next "shining" future being offered to  them is like, how reforms will be conducted, and how much time  they will take. Citizens have the full right not only to ask  about this, but also to disagree completely with the program  proposed and ultimately, to demand a report on the Government's  activity.    The great Russian philosopher Vl. Solovyev stresses: "Both  human individuals and entire nations face the task of  counterbalancing each other without losing their original  uniqueness, but on the contrary, manifesting it most fully.  Genuine unity of peoples is not uniformity but universality,  that is to say, the cooperation and solidarity of all people for  the self-sufficient and full life of everyone."    These are truly sacred words calling for unity. All the  things that have happened in the last few years sometimes remind  one of a hasty retreat by troops leaving behind 25 million  "prisoners," Russian and Russian-speaking compatriots who  suddenly find themselves in a foreign land now called the near  abroad, cast to the winds of fate. But even those who are now  living in Russia are experiencing if not moral-political at  least socioeconomic oppression. They include tens of  millions of formally and de facto unemployed people; and  they include tens of millions of pensioners,  students, and disabled persons.    Now underway is the collapse of the Russian  ethnos, or rather its violent breakup, and the  formation in the former Union and autonomous republics of  Russian national minorities which in certain cases reach or  approach 50 percent of the population, which in itself is  fraught with disastrous conflicts. Attempts to concentrate in  Russian communities millions of people who find themselves  refugees in their own country or hostages of ambitious  politicians are having virtually the same result. Abandoned  homes and hearths, migration of work force fatal to the national  economies, and the misfortunes and death of people. Years of  work by tens of millions of people are being nullified by the  redistribution of ethnic areas.    Russian people regardless of where they live, if they  preserve their national self-consciousness, are a powerful  driving force for the rebirth of Russia. The state strategy  of the Russian great power must rely on the historical and  spiritual legacy of its people. Because Russia will never be  reborn if the disposition and national self-consciousness  inherent in our people are not reconstructed.    The path to national accord must be sought on the platform  of  respect for the individual and the right of each citizen,  regardless of party, religious, or national affiliation, to  tolerance and harsh treatment of all attempts to  destabilize the situation in the country and once again to  try to break up the State. It is remarkable that in recent  months positive trends focused on achieving national  accord and strengthening the Russian State are beginning to  show in the policies of the president, the Government, the  Federal Assembly, and most political forces. But potent  destructive forces which are in the structures of power and in  the opposition oppose these weak shoots. Thus, today the  watershed lies not so much between the president and the  Government, on the one hand, and the opposition, on the other,  as within these camps: between the forces of creation and  the forces of destruction.    Today a Government able to find a way out of the crisis is  needed. Only a program which is oriented to the needs of most of  the population in the spiritual and material spheres will enjoy  the support of the people. And only then can consolidation of  all progressive forces interested in Russia's rebirth be  achieved.    How do we propose to begin?    FIRST, immediately abandon the extremes of the  political struggle and strengthen legality, law and order,  and elementary performance discipline, without which any power  is doomed to impotence, that is to say, strengthen the  State. Any weakening of one of its branches signifies a  weakening of power and the state as a whole. The  mutual reinforcement of the representative, executive, and  judicial branches of power would be wiser.    SECONDLY, undertake a series of measures to improve the  living conditions of citizens of the Russian Federation,  above all the least protected ones, pensioners, children, the  sick, and disabled persons.    THIRDLY, defend unity and economic and political  independence.    FOURTHLY, restore Russia's spiritual potential.    The most important condition for achieving these objectives  is the rebirth of the nation's dignity and spiritual potential,  which in the most tumultuous years of hardship saved Russia,  encouraged consolidation, and helped overcome the most serious  crisis. That is the most important prerequisite of  political, economic, and social Progress. Without a  National Idea, in Russia's conditions it is  impossible to achieve a significant result either in  politics, in economics, or in implementation of the reforms. The  shaping of the National Doctrine has already begun  and should continue at an extremely fast rate. Only then is a  realistic success in the particular area of the reforms possible.    The first attempt at a comprehensive view of the  National Doctrine of Russia is attached for your  attention. Naturally, the authors in no way claim their views  are absolutely correct. Moreover, there is by no means full  unanimity among them. We invite opponents to a well-supported  debate in the interests of the Nation.    With respect to readers and opponents,    Head of the authors' collective and president of the  international nongovernmental scientific research organization  "RAU-Korporatsiya," Doctor of Historical Sciences and RAEN  [Russian Academy of Economic Sciences] Academician A.

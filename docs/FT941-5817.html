			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Excess gives way to restraint: David Marsh assesses the quiet revolution at the EBRD as its new president seeks to build confidence Just before Christmas, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, received a top-level visitor. Lord Lawson, former UK chancellor of the exchequer, now chairman of the Central Europe Trust consulting firm, dropped into the bank's London headquarters to offer some hints on channelling resources to eastern Europe. 'It's not that usual in my experience for an international civil servant to seek out the view of the private sector,' says Mr Tom Lampl, one of the firm's managing directors, who accompanied Lord Lawson on his visit. 'Normally they have their heads in the clouds playing politics. But he (de Larosiere) has his ear to the ground. He really wants to find things out.' Mr de Larosiere's keenness to listen illustrates just one way the public-sector bank has changed since his predecessor, Mr Jacques Attali, resigned last year at the height of a crisis caused by mismanagement and budgetary extravagance. A former governor of the Bank of France and managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr de Larosiere has been carrying out a quiet revolution since he took over at the end of September. He quickly concluded that the bank, established in 1991 with Ecu10bn capital to provide loans and equity to the former communist bloc, had become too cumbersome and disorganised to carry out its mandate. Mr de Larosiere has been squaring up to two principal tasks. First, he has had to win the support of the bank's 56 mainly government shareholders for measures to cut costs and increase efficiency. An important stage in the process was reached yesterday at the EBRD budget committee, which discussed Mr de Larosiere's proposal to maintain the bank's personnel and administrative spending for 1994 unchanged from 1993 at Pounds 116m. The EBRD board is expected to approve the budget plan in three weeks. Underlining the bank's problems in controlling expenses, the budget last year rose by roughly 50 per cent compared with the start-up phase in 1992. Second, he has been trying to improve long-term confidence that the bank can fulfil its aim of developing the nascent private sector in eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union. Doubts whether the EBRD can meet this objective reflect the general deterioration of the political and economic environment in the east during the past two years, as well as the damage to its reputation caused by the Attali affair. The EBRD's management crisis has focused attention on a fundamental contradiction in the bank's operations. It was established to provide additional resources to the former Soviet bloc. But it has to meet standards of extreme prudence in its investment policies - one of the reasons why it has been frequently criticised for cumbersome administrative procedures. The EBRD lends under fully commercial terms - charging higher interest rates, for instance, than the European Investment Bank, the EU's long-term lending institution, which competes with the EBRD in some areas of eastern Europe. By the end of 1993, the EBRD had committed a cumulative Ecu2.8bn (Pounds 2.1bn) and disbursed Ecu556m in 2 1/2 years of operations - much less than originally planned. About 57 per cent of the bank's loans and equity investments have been channelled to the private sector and 43 per cent to the public sector, compared with the 60/40 split called for in its statutes. By contrast, the EIB, which is a shareholder in the EBRD, has so far committed Ecu1.7bn to eastern Europe, of which about half has been disbursed. In view of the EIB's limited engagement in eastern Europe compared with its overall lending, the EIB has, according to some critics of the EBRD, been much more effective in channelling resources to the former communist countries. Under the leadership of Mr Attali, who as special adviser to French President Francois Mitterrand was the main inspiration behind the EBRD's foundation, the bank suffered from an acute imbalance between aspiration and reality. Mr Attali's relationship with the bank's 23-member, London-based board was frequently adversarial. One EBRD insider says bluntly that Mr Attali was not trusted by big shareholder governments. A former EBRD director contrasts Mr de Larosiere's sober and professional style with the 'oppressive and domineering' manner with which Mr Attali used to handle board meetings. He says of the former president: 'He felt it was his bank. He felt it was his property - his child, he called it. I don't think he ever came to terms with the fact that it was owned by governments and the directors were representatives of its owners.' To put the bank's operations on to a more realistic footing, Mr de Larosiere has set a target for new commitments of Ecu1.8bn this year, the same as last year's actual total and much lower than the Ecu2bn to Ecu2.6bn originally budgeted by Mr Attali for 1993. The bank has embarked on several new programmes, including ambitious plans to provide venture capital and loans for small businesses in Russia. However, since the EBRD's lending in coming years will remain below earlier expectations, it will continue to run the risk of looking top-heavy. The bank now employs about 700 staff, since Mr Attali's original plans for 800 employees by the end of last year were never realised. One of Mr de Larosiere's first actions was to freeze creation of new posts. About 35 employees have left the bank since he arrived, and a large number of employees has been redeployed. The number of operational banking professionals has been increased by 25 per cent to 250 people. Mr Mario Sarcinelli - currently third in command at the bank under Mr de Larosiere and Mr Ron Freeman, the senior vice-president - will leave next month after his appointment as the next head of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian public sector bank. However, so far Mr de Larosiere has brought in only two new people at a senior level. They are his principal aide, Mr Philippe Richard, who came with him from the Bank of France, and Mr Claude Peyrot, a temporary management consultant - known by some at the EBRD as 'the secret weapon' - who has also previously worked at the French central bank. To gear the EBRD's activities more closely to the varying needs of the 25 diverse countries in which it operates, the president decided in November to merge the merchant and development banking departments, which previously handled private and public-sector business separately. Mr de Larosiere is convinced that the bank previously failed to put sufficient emphasis on identifying profitable private-sector deals in its countries of operation. He was surprised to find that only 20 EBRD staff spoke Russian. One director reports 'strained nerves' as a result of Mr de Larosiere's insistence two months ago that five staff members move to Russia on secondment with local banks, as part of his efforts to decentralise operations. Mr de Larosiere wants to increase by 20 the bank's staff (both expatriates and local employees) in its 11 offices outside London - a 50 per cent increase from the present tally of 40. He also wants to improve the bank's effectiveness by increasing the number of investment instruments at its disposal. Proposals under review include the ideas of taking more stakes in local banks and investment funds in its countries of operation, and providing guarantees to back private-sector loans for certain projects. One problem, however, is that the EBRD's deals have become both smaller and more time-consuming as it tries to shift towards private-sector business. Although the bank aims to multiply the effects of its investment through co-financing with other banks, it normally has to shoulder by itself the time and expense of credit analysis. 'These are mainly borrowers without credit history,' says one EBRD executive. 'In practically every case we are starting from scratch.' Roughly 20 per cent of the time of its 250 mainstream bankers is spent monitoring credit risks. Already there are signs of an increased need for write-offs on some investments, such as the alleged over-valuation of the EBRD's 20 per cent stake in the Czech national airline. Even though the bank's problems are by no means over, its main shareholders voice relief at the switch of presidency. Mr Lee Jackson, the deputy US director at the bank, says: 'He (Mr de Larosiere) has brought a greater degree of focus. My government and I are very supportive of what he is doing.' Mr Gunter Winkelmann, Germany's director at the EBRD, says: 'There has been a dramatic improvement.' Mr Attali stated in a recent book* that he was toppled by a revolt against his own proposals last summer to restructure the bank and make it more efficient. Mr Winkelmann, however, refutes this claim. 'That is not true . . . In the end, he (Mr Attali) was not accepted by the board, not accepted by the staff. It is this that brought him down.' Mr Tomas Parizek, director for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, says Mr de Larosiere's decentralisation plans are 'in the right direction'. He emphasises that the bank should not simply put more bankers in the field, but should also find ways of increasing its effectiveness by injecting equity into banks and investment funds in its countries of operation. On the ground in eastern Europe, the staff in the EBRD's present network of offices win few plaudits. One international investment banker in Budapest says he has met the EBRD's local staff only at parties and receptions. 'These people are the worst kind of diplomats you can imagine,' he says. 'The best that they can do is set appointments.' Senior bankers in Poland say they deal with the EBRD's London headquarters rather than its Warsaw office when they want to do business. The World Bank's local office has much more of an operational function. In Prague - where the EBRD is generally held to have played only a minor role in economic restructuring - there is support for a stronger EBRD presence. 'Decentralisation is a good thing, and the bank should be more willing to listen,' says a senior fund manager in the Czech Republic. For all the criticism to which it is accustomed, there are signs that the EBRD can find a useful role in areas where commercial banks are reluctant to lend. In association with a Russian state-owned oil enterprise, US oil company Conoco last year borrowed Dollars 90m from the EBRD for a Dollars 350m oil project. Mr Mike Espinosa, Conoco's assistant treasurer, says he is 'absolutely ecstatic' over the EBRD's track record, and contrasts its willingness to lend money to Russia with the excessive prudence shown by commercial banks. Similarly, Mr Wayne Murdy, chief financial officer at Newmont Mining, the US-based gold company, says he is 'very complimentary' about the EBRD's work on a Dollars 105m loan for a joint-venture gold mine in Uzbekistan. 'We couldn't have got a commercial bank to take on a commitment in Uzbekistan without them.' Despite accolades like this, many would agree with the assessment of Mr Wolfgang Roth, the EIB's director responsible for eastern Europe, that the EBRD is 'not basically necessary'. An alternative three years ago, Mr Roth says, would have been to establish a joint subsidiary of the EIB and the World Bank. 'But now we have it, we must make the best of it.' After Mr de Larosiere's initial moves to curb the bank's structural defects, the EBRD has regained the support of its shareholder governments. His hardest task, however, still lies ahead: to show during the next few years that the EBRD can make a real contribution to the development of functioning capitalist economies in the former communist bloc. In the meantime, the EBRD will remain highly vulnerable to political and economic setbacks in the countries it was set up to serve.

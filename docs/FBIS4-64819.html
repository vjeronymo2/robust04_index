			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 7 (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel on  Saturday [7 May] said the discussions on the extension of the  duty of Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures are totally absolutely  unnecessary, untimely and inappropriate when there are still  four months until Gures's time of duty is up.    In a written statement, Demirel said that when the time  comes, necessary procedures will be done following the  government's proposition and in line with the Constitution and  the laws.    "However," he said, "that will be a posting and not an  approval. The power of accepting the government's proposal  belongs to the president."    Demirel said in the statement that the Turkish Republic is a  constitutional and legislative state, where everyone's duty and  authority is determined by the Constitution and the laws.    "The chief of staff's appointment and the procedure when his  duty ends, are all determined by the Constitution and the laws,"  he said, adding that clauses number 117 and 104 give the power  to appoint the chief of staff to the president.    "The presidency represents the high commander at the Turkish  Armed Forces [TAF] in the name of the Grand National Assembly,"  he said, adding these speculations can hurt the TAF, and they  should be stopped.    "I would like all to know that when the time comes,  everything necessary will be done in line with the Constitution  and the laws," he concluded.    A scandal broke out in the society this week when a man  listened to a three-way telephone conversation between Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller and two cabinet members. The  conversation, recorded because one of the ministers was talking  from the telephone in his car, was issued in one of the dailies.  In the conversation, Ciller was asking her ministers to make  necessary arrangements to extend the duty of Chief of Staff  General Gures for another year.    On Friday, a written statement published by the Prime  Minister's Office said that the polemics concerning the issue  have been continuing in certain circles and the press, adding  the power for duty extension of the chief of staff, General  Dogan Gures, belongs totally to the political authority.    Earlier the same day, President Suleyman Demirel said that  he  was the one who will say the last say on the extension of the  duty of General Gures.</p>

"The great leader in his New Year address elaborated on the  sincere efforts made by our party and the government of the  Republic to pave the way for national reunification by the  united strength of the nation last year and reiterated the  principled stand of our party on the reunification of the  country," Pak says, and continues:    "In the New Year address the great leader stressed that the  principle and the line of our party and the government of the  Republic on national reunification remain unchanged, declaring  that we will make every effort in the future, too, to reunify  the country by a confederacy formula based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles  of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.    "This principled stand clarified by the great leader clearly  manifests the unshakable will of our party and the government of  our Republic to bring an early realisation of the independent  and peaceful reunification of the country in compliance with the  desire and will of the whole nation in disregard of the change  of the situation.    "Our party and the government of our Republic will make  maximum efforts to accomplish the cause of national  reunification in the 90s under the banner of the 10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by  the great leader."    Pak earnestly calls upon the 70 million fellow countrymen in  the North, South and overseas to courageously turn out in a  nationwide struggle for reunifying the country by the  confederacy formula, united as one under the banner of the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation in  hearty response to the policy of national reunification laid  down by the great leader in the New Year address.    He expresses the expectation that the world progressives  will  extend full support to the Korean people in their struggle for  the reunification of the country.</p>

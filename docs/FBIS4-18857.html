			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens (DPA) -- In order to stimulate the economy,  the European Union [EU] will participate in financing two  express train tracks in Germany. During a meeting in Athens on  Friday [8 April] the EU finance ministers basically agreed on 10  large-scale projects in the field of trans-European traffic  networks, telecommunications, and energy, which are to be pushed  ahead as a priority. However, according to FRG Finance Minister  Theo Waigel, the financing of the project must not be achieved  via loans.    Waigel said in Athens that two German projects were included  on the list, which can be implemented quickly. Thus, ICE  [Intercity Express] high-speed tracks from west to east and from  south to north are to be expanded. According to available  information, these are the lines from France via Strasbourg,  Karlsruhe, and Frankfurt to Berlin and the south-north axis from  Milan via the Brenner Pass to Munich, Nuremberg, Halle, and  Berlin to Warsaw.    Brussels' exact share in the construction projects, which  involve billions, are yet to be determined at future ministers'  meetings. However, the financing of investments in the networks  must not be achieved via loans, Waigel said. "Financing via  loans raised by the commission is out of the question," the  minister said. No new debts must be incurred.    According to Waigel, Germany, France, and Great Britain  reject the idea that the commission can get money on the capital  markets via so-called Euro Funds. The minister added: "It is  the clear line of most countries: no new instruments." Existing  EU budget means, as well as those in the form of guarantees and  loans of the European Investment Bank must be sufficient.    In order to overcome the economic crisis in the EU the  Commission had presented a strategy paper (white paper) to the  partners and there also suggested the expansion of the networks.  As a result, the EU states decided to allocate ECU5 billion  from the EU budget and ECU7 billion in the form of leans from  the European Investment Bank every year for the next six years  for this purpose. The finance ministers should clarify how the  additionally necessary means of ECU8 billion can be raised.    Waigel warned that a policy to safeguard growth and  employment must not concentrate solely on infrastructure  measures. It is urgently necessary to improve the prospects for  growth in Europe and reduce the burdens on the companies created  by excessive regulations. In addition, wage policy must  contribute to safeguarding employment.</p>

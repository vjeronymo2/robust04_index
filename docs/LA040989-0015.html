			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV'S BLOOD MONEY?  </P> <P> For a long time I viewed murder on film as a morbid oddity at which you might  sneak a look under a sideshow tent. That was until it took someone close to me.  </P> <P> Let me assure anyone who's slightly curious that there's nothing remotely  glamorous or fascinating about an experience that's so completely cold and  devastating as homicide.  </P> <P> It bothers me that the American public is so preoccupied with murder. But  what's more unsettling are the producers who feign sympathy about "those  dreadful days we all shared" as they take their blood money to the bank  ("Murder Most Glamorized," by Peter H. Brown, April 2). Thanks to Peter Brown  for exposing this network of exploitative sensationalism.  </P> <P> GREGORY BURNS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

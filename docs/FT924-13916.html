			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Perot flies high after debate as Bush comes out loser PRESIDENT George Bush's uphill struggle to be re-elected looked even tougher yesterday as he was widely judged to have given the poorest performance in the first televised US presidential debate on Sunday night. Three of four overnight polls proclaimed Mr Ross Perot, the independent, as the 'winner,' followed by Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, who was reckoned to have done best in the fourth poll. Mr Bush trailed badly in all of them. But Mr Perot's typically rambunctious and humorous act did not appear to make him a more credible threat to his opponents. Translated into voting preferences, two surveys found him rising to the 12-14 per cent range, with Mr Clinton gaining a point or two to 46-47 per cent and Mr Bush losing between 3 and 6 points to 31-35 per cent. Apart from the mini-movement towards Mr Perot, probably a greater threat to Mr Bush than to Mr Clinton, most respondents said their minds had not been changed by the debate. With three weeks to go to election day this must delight the Democrats and distress the Republicans. The debate was seen as crucial for Mr Bush to turn the tide. His spin doctors said he had done well, but he elicited no measurable mistake from Mr Clinton during the mannerly evening. In the sharpest exchange between the two, Mr Clinton invoked Mr Bush's father, the late Senator Prescott Bush, as a fighter against the McCarthyite tactics which, he claimed, Mr Bush was using over his role in organising demonstrations in London against the Vietnam war 23 years ago. Mr Bush was not helped by the fact that most of Mr Perot's barbs were directed his way. When the president proclaimed the virtues of his own experience, Mr Perot quipped: 'I don't have any experience in running up a four trillion dollar debt.' The surprise of the evening came when Mr Bush said he wanted Mr James Baker, who switched from secretary of state to head the White House staff in August, to run the economy in a second term. But a campaign spokesman said Mr Bush was referring to the period between election and inauguration. Deputies in limelight, Page 8 Bush cues the blues, Page 20 Lesser evil for growers, Page 32</p>

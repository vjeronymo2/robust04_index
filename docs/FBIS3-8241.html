Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on  Sunday agreed on the opening of two air corridors to Tuzla, a  Muslim-held town in the north-eastern part of the former  Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The agreement was reached at Pale, the R.S. administrative  centre, between R.S. president Radovan Karadzic, special U.N.  Secretary-General's envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi, and UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen.  Michael Rose, the R.S. news agency SRNA said.    Akashi confirmed after the meeting that an agreement had  been  reached on the opening of two air corridors which would link  Tuzla with Croatia's capital of Zagreb and the Croatian Adriatic  port of Split. Akashi said that the ways and means of securing  the airfield near Tuzla had also been agreed.    The Japanese diplomat said that Karadzic had guaranteed the  safe use of the airfield, but there remained some difficulties  with the other two sides, the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, with  whom he said no agreement had been reached yet.    A group of Russian experts left for Tuzla on Sunday to carry  out preparations for the opening of the airfield in line with an  agreement reached between the Russian Government and the R.S.    Russian observers will check all deliveries which arrive at  the Dubrava airfield near Tuzla, because the Serb side fears the  airfield could be used for illegal munitions shipments to the  Bosnian Muslims.    Karadzic said after the meeting with the two UNPROFOR  officials that he was satisfied since "things are moving in a  positive direction and confidence is also gradually increasing."    The R.S. president set out special interest in the "free  movement of civilians in Sarajevo, since arounds 60,000 Serbs  are still to be found in the Muslim section of the city, where  they are held as ethnic hostages." Karadzic recalled that an  agreement had been reached at the Geneva peace talks on the free  movement of civilians between the Serb and Muslim sections of  Sarajevo.    Asked to comment the statements of Bosnian Muslim leaders  that peace could be reached in Bosnia-Herzegovina in April if  the Serbs were to join the Croat-Muslim agreement on a  federation, Karadzic said that "peace is possible even earlier."  He, however, said he doubted the new coalition's readiness to  accept a peaceful solution to the conflict.    Karadzic recalled that Muslims and Croats had been "hostile  towards Serbs" in both the first and second world wars, just as  he said they were now.</p>

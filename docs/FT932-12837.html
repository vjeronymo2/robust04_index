			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico may seek EC trade accord - Once Nafta is ratified, business eyes will turn to Europe MEXICO may try to pursue a trade agreement with the European Community once the North American Free Trade Agreement has been ratified, Mr Fernando Solana, Mexican foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Solana, in London for the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said that Nafta ratification was the Mexican priority, but talks about a trade agreement with Europe could start next year. Mexico already has a trade co-operation accord with the EC, which came into effect in October 1991. That, for example, provides an informal disputes procedure - but there was a desire to 'go beyond what we have,' the minister said. He was returning from Copenhagen, where EC and Latin American foreign ministers were meeting, and said negotiations to complete two side agreements to Nafta, on labour standards and the environment, should be complete by June. This would allow for a vote on Nafta in the US Congress after its August recess, in the third quarter or in October, permitting the accord to be put into effect on schedule at the start of next year. Mr Solana said he was open to the extension of Nafta elsewhere in Latin America, in the first place to Chile, then to Colombia and Venezuela, and including the smaller states of central America. On Friday, President Bill Clinton had reiterated his support for Nafta, a comment that followed fresh criticism of Nafta on Thursday by Mr Ross Perot, who opposed Mr Clinton in the US presidential election last November. The president added that the US needed to 'build those bridges in our own area' by moving to expand free trade arrangements into other Latin American nations, including Chile. He stressed that, for Nafta to move ahead, the US had to secure supplemental agreements to address environmental and labour issues. Noting Mexico's concerns over creating multilateral commissions to oversee enforcement to some degree, he said: 'There's some merit to their position.' Mr Clinton added: 'What we're trying to do is agree on an approach that, if there is a pattern of violation, there will be some enforcement.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By E.T. Suarez] </F>   [Text] President Ramos launched yesterday a $1.2-billion  (about P [Philippine pesos] 33 billion) thermal power plant in  his home province of Pangasinan capable of supplying 1,320  megawatts to the Luzon grid.    Reported to be the largest base load power station in the  country, the president said that this power plant will help  solve the power problem permanently and accelerate economic  development.    The Chief Executive congratulated the Hopewell Group, headed  by chairman Gordon Wu, for undertaking the $1.2-billion Sual  project, the biggest under the build-operate-transfer (BOT)  scheme.    The construction of the project is being undertaken by  Consolidated Electric Power Asia, a subsidiary of the Hopewell  Group which also undertook the Navotas 1 and 2 Gas Turbine Power  Station projects and the 775 megawatt Pagbilao Coal-Fired Power  Station project.    The president called on his provincemates to unite and help  protect the environment, pointing out that the thermal plant to  be constructed will have a mechanism for environmental  protection.    But aside from electric power, Mr. Ramos stressed that  people  power is another factor in the economic development of  Pangasinan.    "Let us help each other because this power plant, when it is  finished, will not automatically give people power by way of  jobs and supplemental income and national domestic wealth," he  said. "We must have to work for that."    At a breakfast program at the session hall of the Capitol  Building in Pangasinan, the president, assisted by Environmental  and Natural Resources Secretary Angel Alcala, distributed checks  totaling P5,053,185 to representatives of families affected by  the collapse of the tailings dam of Philex Mining in Benguet.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Poetry in Performance AS IF to give geographical proof that the strengths of contemporary poetry do not necessarily emanate from the metropolitan centre, Bloodaxe Books have been launching The New Poetry, their anthology of the best of British and Irish verse of the past 15 years, in Glasgow, Newcastle, London and, this week, at Waterstone's, Leeds. Fittingly, this week's readers were some of the Yorkshire poets who are represented in the book: Simon Armitage (Huddersfield), Geoff Hattersley (Wombwell), Ian McMillan (Barnsley), Maggie Hannan (Hull) and Ian Duhig (Leeds). David Morley (Sheffield), one of the book's triumvirate of editors, gave an account of its raison d'etre. The title of the book itself has been borrowed from Al Alvarez's anthology of the same name that was published in the early 1960s and helped to shape the perceptions of a whole generation of poetry readers. Anthologies can be immensely influential in that way - they are bought in their thousands by schools, and by those who, though interested in poetry, may be disinclined to buy collections by individual poets. An anthology can provide an aerial view of the principal features of the terrain almost at a glance. The Bloodaxe anthology, unlike some others, impresses by its inclusiveness and its catholicity - 55 poets in a volume of 350 pages, selected by the editors from a long shortlist of 250 possible candidates. The message of the book, presented in what must be one of the most ineptly-written and poorly-argued introductions for many a year (readers are recommended to skip it altogether; the poets themselves are a much more lively bunch) is that the idea of mainstream is no longer tenable in a country as linguistically fissiparous as Britain is today. It is not a question of English poetry any longer but of British poetries. Earlier anthologists, by arguing that particular groups of poets represented a dominant trend, were guilty of marginalising all the rest. And so here they all are at last, a gloriously democratic rainbow coalition of jangling voices: young Lallans poets from north of the border, Afro-Caribbean poets from Birmingham and Glasgow, all proclaiming the triumph of cultural diversity, and helping to eradicate once and for all that notoriously exclusive Oxbridge bias . . . And, equally important, helping us to recognise quite how unstable language is these days; how rapidly it is changing from moment to moment, and how difficult it is therefore even to talk about a common language for poetry any more. And is there a single figure who has helped to bring about the generational shift of the past 15 years? Who has helped to shape and define poetry's response to the world of today? Yes, argued David Morley this week. 'It is Mrs Thatcher who changed the subject matter and the language of poetry,' he told us. But how? By creating a strong resistance within poets themselves, those antennae of the race, to the duplicities of governments, the lies of official language, the rubbishing of society etc, and thereby helping them to define poetry's new freedoms from such repression. 'We inhabit a society where government can close down pits, and then not close down pits, and then close them down anyway. The world, like language itself, is full of dissociations. . . ' In spite of the fact that it might equally well be argued that rulers have been lying to their subjects since the dawn of Man, the poets from Yorkshire who read from their own anthologised selections did indeed seem to confirm in part the general drift of Morley's audaciously simplistic argument, and none than Ian McMillan from Barnsley, whose sense of the bizarre and the ridiculous coupled with a punchy, flat-cap delivery worthy of the street-corner news vendor, made for a wonderful ten minutes of non-stop entertainment. 'Sometimes my poems are set in the real Barnsley,' he began, 'and other times in a Barnsley of the mind - but maybe they're the same thing.' And so they were. Or, at least, so they seemed to be. 'I always wanted Barnsley to be near the sea,' he said of his second poem, 'The Er Barnsley Seascapes', 'and it can happen - in a poem . . .' He paused. 'And there were, er, something else as well,' he said. 'The word 'er' never gets into, er, poetry, but people are saying it all the time - so I thought I'd, er, get it in.' And so it got in - and unlucky, landlocked Barnsley, flying on the wings of McMillan's anarchic humour, got to the sea. And that is perhaps one way in which the new poetry is trying to define its new freedoms. Ian Duhig, another reader, put it slightly differently: 'Poetry allows you to do what you like. Of a novel, you can say: life's not like that. Well, I am. . .' But does not the New Poetry, by these lights, sound a bit like the Old Dada writ large? Baroness Thatcher seems to have made the world such a confusing place to live and write in. The New Poetry edited by Michael Hulse, David Kennedy, and David Morley. 352 pages. Bloodaxe Books.

This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of the MLG wheel bearings. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent detachment of a MLG wheel from the airplane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective March 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before April 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;16&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O.

The CAA advises that reports have been received of failure of the main landing gear (MLG) wheel bearings on Model ATP airplanes. Investigations are under way to determine the cause of these failures. This condition, if not corrected, could result in detachment of a MLG wheel from the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;32&hyph;48, Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, that describes procedures for performing daily and pre-flight detailed visual inspections to detect damage or discoloration of the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve side hubs on the MLG wheels. (This service bulletin references Dunlop Service Bulletin AHA 1663&hyph;32&hyph;1088, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994, as the appropriate source of service information.) The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 007&hyph;12&hyph;93, dated December 22, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the MLG wheel bearings, which could result in detachment of the MLG wheel from the airplane. This AD requires daily and pre-flight detailed visual inspections to detect damage or discoloration of the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve side hubs on the MLG wheels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the Jetstream service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This AD also requires replacement of the entire MLG wheel assembly and bearings with a serviceable wheel assembly and bearings, if any damage or discoloration is detected during any inspection. The replacement is required to be accomplished in accordance with the airplane maintenance manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators should note that, although Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;32&hyph;48,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, specifies that certain pilots may perform both the daily and pre-flight inspections, it is the FAA's determination that both inspections must be performed by appropriately certificated maintenance personnel, as specified in &sect;43.3 of the FAR (14 CFR 43.3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

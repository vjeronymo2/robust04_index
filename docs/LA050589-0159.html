			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH HIGH STUDENTS WIN AIDS VIDEO COMPETITION  </P> <P> Students from Laguna Beach High School recently won first place in a local AIDS  video competition sponsored by KOCE-TV, Channel 50, and the Orange County Red  Cross.  </P> <P> The purpose of the contest was to help teen-agers learn the facts about AIDS by  producing information videos.  </P> <P> Serena Kizlty, a junior at Laguna Beach, was producer of the winning video,  which addressed the issue of AIDS and teen-age pregnancy. Her assistant  producers were sophomore Silva Sosa and junior Jason Gagnon; the project  adviser was Jeffrey Hornacek.  </P> <P> Second place went to a team from Foothill High School, whose video attempted to  make the public aware of what could happen to AIDS victims if something is not  done immediately to help them. Senior Noah King was the producer. Assistant  producer was senior Peter Mullen and project adviser was Stephane Zamorano.  </P> <P> Third place also went to Foothill High. Sophomore Jodie Baird was the producer,  and her assistants were sophomores Marc Danon and Barbra Tibbles.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach will receive $200 in first-place prize money and Foothill will  receive $200 for its second- and third-place finishes. The students will be  awarded trophies, plaques and certificates. The winning 1-minute video will air  on KOCE throughout the year.  </P> <P> In addition, Laguna Beach's winning video will be entered in a national PBS  AIDS video competition. Three winners from entries submitted by public  television stations across the country will be selected in June, and the  winning students will receive an all-expense-paid trip to the 1989 PBS annual  program fair in Marco Island, Fla. Winning videos will be edited into a  national PBS program, which will be broadcast later this year.  </P> <P> First-place Bank of America Achievement Awards of $2,000 each were presented to  Sunny Hills High School student Ronald Strauss in the science and math category  and Foothill High School student Joanna Brooks in liberal arts.  </P> <P> In 1988, U.S. teen-agers spent $31.3 billion of their money plus $47.7 billion  of their parents' money, for a total of $79 billion, according to the recent  issue of NEA Today, the magazine of the National Education Assn.  </P> <P> Though the number of teen-agers has been declining since 1975, last year's  total teen bill was 5.3% more than 1987's and 21.5% more than the 1985 total.  </P> <P> "Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever."  </P> <P>  -- Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)  </P></p>

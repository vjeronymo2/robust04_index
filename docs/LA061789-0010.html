			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN MISTAKEN FOR SUSPECT SLAIN  </P> <P> I have been troubled ever since I read your news story about an unarmed man,  Marcus Donel, who was shot by a sheriff's deputy in the driveway of his  apartment after having driven up with his stepbrother, Terry Curb ("Man  Mistaken for Robbery Suspect Is Slain by Deputy," Metro, June 1). A $200  robbery had occurred 30 minutes earlier about a block from Mr. Donel's  apartment. Even though the description of the bandit was not of the same race,  13 years younger, 4 inches shorter and 35 pounds lighter, the police evidently  thought they had their man. (After all he was the same sex.)  </P> <P> I was further disturbed that after shooting Mr. Donel they took Curb into  custody and tried to get him identified by the victim as the robber. I shudder  at the inhumanity of making 20-year-old Curb go through this after experiencing  the trauma of seeing his brother mistakenly gunned down.  </P> <P> I was moved to tears by the time I read that Mr. Donel was a hard-working man  and a devoted family man -- the sole support for his common-law wife, his two  girls (11 and 10 years) and his stepbrother. Not only was this unfortunate  incident a personal tragedy for Mr. Donel, but for those people he loved and  who depended on him.  </P> <P> Why did this happen? There will be an investigation by the Sheriff's  Department, but will the truth be found and justice done? Are we just going to  hear rationalizations for why the deputies did this?  </P> <P> In the article Sgt. Ernie Roop is quoted as saying, "If he (Mr. Donel) didn't  commit the robbery, he probably shouldn't have been doing what he was doing."  Why isn't Sgt. Roop concerned whether the deputies were doing what they were  supposed to be doing? Is the Sheriff's Department actively trying to root out  its weak links? Is the Sheriff's Department using the same standard to detect  crime in its own department as it is in the community?  </P> <P> MARGARET WILSON  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Pounds 2bn of tobacco tax 'at risk from EC law' AS MUCH as Pounds 2bn of UK tax revenue could be at risk if the European Community presses ahead with implementation of the single market while adopting current proposals for harmonising cigarette taxes, according to the research group London Economics. Its privately circulated study - commissioned by the Tobacco Advisory Council, a lobbying organisation - claims that proposals accepted in principle by the council of economic and finance ministers 'simply fail to address the major issues of harmonising tax-induced price differences across the Community'. Incentives for 'both legal and illegal cross-border trading' would not be reduced, the report predicts. 'If frontier controls are removed without a reduction in tax differentials, then some member states may find their cigarette tax bases being eroded.' The Ecofin approach, requiring member states to charge at least 57 per cent excise duty on the most popular price category of product in their country, would probably leave UK cigarette prices unchanged. The study's conclusions point to potential losses for the Treasury of 'anything up to Pounds 1bn' from legal cross-border trade and 'as much again' from illegal bootlegging. 'Whilst it is very unlikely that excise receipts will actually be reduced by as much as Pounds 2bn, this figure provides an indication of the tax revenue at stake.' The report uses the example of a van carrying 1.5m cigarettes from Portugal to the UK to show how lucrative cross-border trafficking between countries with widely diverging prices might be. Gross profits from such a haul would amount to Pounds 80,000, the study calculates. Opportunities are significant partly because 'cigarettes are relatively easy to transport in bulk'. Tobacco products generate about 27 per cent of overall UK excise duty and 4 per cent of total tax receipts. In 1991-92, this was just under Pounds 6.3bn.</p>

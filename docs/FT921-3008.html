			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Publishing performance gives BPP lift to Pounds 6.4m BPP HOLDINGS, the financial training and publishing group, announced pre-tax profits 23 per cent ahead, up from Pounds 5.19m to Pounds 6.39m, for the 1991 year. A strong performance from publishing offset a fall in profits from training and language courses. These were hit by lower recruitment of chartered accountants and the Gulf war. Mr Richard Price, chairman, said: 'We like to think we are a good each way bet for the general election. If the Conservatives win it will be good for the underlying strength of the economy, while if Labour wins it will be good for training.' Earnings per share increased to 17.3p (15.7p) as sales rose to Pounds 42.4m (Pounds 36.7m). An increased final dividend of 4.5p lifts the total to 6.9p (6.3p). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 362,000 to cover the costs of closing BPP Management Education and the unsuccessful legal action to lift an injunction preventing the group from bidding for DC Gardner. In May the group raised Pounds 12.3m by way of a rights issue, used to acquire Letts Educational, a publisher of home-study books for school examinations, for Pounds 3.7m, and the purchase of 75 per cent of Melrose, a publisher of video-based training packages, for Pounds 5.75m. The group now has net cash of Pounds 5.2m and is looking at various publishing companies to buy. The publishing activities all did well, benefiting from the rise in numbers of college students, and increased profits to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.27m).</p>

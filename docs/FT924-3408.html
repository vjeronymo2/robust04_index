			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Overseas growth boosts Tunstall TUNSTALL Group, the manufacturer of emergency communication systems for the disabled and elderly, reported a 21 per cent increase to Pounds 5.29m in pre-tax profit for the year ended September 20. Sales rose 9 per cent to Pounds 40.5m. Mr Michael Dawson, chairman, said the group had performed well, 'despite adverse economic conditions both in the UK and overseas'. Part of the increase was due to the inclusion for nine months of Ohmeda Schmelter, acquired for Pounds 3.3m in January and renamed Tunstall ComSystem. The purchase contributed Pounds 5.3m to sales and Pounds 500,000 to trading profit. About 20 per cent of Tunstall's sales were now overseas, against 5 per cent last year. The group also benefited from a Pounds 232,000 interest gain, against a Pounds 96,000 charge last year. Mr Dawson said the under-exploited German market would provide good opportunities for growth in the coming years. Tunstall's immediate opportunity, however, would be the introduction of the UK government's Care in the Community programme. The final dividend is raised to 3.75p, making 6p (5.35p). Earnings per share rose from 17.4p to 21.6p.</p>

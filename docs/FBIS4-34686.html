			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marco Antonio Moreira] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- To offset the setback  suffered by Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de  Oliveira over the last-minute cancellation of his trip to  Lisbon, President Itamar Franco today asked former President  Jose Sarney (who is a senator for the Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party, Amapa State) to head the Brazilian delegation to  the Seminar on Economic and Entrepreneurial Cooperation and to  the signing of the declaration creating the Community of  Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP).    Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended  personally by Franco. Sarney returned from France on 20 June.  Today he stayed home recovering from labyrinthitis. At 1700 on  22 June, Sarney will meet with the members of the Brazilian  delegation to discuss details of the trip, which is scheduled to  start on 24 June.

In a communique released today at Planalto Palace, the  president states that despite having postponed his trip to  Portugal, he will visit that country before the end of his term  to commemorate the creation of the CPLP and to resume bilateral  talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco e Silva. The  Brazilian delegation will include cabinet ministers, executives  of state-owned companies, and private businessmen who will pay  their own travel expenses.    Presidential Spokesman Fernando Costa has said Franco's  decision to postpone the trip was in no way related to the death  of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto Franco, although the  cancellation came after his death. "The president was shaken by  Ariosto's death," Costa said, "but he has chosen to stay in  Brazil because he considers his presence necessary on the eve of  the implementation of the real."</p>

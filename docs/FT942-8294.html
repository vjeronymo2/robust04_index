			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Capital gains lift SCA quarter SCA, the Swedish pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a SKr566m (Dollars 73.44m) profit after financial items for the first quarter, more than double the SKr271m it achieved a year earlier. But it had to rely on capital gains and lower interest payments to compensate for a weaker performance in many of its main businesses. The recent improvement in prices and volumes was not felt during the quarter, but it will influence the group's figures over the rest of the year. The company is sticking to a forecast of a full-year profit of between SKr1.7bn and SKr2.2bn, excluding one-off items. The main first-quarter influence was a SKr371m capital gain from the sale of shares in fellow Swedish forestry concern MoDo. It left SCA with a SKr255m exceptional gain, after deducting a SKr116m restructuring charge. Lower interest rates and a reduced net debt also had a positive impact, cutting net financial expenses to SKr181m from SKr252m. Both factors helped compensate for the poorer performance from three of the group's four main divisions. Molnlycke, the hygiene division, saw operating profits fall 11 per cent to SKr276m. Lower board prices hit the packaging division, cutting profits to SKr146m from SKr153m. The graphic paper unit broke even, following a SKr37m profit, due to lower prices and the strengthening Swedish krona. Only SCA Forest and Timber produced better figures, profits rising to SKr146m from SKr61m. Group sales fell to SKr7.78bn from SKr8.59bn, and operating profit (excluding the exceptional gain) dropped to SKr492m from SKr523m.</p>

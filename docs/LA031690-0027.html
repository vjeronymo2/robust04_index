			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHOOSING TO LIVE MORE SIMPLY  </P> <P> The dinosaurs were the dominant species on this planet for over 160 million  years. They vanished virtually without a trace. Compared to that vast span of  time, Homo sapiens' sojourn on Earth is less than the blink of an eye.  </P> <P> And yet in the infinitesimal millisecond of our pitiful existence, we have  brought our world to the brink of destruction.  </P> <P> Our technological evolution has surpassed our social evolution. We cannot  destroy nature. But what we are doing is destroying ourselves. The planet will  ultimately prevail. Only another species will be in the driver's seat. From a  purely selfish viewpoint then, it's time to think of ourselves as "one planet  -- one species." Then again, considering how we've botched things up, maybe  it's time to give the job to someone else.  </P> <P> SAM MINSKY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

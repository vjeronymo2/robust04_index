			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambian group's survival plan agreed Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the world's fourth-largest copper producer, yesterday won union agreement to its short-term survival plan designed in the next three years to lift output from under 400,000 tonnes of copper to 450,000 tonnes and to reduce operating costs from 80 US cents a pound to 64 cents. It also calls for an 8,000 or 16 per cent reduction in the workforce from the present 50,000, including 5,800 redundancies this year. Some 850 senior staff, out of 2,500, have already left the company. Mr Edward Shamutete, chief executive, revealed in London that ZCCM is to sell its Chambishi and Kansanshi copper mines, which have resources of 3.25bn tonnes and 750,000 tonnes respectively. He said the group might also sell its recently-closed Kabwe lead-zinc mine and the Luanshaya copper smelter. ZCCM's debt of Dollars 600m at the end of March would be reduced below Dollars 400m by the end of the 1996 financial year, Mr Shamutete said. Production difficulties caused a loss for the year to end-March but ZCCM expected to break-even in the current financial year and be profitable in 1995-96. Annual output of cobalt, about 3,300 tonnes in 1993, would rise to at least 5,000 tonnes in the three-year period. ZCCM had 1,600 tonnes of cobalt in stocks.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: VENTURING -- REALISTICALLY  </P> <P> Brentwood Associates, L.A.'s premier venture capital firm, has $55 million  waiting to fund brilliant new business ideas for the 1990s.  </P> <P> But like other investment firms, Brentwood is taking a much more disciplined  view of what constitutes "brilliance" these days. In the late 1980s, many big  ideas didn't pay off for venture investors as they expected. So money is  tighter, and more entrepreneurs are likely to go begging.  </P> <P> In 1989, venture capitalists invested $3.3 billion overall, an 11% drop from  1988 and 15% less than 1987's record $3.9 billion, says Venture Economics'  monthly Venture Capital Journal in Needham, Mass.  </P> <P> Still, venture financiers aren't sitting on their wallets. In fact, "There's  much more emphasis today on us going out and finding opportunities, rather than  waiting for them to come in the door," says Brentwood partner Roger Davisson.  Brentwood hunts for entrepreneurs at new-industry conferences, through  executives at major companies who have contact with new products, and via  networking with other entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> Brentwood invests nationwide, but it hopes to put a substantial amount of its  venture dollars into Southern California enterprises in the early '90s. Medical  technology in Orange County is a key focus of the firm, but Brentwood hopes  that other hot business ideas will emerge from the Southland during the next  few years.  </P> <P> "There has been a legion of brilliant entrepreneurs in Southern California, but  they all became real estate developers," Davisson says, only half joking. That  business doesn't lend itself to venture financing.  </P> <P> But real estate here is unlikely to be the boom business in the '90s that it  was in the '70s and '80s. That -- and the layoffs of many talented aerospace  workers -- could lead to a wave of business start-ups in new fields, Davisson  says.  </P> <P> David Chonette, another Brentwood principal, notes that "it was refugees from  aerospace who originally spawned the medical technology industries in Orange  County" in the 1970s and 1980s.  </P> <P> What does it take for an entrepreneur to attract a venture investor in 1990?  Davisson says his firm wants to see strong management, a significant  technological advantage in the product or service and a "very significant  market opportunity" -- a market at least several hundred million dollars in  size.  </P> <P> Those criteria haven't changed much from the '80s. What has changed is that  deal makers want to see entrepreneurs take a more realistic view of venture  financing -- especially regarding the stake in the business that the  entrepreneur will have to give up and regarding the changes the financier may  suggest in the business plan. "People who are unrealistic are going to be more  disappointed now than ever," Davisson says.  </P> <P> Entrepreneurs may view venture money as cash to fund more risk, for more  potential reward. But "the spending of venture money should be to lower the  risk," Davisson says -- to get the initial product out, for example, or to  strengthen the management team to guarantee the company's long-term success.  </P> <P> Entrepreneurs should recognize that venture capitalists can bring more than  money to the party, Davisson says. Experienced financiers can bring market  contacts, a better business plan and the knowledge of how to recruit the right  key employees, he says. Finding the best managers is a constant challenge,  Davisson says. The right product is one thing, but before Brentwood commits its  investors' dollars, the firm wants to be sure that the managers running the  company can get the product to market, and manage the bumps along the way.  </P> <P> Currently, three young companies that Brentwood is considering financing all  need strengthening of management, the partners say. "There are never enough  good managers around," Davisson says.  </P> <P> The venture financier's ultimate goal, of course, is to sell the business in  two to seven years for a fantastic sum, either to another company or to the  general public via stock. Although some independent entrepreneurs may cringe at  that idea, it's the reality of the business -- and it's the way entrepreneurs  become millionaires, too.  </P> <P>  Briefly: The average stockbroker earned $78,711 in 1989, up 10.4% from $71,309  in 1988, the Securities Industry Assn. says in a new report. The earnings rise  was the first since 1986, when the average figure peaked at $97,100. The 1989  increase was helped by a turnaround in broker earnings at regional firms, which  tend to concentrate more on the average investor than major Wall Street houses.  . . .  </P> <P> L.A. brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards has pulled its "buy"  recommendation on Paramount Communications, citing weakness in the company's  summer movie menu (mainly "Days of Thunder" and "Another 48 Hours"). Analyst  Paul Marsh also lowered his fiscal 1990 earnings estimate to $2.30 a share from  $2.72. Paramount stock has fallen to $40.75 from $52.875 earlier this year.  Meanwhile, Dean Witter recently initiated coverage of Paramount. Analyst Alan  Gould rates the stock a "hold," noting that the big question regarding  Paramount remains the same: What will the firm do with its $1.1 billion cash  hoard? . . .  </P> <P> "An Investor's Guide to Reading a Mutual Fund Prospectus" is available free  from the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade group.

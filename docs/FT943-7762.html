			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Truth of the Matter: Cheeky and misunderstood - Michael Holman reflects on what boyhood experience taught him about Africa It was generally agreed that 'Smiler' May knew how to manage Natives. Whenever his boy got drunk, he gave him a sound thrashing, behind the kia, the servants' quarters at the end of the garden. I used to like Smiler. He was as cheerful as his nickname suggested, and popular, judging by the turn out for the sun-downers he hosted, the round of drinks at the end of hot African days. It was at one such evening that I changed my mind about him. As dusk fell on Victory Street, Gwelo, a small conservative town in the heart of Southern Rhodesia, Smiler's neighbours had gathered on his stoep (verandah), drinks in hand, while children roamed the surrounding gardens. That evening, however, I lingered in the half-shadows near the stoep, a 12-year-old eavesdropper on conversations that turned to the trials and tribulations of domestic servants. All agreed on one thing: Smiler knew how to handle his boy. I cannot recall the 'boy's' name. He was in fact an adult, the family's cook of many years standing. The relationship owed much, I heard Smiler explain, to those regular sessions behind the kia. They took place when Joseph (as I shall call him) was drunk. No one was more appreciative, apparently, of this vigorous display of concern for his welfare than Joseph himself. But one thing bothered Smiler: something in Joseph's expression. At the end of the thrashing, the boy was still 'cheeky'. Smiler did not need to say more. It was the mid-1950s, a time when the African nationalist movement throughout the continent was starting to flex its muscles, the word was resonant with dissent and potential rebellion. Joseph's passive resistance was no doubt inspired by his conviction that white minority rule would pass. And so it proved, some 25 years later, when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe. Today, nearly 40 years on, that evening in Gwelo comes to mind. As Africa's post-independence crisis deepens, some voices call for Africa to be left to its own devices; others advocate trusteeship status for nations in distress. But what we offer Africa - indeed, seek to impose on the continent - is an economic system and a political culture for which its peoples show little affinity. It is as if Africa has been collectively taken behind the kia by the west, and given a thrashing by the World Bank and the IMF, the well- intentioned Smiler Mays of today. Grunts of pain, and a series of exhortations, reach our ears as the virtues of structural adjustment and multi-party democracy are hammered home. With a cuff comes the demand: 'Devalue]' And a further clout: 'Privatise]', and then a punch: 'Reduce the budget deficit]' Ten years after the thrashing began, Africa emerges from behind the kia, battered and bemused, but still cheeky. It is if Africa clings to an atavistic sense of what should be, and what might yet be. It never accepted communism, and while capitalism has triumphed elsewhere, it has yet to win over hearts and minds in Africa. It is as if the continent dimly recalls an era long past, well before the slave trade, colonialism and the cold war, which between them traumatised the region. Traces of this era can still be detected, like Great Zimbabwe, the ruins of a once mighty city, testimony to a great indigenous civilisation, its rise and fall shrouded in mystery. Africa sustains a belief in the extended family, respect for the elderly, hospitality towards strangers, and a passion for dance and music, laughter and physical embrace which makes the west seem soul-less. There also survives a culture of compassion and tolerance, reconciliation after Biafra, or the forgiveness of their erstwhile jailers by the Kenyattas, the Mugabes and Nelson Mandela. It is as if Africa is saying that these values, and more besides, are incompatible with capitalism. Yet it fails to articulate an economic or constitutional alternative to the systems it rejects, based on values Africa finds alien. So Africa stubbornly, doggedly resists, as it pursues a vision based on the past. Africa has rejected our embrace and shrugs off our thrashing, but like Smiler May, we are only aware that Africa, like Joseph, is defiantly 'cheeky'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jalal Talabani, leader of the Iraqi Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan [PUK], has placed his hopes on Turkey in his effort  to go to northern Iraq. Ankara gave a positive reply to  Talabani's request to go to northern Iraq via Turkey. The  meeting between Talabani and [Democratic party of Kurdistan  Mas'ud] Barzani will not take place in Silopi.    [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] Talabani was abroad when the  clashes started in northern Iraq on 2 May. When the clashes  intensified, Talabani got as far as the Syrian capital of  Damascus, but could not proceed to northern Iraq from there. In  order to go to his region in northern Iraq from Damascus,  Talabani has to pass through a region under Barzani's control.  Talabani had said that he could go to northern Iraq on  condition that Barzani meet him at the border.    As a last hope, Talabani appealed to Turkey. Ankara gave a  positive reply to Talabani's request to go to northern Iraq via  Turkey. It is expected that Talabani will enter Turkey in the  next few days. Turkey supported Barzani during the clashes in  northern Iraq. An important factor in this were the close ties  Talabani had established with the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan].    The Talabani-Barzani summit that was expected to be held in  Silopi is now regarded as highly unlikely.</p>

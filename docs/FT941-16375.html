			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Perry likely to join Fed board The Clinton administration has narrowed its choice for the next seat on the Federal Reserve board to Mr George Perry, an economist at Washington's Brookings Institution. Although President Bill Clinton is understood not to have made his final choice yet, his economic advisers have picked Mr Perry from a shortlist to succeed Mr Wayne Angell, whose term of office as a Fed governor expires at the end of this month. Mr Perry, who was an economic adviser to former Vice-President Walter Mondale in his 1984 election campaign, would, if finally selected by Mr Clinton and confirmed by the Senate, be expected to be less hawkish than Mr Angell. Inflation has been one of the focuses of Mr Perry's academic work, but some of his writings suggest he sees a trade-off between growth and inflation. 'The demand management chore confronting policymakers is not merely avoiding excess demand, but rather choosing how much to accommodate inflation and how much to give up in output and employment in order to suppress inflation,' he wrote in an article on demand-pull inflation in an influential economics dictionary. Curiously, the administration, which has gone to great lengths to ensure ethnic and gender diversity in other appointments, appears relatively untroubled by the fact that Mr Perry is a white male. The Fed, whose seven governors include just one woman and no blacks or Latinos, is probably the institution whose diversity shortcomings are most glaring. Mr Morton Halperin, whose nomination to the new post as head of peacekeeping operations at the Pentagon was held up by Republican opposition in the Senate, has withdrawn his candidacy. The White House had said it would resubmit his nomination, which expired when Congress adjourned last year, but yesterday said Mr Clinton had accepted Mr Halperin's withdrawal 'with real regret'. Mr Halperin's decision was prompted by the resignation of Mr Les Aspin as defence secretary. He felt Mr Bobby Ray Inman, Mr Aspin's successor, should have the freedom to select his own subordinates.

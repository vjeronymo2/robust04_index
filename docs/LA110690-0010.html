			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Two men accused of severely beating San Diego Charger Joe Phillips on Sept. 26  pleaded not guilty to felony assault charges Monday.  </P> <P> Brett J. Dost and Scott E. Stewart made their pleas before Municipal Judge  Michael B. Orfield, who ordered the defendants taken into custody.  </P> <P> Citing the "senseless and brutal nature of this crime," Orfield set bail for  Dost at $30,000 because of his prior contacts with police, and he set bail for  Stewart at $20,000.  </P> <P> Dost, 21, and Stewart, 24, face one felony charge each of assault with force  likely to produce great bodily injury and battery intended to produce great  bodily injury, and one misdemeanor charge of malicious mischief.  </P> <P> The two men -- along with David Hanna, 22, who is free on $20,000 bail after  pleading not guilty last week -- are accused of beating 27-year-old Phillips  outside a Mission Beach restaurant.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine said Phillips, a defensive lineman and  five-year NFL veteran, was beaten so badly that a doctor could not tell how  many fractures there were in Phillips' face. The beating was "one of the worst  he's ever seen," Pettine reported.  </P> <P> Phillips underwent surgery for some of his injuries. It is not known if he will  be able to play again this season.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police after the attack that the assailants made a remark to a  woman accompanying Phillips that led to a confrontation, which erupted into a  brawl. Phillips reported to police that at least one of his attackers kicked  him with steel-toed boots while he was on the ground.  </P> <P> Pettine said there is a "history of violence in Mr. Dost's past," and he is on  probation in a drug case. The prosecutor told the judge that a man involved in  another altercation with Dost suffered a broken jaw and other injuries.  </P> <P> Orfield set a preliminary hearing for Nov. 20, when the three cases are  expected to be consolidated.  </P></p>

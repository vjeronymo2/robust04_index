			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil exports warning FOREIGN TRADERS have been warned to get used to a chronic shortage of Russian oil products and prepare for a continuing reduction in exports because of Moscow's squeeze on crude deliveries to former Soviet republics with spare refining capacity. Professor Yevgeny Khartukov, a leading oil analyst, described as 'uneducated' a statement by an official at Rosnefteprodukt, the state organisation which collects refined products for export, that deliveries to Japan and western Europe were being suspended because of a domestic need for fuel to drive agriculture machinery during the harvest. The statement was later withdrawn amid confusion on world markets. 'The trend should be made clear to traders: there is an excess supply of crude hanging over the market and less and less oil products around,' said Prof Khartukov, who heads the Moscow-based World Energy Analysis and Forecasting Group. Exports of products from Russia would continue, but exports from other former Soviet republics could come to a stop by the end of the year, he said. This was because Russia was starving republics such as Ukraine of cheap crude deliveries in an attempt to prevent them re-exporting oil and refined products for hard currency. But as a result it found itself with more crude than it could cope with, while refineries in other republics had idle capacity. The break up of the Soviet Union has strained the old integrated system, in which Russia automatically delivered excess crude to refineries in other republics. Asked about more efficient ways of discouraging the re-exports so that Russia could meet export obligations outside the former Soviet Union, Prof Khartukov said it was politically difficult to charge other republics world prices to stop them importing more than they needed for domestic consumption. Moreover, politicians were too ignorant and industry managers too chaotic to pursue standard crude processing arrangements between countries with excess crude and those with excess refining capacity. Under that sort of ideal solution, the oil would continue to belong to Russia even when it went to refineries in other republics, which would receive a fee for refining services. Prof Khartukov said Russia's plan to centralise exports and limit the number of enterprises which could become involved in foreign trade were also doomed to fail. 'The shift from commercial to state run (export) structures have nothing to do with the volume of products available.'</p>

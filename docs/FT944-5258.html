			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Revenue examines tax on charities The Inland Revenue yesterday promised to re-examine a tax change announced in the Budget that may have the side-effect of imposing big tax bills on many charities. Tax officials conceded they had not intended to hit charities when drawing up plans to close a loophole used by foreign companies with subsidiaries in the UK. They promised to listen to charities' concerns and did not rule out re-wording clauses planned for next year's finance bill. The Revenue is worried that some UK subsidiaries are able to avoid corporation tax by using profits to make interest payments. These have not previously been taxable. The plan to tax such payments would affect UK companies only where the company receiving the interest was not paying corporation tax. But that could include many large charities with trading subsidiaries. Letters, Page 14</p>

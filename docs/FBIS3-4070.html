Mr. Tong said that China was reforming its banking system  and  owing to the state-owned pofessional banks being in the process  of being switched to becoming state-owned commercialized banks,  permitting foreign-funded banks to operate RMB-related business  would be unfair competition prior to the establishment of the  commercialized bank system in the country because of the great  discrepancies in ways of management and the tax rate between  foreign-funded banks and the domestically-funded banks.    The opening to foreign banks by any country, he said, should  be based on its own realities and China, in line with its own  situation, first permitted foreign banks to operate foreign  currency business and would later create the conditions for them  to open to RMB-related business.    Such opening, he added, would not be overall at the  beginning. Places like Shenzhen and Xiamen, however, were  permitted to open first since the ratio of major state-owned  enterprises there was small, the economy there mainly dominated  by the market economy and most of the banks there were  commercial banks.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Franco-German corps takes shape FRANCE and Germany will next week finalise the concept and tasks of their planned European defence corps, including an independent command structure, which could run into strong objections by other Nato member states. A joint Franco-German military delegation yesterday met UK defence officials to try to allay British fears that the attachment of German units to the corps would conflict with Nato planning. The German embassy in London described the talks as 'constructive'. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday that the planning staff for the corps, intended to be the nucleus of a future fully-fledged European defence arm, would begin its work in July. According to government officials in Bonn, the two sides have ironed out their principal differences, and will set a timetable culminating in final establishment of the corps in October, 1995. They said Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand would sign a treaty on the creation of the corps at a summit at La Rochelle in France on May 21-22. The chancellor said any other member states of the Western European Union were invited to join the unit, which will be built on the existing Franco-German brigade and is intended to be put under the WEU umbrella. The German troops in it will also remain assigned to Nato. The fear of some other Nato members, including Britain, is that the command arrangements for the new corps will dilute the German units' commitment to Nato and interfere in their full participation in Nato exercises. The German argument is that, on the contrary, the plan will bind the French contingent in the force more closely to Nato forces.</p>

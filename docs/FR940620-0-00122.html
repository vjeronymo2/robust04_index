			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.5.2(8)&blank;Controls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that controls intended for operation by inmates be accessible according to ADAAG 4.27 (Controls and Operating Mechanisms). This provision has not been revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.5.2(9)&blank;Accommodations for Persons With Hearing Impairments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this provision, accessible cells are also required to be accessible to persons with hearing impairments and comply with ADAAG 12.6. Cells or rooms addressed by this section are required to comply with ADAAG 12.6 in addition to the three percent of cells or rooms addressed by ADAAG 12.4.3. This provision is intended to address access for those persons with both mobility and hearing impairments. The NPRM asked whether this provision was necessary or appropriate with respect to detention and correctional facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A majority of the commenters, most from disability organizations, supported this requirement. However, corrections officials and the Bureau of Prisons recommended that this requirement be removed. Most of these comments indicated that the elements required to be accessible under this provision, alarms and permanently installed telephones, are typically not provided or needed in cells. These comments noted that staff supervision and controlled means of egress preclude the need for alarms serving inmates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed under ADAAG 12.4.3, alarms and permanently installed telephones are not typically provided to serve individual cells. Thus, the specifications referenced by this provision apply only where such devices are provided. In addition, the requirement for auxiliary visible alarms, as discussed under ADAAG 12.6 (Visible Alarms and Telephones), does not apply where inmates or detainees are not allowed independent egress. No changes were made to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.6&blank;Visible Alarms and Telephones <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains technical requirements for cells that are accessible to persons with hearing impairments. ADAAG 12.6.1 requires that if audible emergency warning systems serving cells or rooms are provided, a visible alarm complying with ADAAG 4.28.4 (Auxiliary Alarms) shall also be provided. Further, permanently installed telephones, where provided within housing or holding cells or rooms, are required to have volume controls complying with ADAAG 4.31.5 (Hearing Aid Compatible and Volume Control Telephones). TTYs in detention and correctional facilities are not addressed by this section but by requirements at ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(v). ADAAG 12.6 clarifies that portable devices may be used in lieu of permanent devices if necessary wiring and outlets are provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed under ADAAG 12.4.3, some corrections officials, including the Bureau of Prisons, stated that such specifications are unnecessary since the type of alarms and telephones addressed by this section are typically not provided in cells. These comments further stated that supervision of inmates and controlled evacuations obviate the need for visible alarms and that, since alarms may be vandalized or tampered with, their placement should not be required within cells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These requirements, as stated in the corresponding scoping provision at ADAAG 12.4.3 and reiterated in this section, apply only where alarms and permanently installed telephones are installed within housing or holding cells or rooms. With respect to the need for alarms where evacuation of inmates is controlled, the proposed rule noted that visible alarms are only required where ``inmates or detainees .&blank;.&blank;. are allowed independent means of egress.'' For clarity, this language has been restated as an actual exception to the requirement for visible alarms. Thus, where independent egress is not allowed, visible alarms would not be required even if an audible emergency warning system is provided. With respect to alarms being vandalized or tampered with, ADAAG 12.6.2 allows the use of portable, instead of permanent, alarms as long as the necessary wiring and outlets are provided. Operators can then install portable devices according to need as required by the Department of Justice title II regulation, which addresses the provision of auxiliary aids and services. See 28 CFR part 35. This information is provided in an appendix note to ADAAG 12.6.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An almost equal number of comments, primarily from disability groups and State and local government agencies, supported these requirements. Some commenters recommended additional requirements, such as specifications for vibrating alarms, signals of announcements or summons, and other notification devices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Auxiliary aids and devices, such as vibrating alarms are not within the purview of these guidelines since such devices are typically not built-in or addressed as part of facility design and construction. Such devices, however, are not precluded by these guidelines and, as noted above, are addressed by the Department of Justice title II regulation as noted above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

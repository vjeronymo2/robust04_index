			<p>BFN     [Text] Two opposition leaders, the Likud's Binyamin  Netanyahu and Refa'el Eytan of Tzomet, accused the prime  minister of lying about the Golan Heights. Netanyahu told a Tel  Aviv news conference that a year ago he presented a map in the  Knesset showing the stages of withdrawal from the Golan Heights,  and Rabin denied the remarks. Today, Netanyahu said, I have  proof that it is precisely the map Christopher is presenting  President al-Asad in Syria.    Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that  Refa'el Eytan submitted a paper offered to him as a basis for  negotiations on his joining the coalition three months ago. He  said the paper claims that no settlement would be uprooted, the  Golan settlements would be strengthened, and all the completed  apartments would be inhabited. These points were also shown to  be false, Eytan said.    The prime minister's bureau said in response that there has  not been any change in Israel's position on peace with Syria  since the establishment of the government, and the commitment to  hold a national referendum prior to any signing of a peace  agreement with Syria that involves territorial concessions  remains intact .</p>

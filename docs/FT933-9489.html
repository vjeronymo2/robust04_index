			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Clinton risks westerners' ire over grazing THE CLINTON administration is again risking the ire of senators from the west of the US with the release of fresh proposals for improving the management of federal range land in the west. The package includes a sharp increase in the fees charged to ranchers for grazing their livestock on government lands. Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said the proposed new rules, expected to take effect next year, were aimed to improve the condition of the landscape in 260m federally owned acres in the west, particularly on fragile river and lake banks. President Bill Clinton originally planned to increase grazing fees and mining royalties on federal lands as part of his budget package, but agreed to remove the measures from it under pressure from western senators, who fight hard on behalf of ranchers. The grazing fee increase will now come about through an administrative rule, rather than through legislation. Mr Babbitt promised to tackle the mining issue in September. The ranchers' victory has proved short-lived but the damage it did to Mr Clinton's presidency persists. The concession signalled to other members of Congress that Mr Clinton could be pressed, and led to the dismemberment of his budget package, which passed Congress last week in a much altered form. Mr Babbitt has proposed a phased increase in grazing fees, over the next three years, to Dollars 4.28 per animal unit month (based on the acreage needed to feed a cow and her calf or five sheep for a month). This would bring in some Dollars 80m from the 170m acres run by the Bureau of Land Management, and Dollars 40m from the 94m acres of grazing allotments run by the Forest Service.</p>

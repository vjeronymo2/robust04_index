			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (2): Weaker players at risk - Charles Batchelor fears the shake-out may claim more victims The steady contraction of the UK venture capital industry appears to have slowed over the past 12 months. But the present pause, far from marking the end of the shake-out of weaker players, may be merely the lull before the storm. There are no signs that UK institutions are more willing to increase their investments in the short term and overseas investors have been almost as reluctant to provide funds. At one stage this year no fewer than 40 UK venture firms were looking to raise new finance. Some venture capitalists are attempting to attract private individuals as investors in their funds but this can be time consuming and can lead to complicated fund structures. 'The big crunch will come in the next 12 to 24 months when people have been unable to raise more money,' says Mr James Nelson, managing director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures. 'Will investors be willing to commit their funds to the smaller teams of venture capitalists for the next few years?' Mr Nelson does not believe there will be a large contraction in the amount of money available for the industry to invest - though the pool of finance available has already shrunk markedly from the position in the late 1980s. But he does think it will be spread among a smaller number of venture funds. This gloomy view of prospects for the industry's less successful players is shared by Mr Jonny Maxwell, in charge of unquoted investments for Standard Life Assurance Company. 'There will be a great contraction in the industry with only five or six managers capable of closing a serious fund,' he says. Opinions differ in the venture industry as to who will feature in the big league but among the most frequently mentioned names are CINVen, Charterhouse, Phildrew Ventures, Candover Investments, Morgan Grenfell Development Capital and Schroder Ventures. These all specialise in the larger development capital deals and management buy-outs/buy-ins. The general industry assumption that the 'captive' funds owned by the large banks had a guaranteed future has been somewhat shaken by the decision of one or two of the big banks to withdraw. TSB Group's decision to sell Hill Samuel Development Capital - its portfolio is being wound down by F&amp;C Ventures - showed venture/development capital was not central to all the banks' activities. But Mr Ron Hollidge, managing director of Lloyds Development Capital and chairman of the British Venture Capital Association, believes the banks will generally want to continue their development capital activities. 'I don't see the UK clearing banks pulling out,' he says. 'They recognise the need for expertise in structuring deals involving equity to help companies recover from the recession.' Support for this view comes from the decision of the Royal Bank of Scotland to recruit a former senior 3i executive to head a department aimed at using equity in just this way. But while the banks may want to continue their involvement in development capital they may not all want to do it in quite the same way as in the past. Two foreign banks with UK-based venture operations have recently established looser links with their development capital operations. In July, Citicorp spun off its European venture capital activities into an independent company, CVC Venture Partners, which is fully-owned by the US bank's existing European venture management team. Citicorp will continue to provide funds to CVC Venture Partners but the venture activities will be free of the restrictions of US banking laws. One advantage of creating independent venture capital operations is that remuneration packages no longer have to fit within the usual banking procedures. There may be only a handful of very large players left in the venture capital market by the end of the decade but there will also be a place for the niche players. Several long-established venture teams have reputations for backing companies with a technology bias in fields such as healthcare, bio-technology and information technology. Advent has specialised in medical instruments, diagnostics and software and is raising a life sciences fund. 'We don't back start-ups but we do invest in companies which have a product and which need to break into more than one country at once,' says Sir David Cooksey, chairman. These specialist players are sometimes introduced to deals by the larger venture groups which lack expertise in that particular area. But sometimes the larger players establish more permanent relationships to make these specialised investments. Trinity Capital is one, making investments in the healthcare, environmental and information technology fields for its three backers, 3i, Charterhouse and Alex. Brown, a US investment bank. For much of the 1980s the venture capital industry was based largely in London and the south-east but in recent years it has achieved a better spread across other regions. This shift towards making more investments in the regions is expected to continue over the next few years, according to a recent review by accountants Arthur Andersen. Midland Bank has contributed to this greater regional diversity with the launch of a series of regional funds. Midland planned to launch 11 funds with a total of Pounds 55m to invest, most of it raised from local investors. After a slow start, because of the problem of finding backers in the depths of the recession, this regional network is now coming together. These developments have challenged the once dominant position of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital company, in the regions though 3i still has a more extensive network of offices than any of its rivals. The past year has not been happy for 3i. It went through a painful slimming process to counter the recession and to prepare for a stock market flotation but the listing plans were postponed indefinitely in April. As a result 3i's chairman left. Despite these setbacks 3i says it has sufficient resources to finance a revival of UK business at the end of the recession. At the same time it is looking to raise outside funds, for the first time, to finance an expansion of its continental European activities. For all the pressures of the past three years, the UK venture capital industry still retains a remarkable diversity. The casualties of any further retrenchment will be those funds which have either failed to establish a good performance record or a strong profile.</p>

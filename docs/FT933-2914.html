			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / ECC blames lower results on competition in kaolin ENGLISH China Clays, the industrial minerals and construction materials group, yesterday reported slightly lower first-half profits, which it blamed on lower margins and fierce competition in its core kaolin business. The decline in pre-tax profits, which slipped to Pounds 40.3m in the six months to June 30 from an adjusted Pounds 40.8m a year earlier, disappointed the markets and fuelled a 26p fall in the group's share price to 408p. At the end of June the group acquired the Calgon speciality chemical business in the US for Pounds 209.7m. It has also announced plans to demerge its construction materials division - a move expected to take place in the first half of 1994. Earnings per share declined to 9.85p from 10.02p a year earlier, but the interim dividend is unchanged at 6.6p. Turnover increased by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 515.1m (Pounds 479.4m), and the group managed to increase operating profits to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds 41m) although Pounds 4m of the improvement was attributable to currency movements. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said trading conditions had remained difficult in industrial minerals markets, particularly in the European paper and ceramics industries, which are both important markets for china clay. The core ECC international operations reported operating profits of Pounds 38.1m, down sharply from Pounds 47.6m in the 1992 first half in spite of an overall 2 per cent rise in sales volumes of industrial minerals. The lower profits reflected a decline in margins as the group was forced to abandon its 'robust' pricing policy in the face of price and cost pressures. Operating profits in the construction materials division fell to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 8.4m). In Europe sales volumes of aggregates fell 7 per cent mainly reflecting the ending of large contracts in the UK south-west. The group has been running down its UK housing operations and completed the sale of 97 new houses in the first half, with 104 homes remaining at the end of June. Proceeds from land sales were Pounds 13.2m, significantly up on last year, and contributed to operating profits of Pounds 6.6m. Net interest expense of Pounds 7.8m was sharply higher than the Pounds 600,000 reported in the 1992 first half. Lex, Page 28</p>

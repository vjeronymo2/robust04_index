			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A Citation/Conviction File which identifies the type of citation and the time, date, and location of the violation; the violator, vehicle and the enforcement agency; and adjudication action and results, including court of jurisdiction (an Enforcement/Citation File could be maintained separate from a Judicial/Conviction File) and fines assessed and collected; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An Emergency Medical Services (EMS) file with emergency care and victim outcome information about ambulance responses to crashes, e.g., emergency care unit, care given, injury data, and times of EMS notification and arrival; information on emergency facility and hospital care, including Trauma Registry data; and medical outcome data relative to crash victims receiving rehabilitation and for those who died as the result of the crash, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions for file linkage through common data elements between the files or through other consistent means; performance level data as part of the traffic records system; demographic data to normalize or adjust for exposure when analyzing the various data in the files; and provisions for the use of cost data relative to amounts spent on countermeasure programs and the costs of fatalities, injuries and property damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Data Characteristics <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Traffic records programs should meet basic requirements for the most effective use of the data by program managers. Accordingly, each State should emphasize the following characteristics: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An accurate identification of the crash location; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timely and accurate data collection and input to all files, and especially to the Accident and Driver Files, to assure maximum utilization and confidence in the traffic records system. Each state is encouraged to join and fully participate in the driver license compact to ensure that complete data is available from other states; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data uniformity, providing for uniform coding and definition of data elements to allow a State to compare its crash problems to other States, regions and the nation; and the use of uniform coding of violations and convictions for the efficient exchange of driver information between States; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data consistency within a State over time to provide for multi-year analysis of data to detect trends and for identification of emerging problems, as well as to determine beneficial effects of highway safety programs; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timely and complete data output to ensure that highway safety program managers will have records that are accessible, understandable, and effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Use of Traffic Records <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The measure of a good records system is the degree to which it is used by those it was designed to serve. Each State should establish a process for the effective use of traffic records by highway safety management, including the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A management process which addresses the role or use of traffic records data in planning (including problem identification), program control, and evaluation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A problem identification strategy that specifies the necessary data, assures that accurate and timely data are available, defines the analyses conducted (including the variables used, statistical tests applied, and trends examined), and describes how results are reported and used; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presentation of analysis results so that they are clearly understood and usable by managers, including the use of problem reports which describe the magnitude of the problems, and appropriate graphs, tables and charts to support the conclusions reached; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

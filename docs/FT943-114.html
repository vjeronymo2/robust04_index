			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Toshiba and IBM form technology alliance Toshiba of Japan and the US's International Business Machines yesterday raised the stakes in the so-called 'microprocessor wars' by announcing an alliance through which Toshiba will adopt IBM technology for some of its key computer products. The companies said Toshiba would license IBM's PowerPC microprocessor design and the AIX operating system. The microprocessor is the heart of a modern computer system, determining the power of the computer and the kind of software it can use. A fierce struggle is raging between semiconductor manufacturers anxious to establish their microprocessors as the industry standard, and so reap the lion's share of royalties from computer manufacturers. Intel of the US is the undisputed leader. Its microprocessors are used in about 90 per cent of the world's personal computers. PowerPC, however, is a new kind of microprocessor known as 'risc', which offers significantly higher performance. Developed by IBM in conjunction with Apple Computer and Motorola, both of the US, it is being used by companies including Canon, Groupe Bull, Hitachi, Tadpole Technology and Thomson-CSF. The chances of a company establishing its microprocessor as the standard increase with the number of licensees. Toshiba, which has a commanding position in portable computers worldwide, is a valuable ally for IBM. Mr Patrick Toole, an IBM vice-president, said: 'This announcement strengthens and extends our alliance with Toshiba while helping establish market acceptance of the PowerPC as the industry-leading risc microprocessor.' The two companies are already working together on advanced liquid crystal displays and semiconductor technologies. Competitors for IBM's PowerPC include Digital Equipment with the Alpha chip, Sun Microsystems with the Sparc chip, and Intel which is working with Hewlett-Packard.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (8): Indonesia leads the drive for expansion - Regional report: the Far East THE FAR East is becoming accustomed to being the exception to the rule. While Japan's economy has suffered from the global recession, many countries in Asia continue to grow at 5 to 10 per cent a year. This has led to a burgeoning demand for pulp and paper in the region, and the industry is set upon expansion. A clutch of figures tells the story: Malaysia's paper industry is expected to average 27 per cent growth between 1991-1995; Thailand's paper demand in 1990 grew 19 per cent; Indonesia's paper capacity is expected to grow by over 30 per cent this year to 3.2m tonnes. The far eastern picture, however, is not just one of growth, but of gradual change, the driving force of which will be Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago with over 13,000 islands and a 185m population. Indonesia's forests, estimated at 144m hectares, are second only in size to Brazil; and, with a per capita income of Dollars 600 a year, the country is labour-competitive. Labour costs, which account for about 22 per cent of Indonesia's total pulp production costs, are one third of Thailand's and Malaysia's, and one tenth of Taiwan's. However, a shortage of international capital, and a decision last year by the government to set ceilings on offshore borrowing, has made financing large pulp projects difficult. Officials of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper Association, estimate that at least seven pulp projects, with a planned total output of 1.7m tonnes, have recently been cancelled or postponed. As Miss Sian Hansen, pulp and paper analyst at Crosby Securities, explains: 'Virgin tropical fibre-pulp has taken a tumble in price, and the plants just couldn't be economical in this kind of world market.' Five projects, however, with a capacity of 3.4m tonnes a year of pulp are in the pipeline. Sinar Mas Group, Indonesia's second largest conglomerate, is installing new pulp plants at its Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia subsidiaries, with capacity of about 2,600 tonnes a day, at a cost of about Dollars 1bn. Industry officials say Barito Pacific plans a plant of 1,500-2,000 tonnes of pulp a day in South Sumatra, to be operational by 1995, at a cost of up to Dollars 1bn; Mr Mohamad Hasan, a wealthy logging concessionaire, is planning a plant of similar size in East Kalimantan; and Indorayon has designs for a 1m tonne a year pulp plant in Riau province. Mr Gus Nilo, managing director of Sinar Mas, believes Indonesia's long-term prospects are bright, and explains that 'the issue is volume. If you cut down all the forests in Vietnam, it would be unable to supply China.' He estimates that only 5 per cent of Indonesia's forests need be turned into plantations for one third of the world's pulp demand to be supplied. Whilst Indonesia's potential in the Far East is unrivalled, it has been slow to exploit its advantage. Miss Hansen estimates that Indonesia is at least 10 years behind Brazil in technology and the development of plantation forests, of which only 326,000 hectares had been planted by the end 1991. Indonesia's underlying competitive advantage makes its emergence as a key player in the market almost inevitable. 'Korea, Taiwan and Japan have pulp mills, but they import the wood. Their wood costs are about four times ours,' explains Mr Nilo. While Brazil remains the cheapest producer, Indonesia should be able to cut costs further as more plantations come on stream, boosting productivity and pulp quality. Miss Hansen forecasts that the typical catchment area for a 200,000-tonnes-a-year pulp mill in Indonesia will fall from a current 32,000 ha toward the 20,000 ha of Brazil. Indonesian companies are already looking toward greater regional integration. Sinar Mas has taken a stake in a paper mill in Ling Po, in southern China. There are plans to invest up to Dollars 200m to expand the plant, the pulp being supplied from Sinar Mas's Indonesian operations. As the industry matures in the Far East, officials believe Indonesia will capitalise on its cheap pulp production to take a greater share of the region's growing paper market. As with pulp, that change is likely to be gradual. In 1990, Japan's paper and board demand totalled 28.2m tonnes, about half the region's consumption. Indonesia is almost alone in the region in producing more paper than it consumes, but net exports in 1991 were only 270,000 tonnes. Although this was a fourfold increase over 1990, further high growth will be constrained by domestic demand, a low 7.5kg in 1990, which is rising by over 10 per cent a year.  --------------------------------------------------------- PER CAPITA PAPER CONSUMPTION: SE ASIAN COUNTRIES (KG)  ---------------------------------------------------------                                  Pop.                                  1990                 1989     1990     (m)  --------------------------------------------------------- Thailand        17.1     20.1    56.7 Malaysia        42.6     47.7    18.0 Indonesia        6.0      7.5   182.6 Philippines      9.3      9.4    62.4 Singapore      190.5    187.0     2.7  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

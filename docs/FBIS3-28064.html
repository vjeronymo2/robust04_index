			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 1 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Former East  Timorese separatist leader Xanana Gusmao may be moved from his  present jail in Jakarta to a prison on isolated Nusakambangan  Island "if all conditions for the transfer are met," a senior  law-enforcing official said Tuesday.    Deputy for intelligence to the attorney general Sukarno was  commenting to newsmen about public suggestions that Gusmao  should be held in a more isolated place after he recently  succeeded in sending a letter overseas protesting his sentencing  by an Indonesian court of justice.    "If all conditions for such a transfer are met, we can move  Xanana to Nusakambangan Island," Sukarno said after attending a  ceremony marking the installation of a number of new officials  at the Attorney General's Office. Sukarno, however, did not  clarify what the conditions were. Gusmao is currently serving a  20-year sentence in Jakarta's Cipinang penitentiary.    He was tried and sentenced to a life-long jail term by a  court of justice in Dili, East Timor's provincial capital, for  acts of armed rebellion committed since 1976. President  Suharto, however, later used his power of pardon to reduce the  sentence to 20 years.    Sukarno said even if Gusmao was actually moved to  Nusakambangan, he would continue to be allowed to send letters  abroad. Nusakambangan, an island off the coast of Cilacap on the  southern coast of Central Java Province, is the location of a  maximum security prison usually reserved for convicts serving  long sentences. Sukarno also categorically denied rumours  alleging that Gusmao would eventually be freed before completing  his jail term. "Don't believe this hearsay. We have no plan at  all to set him free," he said.    East Timor is the youngest Indonesian province. It was  colonized by Portugal for 450 years before it integrated with  Indonesia in 1976.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (CNS)--China's Vice Premier and  Foreign Minister Mr Qian Qichen said to South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu today that China held the two basic  targets should be set for settlement of the issue of the nuclear  fuel in North Korea. They were to promote denuclearization in  the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard peace and stability in the  Korean Peninsula. China considered these two targets were in  conformity with the fundamental interests of all countries in  northeast Asia.    Mr Qian said facing the current difficulties, those sides  concerned should particularly keep calm and remain restrained,  and should not shut the door of negotiations. China appealed to  the sides concerned to continue making efforts to restart talks  so as to leave room and possibility for settlement of the issue.    Mr Qian also said to impose sanctions would not help solve  the problem. On the contrary, it might lead to consequences  which no one wished to see.</p>

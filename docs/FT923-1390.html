			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cantors restructures and attacks rents CANTORS, the Sheffield-based retail furnishing group, yesterday announced a capital restructuring along with a 17 per cent setback in annual profits. Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said the decision to enfranchise the A non-voting ordinary shares reflected the reluctance of certain investors, including institutions, to invest in companies with such capital structures. Holders of the ordinary shares, which currently represent 7.3 per cent of the equity, will receive a compensatory 3-for-2 scrip issue resulting in the issue of 1.5m shares - 9.9 per cent of the enlarged capital. The company also proposes to cancel and repay the 5.25 per cent cumulative preference shares at par. The statement accompanied results for the year to April 25 which showed pre-tax profits down to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 2.53m) on turnover ahead some 11 per cent to Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 57m) - a 'creditable' performance in difficult economic conditions according to Mr Cantor. Efforts to improve margins and control overheads had been offset by unavoidable increases in occupancy costs, particularly from 'upward only' rent reviews. 'If rents were able to reflect economic reality and not some Alice in Wonderland fantasy, they would reduce in recession, lowering overall costs, allowing price reductions and encouraging consumer spending,' he said. The final dividend is maintained at 3p, holding the total at 4p, covered 2.5 times by earnings of 10.01p (12.72p) per share.</p>

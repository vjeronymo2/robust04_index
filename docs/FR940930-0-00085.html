			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Limitations on Screening Mammography Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that the screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography radiologic procedure covered under the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program should not be limited to the four-view procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in &sect;410.34(b)(1) of the interim final rule, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that additional views should be allowed as necessary in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of particular patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As we indicated in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule (55 FR 53513), the basis for specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the screening mammography service must be a bilateral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four-view procedure (that is, cranio-caudal and a medial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lateral oblique view of each breast) is congressional intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as expressed in the Report of the Committee of Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that accompanied Public Law No. 100&hyph;360 (H.R. Rep.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 100&hyph;661, 100th Congress, 2nd Sess. 171 (1988)). In that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report, the conferees stated that they ``understood that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral four-view procedure is currently considered to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard of care in the United States for screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography *&blank;*&blank;* [and] therefore anticipate that this would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially included in the quality standards to be developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Secretary as a requirement for coverage.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recognize that it may be necessary in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some patients to perform more than a bilateral four-view  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure. In view of the possibility that more than four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> images will need to be taken in the case of a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient, we have revised &sect;410.34(b)(1) (redesignated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule as &sect;410.34(d)(1)) to state that generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``the service must, at a minimum, be a four-view  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The need to do additional images will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have any effect on the payment amount that will be allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Medicare screening mammography services because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment amount is prescribed by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To accommodate postmastectomy screening of certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women, however, we will allow, at a minimum, a two-view  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial lateral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oblique view) of the remaining breast for those individuals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and still permit the facility to meet the standard. We are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting that standard as a two-view exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters expressed concern about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limitations on the frequency of coverage of mammography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screenings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As explained in the interim final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (55 FR 53513), the frequency limitations specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;410.34 reflect the provisions imposed by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1834(c)(2) of the Act, except for the high risk factors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were identified in &sect;410.34(b)(4)(i) (redesignated in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule as &sect;410.34(d)(4)(i)). As provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1834(c)(2)(B) of the Act, the frequency limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be revised by the Secretary in consultation with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Cancer Institute (NCI). This matter is under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration, and will be addressed in a later notice, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discuss the importance of women having a clinical breast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination performed by a physician that would supplement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preventive value of using the Medicare screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography benefit. The commenter acknowledged that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare law authorizing screening mammography coverage does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not provide for coverage and payment for a clinical breast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination as part of the screening mammography benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the commenter suggested that this final rule, at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum, indicate that a supplementary clinical breast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination performed by a physician be recommended in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with a screening mammography examination and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related physician's interpretation of the results of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiologic examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenter is correct. We do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the legal authority under the screening mammography benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide for coverage and payment for a clinical breast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination performed by a physician in conjunction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of screening mammography services. We understand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that NCI, ACS, the American Medical Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (AMA), the American Society of Internal Medicine, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Medical Association, the American Academy of Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Physicians, the American College of Radiology, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialty groups recommend that a combination of screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography and a clinical breast examination is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a complete early breast cancer detection program. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this regard, NCI publishes public information brochures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explain screening mammography and strongly advise that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doctor also perform a clinical breast examination to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement the value of the screening service. Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about breast cancer screening, including information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the importance of clinical breast examinations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be obtained, free of charge, by calling the NCI-funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cancer Information Service at 1&hyph;800&hyph;4&hyph;CANCER.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter questioned the inclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``not given birth prior to age 30'' as a factor indicating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high risk of developing breast cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

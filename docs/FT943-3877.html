			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Main parties share honours in German state elections The Christian Democratic Union and their Social Democrat rivals yesterday won decisive victories in two regional elections in Germany, which have been see as an early test of the parties' standing before the federal elections next month. The CDU prime minister of the eastern German state of Saxony, Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, and the Social Democratic prime minister of Brandenburg, Mr Manfred Stolpe, were returned to power with absolute majorities, according to exit polls, conducted by ARD state television and by later computer predictions. The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to the former east German communist party also increased its share of the vote, becoming the third largest party in both states. Yet the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Kohl's governing CDU coalition, and the Bundnis 90/Green party failed to get the 5 per cent minimum required to enter either of the two parliaments. The interpretation of the vote was complicated by turn outs of less than half eligible voters. In Saxony, the only state where the CDU has an absolute majority, Mr Biedenkopf, a former former general secretary of the CDU, was returned with 57.7 per cent of the vote, three points higher than in 1990. Mr Biedenkopf said in a television interview: 'I am very happy. But I want to use my second term in office to speak on behalf of all Saxons.' The SPD failed to make inroads in Saxony, winning only 17 per cent of the vote, 2 points less than in 1990. The FDP's share of the vote was cut from 6.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent and the Bundnis 90/Greens's vote fell from 5.6 per cent to 4.3 per cent, leaving both parties outside parliament. The PDS vote rose from 10.2 per cent in 1990 to more than 16 per cent. In Brandenburg, the only eastern German state with an SPD-led coalition government, the party's share of the vote rose from 38.2 per cent in 1990 to 53.5 per cent. But the strong showing may reflect the special factors at play in eastern German politics rather than national trends. The CDU's share of the vote collapsed from 29.4 per cent in 1990 to less than 20 per cent. The FDP vote fell from 6.6 per cent to 2.3 per cent, and the Bundnis 90/Greens vote also dropped from 9.3 per cent to under 2.9 per cent. By contrast, the PDS share of the vote rose from 13.4 per cent to 18.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (4): Hard-hitting rules opposed - How the Budget tax changes will affect companies FOUR of the top five relocation management companies have formed themselves into a consortium to lobby the Inland Revenue, Treasury officials and anyone else who has the chancellor's ear over the changes he made in the March Budget. Mr Norman Lamont plans to raise Pounds 200m from a change of rules. Relocation expenses are to be capped at Pounds 8,000 per employee. Over that figure they are to be taxed as a perk of the job. The strict ceiling - which overturns a 40-year-old principle that all reasonable removal expenses should be tax exempt - is to apply immediately. Anyone accepting a job move since the tax year began is to be caught, as well as all those making the move after August 1. The four management companies - Black Horse Relocation Services, Lloyds Bank's specialist subsidiary and the market leader; Pricoa, longest in the field and now owned by Prudential of America; PHH, the Californian-based multi-service operation; and Hambros Bank offshoot, Hambro Countrywide Relocation - reluctantly concede that this is no moment to defend unlimited tax exemptions. But they intend to argue specifically that: The Chancellor has picked his Pounds 8,000 figure out of the blue. The true average cost of relocating is Pounds 25,600 according to a recent industry survey. The tax exempt ceiling should be immediately lifted to Pounds 25,000. The transitional timetable is unfairly tight; since companies take their relocation decisions years ahead of a move, Mr Lamont's plan amounts to retrospective taxation. The old system should apply to employees deciding to move before April 6, 1994 and carrying out the move before April 6, 1996. The third point has as much to do with a long-running battle between the Inland Revenue and the industry as with the Budget. Under the 40-year-old rules on relocation, tax relief was available on all reasonable expenses if a job move involved a change of residence. Good plain English, you might think. About 1987, however, some Inland Revenue inspectors began to take a dim view of employees who merely rented out their old houses rather than selling them before moving jobs. They claimed that this did not amount to a 'change of residence' and housing costs during the move were therefore disallowable. Then came the property slump and failing to sell one's old home often became involuntary. The management companies tired of overturning unfavourable Inland Revenue rulings, case by case, on appeal. The consortium simply wants the change of residence condition abolished. Similar arguments are also being marshalled by the CBI; its chief executive, Howard Davies, has written to Treasury Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, protesting that relocation expenses are not a perk, and a meeting is to be arranged with the Inland Revenue. The CBI, in fact, goes one step further than the consortium: it wants the expenses ceiling abolished altogether. Nationwide Relocations, the eponymous building society's subsidiary thought to have the second largest market share, chose not to join the consortium. Instead it will be making its own, separate but identical, submissions to the Revenue, Treasury officials and MPs. The consortium has hired one of the leading employee benefits tax specialists, Michael Kaltz of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, to advise them. He declares: 'I hope and have some anticipation that ministers and the Revenue will move on this.' But if they do not? 'Make no mistake, this will hit us hard,' admits Dominic Yeo, marketing manager at Nationwide. He is speaking for the industry as a whole. Even before the Budget, professional relocation companies were thought to be involved in little more than 25 per cent of the 100,000 or so annual relocations linked to job moves. Three quarters of job movers must still go it alone or rely on personnel officers or what the trade calls 'home searchers' - estate agents offering to take on the burden of finding an individual a new home in an unfamiliar town or county. Professional relocation managers typically act as the employer's agent, ensuring that transfers of key personnel go smoothly. Sometimes the company itself is on the move, sometimes only the staff. In either case, finding new homes is only a small part of the whole. All the leading players are capable of funding an entire move, either by means of offering bridging finance (against an indemnity from the employer) or by buying up the vacated property (at a price based on an agreed minimum valuation). In a falling or sluggish market that can be expensive so any skill in shortening the process is a selling point. Phoenix Relocation, a relative newcomer to the industry in its present form, makes much of its 'open days' on which it displays vacated houses to potential buyers after careful spring cleaning. The range of services includes advising incoming staff on schools or opportunities for working spouses. It all depends on how much support the employer offers. And that is where the Budget will rub. Companies that need to move staff will have to gross up the costs once they rise beyond Pounds 8,000 to compensate individuals for the tax liability. But since the grossed up amount will be treated as income and thus taxable, a second grossing up will be necessary, and possibly a third. Michael Kaltz estimates that the tax burden to the company could be 76 per cent under the Chancellor's proposals. Michael Lansley, managing director of Hambro Countrywide which moved nearly 3,000 employees last year, believes the Budget will force companies to rely less on moving employees and more on using available talent in the new area  -which could damage individual career prospects and discourage job mobility. But the more immediate effect may be on the moving companies themselves. Corporate budgets being what they are, especially during recession, company directors faced with the increased costs imposed by the Budget, may have little choice but to do without the extra services offered by professional relocation managers, or even without them altogether.</p>

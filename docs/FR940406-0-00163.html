			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. A new &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001 is added to subpart K to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1)(i) For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts N, I, and P of this part. The Administrator, may on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in subparts N, I, and P of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts N, I, and P of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For heavy-duty vehicles the prescribed test procedures are the Fuel Dispensing Spitback Test as described in &sect;86.1246&hyph;96 (for HDVs with a GVW of less than 14,000 pounds (6,400 kilograms)); this test for fuel spitback is conducted as a stand alone test, thus all references to the test sequence described in figure M96&hyph;1 of subpart M of this part can be ignored. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in subpart M of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subpart M of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedures are the Federal Test Procedure, including the refueling test procedure or the fuel spitback test, whichever is applicable, as described in subpart B of this part, the idle test procedure as described in subpart P of this part, the cold temperature CO test procedure as described in subpart C of this part, and the Certification Short Test as described in subpart O of this part. For purposes of Selective Enforcement Audit Testing, the manufacturer shall not be required to perform any of the test procedures in subpart B of this part relating to evaporative emission testing, other than refueling emissions testing, except as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The Administrator may select and prescribe the sequence of any CSTs. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in subparts B, C, P, and O of this part for any motor vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts B, C, P, and O of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart B of this part are applicable to Selective Enforcement Audit testing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel meeting the specifications for mileage and service accumulation fuels of &sect;86.113&hyph;94. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified in this section only with the advance approval of the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may drain the test fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(b) and &sect;86.152&hyph;98(a), provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA test vehicles other than the preconditioning specified in &sect;86.132&hyph;96 only in the additional preconditioning had been performed on certification test vehicles of the same configuration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the time period specified in &sect;86.133&hyph;90(a). All references to an evaporative emission enclosure and analyzing for HC during the heat build can be ignored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph &sect;86.135&hyph;90(e):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the slave tires are the same size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the cold start exhaust emission test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96 shall follow the heat build procedure described in &sect;86.133&hyph;90 by not more than one hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

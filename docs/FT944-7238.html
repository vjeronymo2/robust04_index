			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Japanese banks fail to arrest slide The long earnings slump at Japanese banks showed no signs of abating yesterday as the leading lenders reported sharply lower profits for the six months to the end of September. The gradual removal of the pile of bad loans accumulated in the collapse of the Japanese property market in the past few years was reflected in bigger write-offs of bad debts. The provisions for problem loans caused a further slide in pre-tax profits, but they also began to make inroads into the outstanding total of disclosed bad loans, which now appears to have passed its peak. But the asset quality problems were compounded by rising interest rates and weak demand for lending which cut into banks' core business profits. Aggregate operating profits at the 11 leading banks fell 6 per cent from a year earlier to Y1,092bn (Pounds 7bn). Write-offs of bad loans cut pre-tax profits 41 per cent to Y233bn. Between them the 11 banks wrote off Y1,341bn in non-performing loans, up 60 per cent. The outstanding balance of non-performing loans fell by Y222bn to Y8,726bn. But these figures include only loans to bankrupt borrowers and loans on which no interest has been paid for at least six months. They do not include restructured loans, where interest rates have been pared to keep borrowers from going under. Real problem loan totals are thought to be up to double the disclosed figures.

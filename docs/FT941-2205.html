			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Marks and Spencer forges Turkish link Marks and Spencer, the stores group, has formed its first franchise operation in Turkey linking with a local petrol and fast foods group. M&amp;S has announced that Turk Petrol Holding, an oil retailer 42 per cent owned by Burmah Castrol, had been chosen from some 46 original applications. The venture will make use of the marketing opportunities provided at TPH's outlets, although the company stressed the main reason for the link up was TPH's 'entrepreneurship and progressive management'. TPH has more than 650 retail filling stations throughout Turkey, 10 per cent of a market which is growing by 5 per cent a year. TPH is also expanding its consumer business and is the local franchisee to Wendy Hamburger. M&amp;S franchise will open one store before the year end, stocking a full range of clothes and household appliances. The company said it wanted to 'keep pace with the opportunities'. Turkey's retail sector is growing rapidly in line with urbanisation, rising incomes and a new awareness of foreign brands. Carrefour of France opened its first megastore last November. The French stores, Prisunic and Promodes of France, are both in negotiations with local partners.</p>

Ciskei  Attorney General Willem Jurgens said he has decided to postpone  any decision on whether to prosecute until Ciskei was  reincorporated into South Africa, after the April general  election. Mr. Jurgens' statement follows the Bisho Supreme  Court's recent decision to overturn the ruling Military  Council's decree indemnifying all the soldiers involved in the  shooting of African National Congress protest marchers.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: National Power says output to fall by 13% NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, said yesterday it expected output to fall by 13 per cent to 95 terrawatt hours this year as competition for its coal-fired plants from nuclear power and gas-fired stations increased. The forecast reduction follows a 7 per cent fall to 109 terrawatt hours last year. Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, told the company's annual meeting that it would be difficult to match profit growth of recent years. However, the current level of dividend cover provided scope for continuing increases in dividends. Mr Brian Birkenhead, finance director, said the company intended to reduce dividend cover to about two and a half times, depending on market circumstances. Last year dividends were covered 3.1 times by earnings. The City took news of prospective falls in market share calmly. SG Warburg expects earnings per share growth this year to be about 10 per cent, against 15 per cent last year.</p>

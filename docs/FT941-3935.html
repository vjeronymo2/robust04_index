			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Shocked, shaken but surviving: Patti Waldmeir says the battle of Bophuthatswana has led to a realignment in South Africa's politics When a lone black soldier turned his rifle on two wounded rightwing whites lying in the blood and dust of a Bophuthatswana street on Friday, and pulled the trigger to execute them, South Africa reached a turning point. With any luck, that gruesome incident - the first time in recent South African history that the armed white right has confronted blacks and come out the loser - will turn the tide of events in a positive direction. Anyone who saw the terrified faces of the two wounded men as they begged for mercy, anyone who watched as truckloads of the racist white fled Bophuthatswana with black soldiers in furious pursuit, cannot doubt that the right was dealt a salutary shock when its lunatic foray into Bophuthatswana ended in humiliation. There are already signs that the shock has sent at least some rightwing leaders scurrying to their senses: General Constand Viljoen, the Afrikaner leader who despatched rightwing 'troops' to the homeland in the first place, said the homeland fiasco had provoked him to drop his plans to boycott April's all-race elections. At midnight on Friday night, he submitted a list of candidates to fight the election under the banner of the Freedom Front, a party created by him to pursue the demand for an Afrikaner homeland via the ballot box. By yesterday afternoon, his commitment to electoral participation appeared to be wavering, with his close ally, Mr Rowan Cronje, foreign minister of Bophuthatswana, saying Gen Viljoen was reconsidering his position. But whatever he decides, the Bophuthatswana episode appears to have provoked a split in the right wing which cannot be healed, leaving the neo-Nazi leader Eugene Terreblanche and the white supremacist Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the ultra-right Conservative Party - the real villains of the battle of Bophuthatswana - isolated from the mass of rightwing Afrikaners, who may be frightened, perhaps even racist, but who recoil at racial confrontation. Such a split must be good news for South Africa's election prospects, for it will weaken the case for violent struggle and give ordinary Afrikaners an electoral outlet for their fears and a constitutional means of demonstrating whether there is widespread support for a 'volkstaat' (an Afrikaner homeland). But the split could hold as much threat as promise: for the paramilitary right has been held in check, at least partially, through Mr Terreblanche's alliance with Gen Viljoen, an alliance which now appears irrevocably ended. Marginalised by the new politics of the right, and enraged by the execution of rightwing whites by blacks in Bophuthatswana, Mr Terreblanche's AWB could prove more rather than less dangerous. Of the many snapshots of horror provided by last week's events in Mmabatho and its twin city, Mafikeng, the most shocking image was of black bodies slumped in the streets of Mafikeng, killed by whites who drew fire in their turn from black troops and police. As a black South African television cameraman said at the time: 'the race war has begun'. African National Congress leader Popo Molefe, candidate for premier of the new Northwest province which includes Bophuthatswana, appeared to endorse the killing of whites, saying that the execution 'leaves me cold', repeating the comment made by Minister of Police Jimmy Kruger nearly 20 years ago, that the death of black liberation leader Steve Biko left him, similarly, 'cold'. South Africans must hope that the turning point reached on Friday was the beginning of the end of the extreme white right, rather than the start of a new racial conflict. South African newspapers were quick to declare yesterday that the battle of Bop marked the definitive defeat of the paramilitary right. Unfortunately, events do not bear that out: the whites who invaded Bophuthatswana in the dark of Thursday night left in confusion and humiliation on Friday; but they were not routed. Most withdrew under orders from their commander, Gen Viljoen, without ever entering the capital; some 3,000 spent the day at an air base several kilometres from Mmabatho, and withdrew under escort of South African troops, after Bophuthatswana president Lucas Mangope (since removed from office) asked Gen Viljoen to send them home. Those chased through the streets of Mafikeng by black troops were a minority. What the white right learned at Mmabatho was that it could not take on an army - whether the 3,500 strong Bophuthatswana Defence Force, or the far more powerful South African Army. But largely, they knew that already; direct confrontation between rightwing and loyal South African armies was never the main threat to the country's transition. Small groups of fanatic rightwingers engaged in sabotage and terrorism posed the greatest danger; they still do. The battle of Bop may have deflated the bravado of the right, but it has not removed the menace. Still, Gen Viljoen's defection to the political centre (assuming he does not reverse it in coming weeks) will strengthen the critical mass of parties accepting the new constitution, and broaden the legitimacy of the election. One major party - arguably the most important of the dissenters, the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi - remains publicly committed to boycotting the election. ANC leaders are hoping that Chief Buthelezi will suffer the same fate as President Mangope: a civil servants' revolt, coupled with police mutiny, toppling him from power. For the moment, this seems unlikely. But Gen Viljoen's decision to stand for election has split not only the white right, but the whole of the rightwing Freedom Alliance, which used to include Inkatha, Viljoen's Afrikaner Volksfront and the Bophuthatswana government. Now the Bop government has been removed from power, the Afrikaner Volksfront is disintegrating after Gen Viljoen's resignation to head the new party (the Freedom Front), only Inkatha is left boycotting the election. The threat of countrywide disruption had been based on the fact that the white right is distributed throughout South Africa, while Inkatha's influence is localised. The weekend's events must undermine the geographical scope of a boycott outside Inkatha's heartland of Natal province, and certain townships of the East Rand near Johannesburg. But Natal is the country's most populous province, and disrupted elections there would seriously undermine the result's legitimacy. The lesson of the past few months of negotiations has been that no breakdown is ever, quite, final. Time is short, Inkatha is still protesting loudly that it will resist the poll, and April's ballots are already being printed. But the ANC still holds out hope that Inkatha will make a late decision to enter the poll. The battle of Bop has generated a realignment in South African politics; but if the scene has been shaken up, it has not yet settled down. Today, Gen Viljoen is due to meet Chief Buthelezi for what could prove another decisive showdown. Perhaps the white right will persuade black conservatives to accept elections; perhaps the opposite will be true. For the moment, the situation in South Africa remains, as it has been for months, fluid. If anything, the recent dramatic events may have made the perilous transition to democracy slightly easier.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> ACCELERATING MORTGAGE PAYMENTS CAN PAY OFF  </P> <P> QUESTION: My wife and I are both 23 years young. A year and a half ago we  purchased a town house with a 30-year mortgage. We are thinking of moving in  approximately three years. Would you consider it wise to accelerate payments in  this case? In the event of a sale would my wife and I accrue profits reflecting  these additional "principal only" payments?  </P> <P> ANSWER: I don't have the sort of crystal ball that can tell me whether you are  going to have any profit in the sale of this town house or not. After all,  we're looking about three years into the future when, presumably, "Rambo IX"  will be ready for release. But we can work out a "what if?" scenario that might  help.  </P> <P> Let's say that you have a 30-year, $50,000 mortgage on your town house at 10%  that calls for monthly payments of $438.79 (principal and interest only). Down  the street, your neighbors, the Hatfields, have exactly the same mortgage. The  difference is that, with the first payment, you started adding $100 extra to  your monthly payment to principal. Not so with the Hatfields.  </P> <P> After five years (you've been there a year and a half and are planning to spend  another three, so that's close enough) you sell -- as do the Hatfields. How  much "profit" either of you end up with is determined by subtracting from the  sales price your selling expenses and how much you still owe your lender,  right? Let's say that both your town house and the Hatfields' have appreciated  to $60,000 and sell for that. Ignoring the selling costs, the Hatfields will  walk away with $11,714 because they still owe their lender $48,286 of the  original $50,000 loan.  </P> <P> And you? You'll walk away with $19,457 because you only owe your lender  $40,543. That's makes you $7,743 better off than the Hatfields in just five  years -- during which time you will also have paid your lender $1,744 less in  interest than the Hatfields have.  </P> <P> It's a hard way to build up a nest egg -- paying out a cool $438.79 a month on  your mortgage and seeing a fat $23 of it building up your equity in the home.  That's the average reduction of principal in the first year of a 30-year, 10%  mortgage on a $50,000 home. By painlessly accelerating principal payments you  can save thousands in mortgage interest, build up equity quickly and lop years  off your payoff time.

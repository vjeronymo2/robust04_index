			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Into jargon Sir, 'Hogarth was likewise deeply into poetry' said Anthony Curtis in his book review ('Hogarth, high art, low life', August 28). It gave me a jolt. Your columns are remarkably free of jargon. I enjoyed the rest of the article very much, but coming across this horror was like snapping a tooth on an olive stone secreted in a sandwich.

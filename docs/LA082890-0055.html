			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO TRY CASH INSTEAD OF FOOD STAMPS  </P> <P> In an innovative program designed to save money and increase the self-esteem of  food stamp recipients, San Diego County will begin paying cash instead of  coupons on Sept. 1, county officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Called a "full cash-out implementation," the unique program is being hailed by  county, state and federal officials as a model for national welfare reform,  said county officials familiar with the plan.  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairman Leon Williams and other officials said that  giving food stamp clients cash instead of coupons will reduce program costs  while increasing the recipients' self-esteem.  </P> <P> Some critics within the county Social Services Department have warned, however,  that giving food stamp recipients cash instead of coupons might lead to more  abuse and ultimately increase the cost of the program.  </P> <P> Legally, food stamp coupons can be used only to purchase food and cannot be  used to buy liquor, cigarettes or other non-food items. A cash-only program  will carry with it none of those restrictions, making it impossible to monitor  how the money is being used, said one social services employee, who did not  want to be identified.  </P> <P> County officials countered that they expect no more fraud than under the  current food stamp program, which has spawned a black market in which the  coupons trade for less than their face value. Under the new system, recipients  will need proper identification to cash the county-issued checks.  </P> <P> According to the Social Services Department, an estimated 46,000 households and  139,000 people receive food stamp assistance in San Diego County. The county,  the fifth largest in population in the United States, proposed the ambitious  plan to state and federal officials last year and initiated a pilot program  involving 20% of the county's food stamp clients in July, 1989.  </P> <P> The county has received federal approval to expand the program to include all  food stamp households.  </P> <P> An official announcement is expected today by federal, state and county county  officials.  </P> <P> County officials familiar with the plan say it will save $600,000 in  administrative costs at the state, county and federal levels between September,  1990, and July, 1991. The cost of the food stamp program in the county,  currently about $67 million, is funded entirely by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture.  </P> <P> By mailing food stamp clients a monthly check instead of coupons, the county  saves thousands of dollars in postage fees for the 590,000 food stamp packets  it mails. In addition, the county will be able to close its food stamp issuance  center and will no longer have to pay an armored transport company to handle  the coupons.  </P> <P> "The pilot program was such an overwhelming success last year. We projected a  savings of $86,000 but saved $150,000 instead," said a county official who  asked not to be named before today's planned announcement.  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairman Leon Williams and other officials said that  besides reducing costs, giving food stamp clients cash instead will increase  the recipients' self-esteem.  </P> <P> "Food stamps put a person at a disadvantage. It's a put-down and a humiliating  thing to have food stamps in a grocery line," Williams said in a telephone  interview. " . . . You have to take away factors that diminish a person. You  have to give a person back his or her dignity."  </P></p>

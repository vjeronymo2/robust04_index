			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Syndicated Loans: Turkish bank leads return to market WITH the Gulf crisis keeping Turkish borrowers away from the syndicated loans market, last week heralded the first significant financing for a Turkish name in several months. Turkiye Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest privately-owned commercial bank, is arranging a one-year Dollars 100m facility through Chase Investment Bank. The deal will provide money for the bank's Turkish customers to finance exports. Turkiye Is Bankasi has not borrowed in the Euroloan market since 1988. Chase, the underwriter and arranger of the loan, is now in the process of finding other banks to sub-underwrite slots of Dollars 15m with an underwriting fee of 15 basis points. Once this has been arranged, Chase will start syndicating the loan. Bankers said the interest margin was 62 1/2 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), and there was a drawing down fee of 12 1/2 basis points (the drawing down period is three months). Bankers point out that a 75 basis point total on each drawing denotes a reasonably aggressive pricing for a Turkish borrower. The commitment fee on the undrawn portion is 37 1/2 basis points. During the Gulf war, the syndicated loan market was virtually closed to Turkish industrial borrowers. Terms were particularly unfavourable, creating, according to bankers, a lot of pent-up demand. Bankers point out that the pricings for the handful of small loans which did emerge were rather high. They point to Esbank of Turkey, which has a Dollars 25m one-year loan arranged by the Bank of New York Capital Markets with an interest margin of 100 basis points. As the Turkiye Is Bankasi deal is the largest facility to emerge from Turkey for several months, its progress will be watched with interest by other Turkish borrowers waiting to come to the market. American General, the US insurance and financial services group, arranged a much larger facility last week: a Dollars 2.6bn one-year transaction through Credit Suisse First Boston and Chemical Bank. The facility is a back-up to the company's commercial paper programme; in essence a standby credit which American General can fall back on in the event of the US commercial paper market drying up again (which is what happened after the default of Wang Laboratories on the repayment of its short-term debt in 1989). There is a facility fee of  1/8 point, and the interest margin is  1/4 point over Libor. Mirror Group Newspapers, the company that Mr Robert Maxwell plans to float soon, has arranged a Pounds 150m, three-year revolving credit intended for the company's use once it is a public company. It is an offer with four joint arrangers - Barclays Bank (which is also the book runner doing the actual syndication), Credit Lyonnais, Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank. Terms have not been disclosed. A clutch of Italian borrowers has come to the syndicated loan market in recent weeks. Of these, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's investment arm (BNL) is arranging a medium-term Ecu430m (Dollars 546m) syndicated loan for Sezione Autonoma di Credito Fondiario di BNL, its mortgage finance arm. BNL is syndicating an Ecu227m tranche with a seven-and-a half-year maturity. The commitment fee is 15 basis points and the interest margin is 32 1/2 basis points over Libor for the first three years and 35 basis points over Libor thereafter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             EUROMARKET TURNOVER (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Market                      Straights  Conv     FRN       Other US dollars          1,360.2     0.0     141.0     12,275.0 Prev                    0.0   175.0      59.0      9,768.4 Other               2,462.0   130.8      35.6     11,397.4 Prev                1,214.1   297.3       0.0      5,130.0 Secondary Market US dollars         18,711.6   661.2   8,873.5      9,427.5 Prev               14,476.1 1,086.0   6,901.5      5,577.5 Other              27,247.4 1,825.9   3,258.1     37,919.9 Prev               26,974.8   639.8   2,383.4     37,827.3               Cedel       Euroclear      Total US dollars   20,088.1     31,361.9     51,450.0 Prev         13,255.5     24,788.0     38,043.5 Other        33,094.2     51,182.9     84,277.1 Prev         32,841.9     41,624.8     74,466.7 Week to   April 11, 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: AIBD  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> MAYOR PLANS TO RESIGN, MOVE TO SAN CLEMENTE  </P> <P> Mayor William Davis said Friday that he will resign at the end of February.  </P> <P> Davis, 49, and his wife, are planning to move from Cypress to San Clemente in  March. He said the move will make it more convenient for him to travel to see  clients of his at Bell Atlantic Leasing Corp. in Costa Mesa, who are scattered  around the county.  </P> <P> Davis said he had planned to announce his resignation after Tuesday's special  election, but word leaked after his house was sold about 2 weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It's a small town," he said. "When you put your house on the market, people  are going to know."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, voters will decide the fate of a controversial proposed commercial  development called Cypress Downs, which surrounds the Los Alamitos race track.  Davis supports the plan.  </P> <P> "We worked on that plan until it made sense for the city," he said.  </P> <P> Davis, a 16-year resident of Cypress, has served as mayor since November. He  has been on the City Council since 1986.  </P> <P> Cypress' four remaining council members must appoint a new mayor within 30 days  after Davis' resignation, or a special election will be held to select his  successor.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>   [Text] Havana 23 Apr (PL) -- Miami resident Magda Montiel  is happy to know that many of the emigrants attending a meeting  with the Cuban authorities have put aside their arrogance, which  is a result of defeats, and are thinking of the welfare of their  country.    Montiel, a former congressional candidate for the State of  Florida, and 209 other emigrants are attending "The Nation and  the Emigrants" conference under way in Havana.    According to Montiel, this conference, which she describes  as  a "reencounter with the homeland," is a very important step that  has been very well accepted by the Cuban community living  abroad, including those who once decided to invade the island or  were members of terrorist groups.    Montiel believes the fact that mercenaries, who were part of  the foiled Bay of Pigs invasions in 1961, are now willing to  talk with the same government they tried to overthrow 30 years  ago is very important and will be remembered and written about  in the pages of history.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Montiel said that for  days prior to the conference the television stations as well as  the newspapers talked about the conference and tried to play  down its importance. Montiel added that there were even people  who invented and spread rumors that Fidel Castro was sick.    Montiel recalled that self-appointed Cuban President Jorge  Mas Canosa, head of the ultrarightist Cuban-American National  Foundation (FNCA), has appointed a cabinet and announced the  creation of an emergency junta "to be prepared for any action."    The Cuban emigrant added that in the past few days she has  seen Mas Canosa more scared and angry than usual, especially  when his distorted features are picked up by the television  cameras saying: "Let Castro's friends go to Cuba to eat  lobsters."    According to Montiel, defeated in the elections by Liliana  Ross Lethinen, an ultrarightist and a FNCA protegee, "the United  States and the Cubans living abroad do not have the right to  dictate what should happen in Cuba; that is up to those who live  on the island."    I believe changes must be made on the island because of the  severe economic crisis the country is confronting. Even the  government admits this. But these changes must be made in  accordance to the needs of the people and those who lead them,  Montiel added.    Regarding another kind of change, Montiel said that if the  Cubans did not want their president, he would not be in power  because "our people's spirit of rebellion does not accept  impositions." On the need to respect the sovereignty of the  nation, Montiel said that "we must let the Cubans in Cuba solve  their problems, and, if necessary, we who are outside should  support them as neighbors should."    Montiel opposes a return to the Cuba of the past. The Cuban  emigrant recalled her happy and fortunate childhood in the Nuevo  Vedado neighborhood in Havana where Santa Claus visited her and  brought her lots of toys while other children were shoeless and  did not even have milk to drink.    I did not see the Mafia or the corruption prior to 1959, but  my parents did, and I know it existed even though there are some  who refuse to admit it, Montiel added. According to Montiel,  the ultra rightists think of yesterday's Cuba (before the  Revolution) as a paradise where everything was rose-colored; but  today, she added, it is a sin to admit the achievements of the  Revolution.    Montiel added that she left the country when she was eight  years old and that it was very difficult to leave her home, her  grandmother, her friends, and the way she lived in Cuba to go to  Miami where everything was different, where one lives in  constant fear of having one's children stolen, even at the  airport or at a shopping center.    Montiel, a well-known lawyer, has her law practice in Miami  and is currently a member of the Cuban Committee for Democracy  (CCD), even though she does not share many of the ideas of the  organization. When asked about the elections in which she ran  against Ross Lethinen for a seat in the U.S. Congress, Montiel  said that had she won she would have shown the rest of the U.S.  Congressmen that not all Cuban emigrants think like those who  support a U.S. blockade.</p>

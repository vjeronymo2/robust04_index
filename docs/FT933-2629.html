			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Store opening costs hit Era as losses increase THE COSTS of opening four additional stores were partly responsible for a near doubling of losses at Era Group, the specialist retailer, to Pounds 2.59m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. The deficit, which compared with Pounds 1.66m before, was struck from a turnover little changed at Pounds 29.2m (Pounds 29.35m). The company is best known for its Beatties model and toys chain. A sales deterioration in the opening quarter following a lack of consumer confidence was compensated for by an improved sales performance in the second quarter. The group suffered only a slight erosion of gross margins despite severe competitive pressures on pricing and the impact of the increased sterling cost of imported products. Mr Anthony Fay, the chairman, said the recovery in sales in the second quarter had continued following improving consumer confidence. He added that if this trend continued, 'it should prove particularly advantageous . . . particularly as trading is strongly biased towards November and December.' The extra stores were also expected to generate additional sales during the important Christmas trading period. Half year losses per share widened from 2.07p to 3.19p.</p>

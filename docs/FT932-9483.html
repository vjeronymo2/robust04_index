			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Wal-Mart eases growth worries WAL-MART Stores, the expansion-minded US discount store group and the nation's top-selling retailer, yesterday eased some of the concerns over its growth prospects, with a 16 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits. It said it was 'on track' to meet sales and earnings targets for the rest of the year. Wal-Mart's after-tax profits in the quarter to end-April totalled Dollars 450.6m, up 16 per cent on the Dollars 387m in the same period of 1992. Sales rose to Dollars 13.9bn, a 19 per cent improvement over the Dollars 11.6bn in 1992. At the per share level, earnings increased to 20 cents from 17 cents. Wal-Mart shares rose Dollars 1 to to close at Dollars 27. They have been trading close to 52-week low, as Wall Street has questioned whether Wal-Mart's growth rate would slow. There have also been doubts over the potential for the US 'warehouse club' sector - high-volume, deep-discount outlets. Wal-Mart, with 277 Sam's Clubs stores, is one of the biggest 'warehouse' operators.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Management: Desert island manager - Sir Richard Sykes Yorkshireman Sir Richard Sykes prefers to relax on mountain walking holidays rather than by the beach. Nevertheless, the chief executive of Glaxo, the world's second biggest drugs company, relishes the prospect of being marooned on a desert island. He is one of the few scientists who have fought their way to the very top of the drugs industry. Could you carry on your business from the island? I might even have a clearer idea of the business than from here in Berkeley Square. I would need telephones, fax and a notebook computer, then could comment on and make decisions from the island. With the extra time I had, it could add up to even better decision-making. Who would you take with you? An astronomer. I've always been fascinated by the stars. With those long evenings and clear skies, what a perfect opportunity to study the stars. What would you take for sustenance? As a variation from the plentiful fish, I would like to take dried pasta and porcini. They are preserved and should last a while. And to drink, a few crates of Brunello. It would be too difficult to cool any white wines. Any entertainment to accompany the food and wine? For music, I would like to take Brahms' four symphonies conducted by Toscanini. He is incomparable. There was a wonderful television series called Search for the Nile narrated by James Mason. That series would help me associate with explorers and pioneers. And for a book I would take Scott's Last Expedition. Would you become a beach bum? I'm not the sort of person who would lie around on the beach. I need discipline and would exercise for at least an hour a day. I need to keep in top condition both physically and mentally. I'd need to build that astronomical observatory after all. How would you keep mentally fit? Apart from the work running the business, I understand there are some very good bridge and chess programs for computers. Would you try to escape? Initially it would be quite nice on the island. But a time would come when I would have to consider alternatives. I'm quite practical and I'm sure I could build what was necessary to leave. What would you most like about the island? Solitude. I'd miss my family, but I don't have a problem being on my own. And I would not miss driving down the A40 every day. What would you dislike about being there? After a time, it would be that there is no access to culture or to my family. Are there any conditions you want to impose on your island? None. It should be a natural island, unspoiled.</p>

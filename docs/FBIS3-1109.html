			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claire Roberston] </F>   [Text] A Goldstone commission sub-committee has singled out  South Africa's top policeman, General Johan van der Merwe, for  scathing criticism. The Wallis sub-committee, set up in 1992 to  investigate the causes of violence in Natal, charges General van  der Merwe with having twice blocked bold initiatives by his  senior officers to root out alleged SAP [South African Police]  misconduct in Natal in the past.    The general yesterday dismissed the charge as "naive and  stupid".    During sittings in Natal, the sub-committee under Mr M.J.D.  Wallis, SC, was inundated with allegations that police had  delayed investigations and that members of the force had  perpetrated acts of violence. Faced with a mountain of unsolved  cases, many of which had never been processed properly, the  sub-committee, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC [African  National Congress] agreed to identify a workable number of  solvable cases in the Port Shapestone area. All parties would  cooperate in bringing these cases to trial as a "very small  first step in restoring community trust in the police force",  they agreed in February last year. Local police accepted the  plan, but approval from headquarters has still not been obtained  more than a year later. General van der Merwe had ignored  approaches by the Goldstone Commission, the report said.    Yesterday the general said he was not aware of the request.    In May last year, General van der Merwe assured the  committee  of his "sincere desire" to improve relations between the police  and the community. Three months later, he blocked a bold plan  to root out police misconduct in the Natal Midlands hours before  it was to be placed before the committee. The entire Natal SAP  hierarchy had approved the establishment of a police  investigation unit to investigate allegations of police  misconduct in the Natal Midlands. At the time, General van der  Merwe said he did not object to the proposal in principle, but  would not sanction the unit because a Security Forces Board of  Inquiry Act existed to deal with such matters.    The Wallis report rejected this response as inadequate,  saying the board -- yet to be constituted -- would not have the  powers to investigate many complaints.    Yesterday General van der Merwe said he had discussed the  matter with Judge Richard Goldstone at the time "and he  supported me". He rejected allegations that he had blocked the  Natal initiatives.</p>

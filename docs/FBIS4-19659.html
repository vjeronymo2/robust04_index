			<p>BFN     [Text] Tolerance by Prime Minister Cavaco Silva toward the  Chinese political regime, without any reference to the human  rights problem, has not been welcomed by President Soares.  Mario Soares understands that Cavaco Silva may be concerned  about Macao, but went on to say that, as far as omitting human  rights violations is concerned, people should use silence to  suit themselves. He made the above statements in an interview  to Maria Joao Figueiredo:    [Begin recording] [Figueiredo] You have said that China has  a  dictatorship. Are you concerned about Macao and what may happen  after 1999?    [Soares] No, I am not concerned about Macao, because I am  convinced that the Chinese, whatever China's evolution may be --  and I believe there will be evolution in China, like everywhere  else -- will be faithful to the Luso-Chinese joint declaration.  As far as I am concerned, I am relatively tranquil about the  future of Macao.    [Figueiredo] There are Portuguese politicians in China at  this moment, and the human rights issue has not been mentioned.  Do you have any reservations about human rights having been  ignored?    [Soares] I understand the prime minister's logic. I  understand that, when he was in China, he was essentially  concerned about our relations with China and the future of a  territory for which we have responsibility, namely Macao. I  understand that he may want to defend the idea that we should  have relations with China, not ignoring, nevertheless, the fact  that the Chinese regime is obviously not a regime that is to our  liking, because it is not a democracy, it is indeed a  dictatorship.    [Figueiredo] Is then silence justified?    [Soares] No. Silence depends on circumstances, and everybody  may use silence when they believe it must be used and also  believe that it is the best way for their own country. [end  recording]</p>

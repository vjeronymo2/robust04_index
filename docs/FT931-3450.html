			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: English China Clays Having abandoned its adventure in housebuilding, English China Clays now finds itself becalmed. Selling kaolin to paper makers will remain unrewarding until demand for the end product catches up with capacity. Given the cyclical downturn in Europe, that point may not be reached until well into 1994. Meanwhile, ECC is in no position to reverse the downward pressure on margins. The move into Pacific markets and an upswing in the US should offset the worst of the damage. The 1990 acquisition of Georgia Kaolin now looks well-timed. But without further steps in that direction, the growth prospects are far from obvious. ECC could usefully raise as much as Pounds 150m by disposals from its land bank and redeploy the funds where growth prospects are better. Given the groggy UK housing market, though, it would not do to count on an early realisation. A debt-funded acquisition would be another way forward. Having replaced most of its auction-market preference shares with last year's rights issue, ECC's balance sheet is strong. The worry is that higher interest charges would eat into free cash flow. That might undermine the secure 5.8 per cent yield on which the shares now depend.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Price rises hit interest rate hopes RISING wholesale prices in the US last month have reopened the possibility that inflation will revive, and have helped to dampen expectations of further cuts in interest rates. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said producer prices rose 0.4 per cent last month, the sharpest rise in the past 18 months. The rise took the year-on-year wholesale inflation rate from 0.9 per cent in April to 1.1 per cent in May. While this is still a low increase, it sounds a note of caution to those who have been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further in order to help along the faltering US recovery. Advocates of a reduction in interest rates might otherwise have drawn encouragement from the disappointingly weak retail sales last month. The Commerce Department said its advance estimates put May retail sales at Dollars 158.8bn (Pounds 87.2bn), just 0.2 per cent higher than April's figure of Dollars 158.5bn - itself revised down from an earlier and more optimistic estimate.</p>

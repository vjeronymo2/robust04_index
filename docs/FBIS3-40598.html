The Islamic Front, JUI  [Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam], Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, Balakh Sheikh  Mazari, and some FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas]  members did not take part in this walkout. The federal law  minister had called this action of the prime opposition party to  be deplorable. At the same time, to keep the parliamentary  process in a healthy environment, he has expressed his  determination to keep the opposition happy. Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto has also stressed to her parliamentary group to  try to cooperate with the opposition at all times and follow the  assembly rules strictly. At the same time, she also reminded the  opposition to show cooperation in the parliamentary process.    In our opinion, the assemblies exist just to express  difference in opinion. However, every democratic country has  special rules and regulations to follow in the assemblies, and  every member has equal responsibility to follow these  procedures. The problem with the major opposition party at  present is that it considers the success of the elected  government on Kashmir and nuclear policy issues to be its own  defeat. Thus, it wants to blame the government on these two  issues without any reason. It is insisting on opening a debate  on the nuclear policy in the National Assembly for this purpose.  The prime minister, the foreign minister, and the law minister  insist that nuclear policy is the nation's most sensitive issue,  and, while full briefing on it can be given to the assembly  members, no open debate can be allowed. The prime minister has  also reminded them that the present government has not formed  any new nuclear policy; it is following the same policy as was  in force before. It is clear that this is a fundamental issue of  national importance, and the whole nation has no difference on  it. Therefore, no political party should make this an issue for  debate. Instead, as the prime minister has said, the opposition  should fully support her government's efforts of removing the  Pressler Amendment.    The foreign minister has reminded us in this context that  India had blasted a nuclear bomb in 1974, and there was a lot of  clamor in the world about it. India still has not discussed its  nuclear program in the parliament. She also reminded them of the  Koranic advice to "protect your secrets." In our opinion, the  opposition should show some responsibility at least on such a  sensitive issue and for the sake of our nation.</p>

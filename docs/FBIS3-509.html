The decision on Monday by the homeland cabinet not to take part  in the April election appeared to add fuel to the stoppages.    "The government is deeply concerned over the current unrest  and its possible impact on South African citizens and interests  and on the peaceful implementation of the election process,"  said a South African Government statement issued in Pretoria. It  said South Africa was keeping a close watch on the situation in  the homeland.    "The government has once again addressed an urgent appeal to  the Bophuthatswana government to become a full participant in  the constitutional process, including the proposed election,"  the statement said.    South African Defence Force members, meanwhile, conducted  military excercises near Bophuthatswana borders, but defence  spokesman Maj Merle Meyer said they were not to prevent the  unrest spilling across the border.    The homeland government accused South African Foreign  Minister Pik Botha of fanning unrest in Bophuthatswana and  attempts by Ambassador Prof Tjaart van der Walt to mediate in a  labour crisis at the homeland's Broadcasting Corporation were  rebuffed.    After a day of police action against strikers in the  homeland, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] recommended  financial strangulation of the government of President Lucas  Mangope, cancellation of Bophuthatswana's diplomatic ties with  Pretoria and other measures if the homeland flouted TEC  directives. The announcement came hours after African National  Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela urged Pretoria to withdraw  its seconded officials to force Mr Mangope to step down.    "I think we have now given him enough time. I have tried to  reason with him (Mr Mangope) but it is clear he has no vision.  Further pressures will be used and I have no doubt he will not  be able to withstand them," Mr Mandela told students at the  University of Venda.    In another development in a day of drama in Bophuthatswana,  the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said an IEC  delegation including chairman, Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, would  travel to Bophuthatswana on Wednesday for talks with the  homeland government.    As stoppages spread on Tuesday, strikers at the  Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] held hostage BBC  Chairman Eddie Mangope and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon Masilo  at the corporation's offices. Eddie Mangope is President  Mangope's son.    The hostage drama ended when homeland police stormed the  building anf fired tear gas at hundreds of workers who had taken  virutal control of the corporation. The strike over pay cut  radio and television broadcasts on Tuesday. Mr Eddie Mangope,  who earlier had told South Africa's ambassador he would resolve  the crisis on his own and did not need the intervention of the  diplomat, was found in the offices unharmed.    Between 10 and 20 strike leaders at the BBC were reported  arrested.    Later, Mr Eddie Mangope said in a statement the crisis had  been resolved following talks with the strikers and the BBC  would resume broadcasts on Wednesday morning. Confirmation of  this claim could not be immediately obtained. [passage omitted]    Striking civil servants are demanding participation in the  election process to ensure their pensions are protected under a  new government. Mr Mandela said on Tuesday an ANC government  would not seize the pensions.    On Tuesday scenes of violence were witnessed around the  capital Mmabatho with teargas being used indiscriminately by the  homeland authorities for most of the day.    The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday  evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng.    Burning barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in  streets in Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed  with rocks, stood on street corners.    There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters  and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers. A  source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA that  members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered "to help  out" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently  confirmed.    A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at  least two camera teams had their film confiscated. [passage  omitted]</p>

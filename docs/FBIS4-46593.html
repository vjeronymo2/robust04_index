			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Grinyuk: "Rooks' Over the Pyandzh Again"] </F>   [Text] Almost nothing is known about the fact that Russian  Air Force units have been active in combat operations on the  territory of Tajikistan. Here are the details. The 186th Ground  Attack Instructor Regiment, based at Kakaydy Airfield in  Uzbekistan at the junction of the Tajik, Afghan and Uzbek  borders, is a component part of the Russian Federation Air Force  Grouping. The regiment was formed on the basis of the  Borisoglebsk Air Training Center and the backbone of its flight  personnel are very experienced instructor pilots (hence the  regiment's name).    The appearance of instructor air regiments in the Air Force  makeup is no accident. According to the new methodology of  putting young pilots in formation, the main emphasis, in  contrast to past times, is placed on air training centers in  which pilots perfect flying skills obtained in schools and  rehearse tactics of combat employment of equipment. The new  level of flight personnel training demanded a new level of  instructors: a combat pilot can be trained only by a mentor  possessing combat experience. This was the basis for forming  special instructor regiments.    The 186th Ground Attack Instructor Regiment is armed with  Su-25BM and Su-25UB attack aircraft. Before restationing to  Kakaydy, the regiment was covering Russian troops in the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone. It was there that enormous  depictions of the Russian flag appeared on the fins of many  aircraft along with the red stars inherited from the USSR, which  permitted distinguishing the regiment's aircraft at least in  some way from Georgian Air Force Su-25's of the same type--the  only aircraft being produced there in Tbilisi.    The regiment rebased to Kakaydy on 24 July 1993 at the most  critical moment on the border, after the death of 25 border  guards in the 12th Border Outpost, when numerous well-armed  detachments of rebels and Afghan mujahedin were proceeding over  several crossings constructed across the Pyandzh into the  interior of Tajikistan. In the first days the pilots flew  several combat sorties each, dropping up to 80 tonnes of bombs a  day. The standard combat payload consisted of six OFAB-250's and  two R-60M air-to-air missiles for self-defense in a possible  encounter with Afghan fighters, and also two suspended fuel  tanks. The decisive actions of the ground attack pilots broke  the course of events and permitted the border guard personnel  and motorized riflemen to dig in firmly at the occupied  positions.    Together with a group of Moscow Military District Air Force  staff officers headed by Lieutenant-General of Aviation Nikolay  Antoshkin, which was making an inspection trip, your  correspondent flew in to Kakaydy Air Base in a period of  relative lull. Our Il-76MD also delivered another shift of  pilots and technicians from Buturlinovka, the Borisoglebsk Air  Training Center airfield. As already mentioned, by agreement  with the government of Uzbekistan, the 186th Ground Attack  Instructor Regiment is operating from its territory. Because of  the absence of national cadres and the break in economic ties,  the Republic Armed Forces are in an extremely difficult  situation. Russian servicemen who arrived encountered a mass of  problems: long-range and short-range navigation systems were not  operating at the airfield. The Uzbek Air Force 115th Guards  Fighter Regiment based at Kakaydy, previously regarded as one of  the best, is experiencing a great shortage of technical flight  personnel. Therefore along with conducting combat operations,  personnel of the Russian Air Force regiment had to restore  airfield equipment and guard the entrusted equipment and  ammunition under very difficult conditions of Central Asian  heat, sand storms, and a shortage of potable water and of  adjusted everyday life--air conditioners are absent and the food  ration is monotonous.    High combat proficiency helps avoid losses in people and  equipment while inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. The  following fact attests to the pilots' proficiency and to the  Su-25's combat capabilities: with one pass at the target, the  positions of a DShK [Degtyarev and Shpagin heavy machinegun]  antiaircraft battery, Major Vdovin destroyed three out of four  machineguns with a bomb strike. In the last days of September it  was learned that several pilots headed by regimental commander  Colonel Aleksey Golovin, an Afghan War veteran, were recommended  for state awards at the initiative of the ground troops command  in Tajikistan.    The majority of servicemen of the 186th Ground Attack  Instructor Regiment believe that by covering the border on the  Pyandzh River they are defending the borders of Russia and of  Commonwealth countries. If they were to leave here, it is fully  likely that in a short time interval they will have to fight the  very same enemy, only several hundred kilometers to the north.

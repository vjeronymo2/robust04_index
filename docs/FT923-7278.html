			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: A tribute to Fokine - Ballet BILLED as 'A tribute to Michel Fokine' to mark the 50th anniversary of his death, the final programme in English National Ballet's summer season is a combination of seance and mugging  - the spirit of the choreographer invoked and then given a thorough pasting. As an example of the unsuitable in pursuit of the unlikely, the evening has a weird interest, but as a celebration of the work of a genius who indelibly marked the ballet of our century, it is a non-starter. The trouble is that texts and performance manner are wildly optimistic. The honourable exception is Dame Alicia Markova's staging of Les Sylphides. Markova learned the ballet from Fokine. He coached her in all three ballerina roles, recognising in her exquisite style the essential Romantic image that lies at the heart of this ravishing and difficult work. In her several productions, Markova has sought to pass on the physical nuance and musical finesse that Fokine demanded and which, in her own interpretations, she so beautifully displayed. On Monday night, ENB's cast tried hard to seize the dreams and drifting magic of the text: the fascination was in seeing how moments of Markova's own style  - sweetly floating, so musically subtle  - surfaced amid the dutiful performance, like happy memories. The truly distinguished dancing of the evening came from Ludmila Semenyaka  -who should have been seen in Sylphides  - as The Dying Swan. She does not show us Fokine's text  - her version is that Soviet recension which Ulanova used  - but it is potent, and given by Semenyaka with intensest poetry and an aristocracy of means that are the mark of a great ballerina. For the rest of the programme we might have been watching  - it would be better to have watched  - all-in wrestling. Le Spectre de la rose was made for Karsavina and Nijinsky, whose glory saturated their roles like the scent of the rose itself. ENB's pair  - who had better remain anonymous  - looked bemused. They also looked wholly unsuited to their task. A nasty clatter after the piece ended could have been Le Spectre de Michel Fokine expressing an opinion on this ludicrous staging. What Fokine might have said about the programme's finale, Scheherazade, does not bear contemplation. There was the set, basically lit, with drifting clouds of dry ice  - doubtless the slaves were having a quick puff before the main bout of the evening. There were the Bakst costumes, some of them even looking inhabited. There was Carlos Acosta - who has something of the right physical lusciousness for the role  - making his debut as the Golden Slave, and determined to let us see that he could turn multitudinous pirouettes. There were lifts in an interpolated pas de deux which prove that necessity is the mother of invention when you have to galvanise an exhausted old romp  - and I know of no romp older or more exhausted. There were conventional mime gestures, which Fokine abominated. There were tripping slaves, eunuchs, a Zobeide (in a role only now to be performed by a Lynn Seymour or an Asylmuratova) who shimmied like her sister Kate. There were meagre pearls that had never known an oyster, and guards who had never known a scimitar (it is not, one of the chaps had better be told, a fly-swat). And there was all the unbridled sensuality of a game of hop-scotch. Poor Fokine. Poor ENB. English National Ballet presents its Fokine programme at the Royal Festival Hall, London, until August 20</p>

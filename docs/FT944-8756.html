			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Management: The difficult art of skills transfer Why did General Motors flounder so badly in the US throughout the 1980s, while its European offshoots prospered mightily? Only in 1991, when the parent company was about to hit the crash barrier, did it start to learn managerial lessons from Europe. They included the need to import Opel's notorious cost- cutter, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua - who after a few instructive months defected noisily to Volkswagen. Why has Ford suffered from a mirror-image of the same problem? The US parent company revitalised itself a decade ago through a string of far-reaching changes - including the introduction of teamwork and total quality - but its European arm adapted far less successfully, and has performed in lacklustre fashion as a result. The reasons are not peculiar to the motor industry. Nor are they simply explained by geography - that is, the thousands of miles that hamper effective communication between locations such as Detroit and Germany, even in this electronic age. Instead, the causes are generic. They afflict almost every large organisation, not only those with a far-flung network of units, but also those with a diverse range of businesses in the same country. Even similar units on the same site can be affected. The problem is that the transfer of skills and practice between businesses within a company is far trickier than most people realise. In some respects, thanks to the glamour of competitive benchmarking, it is harder than learning lessons from outside. This is not merely a matter of the ubiquitous 'not invented here' syndrome interfering with internal organisational learning, although that does always create a powerful barrier. There is far more at fault: poor understanding of what really constitutes 'world class' practice; head offices that have no idea how to encourage the transfer of skills between their business units; and a long list of other value-destroying problems. Many of them have been investigated in unusual depth in a two-year study of 'intra-firm transfer of best practice' carried out by Gabriel Szulanski, a researcher at Insead, a leading European business school. His report will shortly be published by an arm of the American Productivity &amp; Quality Centre*. The study finally dispels the widespread myth that companies can breed best practice just by designating internal 'centres of excellence' for particular skills and know-how, and then letting them disseminate it to eager internal customers. Szulanski examined 122 transfers of 38 technical and managerial practices in a range of US and European companies including AT&amp;T Paradyne, BP, Chevron, EDS, Rank Xerox, Sprint and Banc One, an Ohio group known for its transfer mechanisms. In descending order of difficulty, the following problems emerged: Inadequate 'absorptive capacity' on the part of the recipient unit. Szulanski uses this term to describe its ability to identify and implement the practices in question. Inadequate understanding of the practice, either on the part of the recipient unit or of the provider. Detailed operating procedures for the practice may not be available, and the skills and resources needed to perform it successfully may not be listed properly. The quality of the relationship between the two units in any transfer. One or both of them may not be keen to collaborate, and to assign good personnel to the project. Even if they are enthusiastic, communication may not be well-established or easy. The recipient unit may be considered unreliable by the provider. The provider may lose its initial enthusiasm because it has to carry too much of the financial burden. Another finding was that it took an average of 27 months for a unit or company to recognise the existence of an opportunity to transfer best practice, and another nine to implement the transfer. Coming from a bunch of supposedly leading companies, this is a pretty sorry catalogue. Puzzlingly, the study pays only scant attention to one of the most important factors in the transfer of best practice: the parent company's effectiveness in fostering it. Szulanski calls this the 'organisational context' within which transfers occur, or fail to. He finds that those 'mandated' by the organisation are less difficult than optional transfers, but that neither are as successful as 'strongly suggested' and spontaneous ones. This conclusion begs a series of important questions about the role of head office. They are covered much more fully, under the jargonistic title of 'linkage influence', in Corporate Level Strategy**, a new book reviewed on this page on October 5. Among other examples, it cites Banc One's use of an unusually detailed monthly reporting system to pressurise all its affiliates to gauge their performance against other units, and to identify good exponents of the practices that they need to introduce or improve. But such centralised procedures can have their downside. The book warns that managers in some companies admit they deliberately conceal potential transfer opportunities for fear of losing control to some centralised procedure. One executive is quoted as saying: 'I would always prefer to deal with an outsider because you don't have to watch your back on the political issues.' That was part of the sad reality at GM and Ford in the 1980s, as it still is in most companies. It means head offices must tread a knife-edge between inadequate involvement and over-interference. Both Detroit giants are now striving to do just that. *In Houston, Texas. Fax 713-681-531. **By Goold, Campbell and Alexander. Wiley Dollars 34.95/Pounds 24.95.</p>

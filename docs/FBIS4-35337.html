			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anis Hasan Yahya Tells AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: The Declaration of Democratic Yemen Does Not Mean  Abandoning the Cause of Unity"; all quotation marks as published]    [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Anis Hasan Yahya,  member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party and  speaker of the provisional National Salvation Assembly  (parliament of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]), has  stated that "Democratic Yemen's application to join the Arab  League is a legitimate and fair step after this war was imposed  on us. He added that the emergence of the DRY does not at all  mean abandoning unity. He pointed out that the Pledge and  Accord Document categorically emphasizes adherence to Yemeni  unity and the importance of restoring unity on democratic and  sound basis."    In reply to questions by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT about Sanaa's  interest in holding dialogues with what it called the moderates  in the YSP in pursuit of peaceful solutions that would bring  about a cease-fire and put an end to the current crisis, Yahya  said: "That interest in a dialogue with the moderates is not  without sinister motives, but despite that, the YSP would  welcome such a dialogue and is willing to provide negotiators  who place the higher interests of the people and the homeland  above all other considerations.    He stressed the importance of stopping that destructive war  and the need for the attacking forces -- a clear reference to  the northern forces -- to return to their pre-May 22, 1990  positions. Yahya said that the call for an end to the war was a  public and just demand. He added that to ensure that and  prevent more bloodshed and destruction, the northern forces must  return to their previous positions. Once that is done, he said,  a call could be made for an immediate start of the negotiations  without prior conditions, and all issues could be raised at the  negotiating table and addressed with open minds.    [Yemeni Planning Minister] Dr. 'Abd-al-karim al-Iryani said  the day before yesterday that the initiative presented by  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jafri, deputy chairman of the (southern)  Presidential Council, and Anis Hasan Yahya was "another form of  secession," and that "al-Jafri has no authority or legitimacy,"  but Yahya reaffirmed the need to stop this war. He said: "What  is happening in our country is no longer an internal Yemeni  affair. It is an Arab affair because the effects of the war will  extend to the region and undermine its security and stability."    He called for Arab League participation in such open and  unconditional negotiations.    He said that Arab League states' recognition of the DRY is  the natural and expected thing but requires the efforts of all  the Arab brothers to understand the background and dimensions of  the declaration of the new republic.    He added that "such recognition would put a final end to the  current war in Yemen for which the Yemeni people are paying a  high price and in which the Yemeni people are the only loser."</p>

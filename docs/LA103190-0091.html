			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USX'S INCOME DROPS 7% TO $163 MILLION  </P> <P> USX Corp. said Tuesday that it will transfer control of its steel division to a  wholly owned subsidiary, a move seen by analysts as paving the way for the  once-mighty steel company to move out of the business altogether.  </P> <P> Separately, on Tuesday the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate also reported lower  third-quarter profit.  </P> <P> The company said it had net income in the July to September period of $163  million, down 7% from a year ago.  </P> <P> But operating income -- net income minus special charges -- rose 25% to $382  million. Sales also rose 16%, to $5.1 billion.  </P> <P> The company's energy business had operating income of $238 million on sales of  $3.7 billion, compared to $189 million on sales of $3 billion a year ago.  </P> <P> The steel segment had operating income of $63 million on sales of $1.3 billion,  down from $85 million on the same sales in the third quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> USX -- formerly U.S. Steel Corp. but now a diversified manufacturer heavily  involved in the energy business -- said its board of directors approved  spinning off the steel-producing USS division into a separate company.  </P> <P> The move "will provide flexibility for any steel restructuring undertaken by  the firm," said USX Chairman Charles Corry.  </P></p>

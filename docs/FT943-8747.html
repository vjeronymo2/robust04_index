			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Indonesian sentenced to 17 years in bank scandal The Indonesian entrepreneur at the centre of Indonesia's biggest banking scandal since independence was sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment yesterday and fined Rp30m (Pounds 9,000). Mr Eddy Tansil, owner of Golden Key, a retail and manufacturing group with petrochemical interests, was also ordered to pay Rp500bn and surrender some of his property to compensate for the losses incurred at Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), the state-owned development bank. Mr Tansil, an ethnic Chinese businessman, was accused of illegally securing a Dollars 430m (Pounds 278m) loan from the bank by colluding with senior government officials. The loan was never serviced, leaving Bapindo technically bankrupt. Mr Tansil was accused of obstructing government efforts to develop the economy by abusing the loan from Bapindo. The sentence and fine were lighter than expected. Prosecutors had asked for life imprisonment and fines and compensation totalling Rp830bn. Mr Tansil is the second person to be convicted in the Bapindo scandal. Last month, Mr Maman Suparman, manager of a Bapindo branch, was sentenced to nine years for his role in extending the loan. Mr Tansil is one of six people involved in the scandal. Two Bapindo directors are still to appear in court and trials are proceeding against two others. Over the past six months, prosecutors have been trying to establish how Mr Tansil, who had little capital to back him and had a history of unsuccessful ventures, could have qualified for the loan without any collateral. The answers are alleged to lie with Mr Sudomo, a former minister in charge of political and security affairs and now a government adviser, Mr J B Sumarlin, former finance minister and now a chairman of the national audit agency, and Mr Nasruddin Sumintapura, a former junior finance minister. So far, Mr Sudomo has appeared as witness in one of the trials, with Mr Sumintapura and Mr Sumarlin due to be witnesses in coming weeks. Mr Sudomo admits he authorised the Bapindo loan for Mr Tansil and Mr Sumarlin is alleged to have overseen the loan. It remains to be seen whether the government goes further than just a showcase trial with Mr Tansil as sacrificial lamb. Indonesians have used the case as a rallying point against institutionalised corruption. Since the start of the trials, demonstrations have taken place demanding that Mr Sudomo, Mr Sumarlin and Mr Sumintapura also face trial. Bankers say the case marks the start of a new era in Indonesia's banking history. The Bapindo scandal prompted Indonesia's finance minister, Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, to disclose the extent of bad loans at state banks, many of which were brought about by illegal collusion between lenders and borrowers. According to Mr Muhammad, 21.2 per cent of state banks' loans were bad or doubtful at the end of 1993, compared with 17.4 per cent a year earlier and only 6 per cent in 1990. The figures should be treated with caution because the state banks themselves are the source for them and they could be far worse, bankers say.</p>

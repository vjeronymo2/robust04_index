			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YUGOSLAV MONICA SELES, 15, ENJOYING LIFE IN THE PINK  </P> <P> Monica Seles is a 15-year-old, left-handed Yugoslav who lives in Florida,  paints her fingernails fire-engine red, talks like a Valley Girl and signs  autographs with her new, lucky pen.  </P> <P> At the French Open, where Seles is all the rage, she has been signing lots of  autographs.  </P> <P> Clad in her usual pink shirt and pink skirt, Seles won her second-round match  Thursday, beating Stacey Martin of Washington, 6-0, 6-2, then signed her name  to oblige as many fans as she could on the way to the locker room.  </P> <P> "I am almost exhausted from all the happiness," she said.  </P> <P> Seles signed autographs with a pink pen that had on one end a fuzzy, pink ball  with a kitten's face drawn on it. She signed. She smiled. Then she laughed.  </P> <P> Someone has suggested that Seles has the determination of Bjorn Borg, the grunt  of Jimmy Connors and the laugh of Woody Woodpecker. It's too early for only the  first comparison to be tested completely.  </P> <P> Seles hits the ball two-handed from both sides and grunts audibly every time.  And her laugh? It sounds like something between Woody Woodpecker and a car  trying to start.  </P> <P> But however she sounds, it's how Seles plays that is drawing attention in  women's tennis, which is in need of new, young stars. Although Seles is playing  in only her fifth tournament as a professional, she is already No. 22 in the  world. Last month in Houston, she defeated Chris Evert to win her first  Virginia Slims title.  </P> <P> Seles has not lost a match this year, but she has played only 10.  </P> <P> Seles got stomach cramps and defaulted to Zina Garrison before their semifinal  match in the Virginia Slims of Washington, but that is not counted in won-lost  statistics.  </P> <P> A two-time world junior champion, Seles was chosen sportswoman of the year in  Yugoslavia when she was 12.  </P> <P> "I got so much press attention, I couldn't believe it myself," Seles said.  </P> <P> When she was winning the Orange Bowl junior tournament in 1985, Seles met Nick  Bollitieri, who persuaded her to join his tennis academy in Florida. She  agreed, and her parents later left Yugoslavia and joined her there.  </P> <P> Seles has grown four inches -- to 5-foot-8 -- in the last year, and her  notoriety is experiencing a similar growth spurt. Garrison, Seles' next  opponent, may stunt that growth, but if Seles does get past the fourth-seeded  player, she will be on a path to meet Steffi Graf in the semifinals. THOMAS  BONK  </P></p>

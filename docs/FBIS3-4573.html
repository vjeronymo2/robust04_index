			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Matsumoto, Nagano Pref., Feb. 27 KYODO --  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader and Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata urged Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Sunday  [27 February] to swiftly reshuffle his cabinet if he really  thinks it necessary. "It is a problem for us to continue  lengthy discussions like this," Hata said, referring to  Hosokawa's planned reshuffle expected to center on removing  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from that post.    Hata, also deputy prime minister, was speaking at a press  conference in Matsumoto, central Japan, near his electoral  constituency.    "It should be done as early as possible if Prime Minister  Hosokawa judges it necessary at any cost," said Hata, head of  Shinseito (Japan renewal party), a key ruling party that along  with the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]  supports a cabinet shake-up.    Hosokawa's shake-up plan has hit a snag since early  February,  facing opposition from three of the seven ruling coalition  parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ],  the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake (Harbinger).    Hata's remarks came amid worries in the coalition that a  prolonged crack over a reshuffle might adversely affect  government efforts to address domestic and foreign policy  matters, particularly a trade friction with the United States,  coalition sources said.    In an earlier speech Sunday, Hata said that politics will  remain stagnant and that Hosokawa should be brave to move  "either one, two or 10" cabinet members if necessary.    Hata denied an intention of replacing Takemura as chief  cabinet secretary, saying duties for a party leader and for the  top government spokesman will necessarily be incompatible.    Hata criticized the SDPJ, the DSP and Sakigake for their  moves toward uniting social democrats and liberals into a joint  front. "Can we maintain the coalition if we are split into two  groups?" he asked, noting a new election system for the House of  Representatives.    The next general election is almost certain to be fought  under the political reform legislation package, enacted last  month, which introduces 300 single-seat constituencies plus 200  seats chosen through proportional representation. The present  511-seat lower house was elected through 129 multiseat districts  to which two to six seats are allocated.    Many mass media surveys have predicted a victory for  coalition parties against the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) if they are united, but a loss if they separately  field candidates in the next general election.    Shinseito and Komeito, which are considered as the  coalition's propelling groups, have called for establishing a  two-party system under the political reform legislation, while  the SDPJ, DSP and Sakigake oppose an immediate two-party system  and favor a "moderate multiparty system."    Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP), at first voiced  support for the moderate multiparty system. But earlier this  month he instructed top JNP aides to consider uniting the seven  coalition parties into one against the LDP to prepare for the  next general election.    Labor leader Akira Yamagishi, whose Rengo labor organization  provides the main base of support for the SDPJ and DSP, says he  expects there will be three main parties in the future -- the  LDP, a new conservative party, and a nonconservative one.</p>

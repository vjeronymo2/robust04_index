			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Motor industry attacks coach ban Plans to ban coaches from the outside lane of motorways could damage customer perceptions of coach travel, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned yesterday. The ban is scheduled to be introduced to carriageways with three or more lanes from the beginning of 1996. The SMMT has told the Department of Transport that coach passengers 'could be disconcerted by vehicles being forced to mingle with slower heavy goods traffic. This could lead to a perception that coach travel was slower.' The society was responding to a transport department consultation paper issued after the European Commission directive that coach speed should be limited. Police found defects in half the coaches they stopped in a safety-check operation on the M5 - the biggest operation of its kind - in which transport department examiners carried out checks at four service areas on 336 coaches. The worst case involved a coach carrying 46 children. Engine oil was leaking on to the hot exhaust. Police said it was 'in imminent danger of catching fire'. It and two other coaches were ordered off the road. Twenty four others were told to make repairs within a week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Army" column: "Nuclear </F> Warheads Return to Russia. Russian Missilemen Use Ukraine  Equipment But Moscow Controls Nuclear Weapons in Any Event"]    [Text] Ukraine honors its obligations and is evacuating  nuclear warheads to Russian in accordance with an earlier  coordinated schedule, Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander  in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, told foreign military  attaches in Moscow yesterday. By this time 180 Ukrainian  warheads have arrived in Russia to Nuclear Industry Ministry  installations for subsequent dismantling. In response the  Russian nuclear department is shipping to Ukraine deliveries of  fuel elements for Ukraine's nuclear power plants.    The planned withdrawal of missile regiments from Belorussia  [Belarus] continues. On 28 March during a summit in Moscow  Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed an agreement on  military cooperation and the status of strategic nuclear forces  whereby missile divisions in Kazakhstan were moved under Russian  Federation jurisdiction, and also coordinated a schedule for the  evacuation to Russia of all nuclear warheads within 14 months.  After that, within three years, all launchers and strategic  missiles in Kazakhstan are to be abolished. The procedure for  the abolition, however, has not so far been finalized (the  details of the Russian-Kazakhstan nuclear agreement did not  become known until recently).    The process of "nuclear divorce" of Russia with Ukraine,  Belorussia, and Kazakhstan is proceeding amazingly smoothly.  Yet problems remain: On 25 April General Staff Academy  official Nikolay Kostin publicly expressed doubts about "the  circle of people today possessing information about strategic  arms command and control systems."    In response to SEGODNYA's correspondent, Gen. Sergeyev  stated  that in his troops "everything is under control." Should any  attempt be made to reveal nuclear codes, emergency warning  panels will flash in all related headquarters, including the  General Staff. Maybe Kostin meant the warheads of the air-based  strategic cruise missiles of the 45th Army stationed in Ukraine?    The equipment used to command and control strategic nuclear  missiles was indeed manufactured in Kharkov. Russian  specialists are apparently concerned over the possibility of  leaks of strategic information from there (inducing to other  foreign countries). Yet Gen. Sergeyev is calm because the  control system's software is of Russian origin. "Without the  software, the hardware is of little value," Mr. Sergeyev  stressed.    Under the START I Treaty, 403 strategic missiles (including  Ukrainian) and 302 launchers have been destroyed. Even so there  are approximately 67 percent of domestic strategic carriers in  the Strategic Missiles Forces (1,150 units, of which 350 are in  neighboring states) and more than 75 percent of the Russian  Federation's aggregate megaton charge.</p>

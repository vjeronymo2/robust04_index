			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT  </P> <P> Let's see if I have this right now. The Bush Administration says that its  military support of the Philippine government to suppress the rebellion was  legal because international law permits governments under attack to seek  outside help. But the Nicaraguan government, under attack for eight years, was  not allowed to seek help from the Soviets or anyone else.  </P> <P> And the United States is allowed to take sides in the El Salvador civil war,  but no one else is allowed to support the other side.  </P> <P> And the Soviet Union should not interfere in the Western Hemisphere, but the  United States can support the rebels in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> And the government and society of Iran are highly repressive, but the Afghan  rebels, who will institute a very similar system if they take power, are  freedom fighters.  </P> <P> And it's a marvelous thing that the Soviet Union has allowed Eastern Europe to  freely pursue its own path, but the U.S. should not do the same for Central  America.  </P> <P> And union militancy, a multiparty electoral system and social reform are  wonderful to see in Eastern Europe, but they have no place in the United  States.  </P> <P> WILLIAM BLUM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Swedish business urges tax cuts The Federation of Swedish Industries yesterday called on the government to take further measures to haul the country's economy out of crisis, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. It proposed cutting taxes by SKr30bn (Pounds 3.3bn) and financing the move by a SKr50bn reduction in public expenditure. It also asked for a further 5 per cent cut in employers' social contributions to increase industry's competitiveness. Their contributions were reduced by 5 per cent in September.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM stood out in a lack-lustre precious metals market yesterday, with its price putting on Dollars 4.25 at Dollars 358 a troy ounce. Traders attributed the rise to a statement by Russia's Almazyuvelirexport saying it would retain its monopoly on exports of platinum group metals. 'The market was just relieved that the platinum will remain in secure hands and traded up in the absence of anything else to go on,' one dealer explained. Earlier news that Russia was giving its foreign trade bank Vneshtorgbank a monopoly on gold sales raised concerns that Almaz might lose control of platinum and that supplies of the white metal might be allowed to flood on to the market. Constructive US economic indicators helped most base metals prices to end firm at the London Metal Exchange. The most notable rise was in the NICKEL market, where the cash quotation closed Dollars 60 up at Dollars 7,400 a tonne on constructive chart signals, taking it out of its recent narrow trading range. COFFEE prices fell further in the morning but steadied in the afternoon in what traders saw as a technical correction. Compiled from Reuters</p>

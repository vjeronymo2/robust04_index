			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Observer: Agnostic A refreshing antidote to publishers' hype reaches Observer from the Behavioral Sciences Research Press in Dallas. A recent survey has been concentrating on 'what makes British sales people hit the road, pick up the phone and go for the close day after day?' According to the two behavioural scientists who have been out on the road themselves, 37 per cent of British sales people are mainly motivated by money - the same proportion, it emerges, as in the US. Even more 'interesting', the taster for the research goes on, only 20 per cent of Canadians are driven by such considerations - 'despite also being former royal subjects and America's closest neighbors'. So what accounts for these cultural differences? 'We don't know,' the authors respond with disarming honesty.</p>

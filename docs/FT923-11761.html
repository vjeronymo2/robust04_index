			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Dangerous to believe no justification for UK to leave ERM Sir, Samuel Brittan's belief ('Don't look for gurus', July 20) that with nominal national incomes rising by 5 per cent and earnings by 6.5 per cent there is no justification to leaving the ERM is wrong and dangerous. Yes, there is still a big labour market problem in Britain in the sense that earnings growth should be reduced further, leading to falling real wages rather than sharply rising unemployment. However, this is a problem that should largely be attended to directly (ie at the micro level) rather than via the mechanism of the ERM, especially under current economic conditions. The twin impact of high real interest rates, which are heading for 7 per cent as inflation expectations are falling, and massive personal and corporate debt which is not being reduced with such low inflation, means that remaining in the ERM could result in irreparable damage to the supply side of the economy. Potentially, mistakes of the 1930s could be repeated of deflating in a depression. Low inflation will not guarantee a recovery and the aim of zero inflation should not be sought. There are advantages and disadvantages of fixed exchange rate systems and which are more important depends on the particular economic (as well as political) situation. For the UK, devaluation and, therefore, in effect leaving the ERM, is unlikely to be considered before things get much worse - unless the French referendum is negative - because of the domestic political implications for Mr Major and Mr Lamont on the UK's consequent isolationism on Europe and damage to its anti-inflation credibility. Next year, though, could see the UK economy suffer new problems with growing difficulties over the financial system and this may result in the UK leaving the ERM unilaterally, if the failure of Maastricht has not already destroyed the ERM. Finally, I agree with Mr Brittan that France should feel more aggrieved than the UK about the impact of Bundesbank policy on French real interest rates given its superior inflation performance, but this is hardly the point. The greater damage to the UK economy means it is crying out for lower interest rates. Patrick Dennis, chief economist, Industrial Bank of Japan, Bracken House, 1 Friday Street, London EC4M 9JA</p>

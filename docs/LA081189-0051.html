			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY PICKS COMRIE FOR METRO RAIL PANEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday appointed City Administrative Officer  Keith Comrie to represent the city on a three-member cost-cutting panel to  oversee the beleagured Metro Rail project.  </P> <P> The board will monitor construction on the first 4 miles of the subway, which a  Los Angeles County Transportation Commission audit found to be $135 million, or  10%, over budget. The overrun triggered a clause in the funding contract  between the transportation commission, the Southern California Rapid Transit  District and the city that establishes a committee with authority to direct  economy measures on the project, which is two years behind.  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum or his alternate, political consultant Mike Lewis,  represents the LACTC. The SCRTD has not yet appointed its representative. The  board's first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 17.  </P></p>

The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition that the manufacturer consents to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.512&hyph;96 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Request for public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision under &sect;89.511&hyph;96 (b), (c), (d), or (f) to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to &sect;89.511&hyph;96 (a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The manufacturer's request must be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of the decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer must simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.

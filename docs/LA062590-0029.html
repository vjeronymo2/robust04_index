			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE CRITIC SAYS U.S. HOLDS TRADE-GAP KEY  </P> <P> Shintaro Ishihara, author of the controversial book "The Japan That Can Say  No," has presented his own 109 demands for American economic reform and warned  that opening the Japanese market, by itself, would not eliminate the trade  imbalance between the two nations.  </P> <P> Ishihara told foreign correspondents Friday that he agrees with U.S.  negotiators who are demanding that Japan dramatically increase spending on  public works to improve living standards and pull in imports. Japan's closed  markets should also be opened to give Japanese consumers a better life, he  added.  </P> <P> But he said that whatever reforms Japan promises to undertake in the yearlong  Structural Impediments Initiative talks won't be enough, by themselves, to  reduce the United States's $49-billion trade imbalance with Japan. The  negotiations are designed to remove trade barriers.  </P> <P> "The United States must regain its competitiveness and make products in America  that will sell. . . . The United States conducts 10 times the basic research,  which is the foundation of technology, that Japan does but cannot turn that  research into products. That is the fault of management," Ishihara said.  </P> <P> "It's also a fault of the U.S. political system. . . . The U.S. government must  get more involved.'  </P> <P> Ishihara, known as a gadfly within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party,  said the LDP, preferring to "leave everything to the bureaucrats," had snubbed  his list of proposed American reforms.  </P> <P> The novelist-turned-politician attracted wide attention last summer when "The  Japan That Can Say No," a book he co-authored with Sony Chairman Akio Morita,  was translated into English without his permission. In the book, which stirred  widespread resentment in Congress, he advocated that Japan use its  technological prowess as a diplomatic weapon.  </P> <P> A sequel, written without Morita, called "Nevertheless, Japan Can Still Say  No," is No. 1 on the Asahi newspaper's list of best-selling business books.  </P> <P> American and Japanese negotiators will meet here today and Tuesday to work on a  final report on the Structural Impediments Initiative talks, which President  Bush has made the focus of his economic policy toward Japan.  </P> <P> Ishihara pointed out Friday that American proposals for rejuvenating U.S.  industry -- the latest is "Made in America," by the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology -- have been coming out one after another for more than five years.  "But the U.S. Administration and Congress have done nothing to implement them,"  he said.  </P> <P> Japanese proposals in the SII talks for American reforms, he complained, have  been too moderate and lacked specifics.  </P> <P> Ishihara suggested that the United States spend 5% of its gross national  product on education, carry out an "action program" to reduce consumption,  enact a national sales tax and offer broad tax exemptions on personal savings  -- similar to those that Japan abandoned in April, 1988, to promote  consumption.  </P> <P> Noting that the United States is demanding that Japanese banks operate their  automated teller machines 24 hours a day to promote consumption, Ishihara said  ATM operations in the United States should be curtailed to 12 hours a day to  restrain consumption.  </P> <P> He also called for "dramatic" cuts in American nuclear weaponry and overseas  bases.  </P></p>

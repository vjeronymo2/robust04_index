			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good company results give equities a lift Wall Street A COMBINATION of strong corporate results, the successful completion of Chrysler's huge share offering on Tuesday, and firmer stock-index futures, provided US stock markets with a big lift yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.12 at 3,373.79, near its highs for the day. The more broadly-based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 4.63 higher at 447.19, a new record, while the Amex composite finished up 2.71 at 414.89, and the Nasdaq composite 3.53 firmer at 708.65. Trading volume on the NYSE was heavy at 345m shares. There was no single factor behind yesterday's big gains. The markets, however, were delighted at the way Chrysler's Dollars 1.78bn stock sale went on Tuesday. Strong demand from investors pushed up the price of the offering late in the day, allowing the carmaker to issue more shares, making it the second largest public stock offering in US history. The decision by Standard&amp;Poor's, the big ratings agency, to upgrade its ratings on Chrysler's debt yesterday also boosted sentiment. Other factors driving prices higher were more strong fourth quarter earnings, notably from Salomon and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, higher bond prices, and demand for stock-index futures in the Chicago derivatives markets. The economic background was also positive, with the string of recent bullish data pointing to solid growth. in 1993. Chrysler was the most heavily traded stock, with more than 15m shares changing hands following Tuesday's offering. At the close the stock was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 38 7/8 , slightly higher than the price at which the 46m new shares were sold. Salomon jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 40, a 52-week high, after reporting fourth quarter profits of Dollars 143m, a big turnaround from the Dollars 29m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 100 3/4 after the company announced fourth quarter net income of Dollars 289m, up from Dollars 259m a year ago. Although the latest figures were affected by one-off gains, charges and writedowns, the special factors cancelled each other out. JC Penney jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 77 in busy trading after Mr Wayne Hood, an analyst with the broking house Prudential Securities, upgraded his recommendation on the retailer's stock from 'hold' to 'buy'. In the Nasdaq market, lesser-known stocks lifted the composite index to record levels. Jimbo's Jumbos rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 6 1/4 after Chock Full O'Nuts agreed to sell its 73 per cent stake for Dollars 7 a share. Canada TORONTO share prices closed higher in heavy trading, following the trend set in most major world markets. The 300 composite index gained 22.20 points, or 0.67 per cent to 3,344.03.

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ratners delays results RATNERS GROUP, the troubled jewellery chain, has delayed publication of its annual report and accounts for the year to February 2 while it concludes refinancing talks with its bankers. The outcome of the talks does not appear to be in doubt, since Ratners yesterday said it would pay its convertible bondholders the Pounds 58m they are owed on October 30. The group said it was at an advanced stage in finalising negotiations with its lenders to continue their existing facilities and that it expected those negotiations to be concluded shortly. The accounts would be published as soon as practic-able. Ratners has already said it plans to make extraordinary provisions of nearly Pounds 100m in these results to cover rationalisation. The shares, which have collapsed from a peak last year of 189p, yesterday closed unchanged at 9p.</p>

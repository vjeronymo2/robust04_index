			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Don't borrow, charge: The chancellor's dilemma, an inside view The theme of these articles has been that the state of the public finances is the central economic policy problem facing the government today. It is simply imprudent for the government to undertake spending which exceeds its revenues by a fifth. Borrowing Pounds 50bn a year, much of it from foreigners who may at any point decline to go on lending to us, is a risky strategy. The problem has arisen partly because recessions are always bad for the public finances. Elections are also bad news, as spending is increased and/or taxes are cut in the pre-election period. The combination is unusual - governments usually do their best to prevent elections and recessions from coinciding - and it has proved lethal. The unexpected length of the recession, which meant that the election was repeatedly deferred while waiting for the elusive upturn, subjected the Treasury to two pre-election public spending rounds. With the cards thus stacked in favour of spending ministers, public spending has, after three successive years of 4 per cent real growth, already risen by more under Mr Major than it did in the entire period in office of Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher. The spending spree has coincided with a shortfall of revenue that has been intensified by the recession. Together these factors have created a borrowing problem more serious than that of the 1970s, the last time that the government borrowed on this scale. Now, as was the case then, new borrowing is causing the stock of debt to rise rapidly. Then, however, incomes were rising even faster because of inflation. So the government's debt-to-income ratio, which is the key variable, actually fell. Today's low rate of inflation means that the large borrowing requirement is pushing up the government's debt-to-income ratio extremely quickly. There is, fortunately, time to deal with the problem. Though the finances are deteriorating rapidly, they do so from a very favourable starting point. The government's debt was less than a third of the national income and is expected to rise to around a half. It can still be stabilised close to the level that Mrs Thatcher inherited from Labour, though that will require difficult dec-isions. The problem is that any way out of the borrowing trap conflicts with other cherished objectives. Consider what the different options are: Raise direct taxes? Hardly, because the Conservatives won a closely contested election by contrasting their own tax cutting record (and promises of further cuts) with Labour's shadow Budget, which penciled in higher taxes to pay for more public spending. Increase indirect taxes? Less difficult politically, since a shift from direct to indirect taxes has been the thrust of Conservative tax policy since 1979. But putting up indirect taxes would raise inflation, and the underlying rate is already uncomfortably close to the government's new inflation target erected since Britain left the ERM. Cut public spending? Too late to implement cuts in 1994-95, as the decisions have already been taken, but cuts in later years must be on the cards. Confronted with these unpalatable choices it will be very tempting to do nothing, especially if the recovery improves the public finances. The do-nothing school will also draw comfort from the Bank of England's success in funding the deficit. So far the markets have absorbed the massive flow of new gilt issues without a tremor. Why risk disturbing a fragile recovery in the interests of reducing a large PSBR that isn't a problem? The answer to these siren voices is that borrowing is a problem. If it is not tackled now, it is hard to see when it ever will be. The fact that the debt is being sold relatively easily is little comfort. It is not hard to sell debt on a coupon of nearly 8 per cent when headline inflation stands at 1 per cent and the government is aiming to keep underlying inflation in the lower half of a 1-4 per cent band. The debt sales achieved this year are better than a funding crisis, but they also constitute a millstone round the neck of the taxpayer. The interest charges on Pounds 50bn of debt at 8 per cent come to Pounds 4bn per annum for the foreseeable future - 2 per cent on the income tax rate, with all the adverse effects on incentives that entails and no public spending to show for it. And next year's borrowing will add another 1 1/2 per cent, with more to come in later years. Mr Clarke will find, like all borrowers that the longer he delays the correction, the bigger the problem he faces. The brutal fact is that, with public spending at these levels, the only choice facing Mr Clarke is between higher taxes now and higher taxes later. Being an astute politician he may prefer to face up to the problem now, with the next election still some way off, rather than be forced into unwelcome action nearer to polling day. He may also reckon that putting up taxes in the coming Budget will make it politically easier to secure the necessary reductions in public spending next year. I say reductions in spending, rather than cuts, because (as I argued in an earlier article) nobody wants to see lower standards of public provision. But if borrowing must be reduced and cuts are ruled out, the only alternative to putting up taxes is to introduce charges. This is a big political step, but the size of the problem, and the obstacles in the way of conventional solutions, calls for radical action. There is no shortage of good ideas. The government has already moved in the right direction on roads. The private finance initiative will bring new private funding in to road building, attracted by the prospect of making a commercial return on capital in the new world in which road users will pay for the use of premium roads. The crisis over the provision of university places for all those who achieve adequate grades would be quickly solved by making students bear some proportion of the fees, as happens in many other countries. The quiet revolution in dentistry, where much of the work is now cosmetic and undertaken privately, points the way to the introduction of charges, for those who can afford it, for other health services. The 'hotel charge' for hospital patients is one obvious example. Mr Clarke has a reputation as a courageous politician, unafraid of tough decisions. He has said his instincts are tax-cutting instincts, but he is not instinctively hostile, as some on the right are, to public spending. As a man of the 'hard centre', he should seize his opportunity to steer a new middle course: maintain the standards of public prov-ision but make those who can afford to pay for it do so.

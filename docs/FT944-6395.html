			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Cavallo quashes rumours Argentina's economy minister Domingo Cavallo, whose rumoured departure shook financial markets last week, said in a radio interview he would stay on until 1999 if President Carlos Menem were re-elected next May. 'If I had to make a forecast, unless my health fails me, I think I am going to accompany (Menem) until '99,' Mr Cavallo said. He also said he was confident the Peronist leader would win a second term in next year's presidential elections. Early opinion polls point to a Menem victory, and the president himself is confident of a first-round win. Reports in the past two weeks that Mr Cavallo had threatened to resign over a spat with the Senate and with party and government insiders about a postal privatisation bill hit stocks and bonds last week.</p>

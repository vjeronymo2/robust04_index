			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> POLICE GROUP CALLS PROP. 134 MISLEADING  </P> <P> The California Council of Police and Sheriffs on Tuesday denounced the  nickel-a-drink tax increase proposed on the Nov. 6 ballot, saying Proposition  134 would not fulfill its promises.  </P> <P> Up to three-fourths of the tax revenue earmarked for law enforcement could go  instead to unrelated programs, the council said.  </P> <P> Mike Carre, an investigator with the county district attorney's office and  representative of the police group, said: "The reason I take personal offense  to this initiative is that it seems to say so much money is going to law  enforcement, but it's not. I fail to see where in the world in that initiative  it says money is going to law enforcement in Orange County."  </P> <P> But Proposition 134 supporters, such as Californians for a Nickel a Drink, said  the wording has been misunderstood. Whereas the initiative says not less than  3% of an available 17% of the total raised will be used for drunk-driving  enforcement, foes have construed that to mean that just 3% will be used for  that purpose, said Bob Reynolds, the group's state campaign director.  </P> <P> "There's a little warfare going on in law enforcement," Reynolds said. "If they  want to use it all, that's OK. We said, 'no less than.' They are saying 'only.'  </P> <P> "What's tragic in all this is that they've convinced law enforcement that their  loyalties lie with the alcohol industry. Law enforcement agencies know what  alcohol does, and for them to oppose this initiative is embarrassing."  </P> <P> Proposition 134 would raise the tax on beer from 4 cents per gallon to 57  cents, an increase of about 30 cents a six-pack. It would also raise the tax on  wine from 1 cent per gallon to $1.29, a price increase of about 25 cents per  750-milliliter bottle. The tax on hard liquor would increase from $2 per gallon  to $8.40, or about $1.27 on a 750-milliliter bottle.  </P> <P> Supporters say the $760 million expected to be raised by this tax increase in  the first year would go for treatment and prevention programs, emergency and  trauma treatment, treatment programs for women, children and disabled people  and law enforcement programs.  </P> <P> Foes of Proposition 134 instead back Proposition 126, which would also raise  alcohol taxes, to collect about one-fourth the money that Proposition 134  would, but would put the money into a general fund that could be used for law  enforcement and prevention programs.  </P> <P> Proposition 126 does not promise that it will raise a certain amount of money,  its supporters say.

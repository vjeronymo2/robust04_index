			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Correct representation of views on local government Sir I refer to Mr Philip G Yuill's letter (January 4) concerning local government reorganisation. The Teesside and District Chamber of Commerce, with some 1,100 member companies, has had a local government working group with the Confederation of British Industry and the Teesside Small Business Club for many years now, and has been consulting both its members and the larger business community over this issue for some considerable time. Our members range in size from the region's very largest companies to one-man-bands. Representations made on their behalf are their own views and are not made, as Mr Yuill states, by 'those who have a vested interest in the debate'. Mr Yuill refers to partnerships between the local councils and the private sector. This chamber of commerce was invited by all our local councils to assist them in developing their City Challenge bids and we have representatives on both the boards and executive committees of Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough City Challenge groups, as well as specialist working groups. The chamber movement, both on Teesside and nationally, has an excellent record of partnerships with local government. My attendance at the launch of the putative Tees Valley Development Company on a 'bitterly cold foggy morning' (as Mr Yuill describes it), on behalf of the Teesside Chamber of Commerce, is an indication that we will continue to work with local government on economic development in our region, as we have been doing for some 130 years. We believe that, having consulted our members extensively, we have correctly represented their views concerning the future of local government in the region. Peter Crowe, chief executive, Teesside Chamber of Commerce, Commerce House, Exchange Square, Middlesbrough, Cleveland</p>

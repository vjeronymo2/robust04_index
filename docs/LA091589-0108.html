			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNK BOND SCARE MAKES INVESTORS MORE CAUTIOUS;  </P> <P> MANY WONDER IF INCREASING DEBT BURDEN IS HURTING FIRMS' ABILITY TO COMPETE  </P> <P> Although price declines for high-yield junk bonds subsided Thursday after a  violent selloff the day before, this week's rout shows that the $200-billion  junk market has entered a new era of increasing risk and volatility, analysts  said.  </P> <P> Accordingly, investors have become much more picky about which junk issues they  will buy, and they are demanding higher yields over safer Treasury securities  to justify the risks. The "spread" between junk bond yields and those on  Treasuries has widened to well over 5 percentage points, compared to 4.2 points  last year.  </P> <P> "The more of these types of scares that we have, the more cautious investors  are going to be," said Michael Singer, director of research at R. D. Smith  &amp; Co., a New York firm that specializes in securities of troubled  companies.  </P> <P> In addition, investors are no longer worried just about a possible recession  and how that would depress the profits of junk bond issuers. They are also  worried about the increasing debt burdens that many issuers have taken on, and  how those borrowings are impairing these companies' ability to compete even  without a recession.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Market Share Lost  </P> <P> Indeed, investors are increasingly wary of junk bonds from issuers such as  retailing giant Campeau Corp., which must rely on asset sales and optimistic  revenue increases to pay interest on those bonds. Campeau's disclosure this  week that it faces a cash crunch, due in part to disappointing sales growth and  other woes, set its Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores bonds  plummeting Wednesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> Prices of bonds of other retailers, as well as health-care and financial  services firms, have also been hit hard, analyst Singer said. Investors fear  that their asset sales and cash flows will be inadequate. Meanwhile, some are  losing market share to rivals with less debt that are better able to finance  expansions and other competitive moves.  </P> <P> "With these difficulties now, who knows what will happen when a recession  finally hits," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service,  a chief bond rating firm. "You've really never experienced a recession with  your corporate sector as leveraged as it is today."  </P> <P> The junk bond worries have also added a sharp dose of caution to the market for  leveraged buyouts. Several troubled junk bond issuers, including Campeau,  boosted their debts through junk bonds used to finance LBOs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Starting to Collapse'  </P> <P> Some analysts also contend that the market is less stable because of the  absence of former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Michael Milken, who  resigned under terms of Drexel's guilty plea to securities law violations.  </P> <P> "Milken used to dress up troubled issues, restructuring and refinancing them so  that everyone went away happy," said C. Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond  Investors Assn. in Miami Lakes, Fla. "Since Milken stepped away, there's been  no one there to hold the house of cards together, and it's starting to  collapse."  </P> <P> Indeed, investors have some justifications for their belief that the stakes are  higher in junk bonds. The default rate on junk bonds so far this year has  nearly doubled last year's pace. About $8.3 billion worth of junk bonds have  defaulted this year, versus $4.8 billion for all of last year, according to the  Bond Investors Assn. That represents a default rate of more than 4%, compared  to 2% to 3% before, Lehmann said.  </P> <P> "Junk bonds are beginning to earn their name," he said.  </P> <P> Among the biggest junk defaults this year are issues of American Continental,  parent of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine; Southmark, a giant  Dallas-based limited partnership syndicator; Integrated Resources, a New York  financial services concern; Resorts International, the hotel and casino company  acquired by entertainer Merv Griffin, and Eastern Airlines, attempting to  reorganize through federal bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Yielded as Much as 25%  </P> <P> Further, some of the more recent defaults have occurred within a year of the  bonds being issued, and in some cases even before the first interest payment  was due, Lehmann said. Such were the cases with recent junk bonds issued by New  York retailer Crazy Eddie, Resorts International, Residential Resources and  Multimedia, Lehmann said.  </P> <P> In Thursday's market action, prices for bonds of Allied Stores and Federated  Department Stores fell again sharply as investors continued to reel from news  of Campeau's cash squeeze. A key Federated junk bond fell about 8 points, or  $80 for each $1,000 in face value, while the most widely watched Allied junk  issue fell about 10 points, one analyst said. The sharp decline meant that the  Allied bond yielded as much as 25%, since yields rise when bond prices fall.  </P> <P> News of their declines helped spark greater outflows of money from at least  some mutual funds investing in junk bonds. Steven E. Norwitz, spokesman for the  T. Rowe Price mutual fund group in Baltimore, said outflows of funds from its  high-yield fund were "well above average" Thursday.  </P> <P> However, the declines in the Allied and Federated bonds did not trigger sharp  declines in other junk issues Thursday, as they did Wednesday. Junk issues  generally fell between 1/2 to 1 points in slow activity, traders said.  </P> <P> "There was not the same panic atmosphere as yesterday," said James Spirrison,  senior vice president at Rodman &amp; Renshaw, a Chicago brokerage.  </P> <P> To be sure, the vast majority of junk issues still remain in good shape, and  there was nothing in the news this week to change the financial conditions or  prospects of their issuers. Further, this week's market selloff could very well  have been overdone, leading to a surge of buying by bargain hunters attracted  by low prices and higher spreads over Treasuries, analysts said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Have to Be 'Selective'  </P> <P> "It's possible we will see some of these issues bounce back," Moody's Lonski  said.  </P> <P> "As long as you're selective, there are a lot of good companies issuing junk  bonds," said Daniel Smith, portfolio manager for the Van Kampen Merritt  Corporate High-Yield mutual fund, which was buying junk issues selectively on  Thursday. "These will continue to be viable markets; they've just gotten a lot  of bad press recently."  </P> <P> But more redemptions by investors in junk bond mutual funds could cause further  selloffs by forcing those fund managers to unload bonds to pay off investors,  Spirrison said. Continued declines might also discourage companies from issuing  new junk bonds, he added.  </P></p>

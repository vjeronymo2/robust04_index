			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: SAS looks for cupid in Europe's open skies - The airline's ultimate aim of a full-blown merger ahead of deregulation Faced with the prospects of deregulation in his domestic market in Sweden and broader liberalisation in Europe, Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), has been scrambling to expand his airline's ties with other carriers both on the home and wider European front. Last week, SAS boosted its stake in Airlines of Britain, the parent company of British Midland, from 24.9 per cent to 40 per cent for Pounds 25m (Dollars 42.5m) to cement its relationship with the UK carrier which had recently been approached by other international carriers interested in a stake. In February, it agreed to buy 51 per cent control of Linjeflyg, the Swedish domestic carrier. The acquisition, now being reviewed by Sweden's office of fair trading, is designed to consolidate the airline's position in its home market in anticipation of Swedish airline deregulation. After an unsuccessful attempt to link with Sabena of Belgium five years ago, SAS has since formed a commercial partnership with Swissair and Austrian Airlines called the European Quality Alliance (EQA). For Mr Carlzon, the ultimate target continues to be a full-blown merger with another European airline to enable SAS to establish a stronger position in the European market. Based on the geographical fringes of Europe, SAS is handicapped by its smaller size compared not only with the large US carriers now aggressively expanding into Europe but also with the big European carriers like British Airways, Air France or Lufthansa. But for all the recent talk of cross-border airline mergers in Europe, these have so far been elusive, although the European Commission's third package of air transport liberalisation measures is likely to accelerate the process next year. In the absence of a full merger, Mr Carlzon says the second best solution is to get as close as possible to this goal. 'Our aim is to have as close a co-operation as if we were merged, knowing that we cannot merge,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. As the sunlight streams into his spacious office in SAS's modern steel and glass headquarters building in Stockholm, he smiles and adds: 'If you cannot get the girl you want you have to take the second best, otherwise you will be left all alone.' To survive when the European airline market is liberalised next year, SAS, he says, must broaden its market base and establish its presence in the main destinations of Europe, at the same time as improving efficiency and its financial situation. 'If we sit in Scandinavia, we will have too small a market to be competitive,' he explains. 'None of the European airlines have access to more than one major hub in their home market, but by combining SAS with British Midland and EQA, we will have an annual passenger volume of 35.2m passengers'. This, he claims, makes his partnership the largest in Europe, placing it ahead of the Air France group with 33.4m passengers a year. The three EQA partners have hubs in Copenhagen (SAS), Zurich (Swissair) and Vienna (Austrian Airlines). British Midland provides the alliance with an important presence at London's Heathrow since the UK carrier has the second largest number of take-off and landing 'slots' at Heathrow after BA. With British Midland, SAS hopes to enter the UK market under cover. But it is also a way of fending off a growing challenge from smaller independent Scandinavian carriers seeking to develop a rival hub at London's Gatwick airport to compete against SAS. Three Scandinavian carriers, Transwede Airways, Norway Airways and Sterling, have joined forces under the umbrella of the NRT Nordisk travel group to take advantage of Swedish airline deregulation and develop feeder services from Scandinavia to Gatwick and other European airports to connect with the international networks of larger airlines. Maersk Air, the Danish independent carrier, is also building up a hub at Gatwick. These smaller carriers believe they can compete strongly against SAS because their costs are about 30 per cent lower than those of the Scandinavian flag carrier. This is putting additional pressure on SAS to reduce its costs. The airline, which cut 2,700 jobs last year and plans to shed a further 3,500 this year, is seeking to improve productivity by 20 per cent in 1991-92. This has not been easy. It started negotiating 38 separate collective agreements with unions in Scandinavia 15 months ago. So far, it has reached agreement with 35 without lowering any of the salaries. The remaining three are the pilots' unions where SAS wants the pilots to increase the time they actually fly during their working day. SAS risks seeing its virtual monopoly of the Scandinavian market eroded by domestic deregulation at a time when it is still struggling to recover from the general airline industry slump as well as strengthening its European network through partnerships and alliances. The airline was extremely concerned by the unsuccessful merger talks between BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. A BA-KLM combination would have posed a significant competitive threat to SAS which, in turn, attempted to interest KLM in joining its EQA partnership with Swissair and Austrian Airlines. Mr Carlzon has not only had to cope with recession but has also had to alter radically his earlier ambitious strategy of turning SAS into a global travel and hotel group. The group, which made a pre-tax loss of SKr1.22bn (Dollars 206m) last year compared with a loss of SKr736m in 1990, is now refocusing on its core airline activities. Apart from the fall in air traffic, the group was hit by heavy losses from its unsuccessful attempt to expand its hotel activities: it bought a 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental in 1989 from Saison, the Japanese retail and leisure group which is the hotel chain's controlling shareholder, but was forced to sell the stake back last month (March). The U-turn was seen as a clear admission of failure, and Mr Carlzon - who was strongly criticised for his decision to embark on this loss-making project - says that he regrets the ill-starred venture. In future, SAS may sell some of the other hotels it owns, but Mr Carlzon says he does not intend putting them up for sale until there is some sign of recovery in the troubled property market.</p>

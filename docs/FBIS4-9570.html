			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following reports on economic  developments in the Republic of Croatia are from periodicals  published in the republic.  <H5>  Exclusive Residences of Croatia's `New Ruling Class' </H5>   Although the "most attractive land" in the northern part of  Zagreb costs as much as 4,500 German marks [DM] per square meter  and building permits alone cost as much as DM200,000,  businessmen and politicians are "rushing" to buy them and are  building more and more expensive villas and even castles. The  Zagreb weekly GLOBUS on 18 March reports in an article entitled  "Northern Zagreb: Forbidden City of Croatia's New Ruling Class"  that Zagreb's elite housing zones are in Prekrizje, Pantovcek,  Zelengaj, Cmrok, Tuskanac, and Salata. According to the weekly,  Mario Pleic, who claims to be working in state security, is  building a residence worth DM4,000,000 in Pantovcek, without a  valid permit. The family of the automobile transporter  Vuckovic, in Gornje Prekrizje No. 55, bought one of the most  beautiful villas in the northern part of the city, with a  luxurious swimming pool. In Zelengaj, Stjepan Pecevski, deputy  minister of internal affairs, became the owner of a  93-square-meter residence, and Milan Brezak, a "high official"  in the Interior Ministry, and Perica Juric, one of the founders  of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) and an  assembly representative, each bought a 112-square-meter  residence. GLOBUS lists numerous other politicians and  businessmen who have purchased luxurious properties in northern  Zagreb and mentions a new "interesting" construction that has  "sprouted up" in Prekrizje: a "real castle with towers and  arches" whose owner remains unknown.  <H5>  Rijeka Shipyard Sells Ship to Private Purchaser </H5>   A Rijeka resident of Herzegovinian origin, Jure Kutle, until  recently an oil-tanker captain, has purchased a ship, the Sv.  Antun Padovanski (St. Anthony of Padua), from the 3 Maj Shipyard  in Rijeka for $45 million, becoming the biggest private  shipowner in Croatia. In an interview he gave while "surrounded  by bodyguards" that was published in the 18 March issue of  GLOBUS, Kutle states that the ship will most probably be sailing  under the Liberian flag because Croatian taxes are too high. He  told GLOBUS that he is also in the process of founding the Kutle  Line shipping company. He worked as an oil-tanker captain for  30 years, GLOBUS reports, and, "thanks to lucrative  investments," he has "enough money to buy several ships."  <H5>  Zagreb Construction Firm Taking Over Split Partner </H5>   The Zagreb firm Montmontaza, which specializes in the  construction and equipping of petroleum and petrochemical  processing plants and petroleum terminals and pipelines,  recently bought 25 percent of the shares of the largest Split  construction company, Lavcevic, for DM11,800,000, according to  the 13 April Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. Montmontaza  Director Ivica Nuic told the daily that Montmontaza had  previously purchased 12.7 percent of Lavcevic's shares from  pension funds and a further 8 to 10 percent from small  shareholders. An agreement has been made for the purchase of  another 4.3 percent of shares from the Split bank, so that  Montmontaza has become the majority shareholder in Lavcevic.  Nuic says that his company bought the Lavcevic shares "to  protect its interests," since the two firms are working together  on a long-term project in Kazakhstan valued at $43 million.  Montmontaza will try to buy all the remaining Lavcevic shares  except the two blocks that are not for sale: the 6.2 percent  that belongs to the Republic of Croatia and the 7.3 percent  reserved for owner restitution.  <H5>  Record Share Sale by Privatization Fund </H5>   At a 7 April public auction conducted by the Croatian  Privatization Fund at the Zagreb stock exchange, 25,479 shares  of two enterprises were sold for a total of approximately  DM2,548,000, or 9.35 billion Croatian dinars. The value of the  transactions represents a one-day record for this year. The 8  April issue of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports that the bulk of the  trading consisted of the "Kapital Trade" brokerage firm's  purchase of 25,421 shares of stock in the Split confectioner  "Bobis" for DM2,542,000. The remainder was accounted for by the  "Investco" company's acquisition of 58 shares of the "Croatia  Auto" firm of Zagreb for DM5,800. Thus, total trade in 14  regular auctions conducted by the Croatian Privatization Fund  this year has amounted to about DM6.8 million, which represents  about 49,000 shares in 27 enterprises, the daily says.</p>

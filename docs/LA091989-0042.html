			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPRESSED ROMANIANS FLEE TO SANCTUARY IN HUNGARY  </P> <P> As a result of Hungary's liberal policies toward the East Bloc's political and  economic refugees, an increasing number of Romanians are risking jail -- and  occasionally the bullets of border guards -- in order to escape into Hungary.  </P> <P> About 20,000 Romanians are registered as refugees here, many of them ethnic  Hungarians fleeing the repressive policies of Romanian dictator Nicolae  Ceausescu, who is systematically destroying Hungarian villages in Transylvania  in an attempt to force the villagers into industrial cities.  </P> <P> Although the ethnic Hungarians have been absorbed here with relative ease  because they speak Hungarian, officials say the real problem lies with the  number of non-Hungarian Romanians fleeing across the border -- a number  increasing daily.  </P> <P> Many, they say, have been lured by the news that about 20,000 East German  refugees have been allowed by Hungary to emigrate to West Germany.  </P> <P> The problem with the non-Hungarian Romanians, however, is that no third country  is ready to accept them. The East Germans have all been granted automatic West  German citizenship.  </P> <P> "It is a problem that is worsening every day," said Laszlo Kovacs, who is  Hungary's deputy foreign minister. "In August, 50% of the Romanians coming here  were non-Hungarians. That means they do not know the language. They have  trouble getting jobs here. They do not want to stay here. They want to go on to  a third country. In the meantime, we must take care of them."  </P> <P> Next month, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will open an  office in Budapest, the first allowed to operate in an East Bloc country.  Hungarian officials say they hope the office will help speed the Romanian  refugees on to permanent settlement in other countries.  </P> <P> About 4,000 Romanians have been settled at a transient camp in the town of  Bicske, near Budapest. Another large group of refugees is housed in the city of  Debrecin in eastern Hungary.  </P> <P> Most new arrivals make their way to Budapest, where a government office has  been established near the central bus station. Officials there try to find  accommodations for them and, if possible, employment.  </P> <P> "We are getting about 65 new arrivals every day," said Ferenc Nemeth, who heads  the office. "About half of them are non-Hungarian-speaking Romanians, and for  them it is very hard.  </P> <P> "Most of them are unskilled workers, mostly with only primary-school education.  They want to go on to somewhere else, so it is difficult to find them jobs.  Some people don't want to hire them because they know they will leave soon. We  find them jobs doing unskilled work in construction, sweeping, working in  kitchens, whatever we can."  </P> <P> Nemeth said his office gives priority in the hunt for housing to families with  children. Because of a severe housing shortage in Budapest, where waiting lists  for apartments range from 10 to 15 years, most are sent to smaller towns and  cities across the country.  </P> <P> Single men, who represent the majority of the refugees, are often housed in  worker hostels, three or four to a room.  </P> <P> Among the Romanians crowding the office Monday were three young men who had  spent the last three nights in the main train station in Budapest. They had  crossed the border together Thursday night, they said, crawling the last  several hundred yards through plowed fields, their escape aided by ground fog.  </P> <P> "If they had caught us," said one of the men, 20-year-old Edmund Cleci, "they  would have beaten us and thrown us in jail for nine months." Cleci said he  spoke from experience, because this was his second escape attempt.  </P> <P> "It is impossible to live there," said a 21-year-old named Marton, who asked  that his last name not be used. "There is nothing. There is no meat. In the  market there are only plums. Some people have potatoes now, if they have a  garden, but there is nothing in the market."  </P> <P> Another man, Stefan, 23, put in: "And when you work, you get paid nothing for  your work. There is no hope for Romania now. That is what most of us think. If  there was, I would not have left."  </P> <P> "The situation is so bad," Cleci said, "that most people think it cannot get  worse."  </P> <P> "Romania is racist," charged Ladislau Sirb, 24, who escaped from Romania two  months ago and has been working as a painter on a construction project. "They  have taken away our schools, they have taken down the street signs in  Hungarian, they want to remove the Hungarian language from us."  </P> <P> The three new arrivals came with only the clothes on their backs. The soles of  Cleci's sneakers were peeling off in layers, but he smiled, as though his  fortunes were already taking a turn for the better.  </P> <P> "They are sending us to the Red Cross for some clothes and to a church for some  money," he said.  </P> <P> He looked at Sirb, smiled, and added: "Our friend here says we may get a job  where he is working. We can paint with him."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 12 Jun (JANA) -- The Western official mass  media has launched a noticeable campaign, characterized by panic  and alarm, against the statements made to a Lebanese court by  Palestinian defendant Yusuf Sah'ban. The campaign has been  started in an attempt to cast doubt over these statements. The  Palestinian defendant has admitted to the whole world that he  blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland.    JANA's international affairs editor comments on this by  querying the reasoning behind the panic among the western mass  media and colonialist quarters. He wonders about the reason  behind this unprecedented uproar, which began when the  Palestinian defendant announced his admission -- which was heard  by the whole world with no exception.    Does this panic express a breakdown in the plots of  colonialism and material forces? This expresses their bitter  feeling that they have failed once again, and in an undisputed  way, to defend their fabrications, mask their lies, and to turn  them into realities.</p>

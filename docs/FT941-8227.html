			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / US rail group plans gold float Santa Fe Pacific, the US railroad group, is expected soon to float its gold subsidiary on terms that would give Santa Fe Gold Corporation a market value of at least Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn). Analysts suggest the stock market launch of Santa Fe Gold will follow closely behind the eagerly-anticipated Dollars 1bn flotation in London and Ghana of Ashanti Goldfields. Santa Fe Gold includes some of the US assets Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations. This deal transformed Santa Fe Gold into the sixth largest North American gold producer with an anticipated 1994 output of 900,000 troy ounces. It also has one of the biggest gold reserves in North America: 14m ounces. Analysts expect the parent to do an IPO (initial public offering) of about 20 per cent of Santa Fe Gold to raise Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m. Santa Fe would then dividend its entire holding to the parent group's shareholders so by the end of this year the gold company would have a free float of 100 per cent. Santa Fe would not discuss the issue, probably because it felt constrained by US regulations, but analysts were alerted in June when the group applied for a ruling from the tax authorities that the distribution of the Santa Fe Gold shares would be tax free. Such rulings typically take between six and nine months to be made known. Ms Lindsey Falconer, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine Fleming group, suggested the tax ruling was likely to be favourable but, even it it was not, Santa Fe would go ahead with the IPO. She estimated the gold subsidiary was worth Dollars 1.6bn or about Dollars 8.50 per Santa Fe share. 'The stock looks very attractive when compared with other senior North American producers, it will be seen as a core holding among the North American gold shares and will be eligible for inclusion in the new Financial Times Gold Index,' she said. Santa Fe Gold now has three mines in northern Nevada: Lone Tree, Mesquite and Twin Creeks (a combination of Hanson's Chimney Creek mine and Santa Fe's Rabbit Creek). It is one of the biggest holders of minerals rights in the western US - 7.2m acres in some of the most prospective regions, inherited from its parent.</p>

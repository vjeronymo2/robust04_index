			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER CLAIMS HE WAS THREATENED BY SAMPSON  </P> <P> Sacramento Kings' center Ralph Sampson threatened to beat up a newspaper  reporter, apparently over a column that called the former All-Star one of  basketball's "great disappointments."  </P> <P> Sampson interrupted an interview Sacramento Bee reporter R.E. Graswich was  holding with Kings' player personnel director Jerry Reynolds before Tuesday's  114-105 loss to the Clippers.  </P> <P> "If you ever write something about me without talking to me again, I'll punch  you in the nose," the Bee quoted Sampson as saying. "I'll be waiting for you  outside. I'll bust you up. I'm not kidding. I'll get you. I'll bust you up."  </P> <P> The Bee said Graswich has tried several times to speak with Sampson about his  medical condition, and the 29-year-old center has declined to discuss the  issue.  </P> <P> "I can't really comment because I don't know what happened," said Rick Benner,  team president. "If Ralph said those things, we can't have it. He's not going  to be busting anybody up."  </P> <P> Said Reynolds: "It was all talk."  </P> <P> Sampson, in his seventh year in the NBA, has missed 21 games this season and  suffers from arthritis in his knees. In a column published Tuesday before the  incident, Graswich wrote: " . . . Sampson is one of the game's great  disappointments. It's sad to watch him now."  </P> <P> Sampson, Houston's No. 1 pick in the 1983 draft, was traded to Golden State in  1987 and to the Kings last season.  </P></p>

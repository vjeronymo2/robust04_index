			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous multipurpose impoundments, including three mainstem reservoirs on the Arkansas River and four mainstem reservoirs on the Canadian River, have been constructed within the Arkansas River Basin. These impoundments have inundated, dewatered, or otherwise altered considerable sections of riverine habitat once inhabited by Arkansas River shiners. Inundation has eliminated Arkansas River shiner spawning habitat, isolated populations, and favored an increased abundance of predators. Water releases from impoundments may be infrequent or non-existent, resulting in dewatering of stream sections downstream of the reservoir. Where sufficient water is released to maintain downstream flows, the releases generally alter the natural flow regime for considerable distances downstream of the impoundment, establishing a stream environment unlike that which existed under pre-impoundment conditions. Physical changes resulting from altered flows may include modifications to water velocity, wetted perimeter (amount of streambed exposed to water at any given flow), water depth, streambed and bank erosion, and suspension and distribution of bed and bank sediments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1952, the Arkansas River shiner was believed to inhabit the entire Arkansas mainstem in Kansas, but was already suspected to be declining due to the construction of John Martin Reservoir 10 years earlier on the Arkansas River in Bent County, Colorado (Cross  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1985). By 1960, the species had disappeared from the Arkansas River mainstem west of Wichita, Kansas, and was absent from the entire Kansas portion of the Arkansas mainstem by 1983 (Cross  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arkansas River shiners were apparently abundant in the Arkansas River near Tulsa, Oklahoma, prior to construction of Keystone Reservoir in 1964 (Pigg 1991). Following the addition of hydropower at Keystone Dam in 1968, the resultant flow alterations severely depleted Arkansas River shiner populations. The Arkansas river shiner was last observed from the section of the Arkansas River between Keystone Reservoir and Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1982. Kaw Reservoir, another Arkansas River mainstem impoundment, located upstream of Keystone Reservoir, became operational in 1976. In 1989, hydropower was added to Kaw Dam. Shiners were last observed downstream of Kaw Reservoir in 1986 (Larson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991, Pigg 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the Canadian River, Lake Meredith and Eufaula Reservoir have impacted the Arkansas River shiner. Prior to completion of Eufaula Reservoir, Arkansas River shiners were abundant in the Canadian River between the proposed dam site and the Arkansas River (Pigg 1991). Arkansas River shiners have not been collected from this reach of the Canadian River since the reservoir became operational in 1964. The disappearance of Arkansas River shiners below Eufaula Reservoir has been attributed to rapid water level fluctuations occurring during hydropower generation and altered conditions favoring an abundant predatory fish population (Pigg 1991). Lake Meredith was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1965 and conservation storage is presently managed by the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority. Releases from Lake Meredith are infrequent to non-existent (Williams and Wolman l984) and have considerably altered flows in the Canadian River downstream of the reservoir. Historically, discharge at Canadian, Texas, located 121 kilometers (km) (75 miles (mi)) below Lake Meredith, averaged 15.5 cubic meters per second (549 cubic ft per second (cfs)); however, following completion of the reservoir, annual discharge has averaged only 2.5 cubic meters per second (87.7 cfs) (Buckner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1985). Principal sources of water to the Canadian River below Lake Meredith are sewage effluent, tributary inflow, and groundwater emergence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reduced flows below Lake Meredith have considerably altered the morphology of the Canadian River and have reduced the extent of suitable habitat for Arkansas River shiners. Stinnett  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1988) examined a 370 km (230 mi) stretch of the Canadian River and associated floodplain 72,843 hectares (179,995 acres) between the western Oklahoma border and the western Pottawatomie County line near Norman, Oklahoma. Quantification of wetland areas between 1955 and l984 revealed that the amount of riverine wetlands (shoreline and open water) had decreased by about 50 percent. Sandbar acreage alone had been reduced by 54 percent. Wetland and associated floodplain changes were principally the result of hydrological modifications due to the influence of Lake Meredith (Stinnett  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1988). The lack of significant scouring flows permitted the encroachment of vegetation within the channel, reducing channel width by almost 50 percent since 1955. Although Arkansas River shiners persist in the Canadian River downstream of Lake Meredith, the reduction in available habitat has likely suppressed shiner populations. Habitat alterations associated with reduced flows downstream of Lake Meredith are considered to be a significant, ongoing threat to the continued existence of the Arkansas River shiner within the Canadian River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other mainstem impoundments within the historic range of Arkansas River shiner include Ute and Conchas reservoirs on the upper Canadian River, Optima and Canton reservoirs on the North Canadian River, and Great Salt Plains Reservoir on the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River. Arkansas River shiner populations persist only below Ute Reservoir (Larson <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1991, Pigg 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Groundwater is an extremely important source of water in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, and the Texas panhandle (Stoner 1985, Texas Department of Water Resources 1984, Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1980, 1990). Withdrawals from western Oklahoma aquifers account for about 80 percent of the State's total groundwater usage (Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1990). Irrigation of croplands has diverted surface water and lowered groundwater tables throughout southwestern Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma. Water tables receded from 3 m (10 ft) to more than 30 m (100 ft) over much of southwestern Kansas during the period from 1950 to 1975 (Cross <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1983). Between 1955 and 1980, declines in water levels by as much as 31 m (102 ft) have been recorded in the Ogallala Aquifer in Oklahoma (Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1980). In 1960, there were about 400 groundwater wells in the Oklahoma panhandle; by 1965 the number had risen to 975; and in 1974, the number of wells had risen to 2,067 (Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1980). By 1988, there were an estimated 3,200 high capacity wells overlying the Ogallala Aquifer in western Oklahoma alone (Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1990). At present, rainfall and runoff contribute little recharge to the underlying aquifers. In Texas, withdrawals of groundwater in the Canadian River Basin were as much as 33 times higher than the annual natural recharge in 1980, and irrigation return flows in the Basin are negligible (Texas Department of Water Resources 1984). When groundwater is pumped faster than it is restored, water tables drop, channel seepage ceases, and streams cease to flow. Under these conditions, suitable habitat to support Arkansas River shiner populations is non-existent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

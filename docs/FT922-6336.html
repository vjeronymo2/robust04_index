			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Training as apprentice invaluable Sir, As one who is fortunate enough to have had a student apprenticeship in electronic engineering, I found the article by Malcolm Craig (Personal View, May 20) most interesting. I agree entirely with his views concerning the adverse effects on British industry of the decline in the availability of craft apprenticeships, but suggest that the position is even more serious in relation to the reduction in student and graduate apprenticeship opportunities. My own student apprenticeship, which was with Cossor Electronics, was most carefully planned and was overseen by a senior member of the research and development laboratories, in which I was employed as an electronics development engineer after my training. As an apprentice, I spent periods in all of the manufacturing departments and in the drawing office, the last year being spent in the marine radar development laboratory. I eventually became technical director and, latterly, joint deputy managing director. Many of those now in senior positions in industry had the benefit of a student or graduate apprenticeship - the excellent training which I received during my student apprenticeship has been of the greatest benefit to me at all stages in my career. Perhaps this is a matter in which the Engineering Council should take an interest. Richard M Trim, managing director, Gilden Research, 17 The Mount, Fetcham, Leatherhead, Surrey KT22 9EB</p>

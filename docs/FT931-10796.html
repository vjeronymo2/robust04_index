			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Nine reach shortlist for editorship of Economist NINE OF Britain's brightest rising media stars have gone into serious training. Over the next month they will do battle for one of the biggest jobs in their trade - editor of The Economist, the world's most influential business weekly. The shortlist of candidates will be interviewed on March 4. But a wrong word at the interview, and the chance of editing the 150-year-old weekly, half-owned by the Financial Times, could be lost. Past performance suggests that the job is a reliable springboard for ambitious types intent on making their mark in business life. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, 45, the current editor, has been appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England. His predecessor, Mr Andrew Knight, is executive chairman of New International, Mr Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper empire. All the current candidates, with the exception of Mr Matt Ridley, work for the magazine and the majority are in their 40s - Ms Frances Cairncross, Mr Nico Colchester, Mr Johnny Grimond, Mr Jim Rohwer and Mr Mike Elliott. Mr Bill Emmott, Mr Clive Crook and Mr Daniel Franklin are 37, and Mr Ridley will be 35 tomorrow. The shortlist includes several with powerful connections. Mr Grimond, the magazine's foreign editor, is heir to Lord Grimond, the former Liberal leader, and Mr Ridley is the eldest son of Viscount Ridley. Ms Cairncross, the environment editor, is daughter of Sir Alec Cairncross, a former head of the government economic service and married to Mr Hamish McRae, associate editor of The Independent. The final selection will be on March 9.</p>

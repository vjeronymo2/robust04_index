			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT LOSES BID TO BLOCK 8 MURDERS FROM TRIAL  </P> <P> Lawyers for Randy Steven Kraft failed Thursday in their bid to keep evidence of  eight more murders out of the penalty phase of his trial, but said they  wouldn't debate most of the facts of those killings.  </P> <P> "We're hoping these murders can be presented as expeditiously as possible so  that we can get on with what I consider the real issues of a penalty phase, the  character and background (of Kraft)," defense attorney James G. Merwin told the  judge.  </P> <P> Kraft, 44, convicted in Santa Ana last month of 16 Orange County murders, could  be the most prolific serial killer in the country's history, prosecutors  contend. They have linked Kraft in court papers to a total of 45 sex-related  murders of young men. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has decided to  present evidence of only eight additional killings when he asks jurors for a  death verdict at the next phase of the trial, which is scheduled to begin  Monday. Those murders occurred in Oregon and Michigan.  </P> <P> Kraft's lawyers half-kiddingly have thanked Brown for paring down the numbers  to shorten the next trial phase. But any new murders at all are too much, they  argue.  </P> <P> "If this were football, Brown would be assessed a 15-yard penalty for piling  on," Merwin said.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin, at a non-jury hearing Thursday,  rejected several motions by the defense to keep the Oregon and Michigan murders  out of the next phase of the trial.  </P> <P> In that phase, the jurors will decide only between verdicts of death or life in  prison without parole. A judge can reduce a death verdict but cannot upgrade a  life without parole verdict to death. In Orange County, no judge has set aside  a jury's death verdict since the new death law was first instituted 12 years  ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dilemma for Defense  </P> <P> Kraft's lawyers say the new murders in the penalty phase present a dilemma for  Kraft's defense.  </P> <P> "The focus of the penalty phase should be the proper penalty for the 16 murders  in the conviction, not another trial on whether he is guilty of killing eight  more," Kraft attorney William J. Kopeny said.  </P> <P> While Kraft lawyer Merwin was not conceding that Kraft killed the victims in  Oregon and Michigan, he said the defense will not contest many of the facts.  </P> <P> "The jury already thinks he killed 16 people, and we have to concentrate on  that," Merwin said.  </P> <P> In fact, the defense's only real victory in a full day of motions Thursday was  to persuade the prosecution to stipulate to some of the more technical  testimony, to prevent bringing in several out-of-state witnesses. Merwin also  wants Brown to agree not to put on families of the victims in Oregon and  Michigan. That issue is one of many which will be addressed when the hearings  continue today.  </P> <P> Judge McCartin has warned the attorneys that he will not allow these non-jury  hearings to interrupt the beginning of testimony on Monday. He threatened to  hold a court session Saturday if the defense motions are not wrapped up today.  </P> <P> Kraft, a computer expert, was on business in northern Oregon and in Grand  Rapids, Mich., for the Santa Monica-based Lear Siegler Inc. at the times when  all eight of those young men were killed between 1980 and 1982. Most of the  victims in the Kraft case were either emasculated, mutilated, or in some way  sexually assaulted.  </P></p>

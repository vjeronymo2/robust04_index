			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO SEEK SETTLEMENT OR FILE CHARGES AGAINST ROCKWELL  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office said Thursday it expects to file a civil  complaint against Rockwell International unless it can reach an out-of-court  settlement with the firm over alleged hazardous waste violations at its Santa  Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Ken Alex said the case was formally referred to his office  early Thursday by the state Department of Health Services, which previously had  cited Rockwell for hazardous waste violations after an inspection last June of  the 2,668-acre test site.  </P> <P> The attorney general will pursue the case "with an eye toward filing a civil  complaint," according to Alex. But he said Rockwell will first be approached  about reaching a settlement, which would result in the filing of a consent  decree.  </P> <P> Alex said there is little chance the state will drop the case, "unless the  company gives us information that we're not currently aware of."  </P> <P> Each hazardous waste violation carries a penalty of up to $25,000 per day.  Rockwell's potential exposure is great, since some of the allegations involve  long-term non-compliance -- such as years of operating waste treatment  equipment without needed permits.  </P> <P> However, it was unclear how many counts might be filed in court. State health  officials originally cited Rockwell for 13 violations after the June  inspection. But health officials said in the past that they had dropped some  counts, based on a follow-up investigation and Rockwell's response last October  to the original citation.  </P> <P> Rich Varenchik, a spokesman in Burbank for the health department's toxic  substances control division, declined to discuss the number of counts referred  to the attorney general. Alex said he did not know how many counts will be  filed, pending a review of the file.  </P> <P> In its inspection last June, the state did not cite Rockwell for toxic spills  or illegal discharges, but rather for failure to meet compliance deadlines,  submit required plans and obtain permits for cleanup equipment -- such as  air-stripping towers the firm is using to treat ground water tainted by  chemical solvents.  </P> <P> But officials said this does not mean the case is minor. "As a general rule,  operation without a permit is a serious violation," Alex said.  </P> <P> A Rockwell official said he was irritated and surprised that the health  department referred the case to the attorney general without telling the  company.  </P> <P> Steve Lafflam, manager of environmental affairs for Rockwell's Rocketdyne  Division, which runs the Santa Susana lab, said Rockwell had supplied the  health department with documents missing from the state's files in an effort to  show "the alleged violations were inaccurate and erroneous. . . .  </P> <P> "We thought we were working very closely with them," Lafflam said. "We really  thought we had resolved most of the issues."  </P> <P> The Santa Susana lab has been engulfed in controversy since reports last spring  of low level radioactive and chemical contamination caused by nuclear and other  energy research. The work has been carried out in a 290-acre portion of the  test site for more than 30 years for the U.S. Department of Energy and its  predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.  </P> <P> However, most of the 13 violations originally cited by the health department  involved non-nuclear areas of Santa Susana, where Rockwell does rocket testing  for the Air Force and NASA.  </P> <P> In another development Thursday, DOE regional officials for the first time  disclosed that President Bush's budget proposal contains $7.6 million for  environmental cleanup and waste management activities at Santa Susana in fiscal  1991, well below what agency officials had sought.  </P> <P> Although Bush's budget plan was unveiled Monday, officials at DOE's San  Francisco operations office said they did not know until Thursday how much  money was included for the Santa Susana lab, one of the sites under their  jurisdiction. They said a previous news report citing a budget figure of $9.8  million was erroneous.  </P> <P> Altogether, DOE officials are seeking $35 million through fiscal 1995 to remove  contamination from soil, ground water and buildings at Santa Susana and to  bring equipment into compliance with new pollution control limits.  </P> <P> Rockwell, DOE and health officials say existing contamination at the site poses  no immediate hazard to workers or neighbors.  </P> <P> The Bush proposal, which must be considered by Congress, includes $2.8 billion  next year for environmental cleanup at DOE nuclear weapons plants and test  sites nationwide, up from $2.2 billion this year, a DOE official said.  </P></p>

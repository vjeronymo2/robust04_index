			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Clouds over the sunset regions: Why the funding system for community care has hit coastal and rural councils At a social services conference on the Isle of Wight two years ago Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, announced funding arrangements for the reform of community care that even her critics admitted looked unexpectedly generous. Ironically, the Isle of Wight County Council this week became the first local authority to have spent dry its community care budget, only two thirds of the way through the financial year. The island - where more than a quarter of the population is above retirement age - is not alone in facing problems. Gloucestershire County Council, with its care programme Pounds 1m in the red, started handling only emergency cases from Tuesday. Other local authorities are likely to be in serious difficulties before the end of the financial year. The new community care system is intended to help elderly people and those with handicaps live in the community rather than institutions, and the councils in trouble are those in coastal and rural areas with big elderly populations. The government has no plans, at least at present, to make emergency funds available to councils such as the Isle of Wight, which says it needs at least Pounds 500,000 to keep community care services running until April. But if more councils run into trouble in the coming winter ministers may be forced to take emergency action. Many local authority social services officials fear, however, that the problems are not temporary but the first evidence that the financial regime announced by Mrs Bottomley two years ago was not generous enough after all. The immediate difficulties for authorities such as the Isle of Wight and Gloucestershire arise from changes in the allocation of funds between 1993-94 and 1994-95. In the first year of the new system money was divided between individual councils on a 50-50 basis which took account of population structures - factors such as the proportion of elderly people - and the number of residential homes in each area. This benefited coastal and rural councils with large numbers of residential homes but was disastrous for cities such as London, which have relatively few homes but face heavy pressure on community care services. So this year funding was calculated on population structure alone, to the disadvantage of areas such as the Isle of Wight and Gloucestershire. However, Ms Denise Platt, Association of Metropolitan Authorities undersecretary for social services, regards the change in the allocation formula as a red herring. She said: 'It has pushed the immediate pressure from one part of the country to another. But the real problem is that the volume of people seeking community care services is much higher than was expected when the financial arrangements were introduced.' This view was supported by Mr Deryk Mead, Gloucestershire's director of social services, this week when he announced the county's financial crisis. He said: 'We have had 18 months' experience of implementing care and the number of people coming forward is far higher than was expected two years ago. The government had attempted to devise a fair formula but now had to recognise that things had 'worked out differently in practice'. Local authorities blame 'cost shunting' by the National Health Service for part of the unexpectedly high number of people seeking community care, with patients who might have previously received long term nursing care being referred instead to councils' community care services and budgets. These budgets are still heavily concentrated on providing residential care. Although the new system is intended to free funds for domiciliary care, these new services are proving slow to develop in many areas. Ms Platt said another factor was that the highly publicised community care reforms had proved a victim of their own success. Elderly people were exhorted to go to their local councils for community care assessment and had done so. Councils have powers to vary the criteria by which they define individuals' care needs. The easiest way of making the available money go further is to adopt tighter criteria. But with so few councils in Conservative control, demanding more money from the government is likely to prove a more politically acceptable option.</p>

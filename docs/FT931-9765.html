			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Poor tanker market sinks Bergesen's earnings BERGESEN, Norway's biggest shipping group, yesterday revealed a sharp decline in 1992 net profit to NKr25m (Dollars 3.5m) from NKr716m the previous year, caused by significant weakness in the world crude oil tanker market and a write-down of the group's share portfolio. Group operating revenue sank to NKr2.64bn last year, from NKr3.12bn in 1991. Operating profit plunged to NKr203m, from NKr857m. This was due to a NKr639m fall to NKr173m in operating profit from shipping operations. The company has proposed an unchanged dividend payment of NKr1 per share. Bergesen's tanker division fell to an operating loss of NKr218m, from a NKr464m profit in 1991. It was pushed into the red by a steep decline in day rates, which were almost halved to Dollars 16,200 from Dollars 30,300 in 1991. Bergesen's weak performance was exacerbated by a NKr143m write-down on the group's share portfolio and a NKr117m unrealised loss on foreign currency. Mr Morten Bergesen, chief executive, explained that, although 25 of the world's tankers had been scrapped last year, 26 newly-built units had entered the market. He forecast the scrapping of more old tankers this year, but he warned that balance in the tanker market may not be restored for another two years. Lower profits could also be expected in 1993 from liquid petroleum gas (LPG) carrier operations, he added. Bergesen's fleet suffered a sharp decline in value in 1992, measured in dollars, with tankers falling by 40 per cent, LPG carriers by 20 per cent and dry bulk carriers by 28 per cent. The group experienced a NKr184m net financial loss in 1992, compared with financial income of NKr40m a year earlier.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Poland stays on reform course Poland is to press ahead with painful reforms of the welfare system, aimed at cutting budget spending, as well as the consolidation and privatisation of the banking system. The capital market is to be strengthened through the development of investment and pension funds, according to a medium-term plan prepared by Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the new deputy premier and finance minister. The outlines of the plan were published yesterday as Poland started talks with a team from the International Monetary Fund on a new one-year stand-by agreement. The government plan, which runs until 1997, foresees an average annual growth rate of 5 per cent. It forecasts the achievement of single-figure inflation in 1997, compared with its present 25 per cent rate. The government also wants to see a reduction in the spread between lending and deposit rates. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall from 16 per cent to 14 per cent, while the budget deficit is to reach no more than 3 per cent of GDP in 1997, from its present 4 per cent.</p>

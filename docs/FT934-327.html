			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Solvency The Goode Committee's proposals for a minimum solvency standard could have the widest implications of all. A system of prudential regulation clearly needs to ensure that pension funds are adequately funded, but solvency is a slippery concept. The Goode approach is meant to ensure that funds always have sufficient assets to provide members with the benefits they have accrued. Calculating the current value of future benefits - the so-called cash equivalent - can be tackled several ways. Using gilt yields as a benchmark is common among actuaries calculating the value of benefits accrued by individuals transfering between schemes. Using this approach as the basis for an industry-wide solvency test, though, could create problems. With liabilities linked to gilts for solvency purposes and assets held in equities, many funds would face a mismatch. A bear market in equities combined with falling gilt yields - as happened in 1974 - could result in a sudden erosion of solvency. As a preventive measure, funds invested heavily in equities would come under pressure to switch more of their assets into gilts. If that resulted in lower returns, pensioners would suffer. The actuarial profession is trying to square the circle. A method of valuing cash equivalents in relation to equities may provide a partial solution. But striking a balance between the need to maximise investment returns and the overriding requirement for prudence will not be easy.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Eisenberg plans China ventures Mr Shaul Eisenberg, the Israeli billionaire, has concluded a series of deals to expand his investments in China following the normalisation of Israeli-Chinese relations. Many of the deals, involving the opening of Burger King fast-food restaurants, expansion of oil refineries and construction of a highway, were concluded during the recent visit to Israel by the governor of Jiangsu province, Mr Wu Guanzheng. The governor was a guest of Mr Eisenberg. Under the Burger King deal, signed this week in Tel Aviv between Mr Eisenberg and Mr James Adamson, president of Burger King International, the Israeli financier has won the franchise to open at least 10 restaurants in China. The first 500-seat restaurant will be in Beijing. Mr Eisenberg's Panama-registered United Development Incorporated (UDI) will carry out the project in co-operation with Chinese partners. During the visit of Jiangsu's governor, Mr Eisenberg also signed agreements to expand the province's oil refineries and construct a toll-highway from Nanjing to Shanghai. In addition, Mr Eisenberg is taking a stake in a new joint venture with Italian and local partners to produce industrial sewing machines. UDI is joining with Rimoldi, an Italian manufacturer, and Tianjin Tiangong, a local Chinese company. At full capacity, the new venture will produce 25,000 sewing machines a year. The majority stake will be held by the Chinese partner, while Rimoldi will have 23 per cent and UDI about 18 per cent.</p>

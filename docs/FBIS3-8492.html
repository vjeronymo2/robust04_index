			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Sali Berisha this afternoon received Loic  Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic Assembly, and Peter  Corterier, secretary general of the alliance.    I would first like to express my deep gratitude for the  contribution made to Albania's associate membership in the North  Atlantic Assembly through an accelerated process, President  Berisha said. I also have the pleasure of ascertaining that  this visit of yours came after Albania clearly and finally  demonstrated its Western pertinence. During the days of the  ultimatum, Albania offered the alliance its ports and airports.  We did so, first of all, to respect our Western roots, but to  also defend those prominent values and principles that the North  Atlantic Alliance has decided to defend in Bosnia.    We also signed the Partnership for Peace plan with pleasure  because we consider it an active and dynamic process in  Albania's full and dignified membership in the pact. We hail  the achievements that are being observed toward a solution to  the extremely complicated crisis in Bosnia, Berisha continued.  However, we observe with concern that this facilitation in the  north is also accompanied by an increase in tension toward the  south.    There is an undeniable escalation of violence and terror in  Kosova today. Out of revenge for the defeats suffered in the  north, Milosevic is closing the last remaining legal  institutions in Kosova one after another, such as the recent  closure of the Albanological Institute and the harassment of its  Albanian scientists. This is being carried out in full  conformity with the memorandum of the Academy of Serbia, which  anticipates the extermination and ethnic cleansing of the  non-Slavic peoples in the territories included in Greater  Serbia. We welcome and support the contribution made by the  European Union, the United States, and Russia in resolving the  Balkan crisis, but we ask for determination so that no one's  presence can serve as an encouragement for the Serbs, who are  the only aggressors, or serve their certain imperial aims. This  would have had very serious consequences in the region's  stability.    I am happy to be in Albania, Mr. Bouvard said, and I am very  enthusiastic about Albania's associate membership through an  accelerated process, because Albania has showed itself worthy of  this membership. We applaud your achievements in the determined  and difficult reform that you have undertaken in the army. We  consider Albania a country that belongs to Western Europe and a  country that is working for stability in the region. We are  determined to contribute to its strengthening, because in this  way we are contributing to stability in the region. We see  every possibility of granting Albania full membership in the  North Atlantic Alliance.</p>

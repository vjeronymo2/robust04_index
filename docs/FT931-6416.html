			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Eurotunnel train output halted A ROW between customer and supplier has halted production of shuttle trains intended to carry coaches and mini-vans through the Channel tunnel when it opens at the end of this year, it emerged yesterday. Bombardier Eurorail, the Brussels-based company building the trains for Eurotunnel, said it had to stop making the shuttles because it had no room left to store them. It said its Bruges production line was blocked because Transmanche-Link, the Franco-British contractor for the Channel tunnel, had failed to give the necessary authorisations for deliveries to begin. TML reacted with astonishment to the statement. 'TML has not received any detailed particulars of any such claims from Bombardier. . .' Bombardier is building 108 carriers for coaches and minivans as part of a FFr4bn (Pounds 506m) contract for Channel tunnel rolling stock.</p>

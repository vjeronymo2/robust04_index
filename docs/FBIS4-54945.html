			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Gabor Kuncze, Alliance of Free </F> Democrats nominee for prime minister, by correspondent Judit  Laszlo; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Laszlo] Are you satisfied with the election  results?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Demmocrats has done  well  in these elections. We received more than 1 million votes on  the lists. In effect, this means that we repeated our 1990  election results, that is we have achieved the aim we had set  for ourselves. The SZDSZ is the only party which has a chance  of preventing a landslide victory by the Hungarian Socialist  Party and of preventing the continuance of a covert one-party  system after the May elections. We have to wait for the results  of the second round. [passage omitted]    [Laszlo] There is an agreement between the SZDSZ and the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] that candidates who  scored poorly are to step down in favor of the other party's  candidate. Having seen the Fidesz results, do you think that is  going to happen? Will the Fidesz candidates step down in favor  of the SZDSZ?    [Kuncze] The Fidesz leaders have stated several times that  they respect the agreement. The SZDSZ has also said this.  Therefore, I am sure that this agreement will work. I also add  that the same is true of the Agrarian Alliance and the Liberal  Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party. [passage omitted]</p>

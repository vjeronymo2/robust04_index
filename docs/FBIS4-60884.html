			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by Vadim Budnikov, </F> identified by caption]    [Text] Fewer than 50 percent of intercity faxes reach  their addressees in Russia. The reason for this are poor  communications channels and antediluvian equipment at most  telephone exchanges. Ordinary people simply have to somehow  live with this. But this situation is totally unacceptable in  the case of the president's office or the government apparatus.  Official information must be transmitted instantly, otherwise  normal administration of the country becomes impossible. This  would be particularly dangerous during an exacerbation of the  political situation.    [B. Kosenkov, spokesman of the president's office,  identified  by caption] This is why the president's office has opted for  the Faxnet network. This system makes it possible to transmit  information to remote areas promptly, speedily, and with a high  degree of reliability.    [Budnikov] A purely Russian feature of this modern  technology is the utilization of the channels of the former  Iskra party-economic communications system which links some 500  cities in our country.

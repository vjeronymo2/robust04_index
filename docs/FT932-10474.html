			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff profits warning PITTENCRIEFF shares fell by almost a fifth yesterday, after the Edinburgh-based oil explorer and mobile communications company, which is in the midst of a hostile takeover battle for Aberdeen Petroleum, issued a profits warning. The stock fell by 69p to 305p yesterday after the warning that 1992 pre-tax profits will be 'below expectations', and the inclusion of a 17p-a-share cash alternative in a revised and extended offer for Aberdeen which values the USM-quoted company at Pounds 8.76m. The revised offer, which Pittencrieff said was final and will close on May 28, still includes the paper offer of two shares for every 49 of Aberdeen's. Before yesterday's share fall, Pittencrieff's all-paper offer had been valued at about Pounds 7.7m and had been firmly rejected as inadequate by Aberdeen. Separately Pittencrieff announced that it had acquired another 6.62m Aberdeen shares yesterday at 17p each, increasing its total holding to 20.3m shares (39.4 per cent). Pittencrieff's results for the year to December 31 are due out next week and brokers had been expecting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.51m in 1991). However Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said yesterday that results were likely to be affected by a number of technical factors, minor adjustments and other one-off factors, including the slower than expected rationalisation of some of the acquisitions made last year. However, he emphasised that 'this profit hiccup is almost entirely of a one-off nature' and that 'going forward the company is in good shape.' In their statement the directors reaffirmed their intention of recommending a final dividend of not less than 4p a share. Mr Heneaghan said the profits warning was made necessary by the need for a Securities and Exchange Commission filing related to Pittencrieff's plan to float a 40 per cent stake in Pittencrieff Communications, its US mobile communications subsidiary.</p>

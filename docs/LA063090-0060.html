			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA'S VISIT TO L.A.;  </P> <P> MANDELA, SHARANSKY AGREE TO DISAGREE  </P> <P> Pausing from his exhausting schedule Friday night, Nelson Mandela met with  another famed political prisoner, former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, to  exchange views over the South African leader's controversial embrace of  Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.  </P> <P> After a half-hour session at the Biltmore, which Sharansky later described as a  "very warm meeting," the men briefly emerged from Mandela's quarters on the  sixth floor of the hotel, smiled, and posed for news photographers.  </P> <P> Sharansky, 42, who emigrated to Israel after he was released by Soviet  authorities in 1986 after spending 8 1/2 years in prison, said the two men  parted over Arafat but agreed that "the struggle for human rights is universal,  international and applies to all the countries."  </P> <P> Mandela was released from prison in February after being held for 27 years.  </P> <P> Sharansky flew from New York to Los Angeles to see Mandela in a meeting  arranged by Jewish leaders concerned about Mandela's continuing support for  Arafat and other Arab heads of state.  </P> <P> During a meeting between Jewish leaders and the South African leader in Geneva  on June 10, Mandela mentioned that he had read "Fear No Evil," Sharansky's  account of his life in a Soviet prison. Afterward, the Jewish leaders urged  Sharansky to talk with Mandela and seek common ground between the two sides.  </P> <P> Instead, the men agreed to disagree. "He agreed with the principal (of Israeli  concerns about Arafat) but he did not agree that Mr. Arafat wants to destroy  the state of Israel," Sharansky said.  </P></p>

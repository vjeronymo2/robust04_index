			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETS OF THE NATURAL WRITER GLEANED AT THE TRAIL'S END  </P> <P> As the students hiked into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, they  stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a  quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the  Stegosaurus."  </P> <P> From time to time, a student dropped behind, pulled a journal from pocket or  backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student wrote a mini-essay about  life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. Another noted that the  mountain trail was "as wide as a spare rib."  </P> <P> The 16 students were taking an unusual course being offered for the first time  this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About Nature," the  double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and a beginning  composition course. Taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim Krusoe, it  requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and a simile.  Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1.  </P> <P> Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say  they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record  their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the  ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be  a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist  who wasn't a great observer."  </P> <P> During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather  and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They  work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom  lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to  Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an  inversion is they are also studying nature writing and learning how to string  together their own words about the natural world.  </P> <P> "Essentially, they have to learn to write in six weeks," Krusoe said. "It's a  killer."  </P> <P> Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic  poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey.  According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book, "Country Year," is especially useful  to beginning nature writers.  </P> <P> In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence  that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard  barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that looks like a  beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying  attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after  displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even  better than just using your imagination."  </P> <P> Krusoe said students tend to "get too pretty" when they begin to write about  storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the course are  examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The assigned  writers have "natural voices," he said.  </P> <P> As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack  of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural  phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the  world we live in," he said.  </P> <P> Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials that  formed the outcropping and the natural forces that created it. Geology lessons  are much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom. "You can't stand here  and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is  changing the landscape," Selby said.  </P> <P> Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science  requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing  component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to  identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale.  </P> <P> Batiste has also become a seasoned hiker. On the first couple of outings, she  was startled by every dive-bombing dragonfly. "I've really gotten better," she  said, undaunted by the slither of a lizard in the dry grass.  </P> <P> After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read  their journal entries aloud. Like a conscientious parent, he tries to teach his  charges without battering their self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet  said, "I feel my compliments are as creative as anything I've ever done."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dick Ljungberg: "Continued Strong Support for </F> Social Democrats"]    [Text] The main rivals in the election -- the Moderates  and the Social Democratic Party [SDP] -- have made gains in  DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's poll on party standings for June.  Together with the Left Party, Ingvar Carlsson has a lead of all  of 17.5 percent over the bruised nonsocialist government three  months before the election.    Despite the fact that the Moderates have gained 3 percentage  points, the nonsocialist bloc hardly makes any net gains among  the electorate. At the same time the Left Party has  strengthened its position above the 4-percent threshold for  representation in the Riksdag.    The Christian Democratic Party, however, is lying exactly on  the threshold and the Green Ecology Party falls 1 percent under  it. The Center Party -- which today holds its national congress  in Falun -- and the Liberal Party are having a difficult time in  the shadow of the Moderates. New Democracy attracts only 1  percent of voters and can now be considered to be out for the  count.    The poll was carried out between 8 and 15 June, and was  therefore completed the evening before Olof Johansson left the  government. The crisis began on 11 June when Prime Minister  Carl Bildt announced in the Riksdag that everything was ready  for a yes to the bridge and this made the Center Party  leader/environment minister feel that he had been steamrollered.    Telephone interviews were carried out with 1,012 persons who  were asked how they would vote if there were an election today.    Results in percent with changes since the May poll in  parentheses:     -  Moderate Coalition Party 23.0 (plus 3.0)    -  Liberal Party 6.0  (minus 1.5)    -  Center Party 6.0 (unchanged)    -  Christian Democratic  Party 4.0 (minus 1.0)    -  Social Democratic Party 51.5 (plus  1.5)    -  Left Party 5.0 (plus 0.5)    -  New Democracy 1.0 (minus  0.5)    -  Green Ecology Party 3.0 (minus 1.0)    -  Other parties 0.5  (minus 1.0).     The proportion of don't knows is 11.5 percent, an increase  of  1.5 percent since May. The proportion of respondents who  indicated their party sympathy and are "sure" of their choice is  64.5 percent, a small increase since the last poll.    In May the Social Democrats and the Left Party together had  54.5 percent against the government parties' 38.5. In June this  lead has increased to 56.5 (plus 2.0) against 39.0 (plus 0.5).    In the government the Moderates -- with the their highest  Temo showing since the beginning of 1992 -- are now 7 percentage  points bigger than the other three government parties --  something that is unlikely to stimulate their interest in  government. Bengt Westerberg is also reported to have been very  afraid in Thursday's [16 June] lengthy crisis negotiations with  the Center Party of being left alone in the government with two  "right-wing parties."    The Left Party's 5 percent is the party's best Temo score in  the election period. Gudrun Schyman cannot feel safe, but with  the Social Democrats' top score of 51.5 percent there ought to  be some scope for support votes for the Left Party from Comrade  4 Percent. The Green Ecology Party moved up to the magic 4  percent immediately after the publicity surrounding its  congress. However, the Greens have long been steady around 3  percent and cannot be counted out.    New Democracy, however, can be. Since the previous poll they  have held a new chaotic congress in Vasteras that led to a new  step toward annihilation at national level.</p>

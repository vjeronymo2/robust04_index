			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Businesses join opportunities campaign LEADING companies in the west Midlands are joining Birmingham Training and Enterprise Council in a scheme to promote equal employment opportunities. The scheme, believed to be the first of its type, involves a 'health check' questionnaire designed to provide an assessment of a company's equal-opportunities policy and a means of identifying measures that could help the disadvantaged. Birmingham Tec has budgeted an initial Pounds 150,000 to help companies that wish to collaborate on equal-opportunity measures to help employment prospects. In Birmingham about 25 per cent of the population comes from ethnic minorities and a further 12 per cent has some form of disability. Unemployment among these groups tends to be higher than the average rate. At the same time there is recognition of the low proportion of women in management positions. The origins of the 'health check' scheme can be traced to informal talks that started three years ago - before the Tec was established - among 10 companies including Cadbury and Rover Cars. The informal group has expanded to 40 organisations including British Rail, the BBC, Central TV, Leyland DAF, Lucas, Midland Bank, Midland Electricity, Royal Mail, J. Sainsbury, Tesco, TSB Bank, West Midlands Gas and WM Travel. Ashley Ashwood More than 1,000 prison workers converged on Parliament yesterday to protest against plans to privatise jails. Britain's first private prison, the Wolds remand centre in Humberside, is due to open next month.</p>

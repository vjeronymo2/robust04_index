			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CHANGES IN SIGN LAWS  </P> <P> The City Council will consider amending its sign ordinance to improve the  city's appearance when it meets tonight.  </P> <P> The amendments represent the culmination of a seven-year effort by the city to  find a middle ground between allowing ample advertisements for businesses but  avoiding excessive, cluttered signs.  </P> <P> "We pride ourselves on the way we look in Brea. We want to let retail,  commercial and industrial establishments promote their businesses, but in a way  that looks good," said Frank Benest, Brea's city manager.  </P> <P> The city staff recommended several amendments to the citywide sign ordinance  last month which were unanimously approved by the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> The amendments would require those placing signs on private property to submit  proposals to the Planning Commission for evaluation.  </P></p>

All the suspects, except one, were arrested on arrival here,  said the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the  statement.    Eleven out of the arrested suspects came on board Brazilian  Varig Air, seven on Ethiopian Airlines and one on Egypt Air,  said the text. All the suspects who came in on the Brazilian  airline and Egypt Air brought in cocaine while those arrested on  Ethiopian Airlines were found with heroin, said the statement.    According to the NDLEA, the arrests "have confirmed an  earlier observation that (...) the Brazilian carrier, Varig Air  is the worst culprit in terms of bringing drug traffickers and  their wares into this country."    The Ethiopian company was another airline "with a bad  reputation in this country" for the frequency of arrests  regularly made on the airline, said the text. Out of the entire  seizure, cocaine accounted for 6.6 kg and heroin 6.28 kg.    Last month, Africa's biggest drug haul was recorded in  Nigeria when a suspected `drug baron' imported into the country  248.3 kg (546 pounds) of high grade heroin. The suspect, Joe  Brown Akubueze, who bought the drugs in Thailand, is currently  standing trial on charges of drug trafficking before a special  tribunal in Lagos.    The NDLEA was established in 1990 to fight drug trafficking  in all its ramifications.</p>

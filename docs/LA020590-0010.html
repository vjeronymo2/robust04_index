			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN AZERBAIJAN  </P> <P> We were rather surprised by the glaringly biased reporting of the events in  Azerbaijan and Armenia by The Times. Most of what we read painted a picture of  innocent Christian Armenians of Azerbaijan being expelled from that state by  Muslim Azeris mostly because of their religious differences. Truth behind the  Armenian-Azeri struggle, however, cannot be reached by such a simplistic  approach.  </P> <P> First, we should answer the question "how did these events start?" As the  Moscow government declared a few months ago, the Armenian-Azeri conflict  started when Armenian nationalists asked for the annexation of Azerbaijan's  Karabakh region into Armenia. Anybody with a map of the region in question can  see that what Armenians were asking for was a piece of land right in the middle  of Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Armenians' justification for annexation was that they were the majority in  Karabakh. They, however, conveniently were forgetting that Karabakh has never  been ruled by Armenians in its history and Armenians were sent there as  immigrants by the Russians to increase the Christian population of this  Muslim-dominated area. As a result of actions of the Armenian nationalists, the  Armenian majority of Karabakh and Armenia started attacking the Azeri minority  in mid-1988. It should be recognized that the first victim of this conflict was  an Azeri and that close to 160,000 Azeris were forced to flee Karabakh and  Armenia to escape attacks by Armenian nationalists.  </P> <P> What we see today in Azerbaijan is a response to the events that took place in  Armenia and Karabakh. It is sad that both Armenian and Azeri lives were lost in  this conflict.  </P> <P> All of the Soviet Republics had demands from the national government under the  open policies of President Mikhail Gorbachev but no nation except Armenia  demanded additional land from a neighboring republic. This is not a religious  war as Armenians would like the American public to believe. This is a war for  land and Armenians started it.  </P> <P> BULENT BASOL  </P> <P> Vice President  </P> <P> Western Region, Assembly of Turkish American Assns.  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

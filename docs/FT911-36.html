			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Drexel details settlement plan DREXEL Burnham Lambert, the US investment bank which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 15 months ago, yesterday revealed details of a complex settlement plan. Under the agreement, Drexel's estate will be split between creditors and parties making claims against it under securities law. The settlement plan comes after judicial pressure to avoid a lengthy, litigious liquidation. There are still hurdles but lawyers in the case suggest it could be over by early 1992, leaving a small 20-person concern to handle Drexel's illiquid assets. Under the agreement, the estate - reckoned at more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.15bn) - is divided so that: Administrative costs of the bankruptcy will be paid first, followed by Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m of secured claims and a further Dollars 150m payment into the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil disgorgement fund; The next Dollars 1.3bn is split 85:15 between fixed creditors and securities litigants; The next Dollars 700m is split 60:40 between the same parties; Thereafter, the split is 50:50. About Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m of particularly illiquid assets will go into a a new entity to be owned by a 'liquidating trust'. This seems likely to be sold eventually. Under the plan, all securities litigation against Drexel would cease and some 200 Drexel employees - though not Mr Fred Joseph, the former chief executive - would be released from any new litigation claims. Drexel will also 'pool' its own legal actions with those of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates the troubled thrift industry, and certain securities litigants, in cases where there is a common defendant. This joint effort could apply in claims against former Drexel employees, in particular Mr Michael Milken, who headed the lucrative junk bond operation. Drexel will get 14 per cent of money collected from such litigation, up to Dollars 400m. Perhaps the biggest hurdle is the Internal Revenue Service, which has filed a Dollars 5.3bn claim and is not included in the settlement plan. Unless a deal can be struck with the IRS, the merits of this claim will be heard by the courts next month. If they grant an award above a certain sum - undisclosed - the settlement agreement could be aborted.</p>

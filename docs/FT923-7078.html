			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: Laying low the ghost of rent control Sir, Professor Gavin McCrone (Personal View, August 17) correctly identifies the benefits of an enlivened private rented sector, the help it would provide in getting out of recession and the critical importance of persuading institutions to re-enter this market. But he is off the mark in saying that 'rent controls . . . have now been removed'. Rent controls still exist and, if anything, are being applied with increasing intensity. In the east end of London, 'fair rents' on properties controlled under Section 70 of the Rent Act of 1977 are about 20 per cent of open market rents - probably the lowest relative level for many years. Our company has one controlled tenancy dating from 1945 in which, by way of his subsidised rent, the tenant has received more than twice the capital value of the property he occupies. The means the DoE uses to maintain controlled rents at derisory levels amount to an abuse of the legal system. Institutions abandoned the private rented market because many fingers were burned by retroactive legislation creating controlled tenancies out of agreements freely entered into by both parties. The large number of empty flats above shops and offices in every high street reflects the resolve of the same institutions not to expose their fingers again. As long as there are controlled rents for a significant number of tenants, the private rented sector will never be revitalised. If the government seriously wants to enliven the private rented sector it could do so at a stroke by abolishing rent control. But is is unlikely to do so, if only because this would increase the PSBR through housing benefit claims and, perhaps, deprive it of the votes of those tenants who would now have to pay a proper rent. The government apparently hopes the passage of time will solve the problem: rent-controlled tenants, many of them elderly, will eventually die off. But I need hardly point out that landlords are growing old at roughly the same rate. M A Philcox, Park House Properties Delta House, 181-183 Romford Road, Stratford, E15 4JF</p>

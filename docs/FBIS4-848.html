			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] A front-page story in UHURU newspaper says that an  official in the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation has ordered the Tanzanian ambassador  in Rwanda, Saleh Tambwe, to oversee the evacuation of all  Tanzanians from that country.    Meanwhile, talking to the DAILY NEWS, Colonel Abdulrahman  Kinana, minister of state in the office of the president in  charge of defense, said precautionary measures have been taken  to ensure the security of Tanzanians on its border with Rwanda.  Recently, the government warned the factions in Rwanda to  ensure the security of Tanzanians in Rwanda and that the  shedding of blood of any Tanzanian would not be tolerated. In  this regard, Honorable Abdulrahman Kinana said he hoped the  government call would be heeded by those groups, and that  Tanzanians would be guaranteed their security until they left  for home.    Meanwhile, President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has stressed the need  for east and central African countries to involve themselves  fully in promoting peaceful solutions to the problems of Rwanda  and Burundi. We read this story in UHURU. Speaking to Zairian  President Mobutu's special emissary, (Mbanda Akimba), at State  House, Dar es Salaam yesterday, President Mwinyi said  neighboring countries have special obligations to end  hostilities in those two countries.</p>

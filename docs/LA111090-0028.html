			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGUTANS  </P> <P> Charles Wallace's article on the illegal trade of animals in Thailand ("A  Wildlife Smuggler's Paradise," Column One, Oct. 20) accurately described the  problems facing endangered primates throughout Southeast Asia. However, towards  the end of the article he stated that four of the "Bangkok Six" had died  following their return to Indonesia.  </P> <P> Actually, two of the orangutans died as a result of static pneumonia, brought  on by the effects of the unseasonably wet and cool June weather in Borneo on  the weakened conditions of the animals. The death of these two orphaned apes  only underscores the tremendous death toll faced by this endangered species.  </P> <P> Not mentioned in the article is the incredible pet trade in Taiwan that has  probably been responsible for the deaths of nearly one-third of all the  orangutans in Borneo over the last two to five years. Based on reliable  sources, the Orangutan Foundation estimates that nearly 3,500 orangutans were  smuggled into Taiwan. Most of these orangutans died as a result of being  smuggled in during the winter and in terrible conditions. Perhaps 10,000-20,000  more may have died as the result of their capture, handling and transport. The  Orangutan Foundation now faces the difficult chore of repatriating hundreds of  these remaining orangutans from Taiwan to Malaysia and Indonesia. The first  group of 11 orangutans are slated to return to Indonesia late this month.  </P> <P> GARY L.

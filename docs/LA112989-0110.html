			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> GOLDWATER HOME AFTER SURGERY  </P> <P> Former Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) was released today from a hospital where  he underwent hip replacement surgery earlier this month. He said he feels fine.  </P> <P> "If I don't run out of parts, I'll probably be here the rest of my life," said  Goldwater, 80, referring to St. Luke's Medical Center, where he has had several  major reconstructive surgeries.  </P> <P> Goldwater has suffered from degenerative arthritis of his hips and knees since  his early 60s.  </P> <P> The Nov. 14 surgery replaced an artificial right hip he received in 1975.  Goldwater had similar surgery on his left hip in June, and also has had his  left knee replaced.  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ahead slightly as uncertainty prevails US BOND prices crept slightly higher yesterday but European government bond markets mainly drifted. Last week's sell-off appeared to be petering out, with European markets uncoupling themselves from the US, but the tone of the market remained uncertain. Last week, selling of US Treasuries fed through into European bond markets, as the approach of the year-end encouraged a spate of profit-taking, in what for many houses has been a record year for bond trading. US BOND prices edged higher yesterday in lacklustre trading, as the market anxiously awaited this week's reports on October inflation and prepared for the Treasury's November note auctions. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 100 23/32 , to yield 6.189 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  3/32 higher at 99 17/32 , to yield 4.107 per cent. In the wake of last week's big sell-off, the mood was decidedly cautious as yesterday's session opened, with the long bond showing early declines. On Friday, upbeat data on US employment intensified fears in the Treasury market that inflationary pressure was growing, and the 30-year issue tumbled. In the aftermath, many traders yesterday decided to remain on the sidelines in anticipation of today's report on producer prices and retail price data to be released the following day. Both measures are expected to show unsettling advances. As the afternoon progressed, however, the market was able to put its uneasiness temporarily at bay, and 30-year issue inched back into positive territory. On the short and intermediate segments of the maturity range, prices were modestly firmer ahead of the auction of Dollars 12bn in three-year notes today and Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes Wednesday. THE JAPANESE government bond market, which shrugged off the turmoil in other markets last week, continued to outperform the rest of the market, gaining close to half a point yesterday. Three-month certificates of deposit were issued at a record-low 2.33 per cent, which helped fuel the rally in the bond market. Dealers said the futures market was particularly firm. THE GILTS market also performed well yesterday, gaining  1/4 point. In fact, sentiment in the gilts market appears to have recovered better than in other European markets, helped by some encouraging economic data. Yesterday's producer price data showed a 0.2 per cent rise in output prices and a 1.1 per cent fall in input prices in October, which provided further assurance that inflationary pressures were at bay. Hopes of a further rate cut are still intact, but the stronger performance of the short end of the market last week was partially reversed yesterday. AFTER holding its ground well last week, the German government bond market put in a rather lacklustre performance yesterday. The bund market failed to benefit from a downward revision of German M3 data, even though analysts said the positive data makes further rate cuts by the Bundesbank more likely. The December bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange ended down 0.04 point at 99.34. MARKETS in both Spain and Italy remained volatile, but dealers said this was due largely to internal political problems rather than outside influences. Spanish bond prices fell more than  1/4 point, and Italian bonds lost ground. FRENCH bond prices ended the day virtually unchanged in thin volume. Dealers said that volume is likely to be low this week, ahead of Thursday's Armistice Day holiday. The December bond futures contract on the Matif in Paris ended at 123.12, down 0.14 from Friday. Having substantially underperformed the German bund market last week, some dealers now believe that the 10-year yield spread of more than 20 basis points represents a buying opportunity.</p>

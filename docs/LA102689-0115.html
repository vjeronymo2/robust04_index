			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN PLANS TO SHARPLY DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE RUBLE WILL LOSE 90% OF ITS VALUE IN SOME TRANSACTIONS.  OFFICIALS HOPE TO CURB THE BLACK MARKET IN MONEY.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union said Wednesday that it will shortly devalue its currency by  90% for some transactions in a bid to curtail the widespread black market  speculation in hard currencies such as the U.S. dollar.  </P> <P> The new rate of 6.26 rubles to the dollar is a fraction of the present official  rate of 0.63 rubles per dollar, reflecting the ruble's limited buying power  both at home and abroad. But it still does not match the current street rate of  10, 12 or often 15 rubles to the dollar.  </P> <P> Although the move will have a limited economic impact, it is probably the first  of a series of "hard, unpopular measures" that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  warned earlier this week would be taken soon in order to pull the Soviet  economy out of its deepening crisis.  </P> <P> The government newspaper Izvestia bluntly characterized the move as "a jolt,"  and officials at the State Bank of the Soviet Union and the Ministry of Finance  were so surprised by the government decision that they could not explain  precisely how the new system would work.  </P> <P> The measure, however limited, is clearly a first step toward a broader  devaluation of the ruble, fundamental price reforms and the eventual  transformation of the ruble into a currency that could be bought and sold  freely on the world's currency exchanges.  </P> <P> The official Tass news agency said the devaluation would not solve all the  country's economic problems but added that the government viewed the move as  "an important part of the economic reform, another step towards making the  ruble convertible." Tass also said the government hoped that "a more realistic  rate of exchange" would attract more tourists and encourage businessmen to  spend more here.  </P> <P> Described by the State Bank as simply a "special rate," the new exchange rate  will be used starting Nov. 1 for the hard currency sold to Soviet citizens  going abroad, and for hard currency purchased from foreigners, presumably  tourists and businessmen.  </P> <P> The official exchange rate would continue to be used for other transactions,  according to an announcement by the State Bank. Most of Moscow's foreign trade,  however, is conducted in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, German deutsche marks,  British sterling or Japanese yen, and more than 3,000 different exchange rates  are used to make Soviet prices comparable to those on the world market.  </P> <P> The official exchange rate has long been "an absurdity," Izvestia said,  commenting on the change, for it only tempted visiting tourists and businessmen  to use the black market, which operates in virtually every tourist hotel and in  free markets in almost every city.  </P> <P> "A more decisive measure had to be taken against this black market, which has  sucked up a considerable amount of the hard currency brought into this  country," Mikhail L. Berger, Izvestia's respected economic observer, said.  </P> <P> Speculators were taking "colossal advantage" of the disparity between the  ruble's artificially high value and the real buying power of foreign  currencies, Berger said. The speculators usually buy hard currency at perhaps  10 times the official rate; use that money to buy prized consumer goods from  special stores; sell the goods in rubles for upwards of 20 times their cost at  the official rate, and then start the cycle over, taking a profit at each step.  </P> <P> "It's the black market," a Soviet banker said. "Too much hard currency is being  lost there. We are going to try to choke off the flow of dollars and capture it  ourselves."  </P> <P> An economic commentator for Tass noted that "the Soviet currency has been  weakened by difficulties arising during the restructuring of the Soviet  economy, by the growing demand for almost all kinds of goods, the striving to  get rid of rubles combined with the reduction in hard currency receipts from  exports."  </P> <P> "It is no secret that many Soviet citizens, and not only those who travel  abroad on business, are striving to exchange their rubles for dollars, francs  and yen," Andrei Orlov wrote. "They use the services of the black market, and  the exchange is certainly not made at the official rate. The state sustains  considerable material losses at moral inconvenience to its citizens. The . . .  government's decision is aimed at correcting this situation."  </P> <P> In the context of the overall Soviet economy, the immediate goal is to ensure  that the state gathers as much foreign currency as it can from tourists and  other visitors and retains as much as it can to finance imports.  </P> <P> Valery Ovcharenko, a spokesman for the Council of Ministers, which made the  decision, described the change as an effort to attract more tourists by giving  them more value for their money and encouraging Soviet citizens to exchange  hard currency for rubles.  </P> <P> But the main focus, Ovcharenko said, was on the black market. The high prices  paid for scarce consumer goods there have added to the country's inflation. The  recent growth of speculation has also undercut the first steps toward economic  reform and angered many people who see political and moral degeneracy resulting  from the economic liberalization.  </P> <P> Those likely to be hit hardest, at least initially, by the new system will be  Soviet citizens who travel abroad, Berger said. At present, they are permitted  to change 200 rubles into dollars at the official rate, bringing them about  $320; after Nov. 1, the same 200 rubles will bring only $32.  </P> <P> The underlying difficulty remains the Soviet Union's huge shortage of consumer  goods and the $480 billion worth of savings held in state banks ready to buy  anything of value or quality, often regardless of the price.  </P> <P> The new system is also a step toward making the ruble a freely convertible  currency, a goal set for the year 2000.  </P> <P> "Although this exchange rate is being instituted only for non-commercial  operations, it will undoubtedly influence the exchange rate for foreign trade  as well," Berger commented.  </P> <P> The auction will be closely watched for indications of the ruble's real value,  which may be as low as 5 cents, 3 cents or even 2 cents when measured in terms  of the massive demand here for scarce consumer products such as audio and video  equipment or gems and jewelry.  </P> <P> Last December, the Council of Ministers approved a plan for partial  convertibility of the ruble, starting with a devaluation of 50% on most exports  in January, 1990. That was tied to price reform and other domestic economic  decisions, and little has been said about how that decision will be  implemented.  </P> <P> A series of visiting American economists have urged Moscow recently to convert  to a gold standard, using its massive holdings of gold to make the ruble  convertible as a way of stabilizing the economy.  </P></p>

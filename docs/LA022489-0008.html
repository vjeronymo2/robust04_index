			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNINGS FROM SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill, the newest of Sacramento's independent  experts on state finances, has declared that the Gann spending limit is a  fiscal straitjacket for California state government.  </P> <P> She also proposed Wednesday that the Legislature initiate a ballot proposition  to repeal the 1979 voter initiative, Proposition 4, that set specific limits on  how much state and local governments could spend with a provision that  surpluses be returned to the taxpayers.  </P> <P> Hill told legislators that, primarily because of the Gann limit, there is a  $1.6-billion gap between available tax revenues and program costs for the  budget now under consideration by the Legislature for the next fiscal year. She  said the limit prevents enough growth in state spending just to maintain the  current level of services in state government or to keep pace with the state's  economy. The limit tends to distort government decision-making, she added.  </P> <P> Several good examples of such distortion are in Gov. George Deukmejian's  proposed budget. In one, he proposed that $331 million of new tobacco-tax money  approved by voters in passing Proposition 99 last fall be used to replace other  state money that pays for health care for the poor. Proposition 99 specified  that tobacco-tax income go for new or supplemental programs, not to supplant  current spending. Hill joined those protesting the action and demanding that  the governor restore the money for the poor.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Gail Greer Lyle, executive secretary of the Commission on  State Finance, told a legislative committee that revenues will fall $1.4  billion short of needs for the new budget year. A shortfall of roughly $1  billion will occur in each year through 1994-95, the commission report said.  After that, the commission believed that the revenue base would be sufficient  to meet ongoing spending levels. That, of course, would not accommodate any new  programs, such as additional gasoline taxes that desperately are needed to  develop the state's transportation system. In the meantime, the state continues  to resort to bond issues for many new programs in part because the bond money  is exempt from the Gann limit. While no experts believe that the increase in  debt financing has reached a danger point, Hill noted that it needs to be  watched carefully.  </P> <P> Gann itself is distorted by last November's Proposition 98, an initiative  measure that guarantees roughly 40% of state revenues for public education.  Proposition 98 also provides that when state revenues exceed the Gann limit, a  portion of the surplus money go directly into school finance and not into  rebates for taxpayers. Thus, much of the initial impetus for Gann -- the return  of so-called excess revenues to the people -- has been eliminated.  </P> <P> The limit has been exceeded once, in 1986-87, when about $1 billion was  rebated. That turned out to be a major mistake. Revenues soared over the limit  in part because of an unexpected windfall in capital-gains taxes paid by people  who rushed to sell stocks before the new federal tax reform law went into  effect with its increase in the federal tax on capital gains. In the following  year, there was a tremendous drop-off in capital-gains taxes paid and the state  ran $1 billion in the red because of the unexpected decline in revenues.  </P> <P> Repealing the Gann limit will not be easy, but having the support of  independent experts like Hill helps. The legislative leadership, the governor  and the California business community must work together to develop a reform  measure that all can support -- the sort of unified support that will be needed  to persuade the voters that retaining the Gann limit is pure folly.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITY HIRING ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> I'll tell you why affirmative action is not working in universities, or any  place else for that matter. Reaganomics! The legacy of Ronald Reagan is rearing  its ugly head again. With fewer and fewer minorities entering college today,  I'm not surprised "the number of full-time black faculty in American colleges  dropped 4%." You can't hire what is becoming an endangered species, black  college graduates.  </P> <P> In 1981, college students all over America cried out for Reagan to have mercy  and not cut government grants and loans -- grants and loans which were the only  means available by which most minorities could attend college.  </P> <P> I applaud Thompson's concern. But it may be too late.  </P> <P> JUANITA JORDAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

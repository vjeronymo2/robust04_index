			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ajaccio, Corsica, Feb 17 (AFP) -- The banned  Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) announced early  Thursday that it was resuming its military activities after an  eight-month truce.    At a clandestine press conference held at a remote spot in  southern Corsica, an FLNC spokesman flanked by about 100  heavily-armed and hooded militants, announced the end of the  truce declared on June 22 last year.    Most of the FLNC leadership was present, seated at a table  beneath a banner reading "FLNC: The people has risen up. It  must go forward."    The Corsican nationalist movement said its decision to  resume  its military activities "reflects our determination not to be  fobbed off with dud promises or satisfied with a few concessions  involving institutional gadgets or a heap of cash."    The FLNC said a visit by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on  February 1 had "dissipated any ambiguity" about government  policy. It said government policy in Corsica was "stamped with  the seal of colonialism."    In view of the government's "intransigence" the FLNC said  "we  will resume our fight at all levels."</p>

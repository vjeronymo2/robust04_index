			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: ATT in talks with cable TV groups AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications and computer giant, is holding preliminary talks with leading US cable television and local telephone companies aimed at AT&amp;T providing the backbone for a national, inter-active multi-media communications network. The talks are the latest sign of the rapid convergence of the telecommunications, computer and entertainment industries as the US prepares for a time when homes will be able to receive video phone calls, movies on demand, and extensive home shopping. Cable TV companies and local telephone operators are locked in a battle to develop this market. An AT&amp;T spokesman yesterday cautioned that the discussions were at a very preliminary stage and 'it would be wrong to characterise them as negotiations'.</p>

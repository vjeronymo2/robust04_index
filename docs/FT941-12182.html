			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Beaches with EU rating ruled safe Stomach upsets can be expected from swimming in dirty sea water, but beaches which meet European Commission standards should be safe, a government report said yesterday. The four-year study was set up in 1989 by the environment and health departments, the Welsh Office and the National Rivers Authority - the environmental watchdog - after rising public concern about the dirtiness of beaches. Only some 80 per cent of the UK's 458 classified bathing beaches now meet European standards, according to government figures. Water companies are investing billions of pounds to comply with rules to stop pumping sewage into the sea. Yesterday's report was the final stage in the study. It questioned 16,000 holidaymakers on eight beaches and found that Morecambe in Lancashire, Cleethorpes in Humberside, and Ramsgate in Kent were among the beaches where bathers suffered unusual rates of health problems. Scientists found no link between ear, eye, nose and throat infections and the level of bacteria in the water. The infections appeared to be linked to the length of time spent in the water. Scientists suggested that after some time in the water, people's bodies lose some of their natural barriers to bacteria and viruses.

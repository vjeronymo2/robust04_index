			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Apple Computer Expects Improved Results: The Cupertino-based firm said results  for its second fiscal quarter, which will end March 30, will be better than  previously expected due to higher-than-expected revenue and gross margins and  close management of expenses. In the year-ago second quarter, Apple earned 44  cents a share on sales of $1.247 billion. Investors have been closely watching  Apple for signs that it may reverse a recent slump in sales and profit growth.  </P></p>

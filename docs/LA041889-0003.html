			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The ambassador to Lebanon at the time of the Iran-Contra affair said he had no  significant role in the scandal and was involved only in getting a freed  hostage out of the country. Reginald Bartholomew told the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee that he had no advance knowledge that U.S. arms were  swapped for the freedom of the Rev. Benjamin Weir, an American hostage who was  released Sept. 14, 1985. "My role was restricted to logistical arrangements, at  the request of the National Security Council," to get Weir to safety as quickly  as possible, Bartholomew said. Bartholomew has been nominated by President Bush  to be undersecretary of state for security affairs, science and technology.  </P></p>

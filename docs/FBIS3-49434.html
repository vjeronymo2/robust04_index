			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Petrov: "Just a Strategic </F> Determination"]    [Text] More than six months have passed since the  Macedonian Government made its first official announcement on  the possibility of joining NATO, along with the information that  a request for admission to this military alliance was being  sent. At that time, this piece of news was largely commented on  because, as some military experts and defense theoreticians have  emphasized, the security of the republic would be highly  promoted with such an action. Since that time, the public has  not been given any further official information about the fate  of this initiative -- whether the government ever discussed NATO  membership again, whether the request for admission to the NATO  Council was sent to Brussels, what the response was, or, in  general, what the possibilities and chances are for Macedonia to  join the treaty. In the meantime, a number of extremely  important events occurred in Macedonia, which, in a way,  overshadowed the NATO membership initiative. First, it was the  arrival of the U.S. squadron from Berlin, which was placed under  the command of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] in  Macedonia, acting as a historical precedent to the previous  practice of UN peacekeeping forces.    More importantly though is that, since May of last year,  visits by U.S. political and army representatives have become  more frequent -- Congressmen Reid and Gingrich, Senators Lugar  and Coverdell, the congressional delegation headed by  Congressman Skelton, and several high army delegations. The  whole matter was finally made official on 3 December with the  opening of the U.S. Liaison Office in Skopje.  <H5>  Expanded Mandate of the "Yankee" </H5>   The initiative for NATO membership has now been actualized  by  President Kiro Gligorov, who announced it as a strategic goal  for this year in his pre-New Year address in the Macedonian  Parliament. On the other hand, great attention was drawn to a  statement made by UNPROFOR Commander Fin Saermark Thompsen a  couple of months ago. Talking about the mission of the "blue  helmets" in Macedonia and reiterating once again that their  basic task was to observe and inform about everything that was  happening on the Macedonian-Serbian border, accidentally or not,  Thompsen stated that only the newly arrived U.S. soldiers in  Macedonia had the right to resort to arms under his personal  command. This practically means that the mandate of the  peacekeeping forces has been exposed to changes, and even though  the Nordic Battalion, as has been stated so many times before,  has been excluded from any armed intervention, the same is not  applied to the Americans either. Therefore, regardless of their  symbolic number (approximately 300), the U.S. squadron that is  operating under the flag of the United Nations in Macedonia has  the right to not only observe and inform about what is happening  on the border, but it also disposes of a "somewhat" expanded  mandate regarding the mission.    This indicator bluntly coincides with the increased interest  in Macedonia by the United States, which started in May last  year, after Bill Clinton stated that the United States would get  involved in military actions in case Macedonia is attacked. In  other words, the predictions about a discrete change in the  UNPROFOR mandate and the expectations that the size of the U.S.  contingent will soon be increased have been actualized.    The fact that the Bosnian conflict cannot be hidden by a  glass bell and that its expansion cannot be impeded because one  of the most natural characteristics of every war is its  metastasis is the cause for Macedonia, whether it likes it or  not, to be involved in the geographic and strategic maps as a  region of high risk, gravitating objectively toward the shaking  Bosnian region. In other words, Macedonia is a part of the  general situation that is defined as unstable and unpredictable  on the global plan and the expanded definition of the total  situation in the boiling Balkans. Here we can look for the root  of the sudden interest in Macedonia by the Americans, who  clearly exposed their intentions in the whole region after  entering the game as a military factor for solving the Bosnian  conflict. Thus, the United States has, once again, not only  demonstrated its resoluteness in realizing its fundamental  interest in keeping a strategic stability in these regions, but  also, as is usually pointed out by Western Europeans, because of  "the fact that history has thrice taught us that the permanent  presence of the United States in Europe is essentially desirable  and fruitful." On the other hand, it is known that the initial  urges of the Americans for a military intervention in the former  Yugoslavia were met by strong reaction from the European allies,  because the Americans themselves refuse to subordinate any part  of their armed forces under the UN command. Here is where the  present latent disunity between the previous allies lies, which  is slowly and discretely affecting the exposed attempts for  redefining the structures, goals, and authorities of the  previously untouchable NATO.  <H5>  The Smallest Evil Selected </H5>   It is certain that the Macedonian leadership has thought  about all the possible alternatives and consequences in the  greater cooperation with the United States.    The U.S. military presence in our country is the third  solution of the dilemma -- how to locate the security of  Macedonia: whether to connect it with some of the neighbors by  creating a military alliance (a dangerous alternative that would  radically increase the pressures and aspirations toward our  country) or to make up for the enormous lack in armament after  the departure of the former Yugoslav National Army relying on  its own forces (not only objectively, impossible alternative,  but also in direct collision with the arms import embargo).  Therefore, the only possibility left is to cooperate with a  military force, which -- emphasized by our state officials so  many times before -- does not have any historical aspirations  toward this region -- in other words, the United States.    As a matter of fact, in accepting the U.S. offer to send  its troops, Macedonia has chosen the best solution, which  certainly should not be treated as a complete guarantee for  peace and stability in the country. This process will be  thoroughly encompassed if Macedonia officially states its  request and is admitted as a member of NATO. However, for the  time being, the public has not been informed about such an  action, although it is known that the Macedonian foreign  minister has paid several visits to the NATO headquarters in  Brussels. As a consequence, if we follow the recent steps of  "refrain" and the gradual penetration of Macedonia into all  international institutions and bodies, accompanied by its recent  recognition by a great number of EU members, it is logical to  expect that in this phase of the military plan, the main  emphasis will be placed on the U.S. military presence in the  state.    From a purely military aspect, the interest of the United  States and NATO originates from the geographical and  topographical definition of the central part of the Vardar  corridor and certainly from the aspect of maintaining peace in  the region. Here lie the clearly defined interests of a number  of states for the former Yugoslav republics; therefore,  Macedonia, directly or indirectly, has found itself in one of  the zones defined as the sphere of U.S. interest and influence  (together with Albania, Bulgaria, and certainly, Greece). In  any case, it would be too ambitious and unreal to claim that  Macedonia has definitely been placed under the U.S. umbrella.  All the guarantees and elementary presumptions for safeguarding  peace and security lie within Macedonia itself, in keeping its  internal stability, particularly on the plan of interethnic  relations and social peace.</p>

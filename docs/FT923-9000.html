			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Evasive The search is on for the red-faced lawyer at Customs and Excise who has cost the taxpayer up to Pounds 100m through sloppy drafting of legislation. The High Court has ruled that a provision in the 1985 Finance Act did not give Customs quite the leeway it thought it had in evading its stated commitment to repay VAT refunds within 30 days. Thousands of traders will now be able to claim a 5 per cent supplement on the value of their refunds over the past seven years. Customs sheepishly refused to be drawn on whether all these claims would be processed within 30 days.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Construction is set to decline further UK CONSTRUCTION output looks set to decline even further this year, judging by an industry workload survey published yesterday. The results of a questionnaire covering more than 2,000 quantity surveyors showed that orders last year fell by 18 per cent to their lowest level since 1985, when the survey began. The findings, published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, are worrying for the rest of the industry. Much quantity surveying work, such as that of architects, occurs early in the construction process. Surveyors' orders therefore provide a good guide to future workloads of construction companies and building material suppliers. Demand is likely to be worse for private commercial development where large numbers of empty office buildings are expected to remain on the market even when the economy recovers. Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris, one of the largest firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'These gloomy figures show the construction industry still faces an uphill struggle. Any recovery is going to be long and very difficult, particularly for smaller practices.' The survey showed that orders fell by 5 per cent during the final three months of last year compared with the previous quarter. The number of staff employed by quantity surveyors declined by 8.5 per cent in 1992 after falls in the previous two years. The institution said the recession had hit south-east England hardest, with a 26 per cent drop in surveyors' workloads last year. Further reductions in orders occurred in south-west England, the Midlands and Wales. Meanwhile, orders in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which had avoided the worst of the recession, had begun to decline.</p>

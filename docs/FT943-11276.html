			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Spanish trawlers end blockade More than 300 Spanish trawlers yesterday ended a four-day blockade of most north coast domestic ports, as well as of the border town of Hendaye in France. The blockade was to protest against alleged illegal tuna fishing practices by French vessels. The protest, which has severely affected maritime traffic, including tourist-laden ferries, ended after the Madrid government gave assurances it would insist on strict implementation of EU fishing guidelines and closely monitor the quality of fish imported from France. The 'tuna war', over French trawlers' use of drift nets to catch tuna which is then exported to Spain, prompted clashes between the two fleets earlier this month. The Spanish trawler fleet, which uses rods to land tuna, claims the French vessels use nets longer than the 2.5km permitted by the EU.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Amalia San Martino] </F>   [Text] [Words indistinct] Haiti, a small, poor nation where  a group of ambitious coupist soldiers are stubbornly defying the  international community without caring in the least about the  consequences of the absurd challenge that will be suffered by an  innocent and hungry people.    The tragic Haitian crisis has gone through many phases.  While  the needs and suffering of thousands of people are reaching a  critical stage, the different options attempting to force the  military from power have not caused them to relinquish the  positions they took by force.    Those who claim that Haiti, the poorest country in the  Western Hemisphere, has been reduced to the status of an  economic outcast due to the all-out trade blockade imposed last  year by the UN Security Council are not exaggerating. That  measure was added to the blockade of fuel shipments taken in  October 1993 -- the only measure the international community  found to oppose the resistance of the military regime that has  refused to allow the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide.    It should be noted that, in addition to taking power by  force, the Haitian military is as, or perhaps even more,  savagely repressive than the Duvalier dictatorship. They have  proved to be liars and have not kept their word because they  broke an agreement signed in July 1993 in New York in which they  promised to return control of the country to deposed President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While the human rights situation in  Haiti grows worse and repression reaches frightening levels,  Haitians must also endure power and water shortages and watch  the price of medicines -- when they are available -- go sky  high. But the coupists turn their back upon this harsh reality.  They continue to travel in lavish automobiles that are  air-conditioned to counter the tropical heat. Despite all the  measures taken against them, the Haitian military has not shown  signs of fearing any of the consequences, not even when faced  with rumors of an impending invasion by foreign troops -- an  argument that has gathered strength in the last few days as an  extreme option to try to settle the crisis.    It must be said, however, that far from being a solution,  the  use of troops in Haiti would worsen the crisis. An invasion,  regardless of how it is accomplished, represents a form of  trampling on the rights of a people and a very serious attack on  a country's sovereignty. [Words indistinct] as in the case of  Panama. The interference in the internal affairs of a country  would be a tacit admission of failure to reach a peaceful  solution. Perhaps the astute Haitian soldiers are taking this  into account and that is why they continue to defy the  international community, which in any event must continue its  attempts to make this coupist group, which is also accused of  drug trafficking and illegal enrichment, come to its senses.    At the recent opening of the 24th OAS Conference in Belem,  Para State, Brazil, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said quick,  determined action must be taken to remove the coupists from  power in keeping with the Governors Island Agreement signed in  July 1993. While this issue is being debated within the OAS, OAS  Secretary General Joao Baena Soares urged the use of peaceful  means to solve the Haitian crisis and said that, even though  these peace efforts might be very difficult, it will always be  better than fostering a foreign invasion, which would set a  terrible precedent.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: HK Electric tops market expectations Hong Kong Electric, which operates the electric power monopoly on Hong Kong island, has trumped market expectations by turning in a 33 per cent rise in net profits for the first half. Earnings came in at HKDollars 1.73bn (USDollars 224m) against HKDollars 1.3bn in the same period last year. A warm spell in April and May, sparking heavy use of air conditioners, helped increase unit sales by 10.1 per cent during the half year. Maximum demand for the half year reached a record 1,925MW, up 5.9 per cent on last year. Sales to commercial customers, which account for 70 per cent of the total, rose 10.5 per cent. Earnings per share hit 86 cents, up from 64 cents in 1992, and shareholders are to receive an improved dividend of 37 cents, compared with 33 cents in the first half of 1993. Property interests continued to contribute to overall profits, and Mr George Magnus, chairman, expects the rest of 1994 to yield improved growth in electricity sales.</p>

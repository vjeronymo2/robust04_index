			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAK TREE;  </P> <P> COLT'S BUDDY SYSTEM PAYS OFF  </P> <P> Thanks to In Excess, it wasn't a totally bad weekend for Bruce Jackson.  </P> <P> After he watched Native Twine finish last at Keeneland Saturday and Aksar run  eighth in the Budweiser International Sunday, the trainer was saved on the home  front.  </P> <P> With Jack Carava saddling the colt in Jackson's place, In Excess took advantage  of a perfect trip to easily win the $110,300 Volante Handicap Sunday at Santa  Anita.  </P> <P> The 2-1 second choice, In Excess tracked pacesetter Pro For Sure for six  furlongs, then came away under Gary Stevens. The final margin was 2 1/4 lengths  over favored Warcraft with Barton Dene another half-length back in third.  </P> <P> In winning his second consecutive race, the son of Siberian Express covered the  1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:46 3/5.  </P> <P> Overly nervous in his two races at Del Mar, In Excess has calmed down since he  started having company on the track.  </P> <P> "In his first two races in the United States, he went to the gate without a  pony," Stevens said after completing a weekend stakes sweep. He won the Linda  Vista on Saturday aboard A Wild Ride.  </P> <P> "In the Del Mar, he got uncontrollable in the post parade and in the race. He  just burned himself out. He's gone to the post with a pony in his last two  races and he's become much more relaxed. He's got a nice turn of foot when he  relaxes and he relaxed today. He's a nice colt and I like him a lot."  </P> <P> Purchased in England by bloodstock agent Richard Duggan for owner Jack Munari,  In Excess now has five victories in 10 lifetime starts and the $65,300 he won  Sunday pushed his earnings to $179,293.  </P> <P> Warcraft, who had some traffic trouble when a tiring Pro For Sure raced a bit  erratically through the stretch, has now been second in three of his four turf  starts and still is seeking his first stakes success.  </P> <P> "My colt ran hard and he felt just fine on the footing," jockey Chris McCarron  said. "He's such a hard doer in the morning. It feels like he's just breezing  in the morning, but he might not be able to go much faster than that.  </P> <P> "I had a feeling Gary was on the horse to beat. I rode against him in his last  race in Louisiana (the Temperence Hill Handicap) and Gary was riding him in the  stretch like he had to go around another time."  </P> <P> A 9-1 shot, Barton Dene finished third despite a bad break and being wide  early. He was followed by Balla Cove, Pro For Sure, Dachi's Folly, Green's  Leader and Mehmetori, who bowed a tendon in his right front leg and had to be  vanned off the track.  </P> <P> Best Pal isn't owner John Mabee's only talented 2-year-old.  </P> <P> The man behind Golden Eagle Farm has another promising prospect named General  Meeting.  </P> <P> The son of Seattle Slew beat another highly regarded Seattle Slew colt, Cien  Fuegos, in Sunday's fourth race. Trained by David Hofmans and ridden by Chris  McCarron, the Kentucky-bred General Meeting covered the six furlongs in 1:09  1/5 and performed like a seasoned veteran in his debut.  </P> <P> Outrun by Cien Fuegos and two others early, General Meeting slipped through  along the rail when room developed, and unlike many inexperienced horses,  wasn't hesitant about being on the inside.  </P> <P> "He seems like he's got some potential," said McCarron after the three-length  victory. "I worked him the other day and David told me he liked him. David did  a tremendous job getting him to the races. The colt was very professional and  didn't mind being on the inside."  </P></p>

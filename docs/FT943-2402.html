			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / New Swedish model halted by the old: The shift from welfarism to liberalism appears to have been stopped in its tracks The fundamental shift from state welfarism to market liberalism that Mr Carl Bildt, the outgoing prime minister, so fervently believed he had wrought in Sweden over the past three years appeared yesterday to have been stopped in its tracks. Instead, the Social Democrats - 'the barons of the old order', as Mr Bildt likes to call them - were back holding the reins of power as they have done for 51 of the past 62 years. The general election on Sunday produced an unmistakable swing to the left in Sweden which suggested the electorate had rejected the reforms of the welfare state Mr Bildt's right-centre coalition had pushed through in the face of the country's deepest recession since the 1930s. The Social Democrats, led by former prime minister Ingvar Carlsson, returned to government, thanks to an eight-point swing in their favour, with 45.6 per cent of the votes. Behind them the former communists of the Left party won their best result since 1948. Together, the two traditional allies jumped from 153 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag to 184. At the same time, the Environment party, which supports Mr Carlsson as prime minister, returned to parliament with 5 per cent of the vote, which gives them 18 seats. The non-Socialists slumped dramatically. Only Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party, with 22.3 per cent of the votes, won more than it did in 1991. The leftward tide goes further: the Social Democratic party today is in some respects more left-leaning than it was during its last spell in government from 1988 to 1991. A key figure on the right of the party, Mr Kjell-Olof Feldt, who as finance minister presided over important reforms such as big cuts in income taxes and deregulation of financial markets, has left the scene, along with a number of influential advisers. Today, the parliamentary party, half its members women, is more dominated than ever by public sector workers and professionals who are likely to resist cuts in the welfare state needed to tackle the country's big budget deficit. But senior Social Democrats insist the picture of a resurgent left is misleading. Mr Jan Karlsson, a member of the party's economic policy team, said the election result was more of a protest vote against Mr Bildt than a positive vote for the left. 'The picture is very middle of the road,' he said. Party officials point out that the three top figures steering the party  - Mr Carlsson, Mr Goran Persson, the finance spokesman, and Ms Mona Sahlin, the party secretary - are from the right and fully appreciate the need for stringent fiscal policies to tackle the crisis in the public finances. Mr Carlsson, who will be 60 in November, succeeded the late Mr Olof Palme in 1986, and has held the Social Democrats to a pragmatic path, presiding over such changes in policy as the party's swing to supporting Swedish membership of the European Union. Mr Persson is set to be the key figure in economic policy. It was he who outlined the Social Democrats' SKr61bn (Pounds 5.2bn) election pledge to stop the growth in the public debt by 1998 through a mix of tax increases and spending cuts. He says he will take tougher action if required. Mr Carlsson has set his face clearly against depending on the Left party - or the Environment party - for support on economic policies. Instead, he indicated yesterday he would seek co-operation with parties of the former government on the economy. This is based as much on realism as sentiment. With Sweden committed to joining the EU and depending to a large degree on foreign investors to finance its debt, the government has little choice but to meet the loud demands coming from the financial markets for a tough fiscal policy. The lingering question, however, is the extent to which the Social Democrats are prepared to go to restructure the heavy imbalance between the public and private sectors in Sweden, where public spending accounts for 70 per cent of gross domestic product, easily the highest in the leading industrial countries. Reforms undertaken by Mr Bildt, such as privatisation, deregulation of the telecommunications and broadcasting markets and the introduction of competition in schools, childcare and the healthcare systems, are unlikely to be reversed. The Social Democrats accept that the battle against unemployment - at a record 14 per cent - must be fought through private sector job creation. But the party retains a deep philosophical attachment to the 'old order' of universal public welfare that underpins, in Mr Carlsson's words, 'a society where there are no great differences between the working class and the upper class. 'We want social security guaranteed for all.'

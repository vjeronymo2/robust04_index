			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kraft buys Bulgarian chocolate KRAFT Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss foods group which is part of Philip Morris of the US, is buying 80 per cent of Republika, Bulgaria's leading chocolate producer. The remaining 20 per cent will be offered to employees. The total investment for purchasing and modernising Republika will amount to Dollars 16m over the next five years. This is one of the first successful large privatisation deals in Bulgaria involving a western partner. Mr Bernhard Hubert, the vice-president of Kraft Jacobs Suchard responsible for central and eastern Europe, said the acquisition was an important step in the east European strategy of the company. Kraft Jacobs Suchard, which employs 32,000 people in 20 European countries, is expected to have operating revenues of Dollars 9bn in 1993. Since last year, it has positioned itself in eastern Europe through the acquisitions of confectionery, wafer and coffee producers in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Lithuania. In Bulgaria, the company will continue to market Republika's local products and will also introduce some of its brands, such as Milka tablets and Prince Polo wafers. Republika, the country's oldest confectionery manufacturer, was founded in 1905. Last year, it produced over 8,000 tonnes of confectionery. Its output satisfied up to 35 per cent of the Bulgarian market.</p>

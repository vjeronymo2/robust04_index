			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: TAMAYO'S CAKE A CHOCOLATE TREAT DONE LATINO-STYLE  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: With the great Latino influence in our cooking, I'm sure many of your  readers would really love to get their hands on a recipe for the chocolate cake  I had at Tamayo's restaurant in Los Angeles. I do know that it was made with  Ibarra, a Mexican chocolate. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- ROSE  </P> <P> DEAR ROSE: Delighted. And so was Tamayo's executive chef, David Barber, who  graciously provided the recipe. Yes, the recipe does use Ibarra chocolate,  which can be found at any Mexican grocery store or in the Mexican food sections  of supermarkets.  </P> <P> TAMAYO CHOCOLATE CAKE  </P> <P> (Pastel de Chocolate)  </P> <P> 1/3 pound semisweet chocolate, cut up  </P> <P> 1/3 pound Ibarra chocolate (or other Mexican chocolate), cut up  </P> <P> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 3/4 cup granulated sugar  </P> <P> 4 eggs, separated  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vanilla  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons whiskey  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups cake flour  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon boiling water  </P> <P> Powdered sugar  </P> <P> Melt chocolates together in top of double boiler. Cream butter and add 1/2 cup  granulated sugar until pale yellow in color. Add melted chocolates and egg  yolks alternately, mixing well.  </P> <P> Add vanilla, whiskey and whipping cream. Add 1/2 flour. Mix soda in boiling  water in small bowl. Mixture should foam when water is added to soda or cake  will not rise. Add to creamed mixture. Add remaining flour, stirring to blend  well.  </P> <P> Whip egg whites in another dry, clean bowl at medium speed until fluffy.  Increase speed and slowly add remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Quickly fold  half egg whites into cake mixture, then fold into remaining whites.  </P> <P> Butter and flour 3-inch-high 8-inch springform pan lined with parchment. Place  pan on baking sheet for double thickness to prevent cake from scorching  underneath.  </P> <P> Pour into pan and bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees 50 minutes or until  wood pick inserted in center comes out barely clean. Do not overcook.  </P> <P> Invert onto serving plate. Cool. Do not remove ring until completely cooled.  Dust cake with powdered sugar. Store at room temperature.

It was once printed in your newspaper and I  would love to see the recipe again.  </P> <P>  -- JEAN  </P> <P> DEAR JEAN: So would many of our readers, we think, because it's a perfect main  dish for family or friends during this time of year. File powder, from the  leaves of the sassafras tree, is a thickening and flavoring agent that often  replaces or enhances the flavor and texture produced by okra. It is widely  available at most supermarkets these days.  </P> <P> FAIRMONT HOTEL CREOLE GUMBO  </P> <P> 1/2 cup shortening  </P> <P> 5 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 6 cloves garlic, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 cup diced onion  </P> <P> 1/4 cup diced green pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped celery  </P> <P> 2 pounds bay shrimp  </P> <P> 1 pound crab meat, cut into pieces  </P> <P> 1/2 cup tomato paste  </P> <P> 4 quarts fish stock  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  </P> <P> 3 bay leaves  </P> <P> 1/4 bunch parsley, chopped  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen okra, thawed  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons gumbo file  </P> <P> 2 cups water  </P> <P> Melt shortening in large stockpot.

I  have never been able to duplicate it. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- VESTA  </P> <P> DEAR VESTA: It's an exceptionally good pudding for children and the elderly,  but anyone who craves old-time desserts will enjoy it, too.  </P> <P> GRAPE-NUTS PUDDING  </P> <P> 4 eggs  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Milk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Grape-Nuts cereal  </P> <P> 1 (3 3/4-ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix.  </P> <P> Lightly beat eggs and combine with sugar and salt.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent suggested that ``a non-binding agreement is a poor indicator of the actual outcome regarding practice in a medically underserved community.'' In FY 1993 no programs qualified for the general preference based on signed commitments. This option was included to provide every fair opportunity for new programs to qualify for the preference. However, if we find that no programs qualify for the general preference based on signed commitments in FY 1994, we will consider deleting this mechanism to qualify for the preference for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Implementation Specifics for Small Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For FY 1994, it was proposed that the program materials for grant programs whose applicants typically have less than 10 graduates per year would request data for the preceding three years which will be aggregated to determine whether or not the ``high rate'' has been achieved. There were no comments which specifically disagreed with this implementation strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Definition of ``Medically Underserved Community''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 799(6) of the PHS Act defines ``medically underserved community'' as an urban or rural area or population that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) is eligible for designation under section 332 as a health professional shortage area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) is eligible to be served by a migrant health center under section 329, a community health center under section 330, a grantee under section 340 (relating to homeless individuals), or a grantee under section 340A (relating to residents of public housing); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) has a shortage of personal health services, as determined under criteria issued by the Secretary under section 1861(aa)(2) of the Social Security Act (relating to rural health clinics).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For implementation of the general funding preference in FY 1994, it was proposed that service in a ``medically underserved community'' would include service in the following work settings: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Community Health Centers (section 330)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Migrant Health Centers (section 329)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Care for the Homeless Grantees (section 340)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Housing Primary Care Grantees (section 340A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Rural Health Clinics, federally designated (section 1861(aa)(2) of the Social Security Act)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Health Service Corps sites, freestanding (section 333)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian Health Service Sites (Public Law 93&hyph;638 for tribally operated sites and Public Law 94&hyph;437 for IHS operated sites)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federally Qualified Health Centers (section 1905(a) and (l) of the Social Security Act)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Primary Medical Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) (facilities and geographic) (designated under section 332) For primary care physicians and other health personnel except dentists and nurses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dental HPSAs (facilities and geographic) (designated under section 332) For dentists only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nurse Shortage Areas (old section 836, currently section 846) For nurses only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or Local Health Departments (Regardless of sponsor_for example, local health departments who are funded by the State would qualify.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ambulatory practice sites designated by State Governors as serving medically underserved communities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several concerns were included in the comments related to the definition of ``medically underserved community.'' Many of the issues identified related to the need for a more comprehensive list of practice settings. For example, it was suggested that the list should include (1) practices and/or facilities in which 50 percent or more of the patients served are Medicaid recipients and (2) practice settings located adjacent to medically underserved communities but serving the underserved population. These practice settings are outside the scope of the current statutory definition of medically underserved community. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CAN'T PREVENT DOMESTIC KILLING;  </P> <P> IT'S NAIVE AND DEADLY TO EXPECT A RESPONSE TO MOST THREATS  </P> <P> In the continuing media flurry over domestic violence, prompted by Maria  Navarro's grim and tragic murder, attention has focused on police protocol,  training, sensitivity and action. The public cannot understand why a police car  was not dispatched the moment that Navarro relayed her fears to the 911  operator. Police are paid to protect and serve. Why didn't the Sheriff's  deputies respond immediately to the reported threat by her estranged husband?  Why don't police take domestic violence seriously?  </P> <P> Maria Navarro told police that her husband had threatened to kill her, and  tried to convince them that he would carry out that threat. She knew that she  was right. She was right. And the police refused to respond to her call.  </P> <P> The fact of the matter is that most of the threats arising from domestic  disputes are just that: threats. Intended to frighten and intimidate, but  seldom carried out.  </P> <P> If police were to sit outside the homes of people who have been threatened,  there would be no one to respond when you hear a prowler in your home. There  would be no one to respond when you see a robbery in progress and no one to  respond when your life is visibly in immediate danger.  </P> <P> It is not a matter of police apathy. It is not a matter of police insensitivity  toward domestic violence. It is not a matter of sexist police policy. It's a  matter of too much crime and too few police. It's a matter of practicality.  </P> <P> Domestic violence has always existed. This decade can take credit for  recognizing, defining, naming and publicizing it. State and national  governments have given effort and money to research; statistics have been  compiled. We now are aware that every six hours somewhere in this country, a  woman is killed by her husband or boyfriend .  </P> <P> As a police officer, I can testify that police training in domestic violence is  complete. It has to be; answering calls to scenes of domestic violence involves  great risk to our own lives. The Los Angeles Police Department's program is  comprehensive and well-taught. We learn how to recognize cycles of domestic  violence and how to counsel women who are victims of it. We are required to  provide women with information on how to obtain restraining orders and with  referral phone numbers for help ranging from psychological counseling to  temporary shelter.  </P> <P> Further, court interpretations of California law have left very little to a  street cop's discretion. For example, if you punch your neighbor, leaving a  bruise on his arm, the officer called to the scene may try to get you and your  neighbor to resolve the situation without legal intervention. If your neighbor  insists on prosecution, you will be arrested, taken to jail and booked on a  misdemeanor charge of battery.  </P> <P> However, if a man hits his wife and a similar bruise appears on her, the police  officer called to the scene has no option. Regardless of the wife's desires or  the husband's explanations, he will be taken to jail immediately and booked on  a felony charge of spousal abuse.  </P> <P> With the accused in jail, police action becomes secondary. He will be released  by the court system in a matter of days or hours. It is up to the victim to  prosecute, something abused women seldom do. Even when they do prosecute, the  case is often resolved with a plea bargain or a token prison term, both of  little use to women who justly fear for their lives.  </P> <P> Police officers strive to protect everyone in society, but we cannot always  prevent. In Navarro's case, had police been on the scene to stop her husband,  they would have taken him into custody for, at most, carrying a concealed  weapon. That would have kept him in jail overnight, assuming he couldn't make  bail. Anyone who believes that a person determined to kill another can reliably  be prevented from doing so by the police -- or anyone -- is dreaming.  </P> <P> Success in dealing with domestic violence demands action from the abused women  themselves and from the courts. Women who have been beaten or threatened too  frequently decide to give the abuser another chance. All too often the cycle  begins anew. These women must want to extricate themselves from abusive  relationships and they must seek the prosecution of their abusers. Those who  are abused must also take steps to protect themselves.  </P> <P> The legal system must really punish those men whose wives and girlfriends are  brave enough to prosecute. At present, a man convicted of spousal abuse will  spend little time in jail. Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has made a strong statement  by directing his office to prosecute gang members in Los Angeles County to the  fullest extent of the law. If we are truly serious about protecting women from  abusers and potential murderers, we must demand that prosecutors do the same.  </P> <P> It is difficult to say that a woman should have to leave her own home, but in  the case of Navarro and many other abused women, that is the action most likely  to keep them safe after a serious threat. Why did Navarro and her guests stay  in her home, even when she believed her husband's threat, and the police had  explained they could not yet take action?  </P> <P> Maria Navarro was a victim. But police cannot be held accountable for the  actions of a crazed person who has a gun. Looking to police to prevent and  solve domestic violence is both naive and deadly.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The government presented the  State Duma with a draft budget for 1994 providing for a huge  deficit of over 60 trillion roubles.    Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin described it as "hard but  realistic," adding that it "sets extremely strict parameters for  financing the most vital state needs and programmes." In his  speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's  new Parliament, on Thursday he said the government will allocate  not more that 183 trillion roubles for this purpose, compared to  240 trillion roubles requested by some industrialists.    The draft allows for a deficit of 62.4 trillion roubles, or  nine per cent of the gross domestic product, which is within the  limits announced by President Boris Yeltsin in his  state-of-the-nation address. The fulfilment of the budget will  require additional measures to normalise the financial situation  in the country, step up control over tax collection and seek new  sources of budget revenues.    Chernomyrdin stressed that the government will no longer put  up with violations of tax regulations and tax evasion. "We will  consider this as crime against the state," he said.    "To my mind it is totally wrong to speak about the  bankruptcy  of the state," he emphasised. "The russian state is not  bankrupt. It is capable of paying off its debts." However, he  pointed out that it is necessary to "somberly realise that we  should live according to our means and do not take unfulfillable  obligations. Otherwise we risk to plunge ourselves into a new  spiral of inflation and stamping out social conflicts."    He said he mentioned this in connection with the continuing  wave of strikes in several Russian regions. There can no longer  be quick and popular solutions in the economy, the premier said.    The situation in the country "remains extremely complex on  the whole," the premier continued. He blamed this on the  continuing production decline which causes stoppages in the work  of industrial enterprises. As a result of such stoppages, 22  million man-days were lost at 4,000 enterprises in February.    Chernomyrdin believes stoppages are caused by "difficulties  in selling finished products." They account for the loss of 58  per cent of working time. One third of losses is caused by the  shortage of material resources, six per cent "are connected with  the conversion of the defence complex."    He said inflationary processes have slightly slowed down. In  february inflation was about ten per cent. In 1993 the number  of people living beyond the subsistence level shrank twofold.  Presently, there are 25 million such people in Russia. However,  the premier warned against self-appeasement, saying it would be  "premature and inappropriate" to feel elated about the decrease  in inflation. The main problems in the economy "are directly  connected with non-payments which are the most vivid indicator  of the depth and intensity of crisis processes." As of March 1,  1994, "overdue credit debts exceeded 25 trillion roubles.  Overdue debit totalled about 32 trillion rouble," he said.    There are several factors behind the problem of  non-payments,  the prime minister explained. Among them he named "debts of CIS  republics to the fuel and energy complex," "uncontrolled money  movement" and "inability of many heads of industrial enterprises  to increase labour productivity." Chernomyrdin stressed the  need to "get rid of incapable leaders."    To solve the problem of non-payments, the government has  mapped out several measurers, including paying off the debt for  1993 estimated at 4.6 trillion roubles by the end of March. A  new procedure for issuing centralised credits has been  introduced. Under the new regulations, they will be issued to  end users for targeted payments. There are also plans to  introduce soon a mechanism for settling overdue credit debts  through finance bills. Additionally, commercial bills will be  introduced. Work is underway to prepare documents obliging tax  payers to provide information about all of their bank accounts.    "The government is taking measures to begin the process of  halting ineffective industries and will actively use bankruptcy  proceedings," Chernomyrdin said.</p>

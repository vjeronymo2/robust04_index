			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Aden, Yemen, May 11 (AFP)--Southern Yemeni jets  and artillery pounded rival northern forces Wednesday east of  the strategic southern port city of Aden, a correspondent  reported.    The heaviest fire was concentrated on the Zinjibar area,  about 60 kilometres (36 miles) east of Aden, as well as Ja'ar  and Bakis, where the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade is based.    Meanwhile, northern forces were also trying to open up a new  front in the Bab al-Mandeb area, about 400 kilometres (248  miles) west of Aden, said Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar, a  southerner.    An AFP correspondent reported that southern planes made  numerous sorties over Aden. The southern air force is  considered stronger than that of the north. [passage omitted]    Some 12,000 northern troops are stationed in Abyan province,  east of Aden, analysts say.</p>

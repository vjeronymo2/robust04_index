			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Practical Traveller: How to pick and choose a Kiwi trek WALKERS in New Zealand are spoilt for choice. The country is criss-crossed with over 40 well-marked treks and there are more than 1,000 mountain huts, four to five hours' walk apart, for overnight stops. The variety of landscape is remarkable: in one day you can walk through forests with great fern trees, up mountains with peaks still covered in summer snow, alongside lakes, rivers and waterfalls. If you are lucky, you will see birds such as the fearless and inquisitive kea or the flightless weka. Which tramp - as New Zealanders call it - to choose? It is a question of assessing your own walking ability, finding a trek to match, and deciding whether to go independently or with a guide. Independent walkers carry their own food, cooking utensils and sleeping bags and sleep in huts which have bunks, mattresses, water supply, pit toilets and cooking facilities. Treks on major routes must be pre-booked even for independent walkers. Hut fees range from NZDollars 4 to NZDollars 14 a night depending on category, but 350 are free. Guided walks are for those who do not want to be loaded down with food and equipment or do their own cooking. These overnight huts are equipped with hot showers, drying room, duvets, towels and hairdryers. Pack, bedsheet, waterproof parka and trousers are usually supplied free. Most of the well-known treks are on South Island. Some 8,000 people walk the spectacular Milford track every year, undeterred by its average annual five and a half metres of rain. But numbers are regulated, with only 40 independent and 42 guided trekkers allowed to set off each day from Lake Anau (you start and finish by boat) to walk deep into Fiordland National Park to Milford Sound. The price (excluding flights) for a guided trek, including two nights' resort accommodation, is NZDollars 1,299. Sir Edmund Hillary has called the Routeburn and Greenstone Valley treks 'two of the most superb walking areas in the world'. Both are three- or four-day, Queenstown-to-Queenstown treks. The Routeburn (rainforests, waterfalls, lakes, alpine meadows full of flowers) crosses the Southern Alps in Fiordland and Mount Aspiring National Parks, climbing to 1,277m. The price is NZDollars 782. The Greenstone Valley, a gentler walk along an ancient Maori trail, follows the Greenstone river through beech forests. The price is NZDollars 670. Less populated, but no less beautiful, are the Rees-Dart (four-five day round trip), and the Hollyford (four-five days) with trout fishing, seal and penguin colonies en route. In the far north of South Island is the Abel Tasman coastal track. Open all year, suitable for the less experienced, it is a trek beside the sea, with sandy beaches and forested hills. The concession is held by the Wilson family who have a five-generation association with the national park, restrict their relaxed guided tours to 16 people, and have accommodation in a beach-side lodge. The price is NZDollars 645. Independent walkers using huts or camping areas need a pass which costs NZDollars 4 a night from the department of conservation, Nelson. New Zealand's highest guided trek, Ball Pass, in Mt Cook National Park, is a magnificent two-three-day alpine crossing linking the Tasman and Hooker valleys through snow-fields. Price, depending on size of group and number of days, is NZDollars 275 to NZDollars 580. For detailed information about trekking, contact the New Zealand Tourism Board (London tel: 071-973-0360). The New Zealand Travel Information Service (081-748-4455), from whom the above prices are quoted, has a range of treks. Silver Fern Holidays (0602-40111) and HF Holidays offer the Routeburn trek with a tour of South Islands national parks for Easter 1993. The price is Pounds 1,990 (including flight), Pounds 990 (land only). If you are in New Zealand and haven't booked a trek, give Outside Adventures in Queenstown (03-442-7126) a call. They provide guided walks, adapted to ability, plus B&amp;B accommodation. Recommended reading: Tramping In New Zealand by Jim DuFresne, published by Lonely Planet Publications, Pounds 6.95. It gives detailed descriptions and maps of 40 treks, and the best time to go. Some of the high-altitude treks are not open in NZ's winter months.</p>

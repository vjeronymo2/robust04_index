			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: National Savings cuts interest rates NATIONAL Savings said it will cut the interest rates paid on two accounts in the next few weeks writes Philip Coggan. The Investment Account will pay 11 per cent per annum, down from 12.25 per cent, from May 21. Income Bonds will earn just 11.75 per cent per annum, down from 13 per cent, from June 20. The rate paid on deposit bonds (withdrawn from sale in November 1988) has been cut from 13 per cent to 11.75 per cent per annum. The cuts follow the recent fall in base rates. National Savings also announced a change concerning premium bonds. Anybody who wins the minimum prize of Pounds 50 will be able to reinvest the money, with effect from July 1. Normally, the minimum amount you can invest in premium bonds is Pounds 100, but National Savings said that this minimum had created problems for people who wanted to reinvest their prizes. Some companies are hoping next week's expected fall in inflation will increase demand for products which guarantee fixed interest for savers. Fixed-rate tax-exempt special saver accounts (Tessas) are still on offer from Allied Irish Bank and Robert Fleming. Equatorial Bank, a City-based bank which caters primarily for the Asian community, offers a fixed-rate deposit account. The compound rate, guaranteed over one year, is 11.83 per cent. A simple interest rate of 11.5 per cent is available over two years.</p>

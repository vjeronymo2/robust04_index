			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on life groups THE ORDER from the Treasury to securities regulators to draft rules requiring life insurance agents to disclose more about their products took the market by surprise and sent shares in the sector sharply downwards. Dealers said the regulatory changes were 'more wide ranging than anybody had anticipated' and were uncertain about how the life companies will cope with them. Among the big life companies, the biggest fall was recorded in Legal &amp; General where the shares were down 33 at the day's worst before steadying to close a net 31 off at 470p after hefty trading of 7.5m. Also hit was Prudential Corporation, in which hectic trading brought heavy volume of 20m as the shares fell 22 to 310p. Sentiment in Prudential was already poor following the release of disappointing new business figures on Thursday. Goldman Sachs took both stocks off its buy list, downgrading them to a 'hold'. Mr Stephen Dias at the US investment bank said the new regulations will cause uncertainty and put the whole sector under a cloud for some time. But he predicted that stronger companies such as the Prudential would emerge yet stronger in a slimmed-down life market. NatWest Securities urged investors to buy Prudential saying that it offers the greatest upside on the 'orphan asset issue'. The day's other casualties in the sector included Refuge Group which gave up 53 to 950p, United Friendly 'B' down 25 at 638p, and Lloyds Abbey which run back 28 to 412p.</p>

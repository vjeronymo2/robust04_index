Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa (JNP representative), who had been entrusted  with the selection of the new officials, announced the lineup at  a meeting of JNP Diet members of both houses on the morning of  the same day and won their approval. Because dissatisfaction  with the former executive board has been expressed within the  party, claiming that "the party's management and personnel  affairs are influenced by the intention of the secretariat," the  possibility of changing executives has been studied. The five  new executives will soon select members of the standing  executive committee, which is a decision-making body second only  to the party convention.    The new executives are: Kunitaro Takeda, (who will remain  as) acting secretary general; Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general;  Eiji Nagai and Muneaki Samejima, deputy secretary general; and  Hirotaro Yamazaki, chairman of the general committee of Diet  members of both houses.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Companies challenged on disclosure of results Quoted companies are exploiting regulatory loopholes to present their financial results in the best possible light, Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. Most advertisements placed in the financial press to record a company's performance do not comply with London Stock Exchange disclosure requirements, it found. The details are contained in a survey by Mr Roger Hussey and Ms Sarah Woolfe of the University of the West of England, published yesterday by the institute's research board. Fewer than three-quarters of companies revealed their turnover and just over a third showed their tax charge in results advertisements placed in the Financial Times in 1992. Publication of these and another dozen elements are required by stock exchange listing requirements if the results advertisement is the only way the data is passed on to shareholders. There are no requirements as to which numbers are shown if the company separately sends out this full information in a report to all shareholders. With the exception of the large privatised utilities, most companies do send out this separate report, so they are not breaking the law. But they are only presenting highly selective information which often shows their results in a favourable light. 'Results advertisements have to be read with extreme caution,' said Mr Hussey, professor of financial services. 'There are mostly advertising the company. Their information value is limited.' He called existing stock exchange requirements 'silly'. The authors highlight a wide degree of variation in the time lapse between the date of the financial results and the date of their publication. They say companies should provide greater balance-sheet information, and that cashflow data at the half-year stage should be made compulsory. Interim Statements and Preliminary Profit Announcements. Research Board, Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, PO Box 433, Chartered Accountants Hall, Moorgate Place, London, EC2P 2BJ. Pounds 15.</p>

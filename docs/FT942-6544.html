			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: How to do battle with jet lag - Health Not for nothing are overnight flights known as 'red-eyes'. But reducing the negative side-effects of long distance flying is possible. One of the most important things a traveller can do, says Dr Gill Lea, of travel company Trailfinders, is to sleep as much as possible on the journey. Trying to pre-empt jet lag by setting watches to a new time zone in advance, changing diets or undergoing high-tech light treatments to change the body's circadian rhythm are really not very helpful, she says. Dr Lea believes a disrupted personal body clock is an inevitable consequence of moving through time zones. Sleeping at the other end is still the best remedy for jet lag and general travel weariness. As far as time permits, business travellers should adapt their schedules and book a flight which arrives as close as possible to the flier's bedtime. Generally, the body needs 24 hours to adjust to a new time zone, and important business decisions should be postponed as long as possible after arrival. Other effects of long-haul flying can be dealt with on the plane. In the air, the body tends to dehydrate and drinking plenty of liquids is crucial during a flight. While free cocktails in first class are very tempting, these have a dehydrating effect and travellers should alternate alcohol with water or soft drinks. Sitting for five to 15 hours - even in a roomy business class seat - can cause the body to stiffen, and the increased pressure of the flight cabin tends to swell the ankles. Travellers should get up and walk around, and remove shoes with caution. Remember you need to be able to get them back on at the end of the flight. If walking around the cabin every 20 minutes seems excessive, Dr Lea recommends that passengers lift their knees off the seat and wiggle their feet up and down at the ankles. Lifting the thighs off the seat allows blood to flow back up from the ankles and can reduce swelling. As part of their campaigns to woo business customers, several airlines have launched programmes and products to relieve passengers of the physical inconveniences of travel. Japan Air Lines produces a special drink which it calls 'Sky Time' - a combination of kiwi juice and royal jelly - which promises to help passengers 'enjoy their flights in a more relaxed mood and arrive at their destinations full of energy'. JAL also offers a honeycomb mask for passengers to wear on their noses and mouths, in order to retain moisture in the nasal passage. To keep travellers from stiffening up on the flight, JAL shows on the movie screens exercises that can be performed in the seats. British Airways' Well-being in the Air package includes light meals, suggestions for exercises, 'comfort kits', containing moisturisers and eye-compresses, and an audio programme to create a 'sense of inner calm'.</p>

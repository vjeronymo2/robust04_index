			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on poor sales data The dollar slid sharply against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday after poor inflation and retail sales data exacerbated dealers' worries about the scope of the US economic recovery, writes James Blitz. The dollar slipped nearly two pfennigs to DM1.5755 after May's retail sales figures showed a rise of just 0.2 per cent. A 0.7 per cent rise had been expected. The producer price index for May was also disappointing for dollar holders, showing an overall rise of 0.4 per cent when the market was expecting a 0.3 per cent rise. Although the dollar recovered later on, it closed in London at DM1.5790 compared to a previous close of DM1.5930. 'Economic fundamentals are still underpinning the dollar in the longer term,' said Mr Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank in London. 'But if you are buying the dollar, you still have to account for the huge cost of carry because of low US interest rates.' The D-Mark's gains against the dollar were mirrored in Europe after Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance Minister, reiterated Germany's criticisms of the terms for European monetary union (Emu). He told a German newspaper that the plan to increase the European community budget by one third by 1997 was 'unacceptable,' and this boosted the D-Mark against most European currencies. This was compounded by other indications that European Monetary convergence is in difficulty. Germany's federal states threatened to reject the Maastricht treaty; Britain's newspapers carried stories that Mr John Major's commitment to Emu has weakened considerably; and France's senate seriously complicated its government's efforts to hasten ratification of the treaty, by adopting an amendment aimed at restricting EC legislation. That last factor ensured that the French franc was the biggest loser of the day, closing at FFr3.3690 to the D-Mark compared to a previous close of FFr3.3670. Sterling also lost ground again to the D-Mark, closing at DM2.9150 from a previous finish of DM2.9220. It was also bottom of the European Monetary System grid once again. The Italian lira ended weaker again at Lira756.40 to the D-Mark from a previous finish of Lira755.8. The Bank of Spain tried to stem the peseta's losses by intervening to buy its currency in the morning at Pta63.04. It's success was only limited. The peseta ended the day at Pta63.09 to the D-Mark from a previous close of Pta62.91. The yen rose against the dollar after Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury Undersecretary, said that the yen's recent rise had been 'appropriate.' The dollar closed at Y126.80 from a previous close of Y127.50.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / What the letters VAT could spell for industry: Business fears about possible increases in taxation rates as Lamont grapples with EC pressures BRITISH businesses will be watching closely today to see if Mr Norman Lamont becomes embroiled again in the continuing row with the European Commission over value added tax. The chancellor will be in Luxembourg for a meeting of finance ministers, called primarily to discuss the EC budget. Even so, he is likely to find himself under renewed pressure to accept the commission's plans for minimum rates of VAT throughout the community. Of much more direct concern to a wide range of British companies is any potential fallout from the government's refusal to accept the proposal for a 15 per cent minimum rate. Last week the commission hinted that Britain might, as a result, be jeopardising its right to maintain zero rating on a large number of everyday goods and services. In spite of categorical assurances from the Treasury that Britain's present position is guaranteed under the sixth VAT directive, the role of zero rates will have to be reconsidered before the expiry of the directive in four years' time. Britain has zero rating in several fundamental areas, including basic foodstuffs, children's clothes, public transport, books and newspapers, domestic utility supplies, charities and the sale of property. Previous threats to remove zero rating have met fierce opposition and while those industries concerned see little immediate threat to their position, any future change would be certain to provoke a similar response. Train and bus operators, for example, are warning of dire consequences if VAT was to be imposed on public transport. Britain, Denmark and Ireland are alone in the EC in applying zero rating. Most other EC countries favour reduced rates of VAT for transport fares - typically 5 per cent but reaching as high as 19 per cent. Fare increases from the imposition of VAT, coming on top of the customary annual rises, would provoke an outcry, particularly among British Rail's 'captive' travellers such as Network SouthEast commuters. VAT would directly lead to a downturn in revenues for the bus and train operators: one estimate, for example, has suggested that a 17 per cent tax on train fares would reduce BR's gross revenues by Pounds 180m. Beyond the moves to impose a minimum 15 per cent VAT there is a parallel proposal to consider taxing all passenger transport services at a special reduced rate of at least 5 per cent. The UK air travel industry is already resisting the plan vigorously. British Airways said it was strongly opposed to this because the move would translate immediately into fare rises. Imposition of the extra tax would pose a big handicap for water companies, already planning to raise charges in England and Wales by an average of 5 percentage points above the level of inflation each year to finance the industry's Pounds 28bn capital investment programme. Water costs less in Britain than in all other European countries except Spain, Belgium and Norway, but the modernisation programme to meet EC standards is quickly pushing up charges. Mrs Dilys Plant of Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator, said: 'The loss of zero rating would impose a heavier burden on customers who are already finding prices high and getting higher.' The UK construction industry has already fought one battle with European Commissioners over the imposition of VAT. In 1988 the European Court ruled that the tax should be imposed at the standard rate on all construction except house building and a limited amount of work on listed buildings and work to help the disabled. As a result, only about a tenth of all building work is not covered by VAT payments. The Building Employers Confederation said that, given the European Court ruling, it was unlikely the EC would be able to extend VAT charges to house building. The prospect of the imposition of VAT on books, newspapers and periodicals would probably lead to another 'hands off reading' campaign such as that which recently drew together all parts of the industry to fight the threat. There have been claims that 15 per cent VAT on newspapers would cut circulation levels by 10 per cent. Mr David Pollock, director of the Newspaper Publishers Association, said: 'We remain emphatically of the view that there is only one appropriate rate of VAT for newspapers - zero.' Food and clothing manufacturers appear more relaxed about VAT, believing their products are more price-resistant. The Food and Drink Federation pointed out that 50 per cent of all food consumption attracts VAT - largely through restaurants, take-away meals, snack foods and confectionery. The supermarket group Safeway would not speculate on the likely impact of VAT, emphasising that the government was committed to resisting change. Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said introducing VAT on children's clothes would only slightly affect sales because 'people really have to buy them'. Charities believe they would be badly hit. Oxfam, whose shops raise Pounds 17m a year for overseas aid programmes, said charities were already contesting the seventh EC directive on second-hand goods, which would impose VAT on their sales.</p>

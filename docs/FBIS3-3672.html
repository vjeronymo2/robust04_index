			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 23 (AFP)--The deployment of U.S.  Patriot missiles in South Korea "will only accelerate the speed  towards war" in the Korean peninsula, North Korean ambassador  Chu Chang-chun said Wednesday.    He told a press conference here that the "United States  should not try to stifle and frighten the Korean people. The  American side should not forget the historical experience of the  1950s Korean war."    He was reacting to Washington's announcement that it was  sending 200 Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea as a  defensive measure and resuming its Team Spirit military  exercises with South Korea.    Those moves would "only accelerate the speed toward war. If  they don't give up all these attempts, nothing can happen but  war," said Chu.    He said the United States was still carrying on a hostile  policy towards the North. "We cannot expect beautiful songs  from the mouth of U.S. Defence Secretary (William Perry)."    Tension on the Korean peninsula rose dramatically last week  after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) accused  North Korea of refusing full cooperation with inspections of its  nuclear programme, which has a suspected weapons element.    The IAEA has now referred the issue to the United Nations  for  possible Security Council action to obtain full compliance.    Chu said that if international sanctions were imposed on  North Korea by the United Nations, Pyongyang would "make the  necessary response."    China, a permanent member of the security council and  Pyongyang's main ally, is on record as being opposed to any form  of pressure on North Korea.    Prime Minister Li Peng said Beijing's UN ambassador would  try  to convince other council members not to vote for sanctions.  But he did not say whether China would abstain or use its veto  to prevent such a move.    Chu expressed confidence about Pyongyang's relations with  China, saying Beijing had "conducted an anti-Japanese and  anti-U.S. struggle together with us" and quoted Chinese  President Jiang Zemin as saying that "though there can be many  changes in the universe, there can be no change in the friendly  relations between China and Korea."    Beijing is Pyongyang's main supplier of food and fuel and an  international blockade would be ineffective without China's  participation.    During Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to  Beijing at the weekend China made it clear it would not be a  mediator in the dispute and said that pressure on Pyongyang  would only complicate the issue.    South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam, who arrives in China on  Saturday, will also try to persuade the Chinese leaders to  become more involved in the nuclear stand-off.    A well-informed Asian source said that Kim would not  hesitate  to bargain economic aid to China in exchange for Beijing's  playing the role of moderator in the dispute.</p>

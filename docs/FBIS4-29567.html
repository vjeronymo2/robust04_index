			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Symposiums of working  people's organizations were held to mark the lapse of 30 years  since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work at the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    Speeches were made at the symposiums on different subjects  such as "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's idea and theory  of building working people's organizations is immortal grand  programme of building mass organizations of our times", "Dear  Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who has most  successfully solved the question of education of young people".    Speakers said that from the first days of his leadership of  the party work Comrade Kim Chong-il attached great importance to  the work of building working people's organizations and has  energetically led them to discharge their mission and role as  peripheral organizations of the party.    Noting that the party and the revolutionary ranks have been  cemented rockfirm as militant ranks of loyal subjects and filial  people and the country has turned into an indestructible  socialist power not wavering in face of any politico-ideological  offensive and military threats of the imperialists and  reactionaries, they said this is entirely a result of the  tireless, energetic activities and leadership of Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    They said the most important of feats performed by Comrade  Kim Chong-il is that he has reared young people as lifeguards,  death-defying corps loyal to the party, thereby guaranteeing a  bright future of the party and the revolution. The five million  young people now are firmly prepared to be guns and bombs  defending the party and the leader with their lives no matter  what mad wind may blow in their way, they declared.    Symposiums also took place in the provinces.</p>

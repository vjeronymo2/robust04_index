			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Germans escape Korean assault to win Group C Defending champions Germany dodged a major bullet in scalding 120 degree heat in Dallas yesterday, barely escaping with the most tenuous of 3-2 victories over South Korea, Jurek Martin writes. With a 3-0 lead at the break, courtesy of a spectacular strike by Jurgen Klinsmann and some dreadful Korean goalkeeping, Germany seemed in full command. But the Koreans, who had scored two goals in the last six minutes to draw with Spain, raised their game to spectacular levels, running at, through and round a suddenly wilted lettuce of a German defence. After 52 minutes Hwang Sun Hong broke free on the left and flicked the ball over the advancing Bodo Illgner; 10 minutes later it was Hong Myung Bo beating Illgner from 35 yards. Thereafter, as the Germans literally gulped for air, the Koreans assaulted the German goal. Illgner, so suspect earlier, made three spectacular saves in the last 15 minutes. Time expired as a Korean free kick from the edge of the area was deflected over the bar. It had seemed a formality for the first 50 minutes. Klinsmann's first, after 12 minutes, may have been the most spectacular individual goal of the tournament. Standing on the penalty spot he flicked up a low cross with his right foot, swivelled the full circle and, almost parallel to the ground, hooked a left-foot volley home. This seem to traumatise poor Choi in the Korean goal. Seven minutes later he made a complete hash of an opportunistic poke from the right, which rebounded off the post and left Karlheinz Riedle with an open net. Matthaus limped off with an apparent foot injury after the second Korean goal and Klinsmann spent most of the last half hour in his own penalty area. But his two goals means that, with four to date, he is the tournament's leading marksman. The Koreans are on their way home. After what they nearly did to Germany, every other surviving team will breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

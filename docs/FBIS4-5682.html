			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The government gave a  warning Monday [11 April] to medium-sized Japanese oil refiner  Kashima Oil Co. for incurring huge unrealized losses from its  failed forward foreign exchange deals, officials said.    The Agency of Energy and Natural Resources of the Ministry  of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) summoned Kashima  President Hachiro Obata to deliver the warning over the  company's 152.5 billion yen worth of loss, agency officials said.    The agency told Obata to prevent a similar recurrence and  devise company restructuring plans soon, the officials said.    Wild fluctuations in yen-dollar rates since the mid-1980s  have made forward exchange trading often risky and many oil  firms, including Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., have reported huge  losses from such deals.    Showa Shell's loss, disclosed in February 1993, prompted a  MITI hearing on other oil distributors and refiners, but Kashima  failed to report its losses at that time.</p>

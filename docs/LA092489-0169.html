			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL / WEEK 3;  </P> <P> RAIDERS FACE THE MILE HIGH BRONCOS;  </P> <P> DENVER IS COMING OFF A BIG VICTORY OVER TOUGH BILLS  </P> <P> Just when you were sure the American Football Conference West (Worst? Wurst?)  was worse still, when 8-8 seemed certain to win the division title going away,  a powerhouse has emerged and it's the . . .  </P> <P> Denver Broncos?  </P> <P> The team that hadn't won a non-strike game on artificial turf since 1986? That  was humiliated in seven straight national TV games, including Super Bowl XXII's  42-10 rout by the Washington Redskins?  </P> <P> Not the namby-pambies who used to play that cute, bend-but-don't-break defense  and got bent over double last season, finishing No. 25 against the run?  </P> <P> Who had that little toy offensive line, who ran the ball just enough to let  John Elway catch his breath and were No. 19 in rushing yardage?  </P> <P> Who needed 17 points off turnovers to get past the Kansas City Chiefs in their  home opener?  </P> <P> Who didn't have more than six players who would be able to start if they played  for the Buffalo Bills, according to ABC's Dan Dierdorf?  </P> <P> No, it's not exactly that team. It's the new Broncos, the team that arose last  Monday night in Buffalo, on artificial turf, and smote their hosts, 28-14,  out-rushing the Bills (Remember them? Great defense? Rock-ribbed running  game?), 201 yards to 94.  </P> <P> Several explanations are possible:  </P> <P> It was a mirage.  </P> <P> It was a fluke.  </P> <P> The Bills were too busy yawning and watching Bruce Smith's airplane imitations  to crank it up.  </P> <P> The Broncos are vastly improved.  </P> <P> If it's the last, then the rest of the division is in trouble, starting with  the Raiders, who are already in trouble and are here today too.  </P> <P> What happened?  </P> <P> The Broncos fired their old genius, defensive coordinator Joe Collier and  brought in Wade Phillips, Bum's son and Buddy Ryan's top lieutenant in  Philadelphia, where he studied the art of the human-wave assault as applied to  football. They also found a top line coach -- former Raider Earl Leggett, the  father of the Howie Long-Sean Jones-Bill Pickel-Greg Townsend nucleus, who  finally tired of having directions phoned down from you-know-whom.  </P> <P> They drafted a 6-foot-3, 217-pound free safety, Steve Atwater, to go with  all-pro Dennis Smith and set both of them near the line. They stopped stunting  every which way and just told everyone to go play. Surprise, it's working.  </P> <P> They phased in bigger offensive linemen, like 305-pound Gerald Perry, and added  two backs: 232-pound Jeff Alexander and Bobby Humphrey, the almost-Heisman  Trophy candidate from Alabama, whose foot fractures looked enough like Keith  Byars' to persuade 16 teams to pass on him in the supplemental draft. Alexander  is an ace blocker and a respectable runner and receiver.  </P> <P> Humphrey? He just appears to be the best runner the franchise has had since  Otis Armstrong. At Buffalo, he had 76 yards in 10 carries.  </P> <P> Of course, two games do not a powerhouse make, so here come the Raiders and  Week 3.  </P> <P> Well, it's not a good time for the Raiders.  </P> <P> Their promising offense will likely be without center Don Mosebar and right  guard Steve Wisniewski. Fullback Steve Smith has sore ribs and Marcus Allen  already has a sprained ankle serious enough to get him on the injury report,  although, as always, he will play.  </P> <P> Given a running game, the Raiders have been something, even without Tim Brown.  Steve Beuerlein and Jay Schroeder currently have quarterback rankings of 128.2  and 126.9, respectively, which would put them 1-2 in all of football if they'd  thrown enough passes to be listed.  </P> <P> But then there's that defense.  </P> <P> It got smoked for 178 yards rushing per exhibition and then, to prove that was  no fluke, mirage or bad dream, gave up 161.5 in two real games. Last week, the  Raiders fell to a shaky Chief team with few attributes other than big linemen,  a 255-pound running back and a desire to run straight ahead and mash people.  </P> <P> That inspired last week's open call for linebackers, wherein many were tried  and 34-year-old Linden King, last year's starter who was waived in the first  cut, was un-retired and re-signed.  </P> <P> A Raider official privately  </P> <P> acknowledges some miscalculations:  </P> <P>  -- Cutting Matt Millen. They didn't figure on Jerry Robinson's groin pull  lasting six weeks, but it has and Robinson says it's as bad now as it was in  the beginning. Jackie Shipp has been tried, found wanting, and behind him, the  cupboard is bare. Twice-waived Rickey Hunley was auditioned last week but told  to keep traveling.  </P> <P>  -- Finding an outside linebacker. They hoped it would be Otis Wilson, but his  knee wasn't ready. They hoped it would be Emanuel King, but Linden King's  resurrection suggests their hopes are fading there, too.  </P> <P> Whoever the linebackers are, it will make no difference if the line can't push  back. Nose tackle Bob Golic is said to be doing fine and Bill Pickel to be  holding his own, but Greg Townsend's switch to rushing linebacker is going  badly. Scott Davis returns today but Howie Long limps to the bench in his  place. The Raiders need both their ends, but will have to make do and hope for  more upsets.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> The Broncos are six-point favorites. . . . John Elway's great scramble at  Buffalo obscures the fact that he's off to another slow start -- two scoring  passes, four interceptions, the second-worst quarterback rating in the AFC. The  short passing game is off and there are problems with the receivers running the  right routes, and Elway, still throws bullets when softer passes would be  better. Last week, Vance Johnson bemoaned his declining relationship with  Elway.  </P> <P> On the Raiders' last appearance in Denver, they came from 24-0 behind on a  Monday night and won, 27-24, a rally that ties for third biggest in league  history. The Broncos haven't gotten over it. "Everybody who was on the team  remembers that game," Elway said. . . . New cornerback Tyrone Braxton has two  interceptions and a touchdown, but is considered a gambler who can be burned.  Steve Atwater is a better tackler than pass defender, so with two new  cornerbacks and a rookie safety, the Bronco secondary could have problems. . .  . The Broncos placed wide receiver Ricky Nattiel on injured reserve because of  a broken kneecap, sidelining him for at least six weeks.  </P></p>

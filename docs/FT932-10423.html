			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Shedding light on share deals - Individual investors can look forward to better information services UNTIL NOW, individual investors who want to find out what is happening in the stock market during the trading day have had to choose between cheap but limited information services and professional data that comes with a price tag worthy of Threadneedle Street. But recent changes in the management of Topic, the London Stock Exchange's electronic information service, will improve the situation. The exchange is handing over Topic to two commercial companies: Telekurs, controlled by the big Swiss banks, and ICV, an entrepreneurial company based in Woking, Surrey. Telekurs is likely to concentrate on a relatively small number of big customers who want an all-singing, all-dancing service. It is the ICV offering, Topic 3 - due to open in the autumn - that could have appeal for active individual investors. ICV already puts out a service called Market-Eye, which provides real-time prices on all quoted UK equities. This comes as a package made up of television set plus decoder and keypad. The share prices are transmitted by the BBC in a spare part of the normal television signal. The service costs a private investor Pounds 850 a year, plus Pounds 1,150 to buy the decoder (which can also be rented for Pounds 350 a year). Traded options prices from Liffe cost another Pounds 350 and a service called Dataload, which allows subscribers to download share prices directly into their personal computers, another Pounds 350. The service offers 'level one' share prices - that is, the best bid and offer. Unlike Topic, Market-Eye does not include the fuller 'level two' prices which show marketmakers' individual prices and the sizes of bargain for which those prices are firm. On Market-Eye, shares belonging to companies which have made stock exchange announcements during the day are marked. But subscribers wanting to find out what the announcements are must call their broker or the company. This would quickly become tedious given the number of routine announcements made by large companies but David Taylor, ICV's managing director, says the company is considering adding a basic news service to Market-Eye which would give subscribers the gist of each announcement. They could then decide whether to investigate further. BT's Citi-Service, a rival to ICV, already offers a news service. For Pounds 25 a quarter and a connect charge of 39p a minute, it provides real-time bid and offer prices for all shares quoted on the stock exchange automated quotations system (Seaq). If you have a computer and a modem, all you need to connect is Prestel communications software - Pounds 25 to Citi-Service subscribers. An additional Pounds 15 a quarter allows you to construct your own portfolio of up to 100 shares. Because of the design of the Prestel system, however, you cannot easily download to a computer database or spreadsheet. More active (and affluent) investors might want to wait for Topic 3 which will be delivered via satellite and will offer a much fuller service, including 'level two' prices and the stock exchange news service of company announcements. It will also carry the 'closed user groups' now provided on Topic; these are private pages made available to their clients by stockbrokers. Taylor says subscriptions probably will cost around Pounds 5,000 a year, including renting the terminal. But there will be no telecommunications costs, an important consideration for subscribers who live some distance from London. The expense of the present Topic service is increased greatly by the cost of the leased telephone lines needed to receive it, which are priced according to distance.

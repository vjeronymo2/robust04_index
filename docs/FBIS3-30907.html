			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Hatred Against Romania Has Been </F> Unleashed in Chisinau"]    [Text] The end of last week was dominated by the  spectacular statements made by President Mircea Snegur and  Dumitru Motpan, president of the ruling party in the Republic of  Moldova, on the issue of relations with Romania. As far as we  could learn from the reports of press agencies, at the congress  of the Civic Alliance in the Republic of Moldova, an  organization set up in order to give unconditional support for  President Mircea Snegur, the latter declared that the  unification with Romania must be eliminated from the  preoccupations of the political life in the Republic of Moldova  and any stand toward Bucharest must proceed from the  delimitation of the term Moldovan from the term Romanian. In  Mircea Snegur's view, the Romanians in Bessarabia are not  Romanians, but Moldovans, and it is not the Romanian language  that is spoken between the Prut and Dniester Rivers, but the  Moldovan language! Thus, as Dumitru Motpan, the leader of the  Agrarian Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova, said in a  speech made on the same day at an electoral meeting in the  locality of Cantemir, if the issue of unification is ever  raised, this will mean not Romania, but only a part of it,  namely Moldavia, and the Republic of Moldova and Moldavia will  make up, in the view of those in Chisinau, one single nation,  namely the Moldovan nation. The affirmations of Mircea Snegur  and of the leaders of the ruling party in the Republic of  Moldova were not just some statements made during a drinking  bout. They were made in an official framework and, what is more  serious, with the intention of making them, from now on, become  a fundamental idea of the domestic and foreign policy of the  Republic of Moldova.    As such, the affirmations of the two leaders are not at all  surprising. The categorical rejection of the unification has,  for quite a while, been one of the dominant ideas of the policy  promoted by Mircea Snegur. The fact that people in Bucharest  viewed this issue differently is very simple to explain. Mircea  Snegur's true position has been hidden under a veil of ambiguous  smiles, smiles meant to put the Chisinau leadership in the role  of a lamb that is feeding from two sheep. Smiling at both  Russia and Romania, Mircea Snegur was able to obtain significant  economic aid from both countries. The illusion created by  Mircea Snegur's duplicity was supported for a long time by the  special relations of the Republic of Moldova with President Ion  Iliescu. Did anybody realize that the Chisinau leader is a  ferocious anti-unionist, more than certain that the "brotherly"  Snegur-Iliescu meetings would have led to the deterioration of  Ion Iliescu's electoral capital. The affirmations made by  Mircea Snegur and Dumitru Motpan are not surprising, not in the  least, if we look at the current situation in the Republic of  Moldova. Elections are approaching beyond the Prut River. And  considering that the unification with Romania does not seem to  be favored by the great majority of the population, including  Romanians, Mircea Snegur and his people, in order to win the  elections, saw themselves compelled to make the issue of  rejecting unification a whipping boy of the electoral campaign.  If, taken as they are, the declarations of the two leaders are  not surprising, nevertheless, the feelings that can be guessed  behind them are shocking. To the astonishment of the Romanians,  the declarations made at the end of last week betray a genuine  hatred for the Romanians in Romania. Willingly or unwillingly,  the two leaders want to picture us as a mortal danger for the  interests of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. One can  see clearly that Mircea Snegur and Dumitru Motpan intend to lead  an electoral campaign based not only on the rejection of  unification, but also on stirring up hatred against us, that is,  the Romanians on this side of the Prut River. No matter what is  reason for this goal, the attempt to implement it is as  dangerous as possible for Romania. Since the dismantlement of  the former Soviet Union, the economic, social-political, and  cultural relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova  have increased. Within the framework of this process, the  Romanians in Romania have become a real presence beyond the Prut  River both through the numerous trips they made there, and  through the numerous private firms and cultural organizations  that they have established there. The declarations of the two  leaders might be the beginning of violence of great proportions  against all Romanian citizens present, for one reason or  another, in the Republic of Moldova. In the case of  correspondents Anda Florea and Mircea Dascaliuc, this is most  significant. From this point of view, it would not be an  exaggerated act if Romanian citizens would be advised to avoid,  at least for the period of the electoral campaign, trips to  localities beyond the Prut River. This would be beneficial not  only for them, but also for the cause of unification.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis  condemned the murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, chairman of the  Committee of Solidarity with Kurdistan, adding that he probably  fell victim to Turkish Security Service agents. In a statement  to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Kasoulidhis said: We  should not consider Yeoryiadhis' murder to have anything in  particular to do with Cyprus. Such murders, Kasoulidhis added,  have been taking place lately in various European countries and  elsewhere. But, he said, if the aim was to affect the talks on  the Cyprus issue, [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas will not  avoid assuming his responsibilities on the talks on the  confidence-building measures. [passage omitted]    DISI [Democratic Rally] General Secretary Dhimitrios  Sillouris said Turks perpetrated Yeoryiadhis' murder. He said  he is certain this is not the last such act we will see, adding  that it must be organized, something directly connected with the  advance of the confidence-building measures. Sillouris said  Turkish agents circulate unhampered in the free areas of the  Republic of Cyprus and added that we should all assume our  responsibilities and protect ourselves through the state  structure and through cooperation between people and the  responsible authorities. [passage omitted]    The National Liberation Front of Kurdistan has strongly  condemned Yeoryiadhis' murder, which, it says in a statement,  was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and  executed by the Turkish Secret Service. The statement also  notes that the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan will reply  accordingly to the Attila state, which destroys the people of  Kurdistan with Ottoman and Mongolian methods.</p>

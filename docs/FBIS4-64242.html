			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed WVDV: "NATO Has Plan for Ambitious Ground </F> Exploration System"]    [Text] The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will work on  an ambitious ground reconnaissance system, which carries a price  tag of billion of dollars. NATO's National Armament Directory  gave the green light for a study into the feasibility of the new  program.    The report must be submitted on 8 October to the Conference  of National Armament Directors [CNAD]. Shortly after this, the  Defense Planning Committee [DPC] will convene on a ministerial  level, as Friedhart Sellschopp, head of the NATO Division of  Ground Armaments, confirmed.    In March last year, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner  launched the concept of a new ground reconnaissance system which  had to complement the AWACS air control system. The National  Armament Directors of the member states were handed the task to  explore the possibilities of a coordinated reconnaissance system.    In June, 10 of the 16 member states began the preliminary  technical studies into the ground reconnaissance system AGS  [Alliance Ground Surveillance] under the leadership of Canadian  Richard Oldford and German expert Friedhart Sellschopp. At the  moment, two teams led by Belgian military commander Werner  Gevers are preparing the final report.    Although no precise figures about the cost price are known  yet, Friedhhart Sellschopp is talking about billions of dollars:  "One airplane alone costs 300 million dollars." The financial  means should come from the participating states that receive  substantial orders for their own industries in exchange.  Smaller states like Belgium should not have to pay more than 10  percent of the cost price according to Sellschoop.    Sellschoop says that the reconnaissance program must be  given  the highest priority. "The numerous crisis in different regions  have emphasized the importance of crisis management. With the  new ground reconnaissance system, any movement of enemy troops  can be watched 24 hours a day. From Brussels to Antwerp, the  most insignificant motion of a car can be detected. The  information will be available to all member states so that each  country can make the appropriate decisions immediately on a  sovereign basis," the NATO expert says . The military circles  are speaking of a "revolution."</p>

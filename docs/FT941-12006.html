			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / RFE targets former Yugoslavia US-funded Radio Free Europe yesterday started a news service to former Yugoslavia intended to counter what it called ethnic hatred and biased reporting in the state-run local media, Reuter reports from Bonn. The hour-long daily broadcasts would try to provide balanced news about former Yugoslavia and encourage a public discussion of peace and reconciliation, an RFE spokeswoman said. Munich-based RFE and its sister station Radio Liberty have broadcast to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union since the early 1950s but never had a service for the Yugoslav federation.</p>

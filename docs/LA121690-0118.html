			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> STOP THE HOARDING  </P> <P> The prospects (for helping inner-city youth in America) are not good. (For  instance,) the problem of food in Russia is paradoxical in that they've had the  best wheat harvest in 20 years, but farmers are hoarding.  </P> <P> They don't trust the marketplace and they figure if they let the people really  starve and so on, then they can get higher prices, make some more money.  </P> <P> In America, it's like that. We're trying to entrench, or hoard, our largess.  For someone to step out and say, "Damn! Let's give your young a piece of the  action, let's give our young a chance to experience. They're needed and  valuable" (just isn't happening like it should).  </P> <P> In our program, we show that love is helping someone like themselves. And that  concept is so simple, it's difficult for people to grasp. It's from that  universal truth that people blossom, people self-actualize. And it's from the  lack of that today that we have the antithesis of self-actualization and  blossoming. We have destructiveness.  </P></p>

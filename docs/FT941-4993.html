			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Kazakhstan poll condemned An official European observer team yesterday condemned Monday's parliamentary elections in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan, saying the system of preventing abuses was flawed and government-sponsored candidates enjoyed a built-in advantage, Steve LeVine reports from Alma Ata. The team, representing the Council for Security and Co-operation in Europe, stopped short of calling the elections rigged. But it said election procedures allowed such abuses as ballot-box stuffing, and that the pre-election campaign handicapped independent candidates. The election was to fill a new 177-member parliament that will replace a larger legislative body dissolved in December.</p>

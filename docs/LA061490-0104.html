The contract -- for digital telephone exchanges -- with the  People's Liberation Army was signed last month and is awaiting U.S. government  approval, said AT&amp;T spokesman Tom Harris. Harris also said AT&amp;T was  granted a license by the Chinese government about two months ago to start a  joint-venture to make telecommunication transmission equipment.  </P></p>

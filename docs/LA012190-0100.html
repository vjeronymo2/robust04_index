			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY REALTOR HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW  </P> <P> As an ex-realtor and now owner of a mortgage company, I take exception to  Robert J. Bruss' reply Dec. 17 to the person who asked: "How to Avoid  Overpaying for a Home."  </P> <P> He's right on everything except the reply about financial information the  realtor has a right to know. Here's why.  </P> <P>  -- By getting vital information regarding the buyer's finances, the agent not  only saves his valuable time but the valuable time of the buyer as well.  Knowing what the buyer can and cannot afford will surely dictate what  properties to preview and then show the buyer. The majority of buyers have an  over-inflated idea of what they can afford.  </P> <P>  -- Many times, buyers intentionally or not misrepresent their financial and  credit background to someone pre-qualifying them. A seller has the right to  know that someone has done his homework in regard to a potential buyer's  qualification before they ask that seller to maintain, vacate and prepare their  home for a potential viewing.  </P> <P>  -- It's the responsibility of the realtor to represent his client (seller) in  all areas in the sale of a home. This includes such questions as: What type of  work is your buyer in? What is his income? How long has he been employed? Does  he have a house to sell? Where is the source of the down payment? How long has  the money been in the bank? Can it be verified? Does the spouse work? Do they  need both incomes to qualify? Has their credit been verified? Have they been  pre-qualified by a lender? Who is the lender representative, and what is the  name of his/her company?  </P> <P> If these questions cannot be answered, then the selling agent hasn't done his  job. There's no way a listing agent should recommend a seller tie his home up  with an offer waiting for all of these questions to be answered -- let alone  get into an escrow without knowing these answers. This is called "full  representation" -- doing a thorough job for the seller.  </P> <P>  -- The buyer saves time. Your realtor can now do a little pre-qualifying (any  good realtor should be able to do this with a little training and simple  formulas), and then preview the homes that are truly in the buyer's price  range. On occasion, there are multiple offers on homes. The agents who have  done their homework best and have brought in a competitive offer will usually  win out.  </P> <P> On a single offer presentation, realtors who have done their homework have a  better opportunity in negotiating price and other terms because the seller and  listing agent feel more comfortable that they have a good buyer.  </P> <P> RON MEYERS  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

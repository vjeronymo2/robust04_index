			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Traditional family households in decline THE traditional family of mother, father and young children all living together has become a social minor-ity. The proportion of households containing two parents with dependent children has moved from being the second main household group to being the third-largest. For the first time it has been overtaken by those consisting of people living alone. The General Household Survey, published yesterday by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, shows that by 1990 26 per cent of households contained only one person, compared with 25 per cent made up of married or cohabiting couples with dependent children. The biggest of the three main household types - married or cohabiting couples without dependent children - accounted for 36 per cent of households. Households containing two parents and dependent children have been in decline throughout recent years, falling to 25 per cent in 1990 from 32 per cent in 1982. During the 1970s and 1980s there was a sharp increase in the number of single-parent families - the great majority headed by mothers - and the survey illustrates many of the social and economic consequences of single-parenthood. Single parents are more likely to live in rented accommodation lacking amenities like central heating. They also face what the survey describes as 'striking' differences in income compared with other families. In 1990 a majority of single-parent families - 53 per cent - had a weekly income of Pounds 100 or less, compared with only 4 per cent of two-parent households. Only 8 per cent of single-parents had weekly incomes of more than Pounds 350, something enjoyed by 55 per cent of other families. Another striking social change during the past 20 years has been a growth in the number of married women working. The survey shows that by 1990 the proportions of married and single women in employment were almost identical  -71 per cent of married women and 72 per cent of single. In 1971 only half Britain's married women worked. The survey detects 'substantial differences between the occupational status of similarly educated men and women'. Among working people with degrees, men were twice as likely to be in professional occupations - 39 per cent compared with 18 per cent. A similar pattern exists among employees without educational qualifications, with 48 per cent of women in semi-skilled or unskilled manual jobs against 29 per cent of men. The survey illustrates the extent to which socio-economic background influences educational attainment. A total of 35 per cent of people whose fathers had professional backgrounds have degrees or equivalent qualifications. The figure is just 2 per cent for those whose fathers were in unskilled manual jobs. 1990 General Household Survey. HMSO. Pounds 18.50.</p>

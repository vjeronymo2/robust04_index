I also congratulate the people who have such a  leader." This was stated today in Vladikavkaz by Sergey Filatov,  head of the Russian president's administration, at a meeting of  the Supreme Soviet of the republic devoted to assuming office by  the first president of the republic.    North Ossetia, Sergey Filatov stressed, has never suffered  from anarchy. But it is necessary to change structures of  power, this is the call of the time. The republic has been  confidently carrying out democratic reforms against the  background of social and political life in Russia.    Some republics, the head of Russian president's  administration said, "believe that president is needed to  protect the republic from the central power. This is an  erroneous position. [The] president is necessary to become a  connecting link between the center and the republic so that all  our Russia lived as a single family".    I am sure, Sergey Filatov said, that the multinational  people  of North Ossetia "associate their revival with strong democratic  power in the republic. This will help successfully resolve all  complex problems in economics, political life and in the social  sphere. What is more, this is possible with close interaction  between all branches of power and the observance of the  Constitution and Russian laws".    According to Sergey Filatov, Boris Yeltsin asked to convey  that he would render all-round support both to the president and  the people of North Ossetia.</p>

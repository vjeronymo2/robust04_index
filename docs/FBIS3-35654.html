			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan -- Russia has proposed a new  cease-fire in all areas of Nagorno-Karabakh, lasting for at  least 2-3 weeks, from 1 February. A Russian Foreign Ministry  source said today that the new Russian proposal was recently  passed to President Geydar Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic,  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of the Republic of Armenia, and to  Robert Kocharyan, the Nagorno- Karabakh leader, by Vladimir  Kazimirov, special representative of the president of the  Russian Federation.    Depending on the replies received additional steps will be  taken to bring about an end to the hostilities in Karabakh. A  meeting of the warring parties in Moscow this week cannot be  ruled out.    Bloody fighting, with fluctuating success, has been taking  place around Nagorno-Karabakh since the second half of December  last year. Several thousand people have already died as a  result. Thousands more have been wounded, mostly among the  attackers. The new escalation of hostilities is all the more  pointless, the Russian Foreign Ministry source notes, in that  the leaders of all the warring parties acknowledge that the  conflict cannot be solved by force, and are calling for a  political settlement. This relapse into bloodshed, the source  considers, is seriously impeding the peacemaking efforts of  Russia and international organizations.    Russia is striving, as an intermediary, to bring the warring  parties' positions closer together, to persuade them to sign an  agreement on ending the armed confrontation as soon as possible,  and not to allow the destabilization of the region as a whole.  In the second half of December 1993, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev held meetings in Moscow with Gasan Gasanov and  Vahan Papzyan, the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia,  and with Arkadiy Gukasyan, a representative of the  Nagorno-Karabakh leadership.</p>

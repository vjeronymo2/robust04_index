			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / TUC urges Pounds 3.8bn more for jobs in Budget THE TRADES Union Congress has called on Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, to spend Pounds 3.8bn more on reducing unemployment in his Budget on March 10. The TUC's proposals, published today, press for the creation of 500,000 jobs and extra places on training schemes. They also call for tax changes to help industry, suggesting that capital allowances be increased from 25 per cent to between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. That would be a 'counter-cyclical measure' to be paid for partly by the abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme (BES). In its submission, the TUC outlines a spending programme consisting of: Pounds 2bn for public projects such as housing, schools, hospitals and transport. Pounds 1bn for training, education and a temporary work programme aimed at the long-term jobless. Pounds 800m for a return to earnings-related unemployment benefits and a range of incentives for the jobless to take up work, including loans to help pay for transport and clothing. Mr Norman Willis, the TUC general secretary, said the country needed a budget for industry on March 10, not 'election bribery'. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, chairman of the TUC's economic committee, urged the chancellor to listen to what unions and employers were telling him. He said: 'The country is crying out for more jobs, more investment and better public services, not quick-fix tax cuts.' TUC Budget Submission 1992.

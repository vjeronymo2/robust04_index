			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hudson's Bay takes over Canadian retailing rival HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's biggest department store group, is taking over troubled Woodward's, the oldest name in western Canada retailing. The deal is estimated to be worth nearly CDollars 100m (USDollars 80.3m). The Bay intends to turn some of Woodward's best store sites into Bay and Zellers units. Bay's national market share will rise from 22 per cent to almost 25 per cent. 'We will buy Woodward's shares and gain all its assets, including accumulated tax losses,' said Mr Gary Lukassen, the Bay's executive vice-president for finance. The Toronto-based retailer, now 25 per cent owned by the Kennes Thomson family, will dramatically raise its market share in western Canada and gain valuable properties. Woodward's had filed for court protection after heavy losses and mounting debts. It had closed its Vancouver flagship store and laid off 1,500 employees. In the nine months ended December 31 last, the company lost CDollars 80.6m on revenues of CDollars 245m.</p>

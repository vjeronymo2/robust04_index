			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 04, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet accepted  Tuesday [3 May] a law on ports providing for the use, management  and security of ports, Communication Minister Andris Gutmanis  said at a press conference.    The law is urgent in the present situation of growing  competition between Baltic sea ports because it will help to  improve the main legislative drawbacks concerning national and  municipal port ownership, Gutmanis said.    The planned revenue from port operation in 1994 is 15.5  million lats from which 1.1 million lats will be transferred to  local budgets to develop port territory infrastructures.    Under the law, port duties are covered by owners of cargo.</p>

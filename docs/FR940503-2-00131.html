The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. IDS Life of New York is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of New York and is a wholly owned subsidiary of IDS Life Insurance Company (``IDS Life'') of Minneapolis, Minnesota. IDS Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation, which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Express Company. IDS Financial Services Inc. is the principal underwriter of the Variable Accounts and also is a subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Variable Accounts 4, 5, and 6 were established on November 12, 1981. Variable Account 9 was established on February 12, 1986. Variable Accounts 10 and 11 were established on October 8, 1991. All Variable Accounts were established as separate accounts under New York law to fund variable annuity contracts issued by IDS Life of New York. The Variable Accounts are registered together as a single unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. IDS Life of New York proposes to issue and distribute a group deferred annuity contract (``Contract'') that is designed primarily to fund retirement plans. The owners of the group Contracts are the employers or other organizations that sponsor the plans. Participation in the Contract will be accounted for separately by the issuance of certificates showing the participants' interests under the Contract. Purchase payments may be accumulated before retirement on a variable and/or fixed basis, and annuity payments will be received after retirement on a variable and/or fixed basis. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 has been filed with the Commission in connection with the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Contracts provide for allocation of purchase payments to the Variable Accounts or to a fixed account of IDS Life of New York. The Variable Accounts, in turn, will invest solely in the shares of the IDS Life Retirement Annuity Mutual Funds (``Funds''). The Funds are registered with the Commission as diversified open-end management investment companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Contracts and related certificates provide for certain charges. IDS Life of New York will make a charge against the certificate value for any premium taxes to the extent the taxes are payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. IDS Life of New York will deduct an annual administrative charge of $30 from the value of each certificate. This annual administrative charge can not be increased and does not apply after retirement payments begin. The administrative charge represents reimbursement for only the actual administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. No sales charge is collected or deducted at the time purchase payments are applied under the Contracts and related certificates. A contingent deferred sales charge (``surrender charge'') will be assessed on certain full or partial surrenders. A surrender charge applies if all or part of the certificate value is withdrawn within the first eleven certificate years. The surrender charge is 8 percent of the amount surrendered in the first through fourth certificate years, and then declines by 1 percent from 7 percent in the fifth certificate year to 1 percent in the eleventh certificate year. In no event will the aggregate surrender charges exceed 8.5 percent of purchase payments made to a certificate. The surrender charge can not be increased during the life of the Contracts and related certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

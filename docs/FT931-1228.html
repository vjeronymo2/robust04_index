			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mexico provides an attractive brew - The rationale of Modelo's joint venture with Anheuser-Busch CORONA, the light golden Mexican beer, became an international success story in the 1980s. Sold in stylish, clear bottles, it leaped from being the tipple of poor Mexican workers to become a fashionable drink in the US. Now the beer will be part owned by the US brewing group Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest. Grupo Modelo, Corona's producer, has been a tightly controlled privately-owned family company since 1925. The handful of owners, led by Mr Don Juan Sanchez Navarro, are icons of the Mexican business community, and between them have helped run the company for more than 40 years. They have sold an effective 18 per cent of their company to Anheuser-Busch for Dollars 477m in cash. Soon the owners will take Modelo public, offering another 13 per cent of capital for an expected Dollars 270m in national and international markets. From 1995 to 1997, Anheuser-Busch has an option to raise its stake to 35 per cent. By Mexican standards, Modelo is a peculiar company. It does not believe in debt; hardly pays dividends, preferring to re-invest its money; and throughout the wild expansionary days of the late 1970s and early 1980s stuck resolutely to beer. However, Modelo had , says Mr Sanchez Navarro, to face the consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'How can we be more competitive?' he asks 'By fighting the American beer groups? Probably they would break us apart. Not exactly in quality, but in prices and sales strategy. 'If they are our partners they cannot. Now we can dedicate our money to improving our distribution systems, and the installations in our factories.' Modelo's joint venture with Anheuser is no doubt prompted by similar ventures expected to be made by its arch-rival, Fomenta Economico Mexicana (Femsa). Philip Morris, the US foods group and owner of Miller beer, recently bought 7.9 per cent of Femsa from Citibank for Dollars 156m. Analysts expect Miller and Femsa's beer division to announce a tie-up later this year, giving the two largest beer groups in the US a foothold in Mexico. Femsa's two breweries have combined sales of Dollars 1.3bn, giving it 49 per cent of Mexico's domestic beer market, against Modelo's 51 per cent. The two companies have the best distribution networks in Mexico, have tied up most retail outlets in exclusivity contracts, and have - through labels such as Sol, Tecate, Dos Equis of Femsa, and Corona, Negro Modelo and Victoria of Modelo - a firm hold on Mexican brand consciousness. Their tight control over the beer market explains why Anheuser entered the Mexican market through Modelo, rather than going it alone. Imports account for just 0.4 per cent of the Mexican market. This may change under Nafta, with tariffs planned to come down from 20 per cent to zero over eight years. Mexico should prove an attractive market for the US beer companies for other reasons. Beer consumption is just 47 litres per person annually, about half that in the US. As incomes rise, consumption should increase over the next decade - by 5 per cent annually in volume terms, according to Lavinia Agnew of Baring Research in Mexico City, against 1 per cent annually in the US. Profit margins, held down by government price controls, excise taxes, and low incomes are expected to increase from their depressed levels of about 10 per cent. Both Femsa and Modelo are increasingly dividing their beers into premium and basic brands, enabling them to increase margins on some beers. Anheuser-Busch and Modelo will inter-change personnel in marketing, distribution and finance, giving the Mexican company a significant edge in meeting new demand at home. Modelo is increasing output capacity by about half by building a Dollars 500m state-of-the art brewery in Zacatecas. Its capacity is1.2m litres. Modelo will also use the joint venture to continue its expansion overseas, although in the US it will keep its existing distribution companies. After flattening out in the US in the late 1980s, sales have picked up, with Corona re-claiming the number two spot for imported beers last year. Sales were around 15m cases - up 13 per cent on 1991. Corona is now sold in 56 countries, with total exports of around Dollars 150m. Much to its chagrin, the only country where it lies behind Femsa is the UK, where Femsa's Sol beer has had the same impact Corona had in the US in the mid-1980s. Sol's export version is a pale, fizzy beer, and as such is unknown in Mexico. But because of its success Femsa is planning to sell it in Mexico, complete with English labels.</p>

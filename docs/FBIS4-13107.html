			<p>BFN     [Text] Our security correspondent told us a short while ago  that in the context of investigations held by Justice Joseph  Furayhah, investigating magistrate in the case involving the  bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat church bombing, and as a result of  the confessions made by a number of the Lebanese Forces' shock  troops, an Army unit last night began a search for 17 bags said  to contain bombs, powerful explosives, and detonators. The bags  were believed to be in the possession of certain individuals  living in 15 different villages. The unit succeeded in finding  12 bags and are looking for the rest. Several individuals were  remanded in custody in connection with the recent findings.</p>

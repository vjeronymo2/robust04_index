			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Russian threat hits nickel - Market report NICKEL continued its plunge on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as the threat of large second-half Russian shipments undermined market sentiment. Support developed around the Dollars 5,800 a tonne level, after an early fall to Dollars 5,760, and at the close nickel was Dollars 5,816.50, down Dollars 38.5 from Tuesday. LEAD was another metal on which fears of further stock increases - following recent deliveries of Russian, Polish and Macedonian metal into LME warehouses - took their toll. Trade selling swamped initial commission house buying and touched off sell-stops down to Dollars 565 before the price recovered to close at Dollars 574.25 a tonne, down Dollars 9.25. ALUMINIUM benefited from a further fall in IPAI stocks which complemented recent steady falls in LME stocks. Three-months delivery closed at Dollars 1,470.75 a tonne, up Dollars 6.75. Traders said aluminium could test resistance at Dollars 1,485 during the current advance. OIL prices fell as traders' attention shifted from the Nigerian oil workers' strike to worries about European over-supply. September Brent crude oil futures slid 17 cents to Dollars 17.68 a barrel. The Nigerian strike has boosted oil prices by Dollars 2 over the last month as the country's output of 1.9m barrels a day has been cut by 20 per cent. Compiled from Reuter</p>

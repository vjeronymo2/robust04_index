This work  should be completed by the end of the current week, member of  the Central Electoral Commission andrey Beloborodov told  ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.    He noted that the Central Electoral Commission treats with  understanding those lawmakers who have not decided whether to be  members of parliament or to hold their present government posts.    "We do not prod legislators, since we understand that there  will be government reshuffling, and it may turn out that some  parliamentarians who will give up their seats in parliament,  will later lose their government jobs," he noted.    At the same time Beloborodov stressed that those lawmakers  who have not decided this question as yet, should remember that  "the Central Electoral Commission should know for sure who will  work at the new parliament by the first joint sitting of the two  chambers which is to be held in the Kremlin next week," he noted.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): The limitations of computer prose Word-processing manufacturers are getting over-ambitious. Not content with offering inventive features to make the mechanics of writing easier, they are now providing language lessons on line. Already half a dozen top word-processors have grammar 'checkers' built into them, and this year a whole sweep of packages for polishing prose has emerged. The latest programs aim to help people in business to produce good, structured, accurate writing. The theory is that there are identifiable steps to writing good prose which software can make easier. The first task is to choose a subject. The computer runs 'brainstorming software' to help spawn the idea, followed by a 'writer's block evader' to get over the fear of a blank screen. The next stage is to outline a structure. By scanning business writing advice programs, good letter writing plans, report writing skeletons or random plot generators the user is offered a selection of templates. Once the basic outline is ready the user begins to write. If stuck for a word, a spicy quote or impressive fact, the requisite dictionary can insert it into the text at the press of a button. Also available for quick reference are thesauri, multilingual dictionaries, usage advice, abbreviations and automatic hyphenators. All this will occupy a sizeable chunk of the hard disk and active memory. Finally, after the piece is written, correction programs sift through the text, pouncing on infelicities of style, punctuation, grammar and usage. There's almost nothing the software linguists haven't thought of to take the pain out of writing. There are some 30-40 types of software beyond the word-processor itself - all apparently selling well. It seems that Britons and Americans are sufficiently insecure about their ability to express themselves that they support an entire industry of computerised language lessons. This ought to be good news for managers who are anxious about standards of English teaching in schools. Unfortunately, however, providing a suite of writing tools for staff is only a palliative, not a substitute. Programs that act as reference books on line are handy, but the user has to know whether a problem exists in the first place. That's fine for checking if Middlesbrough has one or two Os in it, but whether to put a question mark before or after a closing quotation mark is a trickier matter. The trouble is that the limitations on computer memory make it impossible for a program to provide sufficient information about the intricacies of an entire language. Language is too rich to be stuffed within the confines of a personal computer program. Most advice is glib. Programs that check for errors of grammar or idiom may be a boon to those who recognise the error and can quietly put it right before the client sees it. But they are no good for users who are unsure. Software analysis can easily come up with an incorrect diagnosis or offer inappropriate comment. Even if it does offer some useful learning points for the insecure writer (when to use 'its' or 'it's') such programs are only worth their price to those who can sort the wheat from the chaff. And those people trust their instincts, not a number-crunching, pattern-matching system. One has to admire the ambition of the software producers who have set themselves the impossible task of taming language to fit computer capabilities. The danger is that some users may depend too heavily on such programs to mask their own shortcomings. Style-checkers encourage deadened prose based on limited criteria of excellence. Good, structured and accurate writing comes from practice, not from software. Jane Dorner's book, Writing on Disk, is published by John Taylor Book Ventures. Price Pounds 15.95.</p>

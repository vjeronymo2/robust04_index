The Rural Development Administration said in a report on  North Korean food production in 1993, released Thursday, that  the Communist country is reckoned to have suffered a 34-percent  decrease in rice production to 1.32 million tons, a 51-percent  drop in corn production to 1.96 million tons and a 15-percent  fall in production of other grains to 600,000 tons. The report  attributed North Korea's sharp foodgrain production decrease  last year to the unusually cold summer and said the North Korean  people would suffer from the worst food shortage since the early  1980s.    Estimating North Korea's foodgrain demand at 6.67 million  tons this year, the report said the internationally isolated  society's shortage in the coming year would be no less than 2.79  million tons.</p>

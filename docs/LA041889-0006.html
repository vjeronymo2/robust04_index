			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> HOUSING FOR YOSEMITE HIT  </P> <P> Environmentalists are complaining that a plan to build $10 million worth of new  housing for concessionaire workers in Yosemite Valley could ruin the park's  master plan. George Whitmore of the Sierra Club and Patti Schifferie of the  Wilderness Society say the plan that calls for building a series of dormitories  to house 452 employees of Yosemite Park and Curry Co. is in direct conflict  with the park's 1980 general mangement plan, which calls for the eventual  removal of artificial structures from Yosemite Valley. The project, which is  being proposed by the National Park Service and the Curry Co. would replace  tent cabins at four sites in the valley with multistory dormitories near  Yosemite Lodge. Whitmore and Schifferie say the plan for the permanent housing  represents the abandonment of the park's general management plan that took  nearly 10 years and cost almost $2 million to formulate.  </P></p>

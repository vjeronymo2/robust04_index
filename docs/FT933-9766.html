			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Hosokawa to take over as Japan's new PM MR MORIHIRO Hosokawa, the head of a seven-party coalition, was chosen as Japan's prime minister last night, but only after the Liberal Democratic party extended its 38-year rule by a few hours with delaying tactics that forced a second parliamentary vote for the leadership. 'One era has finished, and another era has begun,' Mr Hosokawa said. 'I feel a great sense of history and a heavy weight of responsibility.' The final seal of approval comes on Monday when Mr Hosokawa formally reports his appointment to Emperor Akihito. Last night, Liberal Democrat MPs thumped the opposition benches for the first time in postwar history and shouted abuse at the incoming government. The generally conservative coalition includes Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and several other mainstream parties, along with the Social Democrats, formerly the Socialist party, and Komeito, the political arm of a Buddhist movement. All have pledged to introduce a new electoral system within a year. Japanese financial markets were calm in expectation of the coalition's taking power, but business leaders warned that parliamentary delaying tactics by the LDP in the past two days could characterise coalition rule. Mr Hosokawa, 55, is the descendant of feudal lords and grandson of a war-time prime minister. A former provincial governor, he formed the Japan New party only a year ago and has risen to the premiership on a wave of public revulsion over bribery and other scandals involving the LDP. He said after the vote that the new government would 'look towards the people, not towards Nagatacho (the Tokyo political district)'. He is expected to announce his cabinet on Monday. Mr Hosokawa's election was presided over by Ms Takako Doi, the former socialist leader, who became the first woman to be selected as speaker of the lower house. The first poll was declared void as MPs claimed their votes had not been counted, and a second poll declared Mr Hosokawa's victory two hours later. Mr Hosokawa defeated Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president, by 262 votes to 224 votes. Two MPs voted for the SDP leader, Mr Sadao Yamahana, who was not a candidate. Apart from political reform, the coalition will have to deal with a still-slowing economy, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and US demands for further opening of Japan's markets. The parties have also promised to seek a full reconciliation with other Asian countries by clearly apologising for war-time aggression. Japan's bureaucrats fear new division of labour, Page 3</p>

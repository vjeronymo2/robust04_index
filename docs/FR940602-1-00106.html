			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposed rule supports and builds upon the language contained in the draft model permit. EPA is proposing that if the trial burn data for an interim status combustion facility show non-compliance with any set of the performance standards, then the facility will be required to (1) immediately cease operating under the condition(s) that resulted in non-compliance and (2) notify the Director. The facility may only continue operating if there are enough successful data from the trial burn to set all applicable operating conditions, and the facility is able to modify its design and/or limit its operating conditions to operate within the performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, one component in establishing a complete set of operating conditions is determining a maximum and a minimum combustion temperature. A maximum temperature is important for the metals volatilization standard; a minimum temperature is important for the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) standard. For the sake of simplicity, this example assumes that the facility tested under only two temperature conditions, a high and low temperature, and that all other variables remained constant. By setting minimum and maximum temperature limits, the test burn can establish an operating ``envelope,'' in other words, a range of temperatures within which the facility can operate safely in compliance with the performance standards. If the trial burn results show that the high temperature was successful, but that the low temperature was not sufficient to meet performance requirements, then there may not be enough successful data to set all applicable operating conditions. In this example, the facility would be required to stop operating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, following up on the above example, a facility may want to run tests over a range of temperatures in order to avoid shutdown. By running multiple temperature tests, the facility could attempt more conservative tests, as well as tests that would push the combustion unit's operating envelope. For instance, a facility may plan to conduct multiple tests to establish its minimum operating temperature. Thus, a facility may choose to test at two temperatures, e.g., low and medium. If the trial burn results show that the low temperature could not meet the performance standards, but the medium temperature did, then enough successful data would exist to set all applicable operating conditions. In this scenario, the facility would restrict its operations to burn between the medium and the high temperature during the post-trial burn period and, thus, would continue operating within the performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends for the facility to be responsible for restricting its operations if any of the trial burn data show non-compliance with performance standards. If the facility wishes to continue operating under restricted conditions during the post-trial burn period, it must provide to the Director a description of the conditions under which it is operating, and a preliminary explanation of how the conditions were determined to be sufficient to ensure that the unit functions within the performance standards. EPA is proposing to require facilities to submit this information with the trial burn results. As currently required in &sect;&sect;270.62(b)(7) and (8) for incinerators, and 270.66(d)(3) and (4) for BIFs, facilities must submit the results of the trial burn and any data from the trial burn within 90 days of conducting the burn. As part of the proposed consolidation of the permitting procedural requirements for interim status combustion facilities, EPA has also reiterated this requirement by incorporating it, by reference, into &sect;270.74(c)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(6), to give the Director the discretion to further restrict operating conditions during the post-trial burn period to ensure that the unit is operated within the performance standards. The Director will make a determination on the need for further restrictions after reviewing the trial burn data and the preliminary explanation submitted by the facility within 90 days of the trial burn. The Director will inform the facility, in writing, of any operational restrictions that he or she is imposing on the facility beyond those listed by the facility in its preliminary explanation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Additional trial burns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing permit modification procedures (&sect;270.42) contain provisions to address additional trial burns at permitted combustion facilities. As mentioned previously, public involvement opportunities are built into the permit modification procedures. The procedures require the permitting authority to notify the public when any change is made to the existing permit through these procedures. Since the permit modification procedures do not apply to interim status facilities, EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(7), to specify requirements for additional trial burns at interim status combustion facilities. As discussed in the previous section, if any results of a trial burn at an interim status combustion facility show non-compliance with any set of the performance standards, the facility must restrict its post-trial burn operations to conditions that passed and demonstrated compliance with performance standards. At this point, there are two potential courses of action a facility may follow. On one hand, the facility may choose to revise its Part B application to exclude those conditions. A facility that opts for this course of action is, in essence, choosing not to pursue those conditions in its final permit. For example, if the facility failed conditions relating to burning of aqueous wastes, it may decide to restrict its long-term operations by handling only non-aqueous wastes; the facility would then reflect that decision in its permit application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, a facility may choose to revise its trial burn plan to address the reasons for the failure and then conduct an additional burn under improved design or operating conditions. EPA believes that the majority of facilities that fail trial burn condition(s) will choose this latter course of action in order to establish permit conditions that meet their needs for long-term operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "military researcher" Ping Ko-fu (1627 0668 </F> 1133): "Russia and China Upgrade Diplomatic Relations"]    [Text] Nikolay Solovyev (suo luo wei ye fu 4792 5012 4850  0048 1133), director general of the Second Asia-Pacific General  Bureau of the Russian Foreign Ministry and a former Russian  ambassador to Beijing, said in an interview a few days ago that  a consensus on the establishment of a "partnership relationship"  had been reached between Russia and China and that this  relationship was different from the strategic "partnership  relationship" established between Russia and the United States.  The new relationship established between Russia and China was  defined as a "constructive partnership relationship." This  meant that stress was laid on bilateral exchanges and regional  cooperation.    Director General Solovyev held that two major factors  threatened peace in Asia-Pacific at present, the first being the  Korean Peninsula and the second the South China Sea. He thus  indirectly rejected the possibility of a conflict between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the new future.    Solovyev also said that he thought "alliance" relationships  between countries did not tally with the norms of international  relations today, because "alliances" eventually led to  unilateral dependence between countries. [as published]    On the question of Sino-Russian military cooperation, Russia  has international commitments and would never carry out secret  weapons deals with China. Regarding the export of Su-27 fighter  planes, the mainland has decided to buy a second batch of 26  Su-27's. According to sources in the Russian Ministry of  National Defense, talks on the export of 26 Su-27K's have  basically been concluded, and the planes will be delivered in  batches beginning this year. Compared with the 26 Su-27UB's,  which the mainland has already obtained, the Su-27K can be used  by both the Air Force and the Navy and are equipped with the  AL35F turbojet and a digital autopilot control system, its fire  control radar is of the same grade as the Su-35, which has an  effective range of 400 km, and they can attack 15 targets  simultaneously.</p>

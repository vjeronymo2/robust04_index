			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Prison Service management faces shake-up Prison governors are being asked to prepare local development plans for the future of their establishments under radical proposals to devolve management in Britain's Prison Service. One of the consequences of the proposed shift to devolved management will be cuts in the 1,900 staff at the Prison Service's London headquarters. A review of headquarters functions is due to be completed by April. Governors and their management teams at 14 prisons have begun preparing detailed strategic development plans - ranging from recommendations for physical im-provements to buildings to changes in specialist services provided for prisoners - under a pilot project to test the devolution scheme. The approach will be extended to all state prisons by the end of this year. Mr Derek Lewis, who left the private sector to become director-general of the Prison Service last year, said there was widespread recognition that the service had been managed in a far too 'centrally prescriptive' way. 'The structure does not allow governors to take sufficient decisions locally or encourage governors to feel responsible for the destinies of their own prisons,' he said. Local development plans will give senior Prison Service managers a far stronger basis for assessing the management performance of individual prisons than exists at present, and a mechanism for allocating capital funds depending on the quality of local proposals. Prisons taking part in the pilot exercise are Dartmoor, Leicester, Shrewsbury, Bristol, Norwich, Maidstone, Grendon, Wandsworth, Pentonville, Stoke Heath, Aylesbury, Wayland, Linholme and Ford. The Prison Service's headquarters has been divided into two functional units  -staff responsible for the service's central strategic management, and those providing services to prisons. All activities are being examined by the review now in progress, which Mr Lewis said would 'undoubtedly lead to a cut in the number of staff in headquarters, consequent principally on the devolution to governors'.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Components and Component Prices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unlike the multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing plans adopted previously in other Federal milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing orders, this decision recommends the adoption of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing plan for milk based on three components rather than two.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the five orders involved in this decision, milk should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priced on the basis of its protein, other nonfat solids, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The protein price contained in this decision is based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of protein in the manufacture of cheese, as determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese market prices, and is not a residual of the Minnesota-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wisconsin (M-W) price minus butterfat value as is the case in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other MCP plans. The butterfat price would be based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butter market, as it is in other multiple component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. ``Other nonfat solids'' will be priced as a residual of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the M-W price minus protein value and butterfat value. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat, protein, and other nonfat solids prices shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed in dollars per pound carried to the fourth decimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place. In addition, payments to each producer should reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of participation in the marketwide pools on a hundredweight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in other orders for which multiple component pricing has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been adopted, this decision maintains the relationship of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of producer milk to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> M-W price. If the sum of the butterfat value and the protein value is greater than the M-W price, a situation which would result in a negative other nonfat solids price, the protein price will be adjusted such that the other nonfat solids price will be zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In testimony and brief a witness for the Trade Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Proprietary Plants (TAPP) and Farmers Union Milk Marketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooperative (FUMMC) presented a plan that would pay producers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein above a neutral zone of 3.00% to 3.29%, and provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deductions for protein levels below the neutral zone. The level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adjustment would be tied to the price of barrel cheddar cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the National Cheese Exchange, and would be used to adjust pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices to producers in a manner similar to the current butterfat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness said that milk traditionally has been purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a per hundredweight basis, with differential adjustments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of components. According to the witness, not only are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers usually paid on a per hundredweight basis, but milk is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured on a per hundredweight basis for purposes of plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting, payments between plants and to haulers, and by breed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations and DHIA with adjustments for percentages of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components where necessary. The witness also claimed that using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential pricing would be revenue neutral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TAPP/FUMMC witness is correct that switching payments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers from a per hundredweight system to one of pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components, as adopted in this decision, is not a minor change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some expense will be incurred by handlers and producers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adapting to the new system. However, the benefits to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry in the affected areas of adopting a uniform multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing system outweigh the one-time costs of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption. The implication that everyone connected with the dairy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry must adopt this system is not correct. Pounds of milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must still be accounted for under the multiple component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. For example, nothing in this decision would prevent a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler from continuing to pay haulers on a hundredweight basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No testimony at the hearing from witnesses that have producers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pooled under Federal orders that have already adopted multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing indicated that moving to a pricing system that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices milk component by the pound was an onerous burden. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transcript does reveal disagreement with the level of the protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price under some Federal orders with multiple component pricing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but little dissatisfaction with the system itself, nor complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the difficulty of switching to a component pricing system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As to the argument that pricing protein and butterfat on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis of price differentials would be revenue neutral, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple component pricing system recommended for adoption is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed neither to enhance nor reduce total producer returns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only changes in the total pool value that may occur because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the recommended changes would result from differences in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein and other nonfat solids content between milk pooled under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the orders included in this proceeding and the milk included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Minnesota-Wisconsin survey. In addition, some redistribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the dollars involved in each pool can be expected between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers, and between handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

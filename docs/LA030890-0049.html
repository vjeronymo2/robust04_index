			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL;  </P> <P> POLY SQUEAKS PAST SYLMAR IN EAST VALLEY OPENER  </P> <P> Two teams that played three-one run games against each other last season met  again Wednesday in an East Valley League opener. After three hours, the setting  of the sun and another one-run decision, what do you have?  </P> <P> "Typical Sylmar-Poly," Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella said.  </P> <P> In a game pitting the top two league title contenders against each other, Poly  emerged with a 7-6 victory at Sylmar. The game was called because of darkness  after six innings.  </P> <P> That the game came down to one run was to Sylmar's credit. Poly forged an early  5-1 lead in the third inning when Rodrigo Dorame (three runs batted in) hit a  two-run home run off loser James Encinas (1-1).  </P> <P> In the fourth inning, Poly's Gabe Chavez (three RBIs) increased the lead to 6-1  with a single that scored Roy Lozano, who had two hits and scored two runs for  the Parrots (3-2).  </P> <P> Sylmar (2-2) then jumped on eventual winner Eddie Castellanos (3-0) for three  runs in the bottom of the fourth as David Romero and Billy Garcia rapped  run-scoring singles and Robert Garcia hit a sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-4 in the bottom of the fifth, Sylmar again stormed back. Ben Soliz  knocked out an RBI single and pinch-hitter Pat Garcia had an RBI single. With  the score 7-6 and runners on first and third and one out, Encinas looped a ball  to Poly second baseman Lozano, who speared it and doubled off Garcia to end the  inning.  </P> <P> Poly, which had stranded 43 runners in its previous four games, left the bases  loaded in each of the final four innings.

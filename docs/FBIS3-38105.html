			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F> Robert Stoppacher; place and date not given--live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [Stoppacher] The protests did not yield the  desired effect. The Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech  Republic near the Austrian border will be completed. This has  become possible because of a decision by the U.S. state bank  promoting exports, which has guaranteed a loan of about 4  billion schillings to ensure the completion of this giant Czech  nuclear power station. The money will be used also to equip  Soviet-type reactors with Western safety technology. The  decision by the U.S. bank did not come as a surprise, even  though many Austrian politicians and environmental organizations  tried to prevent these U.S. credits.    Austrian officials reacted in the following way: Chancellor  Franz Vranitzky has been sobered by the fact that efforts to  prevent the completion of the Temelin nuclear power station have  failed for the time being. Still, he is not discouraged. The  chancellor pointed out that the credit still has to be approved  by the U.S. Senate.    [Vranitzky] We will take all possible political measures to  achieve a change of heart in the U.S. Senate and to initiate a  new discussion.    [Stoppacher] What possibilities do you see? Some of your  government's ministers contacted U.S. authorities in the past.  Yet they did not achieve anything.    [Vranitzky] You are quite right. We have undertaken a great  deal. Ministers, members of parliament, and provincial  politicians launched initiatives. I myself drafted  comprehensive statements and intervened in other ways. The  opportunity of bringing about a change of heart in the United  States is to be considered very slim. One must say that, if  Temelin is completed, Austria's and my own efforts will not have  led to the desired goal.    [Stoppacher] Do you see other possibilities, apart from  talking with U.S. senators and trying to convince them?    [Vranitzky] I see only a limited number of possibilities  because, by guaranteeing the credit, the U.S. Administration is  primarily supporting a U.S. supplier during difficult economic  times. One can imagine that the U.S. industry is presenting very  convincing arguments in favor of this project. [passage omitted]</p>

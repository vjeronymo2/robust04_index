			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec shares near low point after resignations SHARES IN Hi-Tec Sports, the sports and leisure wear company, yesterday headed back towards their all time low - touched in January - as the market reflected on Tuesday's resignation of the company's two newly appointed non-executive directors. Sir Michael Edwardes, former chairman of British Leyland, and Mr Richard Fenhalls, chief executive of Henry Ansbacher, joined the Hi-Tec board in January and their sudden departure was largely overlooked by the stock market, which was concentrating on the Budget. Yesterday the shares fell 5p to 40p, after touching 35p, just 5p above their all time low of 30p. Analysts said the departure of the two non-executives had raised worries about how Hi-Tec was managed and its trading outlook. 'When non-executives of this calibre resign simultaneously, one obviously draws a negative conclusion,' one analyst said. Hi-Tec's position was not helped by the refusal of both sides to comment on the resignations. Sir Michael and Mr Fenhalls were appointed by Hi-Tec chairman and 54 per cent shareholder Mr Frank van Wezel. Mr van Wezel last year came under pressure from institutional shareholders who feared he had too much control over the company. But his choice of such high profile non-executives looks strange, as does their agreement to work under a man with a reputation for getting his own way. 'Both sides could be accused of naivety,' one observer said. 'It seems they were unable to work together from the start and had different opinions of each others' roles,' another said. Hi-Tec's advisers stressed the company's trading situation had not declined in recent months. The company's broker Hoare Govett expects a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3m for the year just ended, but said the US market has started to improve and 1994 is forecast to see Hi-Tec return to a profit of about Pounds 4m.</p>

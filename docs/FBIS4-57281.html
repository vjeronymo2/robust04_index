			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] The Legislative Assembly yesterday ratified the  constitutive treaty whereby Panama will join the Central  American Parliament (Parlacen).    In a little over 24 hours the Assembly approved in the  second  and third debates the Parlacen constitutive treaty, which was  signed by the Central American presidents on 2 October 1987.    According to the treaty, Panama will have a representation  of  20 deputies in Parlacen, each of whom will be elected for a  five-year term by direct vote. They will also be allowed to run  for second terms.    The treaty establishes that presidents and vice presidents  of  Central American countries will join Parlacen when they complete  their mandates.    It is estimated that Panama will have to contribute $1.7  million to enter the regional organization. Parlacen will pay  the deputies' salaries.    Parlacen will serve as a deliberative body to analyze  political, economic, social, and cultural matters common to the  region and the security of Central American nations.    Assembly President Arturo Vallarino said the current trend  toward the establishment of world blocs makes it necessary for  Panama to join a regional forum where its problems will be  discussed.</p>

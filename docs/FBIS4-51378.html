			<p>BFN     [Text] Accompanied by provincial vice Governor Zheng  Peimin and provincial education commission Director Ji Yihui,  provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin inspected five  locally based higher learning institutions on 18-21 May,  including Central South University of Technology, Hunan  Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hunan Teachers'  University, Changsha Institute of Communications, and Hunan  Light Industry School.    During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin inspected in  great detail internal and external environments of each and  every higher learning institution, inquired about conditions in  student dormitories and canteens, befriended and solicited views  from students, and showed great concern for teaching, learning,  and scientific research activities, teachers' contingent  building, as well as ideological realities, livelihood, academic  and research work of staff and teachers.    After being told that many locally based higher learning  institutions are confronted with difficulties in scientific  research and publication of literary works due to a short supply  of water, electricity, and operational funds, Secretary Wang  Maolin repeatedly asked the provincial education commission,  provincial party committee's college education work committee,  and some other provincial departments concerned to take prompt  action to resolve those problems as soon as possible.    During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin time and again  stressed: Now the majority of the province's college students  are in their twenties and are thereby the unquestionable  successors in the next century. Within a short space of 10 to  20 years, these students will become either party and government  leaders at all levels across the country or technological  backbones in the forefront of production. Therefore, higher  learning institutions should at once be places where students  are trained academically and where students are taught how to  conduct themselves. Only by so doing will they be able to train  a new generation of people capable of undertaking sacred  missions entrusted by history.    During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin highly praised  Central South University of Technology for having successfully  built a national-level laboratory and a powder metallurgy  research institute, praised Hunan Teachers' University for  having built a competent contingent of teachers and trained a  large number of highly qualified personnel, praised Hunan  Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine for having  successfully developed a traditional Chinese medical diagnoses  course, praised Changsha Institute of Communications for having  cultivated a fine campus style and a fine academic style, and  commended Hunan Light Industry School for having successfully  created and experimented with a series of new teaching methods.    Secretary Wang Maolin also spelled out some specific new  work  requirements for the aforementioned five higher learning  institutions.</p>

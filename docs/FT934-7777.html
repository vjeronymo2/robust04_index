			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Falling demand and strong yen hit Casio Computer CASIO Computer, the leading maker of digital watches and electronic calculators, yesterday reported a plunge in parent pre-tax profit as it suffered the impact of the sharp economic downturn in Japan and the rapid rise of the yen. Casio suffered a 67 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y2.8bn (Dollars 26.16m) on sales that were 7 per cent down to Y159bn. Operating profits plummeted 82 per cent to Y1.3bn. The company blamed the severe drop in private capital spending and personal consumption as well as the devastating impact of the yen's rapid rise for the deterioration in its business performance. Casio is revising its forecast for consolidated sales and profits in the full business year due to the sharp rise of the yen and continuing weakness in major economies. It now forecasts sales of Y415bn rather than Y450bn as predicted in May and pre-tax profits of Y11bn, rather than Y14.5bn. For the parent company, Casio forecasts sales of Y330bn and pre-tax profits of Y9.3bn. The company was particularly hard hit by falling overseas demand, particularly in Europe. Calculator sales were modestly up on the same period last year but electronic clocks and watches, electronic musical instruments and electronic office equipment all suffered a setback.</p>

Everyone is awaiting this pivotal  event in the peace process. The results of this summit will  definitely make major headlines in the region for a long time to  come. Perhaps the great attention given to the Geneva summit  primarily stems from the interest in the need to achieve peace  in the Middle East, a peace that is considered an international  demand more than it is a domestic or regional demand. [passage  omitted].    We will not be divulging a secret if we say that we agree  with the U.S. Administration on many points, most prominent of  which is the need to achieve a comprehensive peace, admitting  that separate and partial deals do not bring a real, viable, and  durable peace, that peace can only be achieved through the  restoration of the territory and ending the occupation, that the  Syrian and Lebanese tracks are two integrated tracks without  which the peace process cannot be completed, and that stability  in the region is important, vital, and essential for world  security. Such security can only be achieved through the  establishment of a just, comprehensive peace based on the  international legitimacy and UN resolutions. Many points of  disagreement notwithstanding, the points mentioned above were  behind Syria's readiness to cooperate with the former Bush  administration and the present Clinton administration to make  the peace process successful and to remove obstacles from its  path.    For over two years, Syria has been making every sincere and  honest effort in this context. This has enhanced respect for  Syria, increased its importance, and boosted its stands, not  only in the eyes of the world, but also in the eyes of the  decisionmakers in the U.S. Administration in particular, who  planned the Geneva summit as recognition and acknowledgement of  Syria's role and of President Hafiz al-Asad's decisive role in  the peace process. This Syrian- U.S. cooperation exists and  will continue as long the U.S. Administration is committed to  the peace process and as long as it is interested in its success  in accordance with the assurances, guarantees, and principles on  the basis of which it has been launched. This cooperation is  apt to yield good fruits in the Geneva summit if the Clinton  administration shoulders its responsibility seriously and  effectively to convince the Israeli rulers to comply with the  terms of peace and to fully withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories.    There is no problem with Syria, which has accepted the peace  process and its bases and worked to make it successful. The  problem lies in the stands of the Israeli rulers, who, up to  this moment, reject the bases of this process. Furthermore,  they are working to marginalize this process. They are  tampering with its tracks and distorting it through secret  contacts and vague and incomplete agreements.    Out of our interest in the peace process, we in Syria are  greatly hoping that the Geneva summit will yield positive  results which will open the way for the peace process and will  remove the traps that the Israeli rulers have placed in its way.  By all yardsticks, it is an exceptional chance for the Clinton  administration to rectify the situation, improve the atmosphere  in the region, make real peace in the Middle East, and prove the  credibility of the United States as the sole superpower which  has a historic responsibility toward the achievement of peace  and security for peoples of the world.

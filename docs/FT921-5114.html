			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: GKN GKN's principal argument for maintaining its dividend in the face of a 45 per cent drop in pre-tax profits appears to be that careful cash management during the recession has left its balance sheet in excellent shape. Gearing has dropped to 26 per cent from 32 per cent, thanks to a squeeze on both working capital and capital spending. Yet its total dividend payment for this year will consume nearly all the Pounds 55m reduction in working capital, while it is only 0.7 times covered by earnings per share. That might matter less if there were any real prospect of recovery in the group's major markets in 1992. As it is, GKN itself scarcely expects any rise in European car production this year and when recovery eventually comes, it will bring with it a fresh demand for cash. Stocks will increase again, and the company will have to rebuild its hire stock which has been run down because of the recession. Once investors have got over their relief at the maintained dividend, they might therefore ponder whether it made sense to mark the shares up by 6 per cent yesterday. Dividend cover is unlikely to return to its normal two-times before 1994. Any increase in payout is thus a long way off, although there may still be some support from a yield approaching 8 per cent.</p>

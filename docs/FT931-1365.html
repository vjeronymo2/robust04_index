			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Weizman elected Israeli president MR EZER WEIZMAN, one of Israel's most colourful and controversial politicians, was yesterday elected as the country's seventh president. A supporter of direct contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and a man who finds his opinions difficult to contain, Mr Weizman can be expected to push to the limits the remit of his mainly ceremonial post. 'I think I know what I am forbidden to do, but I am not yet clear what I am allowed to do,' he said after winning the vote by members of the Knesset (parliament). Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, was quick to enlighten him. He said Mr Weizman well understood presidential responsibility, which was to unite the people, help the government and advance its goals without being political. Israel's new president is one of the country's few politicians who have moved from right to left across the political spectrum. The architect of Israel's air victory in the 1967 six-day war, he guided the Likud party to its shock electoral triumph in the 1977 general election and was the only politician in Israel to strike up a personal relationship with President Anwar Sadat after the Egyptian leader's visit to Jerusalem later that year. Mr Weizman, who learned to fly with the Royal Air Force during the second world war, joins fellow-pilots Assad of Syria, Mubarak of Egypt and Hussein of Jordan at the centre of Middle East peace efforts. Mr Shevach Weiss, speaker of the Knesset, saw it as an omen that the peace process was about to take off. How far it might fly will be more emphatically affected by another Israeli election yesterday where four candidates are fighting for leadership of the Likud party. Likud is historically committed to the idea of a greater Israel which includes the Arab occupied territories. With the result due to be announced today, the likely victor is Mr Binjamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu. He is seen by his supporters as the modern, televisual riposte to the ageing generation of politicians represented by Mr Weizman and Mr Rabin, but by his detractors as shallow, superficial and self-centred. If no candidate wins 40 per cent of the votes cast by an estimated 200,000 Likud members, a second round will be necessary.</p>

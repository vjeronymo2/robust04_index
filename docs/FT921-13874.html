			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Gardening: A window on winter's wonders - From his ivory tower, Robin Lane Fox observes a sparkling display of cold-season blooms WE ARE in the middle of an extraordinary flowering which some of you may not have noticed. This weekend, you have a chance to notice it, pleasurably. Naturally, it has not escaped my ivory tower: how, indeed, could it? Historians in ivory towers are so wonderfully broad-minded. They rise above petty differences, the world is their horizon, and they look to and fro behind the misty clouds of everyday life. Or so it should be; but it is not because of these fine ideals that I have noticed what is going on. The reason is that my view of it is very narrow. Through two small windows of academic proportions, I look out on a cloud of cherry blossom in January. Even a genius would probably not miss it but, through these particular windows, it appears in an unintended light. They are set in dark, damaged panelling which was stripped by two kind souls last year in return for a modest bribe. After stripping it, they said they ought to preserve it. This sounded sensible but took me by surprise when I found they had painted it with a coat of transparent gloss. As a result, the world outside is reflected in a mirror of dark, stained walls which gleam like burnt toffee just removed from an oven. Through these two toffee-brown mirrors, I keep up with the news of the world. Empires collapse and so do heads of state at smart dinners. I see it all, along with these clouds of blossom which hang on the air as if some gentle person is breathing into a cold morning. From the front line, I can report that it is a fabulous year for winter-flowering plants and that winter-flowering cherry is having the time of its life. Perhaps you mistrust the breadth of my narrow view: if so, you can verify it today and tomorrow by a special trip to Hampshire. At Ampfield, near Romsey, the Hillier Arboretum is marking the mild weather with a special weekend for visitors. The arboretum leaves happy memories in crazy weather. I will never forget a strange day in March 1989 when the garden's gold magnolias beamed happily in the sunshine before an audience of myself and some canny old-age pensioners. Unless there has been a sudden frost in the small hours, you have a good chance of an experience that will be just as memorable. The garden will be open to visitors from 10.30 until dusk, charging Pounds 2 for admission. Visitors ought to see why the winter-flowering cherry, Prunus subhirtella autumnalis, remains my first choice among flowering trees for the garden, the Glaxo of tree-planters during my adult lifetime. It will fit into front gardens of modest size and it is a wonderful performer from an early age, giving you quantities of buds which can be brought indoors. This year, the sweet scent of the sarcoccas is all around; the viburnums are fantastic, especially the white bodnamtense and its pink variant, Dawn, which are showing more heads of peppery-sweet flowers than I can remember. The winter suite is flowering crazily with that wonderful scent on those pale yellow petals which look as if they, too, have been treated with transparent gloss; while in one of its long borders, Hilliers has a Himalayan honeysuckle, Lonicera setifera, which I have never seen before. It also has bewitching witch hazels and some daphnes which need serious study. In the family of witch hazels, I know what I like: my favourite is the pale lemon-yellow form called pallida, but I suppose that this certainty needs to be checked. Modern breeders have introduced shades of red, orange and copper into the witch hazel's petals and my immediate response is to dislike all of them when I see them on young plants. They might, perhaps, look prettier at maturity but it takes so long for a witch hazel to develop that I would not take the risk without hard evidence. This weekend, hard evidence is available in the arboretum where some of these hybrids have now grown into decent little trees and you can decide if you really like a red variety called Diane or a copper-orange one called Jelena. I much prefer the pale yellow, but all of them are scented charmingly on a mild afternoon. The winter-flowering daphnes will also be worth visiting. Some of them are European natives but there are also some taller, pale-flowered varieties which have a heavenly scent and are at home from India eastwards through Katmandu to China. Daphne bholua is the most tantalising and in the arboretum you will, perhaps, see why daphne-fanciers have been excited. In Britain, the ordinary form was never very hardy or free-flowering. Instead, we needed to look for a named variety which had been collected by keen botanists or found by sharp-eyed army colonels at a height in the mountains where hardiness is more certain. One of the best is a pink-flowered form called Gurkha, which was found by an alert major in the field. The arboretum also has Jaqueline Postill, a deep pink daphne which I have always envied but never pleased on a stony lime soil. The Cotswolds are not exactly Katmandu and witch hazels also dislike my part of the country. Hence, the pleasure of a visit. Go and see what you cannot grow, enjoying the second-hand gardening which has always been a national pastime. Gardening, too, is a spectator sport and there are certain things which are much too rare to be seen from a narrow window.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has welcomed the  agreement on ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh and insisted that it  be strictly implemented by all parties. This was announced by  an official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry,  Mikhail Demurin, at a briefing in Moscow today.    He said it was necessary to achieve a breakthrough in  development of the situation, to turn to peace and to confirm  the armistice with a legally binding agreement which would put  an end to the armed conflict once and for all.    Demurin announced that the agreement on ceasefire had been  reached on May 12 late at night by the Armenian and Azerbaijani  defense ministers and the commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh army  with a significant contribution made by Russia and the chairman  of the CSCE Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh.    "Contrary to the ceasefires unilaterally declared by  Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan this agreement provides for  mutual obligations of the parties and a compromise reached with  the participation of the mediators," Demurin stressed.</p>

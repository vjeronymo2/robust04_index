			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Interest boost helps Farnell to Pounds 33.8m STRONG GROWTH in interest income helped Farnell Electronics, the manufacturer and distributor of electrical and electronic equipment, increase pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 30.64m to Pounds 33.78m in the year to February 3. Farnell, which had cash balances of Pounds 29m at the year-end, benefited from high rates available in the money markets and interest income rose from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 3.8m. Turnover fell from Pounds 169.7m to Pounds 163.8m, mainly because of the disposal of AC Farnell, a wholesale distributor of brown goods, sold in March last year. Farnell's main division, electronic component distribution, increased operating profits from Pounds 21.33m to Pounds 23.43m on turnover up from Pounds 97.36m to Pounds 104m. Electronic equipment manufacturing saw operating profits fall from Pounds 8.87m to Pounds 7.12m on turnover of Pounds 60.3m, down from Pounds 65.46m. Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 16.3p (14.5p). The directors are recommending a final dividend of 3p, bringing the total for the year to 5.5p, a rise of 15 per cent. Mr Henry Elstone, finance director, said the group's German subsidiary made a loss of Pounds 2m, but its development was continuing and he was looking for a good return in the current year. Mr Elstone said the group had been hit by recessionary conditions in the UK, but was confident that it would be able to maintain its 25-year record of growth in earnings per share. Farnell's Australian subsidiary made a small net profit during the year, which Mr Elstone said was a commendable performance in view of the difficulties of the economic climate there. COMMENT These are good results in view of the depth of the recession in the UK economy, which still accounts for the vast majority of the Leeds-based group's business. Farnell did well to increase profit margins slightly in its already extremely lucrative distribution business, but holding the erosion in manufacturing margins to 11.8 per cent, compared with 13.6 per cent in the previous year, is just as impressive. The main concern in the market is that Farnell will use its cash pile to pay too much for the distribution activities of STC, the British telecommunications group bought last year by Northern Telecom of Canada. However, paying over the odds would not be in character for a canny northern management team. Forecast flat profits of Pounds 33.5m put the shares, up 4p yesterday to 206p, on a prospective multiple of just over 12, in line with its sector. That seems undemanding, particularly if the German investment comes good, but the shares are unlikely to advance until the group's acquisition intentions become clearer.</p>

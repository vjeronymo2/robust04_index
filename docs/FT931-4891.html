			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Borrowed time It may be just as well that the government will present two budgets this year. Yesterday's consumer credit figures add to the impression that the economy has at last begun to grow. Yet the recovery is not secure enough to give the chancellor much leeway for fiscal tightening next week. If he wants to nurture confidence, he will probably still have to wait until November before setting about any serious deficit reduction. Much of January's increase in consumer lending appears to reflect the turnround in car sales since the abolition of car tax. Stripping that out leaves a modest rise in credit card borrowing which hardly amounts to a broad-based revival in consumers' appetite for credit. Nor is there much reason to expect confidence to recover strongly while unemployment is still rising and there has been no definitive pick-up in the housing market. Mr Lamont thus still faces the difficult task of convincing financial markets that the PSBR is under control without trampling any green shoots in the process. The least the markets require is a medium term plan for reducing the deficit with some net tax increase now as a gesture of good faith. Backbench Tory opinion seems to be moving in support of such an approach. Whether consumers will be happy is another matter. It is a pity the chancellor has been so emphatic on interest rates. Another rate cut would not be fully passed on in the mortgage market. But companies would feel the benefit in their cash flow. That might make them less inclined to shed staff.</p>

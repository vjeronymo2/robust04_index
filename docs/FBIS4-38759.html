			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels June 1 TASS -- Kyrgyzstan is now the 12th  state and the third Central Asian republic to join the  "Partnership for Peace" programme. The framework document was  signed on Wednesday at the NATO headquarters here by Kyrgyz  President Askar Akayev, who is currently paying an official  visit to Belgium at the head of a Kyrgyz state delegation.    Taking the floor during the signing ceremomy, Akayev noted  that the world was no longer divided into opposite blocs, but  the process of the Soviet Union's disintegration proved to be  painful; it is accompanied by conflicts and crises in the  economic and other spheres of public life.    "This is why Kyrgyzstan is turning its attention to  international unions, set up by the civilised mankind -- the  United Nations, the CSCE, the NATO, etc. It shares the idea of  partnership as an expression of its conviction that the  stability and security of every country can be ensured only  through joint actions," Akayev stated. The president reaffirmed  the adherence of his country to the principles of freedom and  democracy, stressing that liberty and human rights were at the  bedrock of Kyrgyz state policy.    "But the road of democratic and market reforms proved longer  and more difficult than initially anticipated. Exploiting the  difficulties of the country, the communists, nationalists and  other conservative forces are endeavouring to turn back its  development. The crisis can be overcome only in conditions of a  strong democratic state and through cooperation with the  international community," he stated. The president specially  stressed America's huge role in the support given to the  independent Kyrgyzstan.    Acting NATO Secretary-General Sergio Balancino noted the  alliance's readiness to cooperate with Kyrgyzstan in many areas,  beginning with peace-making operations and ending with the  creation of democratically controlled armed forces. He noted  Akayev's role and efforts to implement democratic reforms, to  promote the freedom of speech, and to guarantee the rights of  all the citizens of the country and of its national minorities.</p>

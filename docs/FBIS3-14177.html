The representatives, who met under the chairmanship of Kenya's  Foreign Minister, Mr. Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, who is also the  chairman of the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought  and Development] foreign affairs standing committee overseeing  the Sudanese problem, agreed that the humanitarian and political  dimensions of the Sudanese problem be treated separately but  simultaneously.    The Sudanese Government delegation was led by Mr. Muhammad  Khalifah, Commander Salva [Kiir] mayar dit for SPLM/SPLA, while  SPLM [Sudanese People's Liberation Movement]/SPLA [Sudanese  People's Liberation Army]-United was represented by Dr. Richard  Mola.    Mr. Musyoka also said that the parties had also agreed to  declare corridors of tranquillity to be set by the UN and the  concerned parties from 15th to 30th April, May and June this  year [as heard] to allow for vaccinations of Sudanese children  under five years. The parties also said that the decision was  necessary to alleviate unnecessary hunger and restore basic  social services. They, however, maintained that humanitarian  activities should be transparent and should never be channelled  to warring parties.    The occasion was also witnessed by all IGADD foreign affairs  ministers.</p>

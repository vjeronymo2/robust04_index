			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (13): Geneva - a centre of precision manufacturing / The city is home for one of Switzerland's largest machine tool companies, Charmilles Technologies WHEN one thinks of Geneva, manufacturing is not something that comes immediately to mind. Yet the city is a significant centre of precision manufacturing, especially of up-market watches, but of other products as well. It is home, for example, to one of Switzerland's largest machine tool companies, Charmilles Technologies. Charmilles, like the Geneva watchmakers, may be a rather small company by international standards - sales last year reached SFr314m - but it is a global leader in a niche market. Its niche is electro-deposition (spark erosion) machines. EDM technology is of fairly recent vintage, having been discovered by accident by two Soviet engineers in 1943. The attraction of this technology was that it permitted cutting metal in unusual shapes while maintaining a high level of precision. As such, it was an appropriate replacement for milling machines in some applications, notably die sinking. Industrial production of EDM machines was started by a UK company in 1952 but, as in so many other cases, that company has long since disappeared. Charmilles, then part of the Ateliers Charmilles industrial conglomerate, began in the mid 1950s and soon established itself as the leading world supplier. Like its watchmaking neighbours, it concentrated for a long time on making the most sophisticated machines, priding itself on its precision technology. However, in recent years, again like its watchmaking neighbours, it found itself being undercut by Japanese competitors making simpler but cost effective machines in high volume. As Japan's mass consumer product industries became stronger, they too became interested in EDM, prompting such local machine tool makers as Makino and Hitachi Seiki to enter the fray in the 1960s. Initially, Charmilles did not pay much attention. It continued to win sales in Japan for its sophisticated machines, and both the company and its agent were content to play the low volume, high margin game. However, it gradually became apparent that customers introduced to EDM technology on Japanese machines would continue buying Japanese machines as they became more demanding rather than switch to Charmilles. 'Now the technological gap is much smaller, so we cannot maintain our stance of concentrating at the top end,' says Andre Richoz, president. The other shock for Charmilles in recent years was to realise that Japan had become the most important market for EDM machines. But today, Japan represents a third of the world market for EDM machines, and Charmilles has only a tiny share there. Only three per cent of the machines it makes go to Japan. In other markets too, Charmilles has found itself squeezed by Japanese competitors who now account for 42 per cent of world output compared to 15 per cent made in Switzerland. Mr Richoz, who was hired away from the Swiss engineering group Sulzer three years ago to lead Charmilles, has set about trying to improve the group's position. 'We cannot be strong in the world without having a significant position in the Japanese market,' he says. A subsidiary has been set up in Tokyo and the group is designing products and training programmes specially for the Japanese market. Although the company makes its own numerical controls, it has adopted Fanuc controls for its products in Japan because Japanese engineers are accustomed to them. 'We do not expect to make money there quickly. Our objective is to have an exposure to the toughest competition,' Mr Richoz says. Charmilles, now part of the Georg Fischer engineering group, has not escaped the ravages of the recession. Precise figures are not revealed, but officials say that after a handsome profit in 1990, the company tumbled into loss in 1991. Last year, its result improved but were still termed 'unsatisfactory'. Employment at the company's factory in the Geneva suburb of Satigny has been cut from 720 to 650, but is now considered to be at a stable level.</p>

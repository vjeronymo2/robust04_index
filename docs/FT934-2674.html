			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Companies welcome sell-offs Companies which supply contract services to public bodies have welcomed last week's announcement that most of the 144 government executive agencies are to be opened to bids from the private sector. Many companies which had bid for contracts from the government under its market-testing programme have become disillusioned with a process which appeared to favour in-house bids from the civil service. The shift in favour of privatising agencies wherever possible will rekindle companies' interest in providing services to the government. So far, only one agency has been privatised - DVOIT, the information-technology arm of the Department of Transport. Three other agencies were identified for privatisation when they were created: the National Engineering Laboratory, Chessington computer centre - which handles much of the civil service payroll - and Adas, the agricultural advisory service. Reviews are under way on privatising the Transport Research Laboratory, Companies House, the Patent Office, the Department of Trade and Industry's Accounting Services Agency and four DTI laboratories. Two companies scanning the list of opportunities with particular interest are Capita and CSL, both management buy-outs from Cipfa, the professional body for public-sector accountants. Both have established businesses supplying white-collar services to local government and the health service, and are keen to expand into central government. Capita, with 1,150 staff, is 'very interested' in acquiring entire agencies, according to Mr Paul Pindar, managing director. The company, which started with consultancy and computer services, now collects council tax and business rates for some councils and pays benefits on their behalf. 'There are some very interesting businesses in central government which could prosper in the private sector,' said Mr Pindar. Capita is also interested in helping management buy-outs in agencies, and has raised a fund of Pounds 100m from venture capitalists. The company is already backing the bid by the management of the DTI's Accounting Services Agency to buy itself out so that it can look for work elsewhere in the public sector. CSL employs about 700 staff supplying revenue collection, exchequer services and general financial management to public bodies. It has recently become part of Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and is keen to win a share of central government business. 'Our stock in trade is taking public servants and turning them into private-sector people with an emphasis on profit, quality and flexibility,' says Mr Dick Turpin, CSL's deputy chairman. Another company with a track record in supplying services to government is Serco, which specialises in defence and security work. Since 1964 it has run the ballistic missile early warning station at Fylingdales on the North Yorkshire moors, providing services from cleaning to systems maintenance. Serco's 9,000 employees now provide services in defence, central government, local government and civil aviation in 29 countries. In the UK they run local authority leisure services, manage Hyde Park in London, maintain speed cameras on main roads and operate defence firing ranges. Mr Richard Nicholls, Serco's marketing director, welcomed last week's initiative to open up the agencies to outside bids. 'This reflects the growing interest internationally from governments which wish to concentrate their efforts and resources on the tasks they best perform.' Agencies such as NHS Estates and the Buying Agency will be of particular interest to Mr Oliver Jones, managing director of Symonds FM, a property management company. His 350 employees currently manage property for companies opening for business in the UK, public-sector organisations and newly privatised utilities. 'Our classic client is a bureaucracy facing change,' he says, 'and there's no bureaucracy like the civil service.'</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Failed bid for leading role in Hollywood ROBERT Maxwell apparently dreamed of becoming a Hollywood mogul and in 1990 made an unsuccessful Dollars 500m bid for Orion Pictures, the now-bankrupt studio best known for releasing Woody Allen's films. According to a former investment bank adviser to Maxwell, the late media tycoon asked Wertheim Schroder, the New York investment bank partly owned by Schroder of the UK, to forward the bid to Mr John Kluge, chairman of Metromedia, the company that owned 70 per cent of Orion. Wertheim Schroder has confirmed that it acted as Maxwell's emissary to explore prospects of a bid of about Dollars 500m for Orion. A spokesperson for Mr Kluge confirmed Maxwell's interest in Orion, but called the discussions 'preliminary' and said they did not result in a firm offer. Last December, a year after the Maxwell bid, Orion filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. Entertainment industry analysts say that had Maxwell succeeded in capturing Orion, the Hollywood company would probably have been forced into bankruptcy anyway, or would now be in the hands of the court-appointed UK administrators of the Maxwell empire. Wertheim Schroder, which handled the Orion matter on a contingency basis, was not paid any fees by Maxwell. The investment bank did receive a payment for its 1990 advice on the sale of Maxwell printing companies to Quebecor, the Canadian printing and publishing group.</p>

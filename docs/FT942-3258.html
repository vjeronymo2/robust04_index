			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hard slog up the bad-debt mountain - Japan's banks claim the worst is over but details suggest otherwise Last month, Japan's banks unveiled their annual results with confident boasts that the worst of the country's bad-debt crisis had past. They congratulated themselves on having disposed of more non-performing loans than they had ever written off before. The figures seemed to support claims that the total of bad debts had peaked. At the 11 leading city banks, outstanding disclosed problem loans fell by more than 3 per cent from September 1993 to the end of March, down to less than 4 per cent of total loans. Most banks spoke boldly of eliminating problem loans within two years. But, on closer inspection, the details suggest the bad debt mountain is a long way from being scaled. Most of the apparent improvement in the banks' performance stems from their disposal of loans to the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Corporation (CCPC), a body set up last year specifically to take over the worst of the bad debts - and the writing-off of loans to that body is not quite what it seems. As an exercise in financial alchemy, the CCPC could not have been bettered. Banks would turn the base metal of their non-performing loans into gold of a sort by selling them to the CCPC at a discount to their full asset value, and book the difference as a loss against their earnings. The value of the loans parked with the CCPC would then be a real, though slightly diminished asset. The CCPC would dispose of the loans, most of them property-related, and collect the collateral. But this alchemy is, in practice, little better than its medieval forerunner. The catch is that the banks have to lend the money to the CCPC in the first place to enable it to buy the loans. The risk of default remains with the bank. If the CCPC is unable to recover what it paid for the loans, the difference is met by the banks. As Mr David Snoddy, banking analyst at Jardine Flemimg in Tokyo, says: 'The CCPC is principally a repricing mechanism, designed to reduce the market's perception of bankruptcy risk in Japan's banks.' If the CCPC were getting rid of the vast numbers of loans it has purchased from the banks at book value, of course, there would be little to worry about. But the latest figures from the corporation, published this week, show that it continues to pile up the base metal, without any real sign of the gold. The banks have been dumping vast quantities of loans on the CCPC. So far it has managed to dispose of just over 1 per cent of them. The failure of the CCPC to liquidate the loans may soon create a problem for the operation of the system itself. Under ministry of finance rules, banks are forbidden from lending more than 20 per cent of their primary capital base to any one lender. Some banks have been so busy passing on loans to the CCPC that they are in danger of breaching that constraint. The finance ministry yesterday denied that there was any immediate threat, but the figures speak for themselves. Banks' primary capital ratios stand at an average of about 5 to 6 per cent. They are attempting to dispose of around 5 per cent of their total loan book as bad loans. That means that only one-fifth of the loans would have to be passed to the CCPC before they started to hit the capital adequacy constraint. It is unlikely that such a situation would provoke a crisis. Before the ratios are breached, the ministry is likely to step in with a solution. One possibility is a 'Son of CCPC', enabling the banks to go on lending in the same way to another, identical institution. In such a way, a whole family of CCPCs could be spawned as the number of loans piles up. The CCPC does have benefits for the banks. But even these have been overstated. Its principal advantage is tax. Normally, banks have to negotiate with the finance ministry on every loan for which they wish to receive approval to post tax-free reserves. The CCPC allows them to receive the tax relief automatic-ally. But, as Mr David Threagold, of BZW in Tokyo, points out, this is not such a huge benefit. 'The banks would still eventually receive the relief on the bad loans once they were finally confirmed as non-performing,' he says. 'All the CCPC allows them to do is to receive the relief immediately.' All this leaves the bank's bad debt problems where they have been for some time. And behind the official figures there are darker problems. The CCPC deals only with loans meant for liquidation. Later this year, the banking authorities will announce new plans for dealing with the vast numbers of loans that do not even currently appear as non-performing - loans that have been 'restructured', where interest rates have been pared to the bone to keep borrowers afloat. Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, estimates that, counting the bulk of the CCPC loans as non-performing, and adding in the undisclosed restructured loans, total problem loans at all Japan's largest banks grew by at least 15 per cent last year. As the pace of economic recovery threatens to be slow, the truth for most banks is that they are still some way from the summit of their bad debt mountain. The next few years promise them a hard slog to the top.</p>

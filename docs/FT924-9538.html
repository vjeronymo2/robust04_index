			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips dip after Clinton's triumph Wall Street THE INITIAL reaction by Wall Street to the first Democratic presidential election victory in 16 years was mixed yesterday, with blue chip share prices ending lower on futures-related program selling but the broader indices putting in a steadier performance, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.44 at 3,223.04, near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 2.81 off at 417.11, but the Dow Transportation Average, a good measure of market sentiment, ended 3.02 higher at 1,360.37. The American SE composite ended down just 0.89 at 381.94 and the Nasdaq composite 0.94 firmer at 605.52. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly substantial at 194.4m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 1,003 to 713. From the opening bell the market struggled to find a direction in the wake of the election result. Prices opened slightly weaker, then rallied 15 Dow points only to drop back into negative territory. The lack of a sustained move either way suggested that the market was unsure about how to respond to a Democrat win. The fact that Mr Clinton's victory looked a certainty in the last few days of the campaign was partly to blame for the absence of a post-election rally. The lack of a strong reaction to the result from bond, currency and overseas markets contributed to the relatively subdued response. Domestic economic concerns were also a factor. The October employment report is to be published tomorrow and investors were nervous about committing funds to the market ahead of the important jobs data. Most of the damage to the Dow was done near the end of the day, when futures-related program selling doubled the Dow's loss in the final half-hour of trading. Among individual sectors, drug companies ran into selling on revived worries that Mr Clinton will introduce controls on pharmaceutical prices. Bristol Myers-Squibb fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 1/8 , Pfizer Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 74 3/8 , Glaxo Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 and Merck Dollars 1 to Dollars 43. Oil issues continued to lose ground, undermined by falling crude oil prices and brokers' downgrades. British Petroleum was hurt most severely, dropping Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , while Chevron shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 67 1/2 and Texaco Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 . On the Nasdaq market, McCaw rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 in turnover of 2.4m shares, on speculation that a possible merger or big investment deal with AT&amp;T was near. Trading was subsequently suspended for the announcement that AT&amp;T was to spend Dollars 3.8bn on a 33 per cent stake in McCaw. AT&amp;T slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 before being suspended. Canada TORONTO stocks ended lower for the second consecutive day in continued active trading. The TSE 300 index declined 16.8 to 3,344.8 and falls led advances by 304 to 238 after volume of 32.3m shares. Air Canada, off 2 cents at CDollars 2.88, reported a third-quarter loss, against a year-earlier net profit. Quebecor said its third-quarter earnings rose to 27 cents from 13 cents and increased the semi-annual dividend on its 'A' and 'B' shares. The 'B' stock put on CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 16 1/2 .</p>

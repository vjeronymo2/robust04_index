			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Allied London in the red after provision An exceptional provision of Pounds 8m, made to reflect the depressed state of the housing market, left Allied London Properties, the housebuilder and property investor, Pounds 5.35m in the red for the six months to December 31. Comparable pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.87m. The commercial property investment portfolio produced a 'creditable performance' according to Sir Geoffrey Leigh, chairman, with rental income 19 per cent ahead to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.1m) mainly due to rent reviews settled at 'satisfactory levels'. Losses per share amounted to 9.43p (earnings 2.5p) but the interim dividend is held at 1.075p.</p>

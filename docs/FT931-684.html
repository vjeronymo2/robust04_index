			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Bosnian aid arrives as truce takes hold A CEASEFIRE from noon yesterday agreed by Bosnia's three warring parties appeared to be holding last night, as a long-delayed United Nations relief convoy reached a besieged town in eastern Bosnia. On Saturday the convoy, destined for Srebrenica where 60,000 people are desperate for food and medical aid, was stopped from crossing into Bosnia by local Serbs. This was in spite of an undertaking by General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander. Hopes rose yesterday that it would at last get through when it was given clearance by the Bosnian Serbs at the border town of Mali Zvornik, and its arrival at Srebrenica was reported by the UN last night. The uncertain situation on the ground was matched by the equally fragile state of the peace negotiations in New York, following the signature last week of important elements of the internationally brokered peace plan by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president. Mr Izetbegovic said at the weekend that the Bosnian Serbs - the only ones not to have signed the plan put forward by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen - had between 10 and 15 days to endorse it. If they did not accept it by that deadline, he would consider his own signature invalid. However, Lord Owen said in a US television interview yesterday that a 10 to 15-day deadline was 'too early' to secure the Bosnian Serbs' signature. Mr Izetbegovic had not mentioned such an ultimatum to him when he signed the agreement in New York last week. It is nevertheless possible that the Bosnian Serbs will give their verdict within a short time. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the parliament of his self-styled republic would vote on the Vance-Owen plan within the next 10 days. Meanwhile, France has become the first country to join the US operation to parachute relief supplies to besieged towns in eastern Bosnia, which land convoys have been unable to reach. A French C-160 cargo aircraft accompanied four US cargo aircraft on Saturday night to drop 30 tonnes of food and 600 kg of medical supplies to the mainly Moslem inhabitants of Gorazde. But Germany, which had intended to join the US relief flights several days ago, has remained on the sidelines, following a threat by the Bosnian Serbs to shoot down aircraft of any flights in which Germans participated. The Bosnian Serbs are still bitter about Germany's occupation of Yugoslavia during the second world war, and also blame Bonn for what they consider the European Community's premature recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, thus precipitating the break-up of Yugoslavia.</p>

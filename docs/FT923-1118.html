			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported a dull session in the derivatives market, with turnover in both Footsie futures and traded options returning to poor levels, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the FT-SE futures contract for December delivery opened strongly at 2,641 and early buying reported to have come from Strauss Turnbull and Salomon soon helped the contract advance to 2,656 by mid-morning, with early strength in gilts also boosting sentiment. However, this proved to be the high of the day after buying interest dried up, leaving the contract to gently drift lower over the middle part of the trading session. In the afternoon, the lack of buyers coupled with the poor opening on Wall Street saw December fall to the day's low of 2,610, although a squeeze towards the close ensured a strong finish. December closed at 2,638, around 22 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 40. Traded options were marked by a lack of business and turnover reached 26,889 lots, well below the markets's break-even level of 30,000 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 8,877 contracts, while among the stock options, HSBC recorded the day's highest total at 1,280 contracts.</p>

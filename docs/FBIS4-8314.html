			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- "Launching air strikes to  resolve the Bosnian conflict may have unpredictable negative  consequences for the national security of Bulgaria," it is said  in a statement by Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National  Assembly Committee on National Security, which was made public  at the committee's news conference today. "Similar actions  could have expanded and internationalized the armed conflict,  they could have led to a confrontation between the great powers  in an extremely risky way, they could have turned the  international community from a part of the mechanism regulating  the conflict into a part of the problem itself; there still is  such a danger," the statement says. According to Mr. Slatinski,  "there is also the danger of the great powers learning to  cleanse themselves from their sins, inaction, contradictions and  impotence by air strikes".    In the view of the National Security Committee chairman,  there is yet another reason for serious concern about the  developments in the Balkans: the fate of the Bulgarian minority  on the territory of Eastern Serbia, which once belonged to  Bulgaria but "were detached from it by great powers in an  utterly unjust and cynical way under the Treaty of Neuilly in  1919".    "Bulgaria has taken the heaviest losses as a result of the  strict application of sanctions against ex-Yugoslavia," Mr.  Slatinski said at today's news conference. "The international  community should clearly state that after the settlement of the  conflict, Bulgaria will be given the right to participate in  rebuilding the countries in ex-Yugoslavia under preferential  terms," he pointed out. "Given the colossal losses suffered by  non-embargoed countries, no doubt the lack of compensations will  discredit sanctions as the most important instrument of the  United Nations," Mr. Slatinski says in his statement circulated  today. "To right a wrong by doing another wrong undermines the  efforts of the world community and makes them pointless," Mr.  Slatinski's statement reads.    "While Europe continues to distance itself from the Balkans,  a process of nuclear buildup is going on in the region; NATO has  not stopped guarding itself against threats and risks... Today  our neighbours are on friendly terms with us, but what about  tomorrow?", is Mr. Slatinski's question. "We need mechanisms of  control, confidence building, protection and easing tensions,"  it is said in his statement.    In Mr. Slatinski's opinion, Bulgaria stands a chance of  becoming a factor in the region.    "Bulgaria's primary national interest is its non-involvement  in the military conflict in the region," the chairman of the  Parliamentary National Security Committee said. "But who can  guarantee that Bulgaria will assume the role of a passive  observer if the developments in the Balkans take a turn for the  worse and its national security and national interests are  directly threatened?" Mr. Slatinski says in his statement.</p>

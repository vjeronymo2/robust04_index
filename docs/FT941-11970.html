			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: African producers set cobalt 'reference' price The sharp rise in the free market price of cobalt - it has doubled since December to about Dollars 22 a pound - has caused Zambia and Zaire, the two biggest western producers, to back away from setting a producer price for the metal. Instead they have set a 'reference' price of Dollars 18 for the next three months. unchanged from their previous producer price. Some traders suggested yesterday that consumers would be lucky to obtain high-grade cobalt - a hard metal used in superalloys in such things as cutting tools, high-strength magnets andjet engines, as a powder in catalysts for the oil and man-made fibre industriesand in radial tyres - at the reference price. The producers would probably charge a premium for better-quality material, they said. On the other hand, some consumers thought the recent sharp price rise had more to do with trader 'hype' than any fundamental shortage of metal. 'The traders were determined to push the price up to Dollars 30 before letting it fall back,' said one. However, statistics from the Cobalt Development Institute, whose members produce about 97 per cent of western world cobalt, suggest the market was about in balance last year. A fall from about 18,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes in western cobalt production was probably compensated for by an increase in imports from Russia and by stocks left over from late-1992 production. Meanwhile, demand is estimated by the institute to have remained at about 19,000 tonnes. This year, the CDI suggests, demand is likely to remain stable while western production may fall again. Even if Russian exports remain at about 2,000 tonnes and the US authorities go ahead with the planned release of another 2,500 tonnes from their strategic stockpile, supply will do well to keep up with demand.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: Tecs are attracting skilled women back to workforce Sir, May I correct an impression in your article 'EOC says women overlooked by Tecs' (March 31), which implied that training and enterprise councils had made no impression on women's training opportunities. The EOC report actually draws particular attention to the success of a number of Tecs, notably Tyneside, Birmingham, North West Wales and Hertfordshire, in attracting skilled women back into the workforce. This is the kind of programme that we would like to see all Tecs taking up. What unfortunately is still continuous is the stereotyping of occupations and, in consequence, of training opportunities, which holds women back from taking up careers in areas non-traditional for their sex. It is in this context that the phrase 'not one jot of difference' was reported. Segregation of jobs by sex is deep-rooted and to counteract it will take a great deal of political will and effort. This is why our report calls for a strong initiative from government to encourage Tecs to translate their very good policies into innovative practices.

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brandon Hire returns to dividend list despite loss Brandon Hire, which hires power tools, catering equipment and marquees, resumed dividend payments in spite of a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12,000 for the year to end April, compared with a Pounds 14,000 deficit last time. A final dividend of 1.5p is payable from earnings, enhanced by a tax credit, of 0.63p (0.44p) per share. Losses were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 200,000 against four unsettled claims arising from the provisional liquidation of the company's insurers. The provision was included in increased administrative expenses of Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 2.77m). Turnover was ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 4.54m (Pounds 3.87m), with a 28 per cent improvement in the second half after a poor start. The USM-quoted company is to seek a full listing and will change its April year end to December.</p>

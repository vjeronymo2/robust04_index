President Mugabe was addressing the  Zimbabweans at Zimbabwe's High Commission in Gaborone last night.    He told them that his government does not see them as  traitors for leaving Zimbabwe for Botswana, but expressed the  hope that when they ultimately return home they will be able to  take with them their experiences to develop Zimbabwe. He also  briefed his audience on a wide range of issues, ranging from his  state visit to Botswana to the economic situation in Zimbabwe  under the structural adjustment program which ends next year.    He said his visit to Botswana is in the spirit of  cooperation  between the two countries to strengthen bilateral relations and  increase the volume of trade between them. President Mugabe  assured the meeting that the structural adjustment program was  yielding better benefits for the country, adding that more  investors are now coming into the country as a result of the  program. President Mugabe will address a press conference at  the Sir Seretse Khama Airport shortly before leaving for home.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received the news that Gyula Horn has  been involved in an accident. Peter Juhasz reports:    [Juhasz] Not long after 2100, Gyula Horn, chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP], who was on his way home after  his end of campaign mass rally in Miskolc, has been in an  accident.    Details are not known thus far. All I managed to find out a  few minutes ago was that Gyula Horn's car crashed into a truck  that did not have its lights on while passing on the No. 3 main  trunk road between Nyekladhaza and Emoed. Three people were  injured in the crash, including the party chairman. How and to  what extent are not yet known.    Anyway, preparations have already been made at the trauma  department of the Miskolc Iron Works Hospital to receive the  injured.</p>

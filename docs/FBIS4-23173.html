			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 30 SAPA -- A government delegation  including Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and  Defence Minister Joe Modise visited KwaZulu/Natal on Monday [30  May] to investigate the state of emergency and maintenance of  safety and security in the province. A statement issued by Mr  Mufamadi said the delegation, which included legal adviser to  the state president's office Prof Fink Haysom, held discussions  in Durban with the South African Police Services, the South  African National Defence Force and local peace structure  leaders. "As a result of these discussions, certain  recommendations regarding the emergency and the general  maintenance of safety and security in the province will be made  to the cabinet soon", the statement said.    A state of emergency was declared in the region ahead of the  April election to ensure free and fair polling.    Monday's visit came a day after six partygoers were  massacred  in the Midlands. Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said the six  were killed at about 3.30PM in Gulube location, mid-Illovo,  about 100km north-west of Durban in the Umbumbulu area. "We  believe the motive for the killing was related to faction  fighting in the Umbumbulu area," Maj Naidoo said.    Police were investigating a possible link between the  slaying  and the weekend murder of Mr Jabulani Mnyandi, 24, also in  Gulube. The names of the six killed are Mfayo Ndlovu, Mzayisini  Ndlovu, Mtholoselwa Ndlovu, Gizi Luthuli, Eric Luthuli and  Msongelwa Mgcongo. The deaths bring to 28 the number killed in  violence in KwaZulu/Natal at the weekend, more than half of them  on the north coast. Among those killed were four people slain  in the Matholamnyama area, north of Durban, early on Saturday in  an attack by the Maqadini tribe. Spent cartridges from  automatic weapons were found at the scene. Police attributed  the killings to a faction fight.    Murders were also reported from the north coast areas of  Ubombo, KwaMbonambi, Mtubatuba, Esikhawini, Nyoni, Stanger and  Umhlali. There were also killings in Durban and its surrounding  townships of KwaMashu, Ntuzuma, Umlazi, and KwaMakutha on the  south coast.    Mr Mufamadi said although there had been a general drop in  violence countrywide, the situation in KwaZulu/Natal was "far  from normal". He urged all political organisations and their  leaders to co-operate fully to normalise the situation in the  province.    On the role of security forces, Mr Mufamadi said: "I wish to  make it perfectly clear that, to be effective, policing must be  implemented without fear or favour. Furthermore, in the  execution of their duty, it is expected that the security forces  will maintain the highest possible standard of impartiality".    He said for normality to return to KwaZulu/Natal it was  essential that all its citizens -- regardless of their political  affiliations -- have confidence in the new SAPS.    Another issue raised during discussions was the perception  that perpetrators of violence went unpunished. "Therefore, an  indispensable condition for normalising the situation in the  province was effective policing", the statement said.</p>

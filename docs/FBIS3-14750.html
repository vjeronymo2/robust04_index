Georgia's authorities explain the  standstill of traffic by an accident at the Gardabani power  station. Of course, this is a more than objective reason. But,  after all, in the Georgian ports of Batumi and Poti cargo  intended for Armenia, including food such as flour, oil, sugar,  are traditionally unloaded.    A meeting between Georgia's Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia,  who has arrived in Armenia, and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan  and Premier Grant Bagratyan, was devoted to the question of the  normalization of the operation of the railway and the transit  supply of Turkmenian gas across Georgia to Armenia. President  Levon Ter-Petrosyan also told representatives of the diplomatic  corps accredited in Yerevan of the difficult situation which has  arisen in Armenia because of the traffic on the southern section  of the Georgian Railway grinding to a halt. Touching on this  meeting, Vahan Papazyan, the republic's Foreign Minister, stated  at the latest briefing: I don't think that the meeting with the  diplomats will produce immediate results, but something will be  done, because it is not advantageous to any of the countries  whose representatives attended the meeting for there to be an  unstable situation in Armenia and Georgia. The Minister also  said, and I am now quoting from the "Armenian Republic"  newspaper: Georgia, availing itself of its convenient geographic  situation, is bringing pressure to bear on Armenia. In turn,  other neighbors of ours are pressuring Georgia into bringing  pressure to bear on Armenia. But, thanks to the fact that we  have a positive balance with Turkmenistan -- and that to date we  should be receiving 12 million cubic meters of natural gas per  24 hours -- Armenia agrees to sell half of its gas to Georgia so  that it take upon itself the delivery of cargo from the ports of  Poti and Batumi to our country. Georgia proved unprepared for  this proposal of ours, and Patsatsia has returned to Georgia for  consultations.    It is difficult to say how long these consultations will  last, but one thing is clear: Without a railway link with the  outer world Armenia will find it exceedingly difficult to live.</p>

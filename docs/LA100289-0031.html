			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> L.A. BAROQUE ORCHESTRA OPENS FOURTH SEASON  </P> <P> The intrepid Gregory Maldonado and his band of antiquarians, the Los Angeles  Baroque Orchestra, opened their fourth season on Friday at St. Paul's Lutheran  Church in Santa Monica with an overly ambitious program of 17th- and  18th-Century instrumental music for the theaters of London and Paris.  </P> <P> The strain imposed by the evening's length and the jungle heat of St. Paul's  ultimately savaged the violins' gut strings, the oboes' intonation and the  players' concentration in what had begun as a noble, stylish performance of a  26-movement(!) suite from Rameau's opera "Les Indes Galantes."  </P> <P> The concert began promisingly. The orchestra, 20 strong and led, as ever, from  the concertmaster's chair by Maldonado, quickly settled into a characterful  suite from Thomas Arne's "The Judgement of Paris" with execution that was, for  the most part, energetic and orderly.  </P> <P> A hyper-extended sequence of snippets from Lully's "Bourgeois Gentilhomme"  needed rhythmic tightening and, perhaps, even (blasphemy!) a two-handed  conductor. But there were rewards in the neatly turned violin duet of Maldonado  and Jolianne von Einem, the ethereal tones coaxed by Stephen Schultz from his  keyless (wooden) transverse flute, and Edward Murray's imaginatively realized  harpsichord continuo.  </P> <P> Ultimately, however, the evening belonged to Purcell and the grand airs from  his "King Arthur" -- a welcome, robust antidote to the French composers'  incessant gracefulness.  </P> <P> Purcell, too, was accorded the most consistent playing of the evening: firm in  ensemble and intonation, broad, even sentimental, in the sublime "Bright Nymphs  of Britain" melody and the "Symphony," with its haunting violin  arabesques.HERBERT GLASS  </P></p>

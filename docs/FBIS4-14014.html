			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the </F> Palestinian negotiating delegation: "What Should We Do?"]    [Text] Pondering the current state of the Palestinians,  which is characterized by frustration and limbo, one feels pain  and sorrow. The national movement is divided, and the peace  process has lost its credibility. Among all the factions there  have been various views and conflicting efforts. As a result,  the urgent question keeps popping up: What should we do?    Neither I, nor anyone else can answer this question. I  believe there can be no answer to it, except through a unified  Palestinian stand capable of making a decision that can win the  respect and commitment of the entire Palestinian people.    I beg the readers pardon for reiterating already well-known  details. But the sequence of events and their relationships  need to be repeated in order to clarify the truth and make it  possible to grope for a way out of our crucial situation.    The Palestinian struggle has, from the outset, taken upon  itself to defend the right of the Palestinians to  self-determination and to an independent state. Later, after  the emergence of the refugee problem it became necessary to  defend their rights as stipulated in the UN resolutions.  Despite the human and material sacrifices of the Palestinian  people over three-quarters of a century, it has been affected  with consecutive setbacks. There is no need to go over the  reasons, but they should not be totally ignored either.    The intifada erupted in Gaza, the West Bank and East  Jerusalem as conclusive evidence that the Palestinian masses,  driven by conscience categorically and definitively, reject  occupation. Moreover, they will never relinquish their declared  national rights which they express on every possible occasion.  Despite the violence, Israel confronted it with a fierce type  of bloody repression and measures that are incompatible with  international norms and the principles of human rights. The  world knows all that. There is no need to repeat it.    The Palestinian National Council, out of political  pragmatism  and desire to put an end to the warring and bloodshed in the  Middle East, through concessions and flexibility unprecedented  in the history of peoples fighting for their rights, adopted a  peace initiative accepting the principle of two states on Nov.  15, 1988. The principle is based on UN Resolution 181 as a basis  for negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis under  the UN's auspices with the aim of reaching a just and enduring  peace in the region.    Israel rejected this initiative outright, heaping  incriminations and definitions upon the Palestinians. The  United States, Israel's staunchest supporter, ignored it  claiming it was insufficient. Thus, the real opportunity for  peace in the Middle East was missed.    The Israeli refusal was neither surprising nor totally  strange. For the dimensions and conditions of the Israeli  approach in the occupied territories have emphasized that Israel  has a claim to the area, partially or totally. It has clearly  demonstrated such an attitude by employing a policy of land  seizure, the establishment of settlements, the annexation of  East Jerusalem and expanding its area with complete disregard to  the Security Council's resolutions, condemning such measures and  asserting that they contravene international laws and norms, as  well as the principles of human rights. Such policy was also  condemned by the whole world as being difficult obstacles on the  way to a just and lasting peace in the region.    The Gulf crisis that started with Iraq's occupation of  Kuwait and America's devastating aggression against Iraq under  the banner of Security Council resolutions shed light anew on  the Palestinian problem as an issue of occupation that has been  going on for so long that it cannot be ignored. The United  States proposed a peace process for the Middle East on the basis  of UN resolutions 242 and 338. The nations of the world and the  Arab states surrounding Israel responded to the proposal. The  Palestinian side also responded to it, despite the Israelis'  provocations, in order to prove its true desire for peace.    The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations faltered at an early  stage because of Israel's insistence on continuing settlement,  and its refusal to talk about the status of East Jerusalem, as  well as its insistence on stripping the Palestinian government  during the transitional period of any real powers. In brief,  the Israeli attitude aimed at legitimizing what Israel has  illegally established in the Palestinian occupied territories,  including Jerusalem. The implication of all that was to  obstruct the road to the possibility of establishing an  independent Palestinian state as a result of the final  negotiations. Israel aimed at emphasizing the stability of its  dominance on all the occupied territories, that is the whole of  Palestine within its natural borders.    The Palestinian side rejected this attitude because we have  not participated in the negotiations to bargain on the  Palestinians right to self-determination. That was the core of  the negotiating crisis.    The US sponsor did nothing to put things in order in  accordance with the peace reference "Resolution 242," which  stipulates the inadmissibility of acquiring land by force, and  the withdrawal from the occupied territories in the context of  the peace accord. The US approach has revealed a supportive  stand to the Israeli ambitions. Though this position was  expected from the beginning, yet it become crystal clear during  the ninth and tenth rounds. It became useless to continue with  the negotiations. The negotiating team deemed it fit to suspend  negotiations so as to have an opportunity to reconsider and  reassess the situation in order to reach a clear and precise  decision around which the Palestinian people could rally.    In the midst of all this, everyone was surprised by the  Declaration of Principles, which was presented to the  Palestinians as substantial accomplishment that would pave the  way for achieving our national goals as well as realizing a just  peace. The accord was approved by the Executive Committee and  the Central Council with considerable reservations and a demand  to implement its term in a way that is consistent in harmony  with our national rights.    The accord has many loopholes:    1. It does not challenge the Israeli claims to the occupied  territories. Israel expressed such a claim by usurping land,  establishing settlements and annexing East Jerusalem, in  addition to the measures taken in support of this claim and in  flagrant violation of all international laws and norms. It is  worth mentioning here that the accord is void of any request for  Israel to halt settlements or to allow it to continue with them.    2. This non-challenging attitude to Israel's claim implied  acceptance of a separate Israeli presence in the occupied  territories, the settlements and settlers, with their separate  legal and administrative systems whose point of reference is the  Israeli state. This complete acquiescence in the Israeli claim.  [sentence as published]    3. Many of the terms of the accord are open to several  interpretations. This rendered the current negotiations  extremely difficult to implement and paved the way for imposing  the Israeli point of view.    The danger of what is going on now lies in the fact that the  Palestinian side has not raised the issues of continued  settlement, the establishment of new settlements, the expansion  of the existing ones and the establishment of infrastructures  for the benefit of the settlements, especially when the UN  resolutions and international consensus emphasize that  settlement is illegal and constitutes obstacles on the way of  achieving a just and consistent peace.    Continuing in the current mode of negotiations but heeding  the views of opposition, which are raised daily, causes the  deepest concern and wonder. [sentence as published] I don't  think the leadership is aware of this grave situation.    I think we are at an emerging national juncture that makes  it  imperative upon all nationalist forces to join together to  review the situation and reach a decision that might win the  confidence and support of all the Palestinians, wherever they  might be.</p>

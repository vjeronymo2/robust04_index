			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Observer: Balkan Wisdom And finally, some good news for Albania - the British comic actor Norman Wisdom, now 77, has announced that he is returning to films and hopes to make some wacky television situation comedies. One of the more startling things Observer discovered in travelling to Albania before the collapse of communism was that Norman Wisdom was a national comic hero, thanks to the Albanian state television being unable to afford much else. Lucky old Albania.</p>

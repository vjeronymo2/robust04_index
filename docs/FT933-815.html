			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: LVMH may expand media side LVMH, the French company which is one the world's largest luxury goods groups, may expand its media interests by making further investments in French newspapers. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, said the group was 'ready to examine other opportunities' having recently ventured into the newspaper field by buying La Tribune Desfosses, the financial daily. The chairman said that it would take 'between three and five years' to bring the loss-making La Tribune to a satisfactory level of profitability. However, he said the group was ready 'to play its part in ensuring that the French press stayed in French hands'. LVMH is under pressure in its traditional luxury market, particularly in its champagne and cognac businesses. The group has warned that net profits might fall in 1993 following a 28 per cent decline in profits to FFr935m during the first half of the year. Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, has announced that its FFr2.7bn share and warrants issue was around three times oversubscribed. The company issued 6.2m shares at FFr434 each.</p>

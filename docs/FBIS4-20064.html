			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The date for Spain's official membership of the  European Army is now known; it will be 5 May. Defense Minister  Garcia Vargas announced this today to the congress defense  committee. The government will also study the possibility of  increasing by one brigade to a division -- some 12,000 soldiers  -- Spain's contribution to what has been called the Euroarmy.    [Correspondent R. Martinez Durban] Spain is the fourth  country, following France, Germany, and Belgium, to form part of  the armed wing of the WEU [Western European Union]. It already  has some 50,000 men. Spain will initially join with the 3,400  soldiers of the Cerro Muriano mechanized brigade in Cordoba.    Garcia Vargas also revealed that a low-powered ground-to-air  SAM-7 missile from the Serb sector hit the fuselage of a Spanish  Aviocar on 8 March as it was flying in Croatian air space.

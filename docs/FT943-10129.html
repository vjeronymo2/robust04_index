			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Gardening: The flower of France Unless it continues to rain for a fortnight, I might as well have been gardening this summer in France. Outsiders would never agree, because they only see the difficulties. In France, lawns are impossible. Hired gardeners do odd things to clematis. French nurseries are supposed to sell none of the things which we all like in Britain. A hundred years ago, French breeders were raising most of the shrubs which we all scramble to grow nowadays: is there really no good nursery, I have been asking myself, between Dieppe and Nice? In English folklore, expatriates have to take their plants with them. A few bushes of lavender may turn up in a local market; you might hit on a specialist grower of one variety for the makers of women's scents; otherwise, it is back to Hilliers, of Hampshire (tel: 0794-368733) no longer with an export licence since the EC rules relaxed for imports from approved nurseries last year. As often, expatriates are doing their new home down. I picture some of you, travelling or sweating in France this month, and I hope you will enjoy my sharing of addresses and nurseries which seem to be completely unknown to most of my fellow gardeners. I owe them to the essential starting-point for ambitious gardeners in France: next May, go to the amiable flower-show at Courson near Paris, publicised at the Domaine de Courson, 91680 Courson Monteloup. The organisers, Patrice and Helene Furstier, described to me how even they did not know what to expect when they first advertised for exhibitors. The Courson show has drawn little-known nurseries from overlooked addresses and, with their help, I have weeded out a selection of the best throughout France. The English myth is that only the English are growing the old-fashioned roses of France. I now see that this is untrue. At Domaine de la Plaine, Chamagnieu, 38460 Cremieu, in the Rhone-Alps region, Jean Pierre Guillot quietly presides over a family nursery of roses, founded in 1829 when our own Peter Beales was doing something else. The Guillot family claims credit for rescuing old Bourbon roses which English gardens cherish. Their old-fashioned catalogue is charming: it lists old roses of France for gardeners who live there. Alternatively, try Andre Eve of Morailles, 45300 Pithiviers-le-Vieil, especially for ramblers and climbers, and the remarkable Roseraie de Berty, 07110 Largentiere. This organic nursery lies in the wild scenery of Ardeche and has banned pesticides and weedkillers. The owners reckon to grow 400 varieties without black spot, refuting lazy emigrants, who try to tell you that healthy roses will no longer grow in France. What about the 'Dame aux Camellias' and the glorious range of camellias which were sold in Paris during the 19th century? The trade has shrunk, but in Aquitaine, at the Chateau de Gaujacq, 40330 Gaujacq, Jean Thoby still lists hundreds of varieties along with hostas, pieris and the types of shrub which expatriates remember in Cornwall. French lilacs and deutzias also used to be famous, but some of them survive in the good list of Maurice Laurent at Les Granges, 69560 St Romain en Gal: he is also great with viburnums, honeysuckle and orange blossom. As for irises, their natural companions, you can buy enough to satisfy anyone by applying to Richard Cayeux, La Carcaudiere, 45500 Poilly-lez-Gien whose family has been growing and breeding these plants since 1892. To most of us, French summers mean drought. French nurserymen are much more aware of the possibilities than English visitors: before you give up, try the list and knowledge of Dino Pellizarro at 290 Chemin de Leouse, 06220 Vallauris in Provence. Match him with the intelligent list of a former journalist, Thierry Denis, at Le Barillet, 581070 Savigny Poil Fol, in Burgundy, who specialises in plants with a history and the ability to survive in extreme climates. My personal favourite is a great grower of salvias glimpsed at English shows: Pepiniere de la Foux, at Chemin de la Foux, 83220 Le Pradet, in Provence. It lists more than 100 salvias - without the awful red variety which we all know in French public parks. I am also impressed by the fine catalogue of the Filippis, two botanists who specialise in plants for dry and difficult places at Route Nationale 113, 34140 Meze, in Languedoc. Near the channel, the challenge is different and many good nurseries reflect it, of which I would single out Martine Lemonnier at Beaumont-le-Hareng, 76850 Bosc-le-Hard. Amazingly, it sells and grows more than 30 varieties of blue Himalayan poppy. They will direct you to other local experts, but I would like to put in a good word for Paris. There, you can buy the latest blue Corydalis and hellebores from the aptly-named Ellebore at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Bois-de-Boulogne, Paris 75116. Although English residents seldom realise it, French style would not be French without the world of fantasy: the yearly prizewinners at Courson are Jardins Imaginaires, which may be as far as most of you wish to go at 9 Rue d'Assas, 75006 Paris. For range, advice, and innovation, which is the best general bet? Unanimously, the experts refer me to Luc-Andre Lepage, at La Fontaine, Chemin des Perrins, 49130 Les Ponts de Ce in the Loire. Two years ago, almost every one of these established nurseries was unknown to me and I have never seen references to them in any English books or endless magazine articles. The compost may still be spread very thin across the country. But it is quite untrue that good nurseries no longer germinate in France or retain their old roots. As always, it pays to hunt with the professionals: I hope that my list of addresses directs you to an unexpected opening for that friend, home or holiday across the Channel.</p>

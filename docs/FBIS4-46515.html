Commission  Chairman V. Lemish and its members--People's Deputies of  Ukraine--exchanged ideas and summarized its legislative work  over the last three years.    The commission, created by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine in  April of 1991, was able to work out a sound legal foundation for  the creation of mechanisms for the practical resolution of  questions in the military sphere, the building of Ukraine's own  armed forces and other military formations, and to provide for  state security. The commission brought into development some 23  laws of Ukraine and 47 decrees of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine  on fundamental issues in the military sphere and state security,  as well as 11 decrees and eight edicts of the Presidium of the  Supreme Soviet of Ukraine and nine directives of the Chairman of  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine.    The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on 11 October 1991 approved  the  conceptual framework for defense and the organizational  development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that was submitted by  the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Commission of the  Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on Issues of Defense and State  Security, as well as the decree "The Creation of the Defense  Council of Ukraine."    The laws of Ukraine "The Defense of Ukraine," "The Armed  Forces of Ukraine," "The National Guard of Ukraine," "The State  Border of Ukraine," "The Border Troops of Ukraine," "Universal  Military Obligation and Military Service," "Mobilization  Training and Mobilization," "Social and Legal Protections for  Servicemen and the Members of Their Families" and "Pension  Support for Servicemen and Individuals and Supervisory and  Regular Personnel of Bodies of Internal Affairs," as well as the  decrees of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on the procedure for  the entry into force of those laws, were developed, prepared and  adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine proceeding from the  conceptual framework for defense and the organizational  development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.    The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine also adopted the law "The  Civil  Defense of Ukraine."    The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has approved the text of the  Military Oath, the Statute on the Duties and Rights of Personnel  in the National Guard of Ukraine, the size of the Border Troops,  and the Statute on the Procedure for Manpower Acquisition for  the military, logistical and financial support of the National  Guard of Ukraine and the Border Troops of Ukraine.    The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine approved in October 1993 the  Military Doctrine of Ukraine and defined its principal aspects,  as well as approving the overall structure, size, weaponry and  logistical support for the armed forces.    The participants in the parting session of the commission  thus pass along to their successors--the newly elected People's  Deputies of Ukraine--a full-fledged package of legislation on  issues in the military sphere and state security, with a sense  of duties fulfilled and wishes for success in the continuation  of this work with regard to its improvement.</p>

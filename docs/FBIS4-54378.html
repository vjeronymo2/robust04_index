			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report, in his recent television  program, U.S. Vice President Gore has made an absurd remark by  saying that continuing talks with North Korea is dangerous, and  that the steps taken by the United States to strengthen security  for South Korea is wise. This is a challenging remark to create  obstacles to resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula, as well as to further lead the situation of the  Korean peninsula to the crisis situation. [chongseul  wigisanghanguro]    Judging from the open remarks made by U.S. hardline  conservative forces indicating that continuing talks with the  DPRK is dangerous, they are not interested in resolving the  nuclear issue, but rather plot to isolate and crush [apsal] us  by force. The U.S. hardline conservative forces' pursuing its  unchanged policy of crushing Korea and of regarding it as an  enemy has been well disclosed in the open remarks made by U.S.  Senator McCain, at the Senate on 24 May demanding that the  United States execute a policy of force [wanryok chongchaek],  such as carrying out an air raid on the North Korean nuclear  facility or attacking it with cruise missiles. Such violent  remarks by the U.S. hardline conservative forces regarding war  can never be forgiven because their remarks are very dangerous  ones that make it possible to bring about an unpredictable  situation [yechuhalsuopnun satae] on the Korean peninsula.</p>

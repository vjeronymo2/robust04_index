			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: Guardez loo And now, a cautionary tale on the perils of covetousness. A man who dropped his wallet down the lavatory of a French TGV train on Sunday plunged his hand in after it and got stuck. Sounding the alarm, he succeeded in stopping the train at a remote station where firemen cut him, and the lavatory, free. He got his wallet back, but not before appearing on television lying on the platform with a toilet wrapped around his arm. Moral: if you must make a fool of yourself, sign up the television rights first.</p>

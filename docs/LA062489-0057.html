			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC CHIEF BACKS EARLIER CALIF. PRIMARY  </P> <P> Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown on Friday endorsed the campaign to move  up the date of the 1992 California presidential primary.  </P> <P> "It is a good idea. I look on it favorably," Brown said at a breakfast meeting  with Southern California reporters.  </P> <P> California votes at the tail end of the primary election season, and not since  1972 has it played a truly pivotal role in the outcome of a contested primary.  In 1988, the state and its concerns had become all but irrelevant in the  primary campaigns. The nominees were already determined by the time  Californians went to the polls, and there was hardly any debate over matters of  particular interest to the state -- everything from immigration to federal  water projects.  </P> <P> Local leaders of both parties came away from that perfunctory June primary vote  expressing alarm about just how unfamiliar George Bush and Michael Dukakis were  with the geography and political cross-currents of California.  </P> <P> Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who previously opposed any rescheduling of  the primary, suddenly changed course after the 1988 primary and said the state  needed to strengthen its hand.  </P> <P> Now pending in the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee is bipartisan  legislation to position California in the thick of things next election by  advancing the date of the primary from the first Tuesday in June to the first  Tuesday in March. That would put the state just after the Iowa caucuses and the  New Hampshire primary, and before the consolidated Super Tuesday election of  Southern states, providing everyone else keeps to the 1988 timetable.  </P> <P> "It takes some of the emphasis off the early primary states," Brown said about  moving California ahead in the queue. "These candidates who have been spending  130 days in Iowa, for example, will have to spend a lot of their time in  California. And some can argue that since California is much more important in  electing a President, you ought to pay more attention to California early."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) is the author of the pending legislation to  move up the primary. He said it was a matter of increasing California's voice  on issues ranging from transportation to air pollution to immigration.  </P> <P> Costa said he could count on overpowering leadership support to move the  proposal through the Assembly. But in the Senate, President Pro Tem David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) continues to express reservations.  </P> <P> Roberti is concerned about how a March primary would affect Legislative races.  </P> <P> "He thinks it would add to the cost of campaigns, since there would be a longer  period before the general election. And he is worried that voters already  turned off will be further turned off by a still longer campaign," spokesman  Robert Forsythe said.  </P> <P> Forsythe added, however, "He is not at this point committed to stopping this on  his own."  </P> <P> Costa indicated that he might be willing to compromise and split the  difference, moving the primary from June to the second Tuesday in April in  consolidation with municipal elections in some communities.  </P> <P> Brown was in California for a Democratic Party finance meeting and to venture  into the lion's den by opening a party office in heavily Republican Orange  County.  </P></p>

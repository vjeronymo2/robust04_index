			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs; date not given]    [Text] Armenia's armed aggression against Azerbaijan  continues to bring misfortunes to the Republic's people. The  recent intensification of the aggression is yet another  confirmation of Armenia's [words indistinct].    Armenia is making an effort to occupy new areas in  Azerbaijan  in total disregard of the peaceful initiatives made by several  international organizations and foreign countries. Massing  reinforcements and heavy military hardware, the Armenian Armed  Forces intensely shelled Azerbaijan's Kazakhskiy, Tauzskiy, and  Akstafa Rayons and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's Sadarak  Rayon with rocket launchers and artillery units during the past  few days. The wave of shelling began on 26 December. More  than 100 Grad rockets and (?artillery shells) fell on  Azerbaijan's peaceful border towns and several quarters in  Kazakh City. Consequently, many peaceful people have been  killed and several schools, medical centers, and means of  transportation have been destroyed.    The Armenian Armed Forces, supported with armored vehicles,  have prepared to launch an attack from the previously occupied  Agderinskiy, Agdamskiy, and Fizulinskiy Rayons. Regardless of  the losses they have suffered in their attacks earlier, they  have not abandoned their attempts. In addition to the acts of  violence, our republic is also being subjected to a ferocious  propaganda campaign, which is being waged not only by Armenia's  media organs but also by the parliament of that republic. The  objective behind their unfounded statements and reports is to  camouflage Armenia's policy of aggression against Azerbaijan and  mislead the world on the situation.    The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is convinced that  Armenia will be completely responsible for the consequences of  the intensified aggression against Azerbaijan. The aggression  will lead to new losses and create additional misfortunes for  the peoples of the two countries.    Azerbaijan urges the United Nations and international  organizations to condemn Armenia's aggression and impose  political and economic sanctions against that republic.</p>

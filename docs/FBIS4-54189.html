			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea on  Thursday [26 May] agreed to formulate a joint program to assist  small and medium-sized South Korean companies.    The accord was reached when Japanese International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata met with his South Korean  counterpart, Kim Chol-su, in Tokyo to attend the Japan-South  Korean meeting of trade ministers.    During the one-day, one-hour meeting, Hata said Tokyo will  maximize its efforts to expand economic relations through  further industrial cooperation with South Korean companies.    The joint program is aimed at facilitating industrial  restructuring in South Korea, especially among small companies,  in an effort to narrow bilateral trade imbalance in favor of  Japan, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) told a news conference.    The program calls for regular studies of ways to encourage  technological transfer from Japan to South Korea, promotion of  human exchanges to reinforce technological foundations at small  South Korean companies, and expanded marketing support of such  companies by Japanese organs such as the Japan External Trade  Organization.    Japanese businesses will also be encouraged to step up  direct  investment in South Korea, the MITI official said.    To that end, Japan will send study missions to Seoul and  other South Korean cities, while South Korean delegations will  visit Japan to lure prospective Japanese investors, the official  said.    The two countries will select small South Korean firms in  "supporting" industries such as household electrical appliances  parts, electronic components, general machine parts and auto  parts.    Selected companies will serve as model firms under the  program, the MITI official said.    Hata and Kim also discussed how to upgrade South Korea's  investment conditions for foreign companies.    Specifically, the MITI chief asked Seoul to remove measures  that hamper smooth foreign investment, including a rule  restricting activity of foreign trading houses.    Kim replied Seoul will study the request positively, the  MITI  official said.    Japan also will send its first investment study mission to  South Korea this fall, the official said.    Hata and Kim agreed to launch a joint working bilateral  panel  to enhance mutual cooperation in multimedia and other  information-related areas.    The joint program is in line with proposals made last March  during the summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam.    Thursday's meeting was the third of its kind to be held  between Japanese and South Korean trade ministers, following  those in Tokyo in 1992 and in Seoul last year.    Kim Chul-su arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day for a  two-day  stay, the first South Korean cabinet minister to visit Japan  since the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed  in late April.</p>

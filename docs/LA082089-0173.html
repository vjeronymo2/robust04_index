			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Random negotiations were under way in the telephone walkout against three  regional "Baby Bell" companies. Bell Atlantic and the Communications Workers of  America, having reached a tentative pact, conducted talks on local issues, and  a company spokesman said he was optimistic the Tuesday midnight deadline would  be met. The strike against Bell Atlantic in the East, NYNEX in the Northeast,  Ameritech in the Midwest and Pacific Telesis in California and Nevada affects  about 190,000 employees and 50 million customers. The main issues are wages and  health care. Ameritech and the CWA are bargaining on a state-by-state basis,  and a CWA spokesman said talks with Telesis are "making a little progress."  Formal talks involving NYNEX have been in recess for several days.  </P></p>

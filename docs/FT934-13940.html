			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 hits another record high THE UK equity market shrugged aside momentary disappointment with the September public sector borrowing requirement figure and raced ahead to hit a new intraday and closing high as the new two-week trading account got under way. Yesterday's burst of enthusiasm in the London market came as dealers picked up the scent of a possible round of European interest rate cuts. These could be triggered by good news on German money supply figures which may lead to a reduction in German rates when the Bundesbank meets this Thursday. Prime rate cuts by some US banks helped sentiment but dealers saw little real significance in these moves, which they said had been signalled a couple of weeks ago. The FT-SE 100 Index touched an all-time high of 3,142.8, up 22 points, shortly after midday, but failed to maintain its upwards momentum as a slightly disappointing opening by Wall Street and an easier trend in international bond markets prompted a minor flurry of profit-taking in equities. The index was finally 16.8 higher on balance at a closing peak of 3,137.6. London was additionally driven by a growing feeling that the November 30 Budget may see the chancellor of the exchequer opt for modest tax increases coupled with a cut in UK interest rates. One market strategist said the market could be indulging in a 'classic pre-Budget run-up', but also pointed out that London had underperformed other European bourses yesterday, most of which rose around one percentage point, against the Footsie's rise of around  1/2 percantage point. He described London's performance as 'nervous but positive'. Dealers were reluctant to lift share prices too far at the outset yesterday, worrying that the Footsie's 34-point jump to a new peak last Friday could have led to a period of consolidation as the new account commenced. However, a burst of futures-led buying saw the index climb from an opening gain of around five Footsie points to its midday peak. The afternoon downturn was regarded as nothing more than minor profit-taking. 'We've had a weekend to calm down after Friday's big upward move but this market is not ready to come back; the quality of buying is far too good for that,' commented a senior marketmaker at one of the top UK securities houses. Figures released yesterday by the Stock Exchange showed that the value of customer business transacted last Friday reached Pounds 1.86bn, the highest since August 25, when the big US investment funds were said to have launched a major foray into the UK market. Turnover in equities totalled 665.8m shares, with that figure boosted by a placing of 40m Rentokil shares by SG Warburg Securities. The latter's shares were outstanding in a generally strong merchant banking sector. Stocks with substantial interests in Hong Kong basked in the reflection of exceptional gains registered by that market, with HSBC firm despite its merchant banking subsidiary Samuel Montagu being ordered to pay Pounds 172m in damages and interest to creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth, the failed financial services group. Cable &amp; Wireless, boosted by yet more big US support after the recent Dollars 22bn Bell Atlantic/Tele-Communications merger, was heavily traded.</p>

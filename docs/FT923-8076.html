			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Former company secretary charged the Cheshire-based trade finance house owned by Mr Muhammad Naviede which collapsed a year ago - was arrested yesterday at his Manchester home by City of London police, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. He was charged at Bishopsgate police station with obtaining property by deception and dishonestly obtaining services. Mr Smithson's arrest follows a year-long investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into Arrows. Mr Naviede was charged last August with obtaining Pounds 10m by deception from ABN Bank of the Netherlands. The money was lent to Arrows for stock-financing operations for its corporate customers, but is alleged to have found its way into property investments that then suffered in the recession. Total debts of more than 80 companies and single-purpose trusts connected with Arrows have been put at about Pounds 220m by Mr Scott Martin and Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young, the group's liquidator. There is a shortfall of about Pounds 100m and Arrows' own debts are understood to total Pounds 113m. Creditors include 35 banks or building societies. Mr Smithson was remanded on bail until October 21 on condition he live at home, surrender his passport and pilot's licence and enter an aircraft only as a fare-paying passenger on an internal UK flight. Mr Naviede is already on Pounds 400,000 bail and has had to surrender his passport and pilot's licence.</p>

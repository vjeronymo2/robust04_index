			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (18): A different life without Big Brother - Frederick Studemann on how capitalist realism came to the theatre Before the collapse of East Germany, actors at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin led a life which their colleagues in the west could only dream about. Every night the auditorium of the impressive neo-classical building near the Friedrichstrasse station was packed. Even better than the thrill of performing to a full house was the fact that the audiences took a keen interest in every word and movement in a studied search for any deeper meaning. Celebrated on stage, the actors and their directors also enjoyed a life outside the theatre as bohemian types who were not expected to conform to the rigours of state socialism. Today, like every other sector of east German society, the members of the Deutsches Theater are having to adapt to the rigours of capitalism. Lively artistic types they may still be, but their theatre is often just over half full. The days when drama was everything, and finance just a series of figures are over - 'the main thing that everyone talks and thinks about now is money,' says Maik Hamburger, the theatre's literary adviser. Money is something everyone involved with culture in eastern Germany has had to seriously think about in the last four years. During that time the relatively generous hand of an omnipotent central government has been swapped for that of the cash-strapped local authorities. In line with the country's federal system, cultural funding in Germany is today carried at the regional, or state level. In the case of the Deutsches Theater, it is the city of Berlin that provides the lion's share of the theatre's budget. Subsidies to the theatre this year are DM32.67m. Last year, they were DM29.76m. But box office receipts in 1993 only amounted to DM2.4m and this year they expect DM3.1m, with an audience capacity of 72 per cent. Although the city of Berlin has earmarked the Deutsches, as it is known, as its show-case for classical drama, and therefore deserving of substantial funding, it is still on a much shorter leash than in the past. Then no one really bothered with costs as it was always assumed that the state would provide extra funds if necessary. Now, for the first time, the Deutsches has taken the step of taking a production off for financial reasons. Ironically, the play in question, Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, was reasonably successful. It was taken out of the theatre's repertoire programme because there was no money to pay for the storage of sets between performances. Mr Hamburger now worries that financial pressures will cut the quality of the theatre's work, and lead to a situation where once again artistic policy is curtailed by outside considerations. The danger is, Mr Hamburger believes, that the overt political censorship of the communists is being replaced by the dictates of the box office. 'There have been internal conflicts over whether we should make more artistic concessions or not. The management wants plays with a large popular appeal, but the artistic side is keen to do more exciting stuff,' he explains. This internal tussle is of course about more than just the filling of seats. To many of the members of the 170-strong staff of the Deutsches' company, it is also about the perceived threat of westernisation of the theatre in the east. As far as the audience is concerned this change has already taken place. Since the Berlin wall fell, the audiences at the Deutsches have been increasingly made up of people from west Berlin, attracted by the theatre's reputation and its grand appearance. On an average night the audience make-up mirrors that of Berlin as a whole - two-thirds western, one third eastern. What they get to see is a culture in transition. Under the communists, theatre performed a unique role as an unofficial form of the media. Plays which were seemingly devoid of all political or social content would be reworked to give them a topical edge. Audiences were trained to see an elaborate critique of totalitarianism in a few lines of Goethe, to see Hamlet turned into a symbol of the painful indecision and self-obsession of the opposition dissidents groups. Now such tactics are redundant - 'the actors say that today the audiences are reacting on a more direct level to the texts and not looking for hidden meaning,' says Mr Hamburger. This means that the Deutsches is now looking for new forms of subtlety. This is a process that can be quite exciting to watch. Recently, for instance, the Deutsches put on a play by Botho Strauss, a western playwright noted for his mastery of subtlety. Getting to grips with this very western work was tough. 'We found it quite hard because we do not have this taste for deep inward searching and most of us do not find it important,' says Mr Hamburger. Other attempts to combine east and west have produced surprisingly topical results as shown by the production of Tankred Dorst's play Herr Paul which is currently in the repertoire programme. Dorst, a west German, originally began working on the play in the 1960s. Set in 1950s west Germany the play is the story of an old man who lives in a soap factory who is faced with eviction by the building's youthful owner who is keen to redevelop the site. When Dorst began writing the play it was intended to show the fundamental changes taking place in post-war west German society, the conflict between the old and the new. Now on stage at the Deutsches it has acquired a totally different quality as anyone who has followed the complicated issue of property rights in eastern Germany can testify.</p>

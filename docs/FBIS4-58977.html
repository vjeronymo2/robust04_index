			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] London, 10 May (KUNA) -- In a press statement  published here today, Yemeni Oil [and Mineral Resources]  Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun said that the oil sector  has not yet been affected by the military operations and that  the sector's activities of production and exports, and even  refining, are continuing in a normal and usual way.    Bin-Husaynun added to the AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper that  export operations are taking place at the same previous rates;  however, he did not specify the size of exports. The Yemeni  minister denied that foreign oil companies have evacuated their  foreign employees. He pointed out that these companies know that  oil regions are far away from military operations, though  prolonging the war may affect the trust of foreign investors,  particularly in the oil sector.

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Dispute over Lloyd's inquiry head FRESH DISAGREEMENT over Lloyd's looks set to surface today when a group of loss-making Names confronts Mr David Coleridge, the chairman, over the handling of alleged malpractices at the insurance market. The Names - individuals whose personal assets provide the insurance market's capital - are particularly concerned about the appointment of Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the investment watchdog, to oversee investigations. Some Names who will meet Mr Coleridge today plan to question Sir David's independence. Sir David is a member of the Lloyd's governing council. 'There is a suspicion he won't do anything to embarrass his friends in the club,' Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, said yesterday. 'We want to know what the terms of reference are.' He stressed that his stance should not be interpreted as a personal attack on Sir David. This prospective skirmish coincides with the gathering momentum behind the legal battle between Lloyd's and some of those Names worst affected by the market's recent losses. Lloyd's is now in open dispute with several hundred Names who, like Mr Doll-Steinberg, are members of lossmaking catastrophe reinsurance syndicates. This follows the decision of Lloyd's to defend a legal action being brought by Names against the agents who handle their affairs. The Names are seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down deposits that Names placed with their agents when they joined Lloyd's. They allege the cash calls are legally 'improper'. The solicitors acting on behalf of Names, Michael Freeman, now expect the total number of plaintiffs in the action to be over 600. Mr Michael Freeman said yesterday that the decision of Lloyd's to enter the proceedings 'had caused a mass of writs from people who otherwise would never have been part of this action'. Sir William Clark, the chairman of the Conservative bank bench finance committee, who leads today's delegation of MPs and Names, said: 'My concern is that anything that affects the City and any adverse criticism of Lloyd's would be disastrous for the City generally.' Mr Doll-Steinberg's remarks followed a meeting of MPs and Names convened at Westminster yesterday by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs spokeswoman, with the aim of keeping the pressure on Lloyd's and improving co-ordination between the various Lloyd's action groups. On Friday, the agents agreed to give temporary undertakings to freeze Names' deposits until the outcome of court hearings fixed for about March 26 was known. The Names provided cross undertakings which mean that if their action ultimately fails they must pay compensation to Lloyd's for any financial loss suffered. Lloyd's warned yesterday that these amounts could be substantial since they would include the 'financing costs of raising money other than by the usual procedures'.

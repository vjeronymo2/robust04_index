			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Battle over economy rumbles on THE WAR of words over the economy continued yesterday with the Tories stepping up their claims that a Labour administration would have disastrous consequences and Labour hitting out at the Conservative record on insolvencies and unemployment. The Tory assault was spearheaded by Mr John Major, who told a 200-strong crowd at Meopham in Kent: 'We have got a very clear choice indeed at this election - a clear choice between recovery under the Conservatives or perpetual recession leading to slump under the policies the Labour party proposes.' Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, took up the refrain, asserting that Labour's policies would 'flatten the economy.' Labour's higher taxes would mean 'less take home pay which means less spending which means less work for industry - higher unemployment and no recovery,' the environment secretary added. Recovery would come he said, because business believed the Conservatives would be best for the economy. For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown used figures from 'the government's own insolvency service' to predict that business closures would rise by 67 per cent in the year to April 1993. Insolvencies would increase to 35,000 from 21,000 if the Tories were re-elected, the shadow trade and industry secretary projected. 'I challenge the prime minister to admit that Conservative policies mean not only will unemployment continue to rise for many months to come but so too will business closures and bankruptcies,' he said. Mr Tony Blair, another of Labour's frontbench stars, used figures gathered from British embassies to show London was vying with east Berlin for the title of unemployment capital of the major industrialised economies. According to the figures, unemployment in London rose by nearly 54 per cent in the year to February, compared with an average of 14.2 per cent in the 16 cities covered. For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy Ashdown said that neither Labour nor the Tories had put forward serious plans for ending the recession. His party has proposed Pounds 6bn package of public investment to create an estimated 600,000 jobs over two years.</p>

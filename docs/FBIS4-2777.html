			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government has taken a series of measures to increase its  agricultural input in an effort to promote a sustained growth of  farm production.    The central government has decided to add three billion yuan  this year to its budget for capital construction, 650 million  yuan of which will be put into farm production, accounting for  21.7 percent of the total increase.    Also, loans offered by banks have risen by 19.8 billion yuan  this year, 2.1 billion yuan destined for agriculture, accounting  for 10.6 percent of the total added.    An analysis shows that the shrinkage of investment in  agricultural capital construction is mainly due to the change of  investment resources and the expansion of investment scale and  scope.    To maintain a stable agricultural development, the central  government has raised the budget and loans for farm production,  12.9 percentage points more than last year.    In addition to the direct input into farming, forestry and  water- conservancy works, the increased investment also covers  the farm- support industries, including fertilizers, pesticides,  plastic sheeting and farm machinery.</p>

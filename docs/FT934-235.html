			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Fowler scorns Labour 'atrophy' Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday sought to rally Tory activists ahead of next year's local government and European elections by launching a detailed attack on the Labour party and unveiling a series of measures to help recruit more constituency agents. In a new year letter to local party committees, Sir Norman indicated that the Conservative leadership would try to focus the forthcoming election campaigns on Labour's weakness in opposition rather than the Conservative record in office. He said Labour was suffering from 'intellectual atrophy' and had no new ideas about social policy, the public services or public expenditure. He described the agenda of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, as 'warmed-over Wilsonism' consisting of corporatism, statism and 'old-fashioned jobs for union boys'. The party chairman was also confident that the government would have a better standing by the time of the polls in May and June, in spite of a recent set of poor opinion polls and strong sentiment at Westminster that the Conservatives could face crushing defeats in the summer. 'The government's standing will rise as tough no-nonsense policies deliver results,' Sir Norman said yesterday. In a measure designed to boost morale among the Tory grassroots, Conservative Central Office announced that it was setting aside Pounds 1m to help recruit more constituency agents to help fight the next general election. In recent months Central Office staff have been concerned by the fall in the number of local agents from about 300 at last year's general election to about 230 now. The new money, which will be disbursed from 1995, will supplement the salaries which some agents receive from their local associations, and will be focused on improving the party's presence in marginal constituencies. But the measures will have little impact on next year's elections. Sir Norman underlined yesterday that funds had become available because of cost-cutting measures at Central Office in the past 18 months which have halved its annual outgoings to Pounds 6m. Recent reforms have included reductions in staff numbers and the appointment of a new board of treasurers. The Labour party said that it was confident that the moves outlined by Sir Norman would make little difference at the polls.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDERSTANDING IRAQ  </P> <P> Your Endpapers ("How Mesopotamia Became Iraq (and Why It Matters)" by Jack  Miles, Sept. 2) was a very comprehensive analysis of the situation of the Arabs  today.  </P> <P> The Western World probably still does not understand what Miles put into one  sentence -- that for Muslims, religion and politics are inseparable.  </P> <P> You also quoted David Fromkin: "Arab Muslims simply were unwilling to be ruled  by this European, Christian, culturally alien power."  </P> <P> This has always been true, and to be completely pragmatic, it should have  guided several generations of so-called world leaders.  </P> <P> SOL H.

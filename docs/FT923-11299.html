			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (1): Expectations are rising - Two-car households are already commonplace in Britain. Furthermore, a growing number expect to acquire a second - or a third - car by the end of next year, indicating a willingness to look beyond the recession to more prosperous times JUDGING by the statistical evidence, there is a dispiriting task ahead for environmentalists and traffic planners seeking to persuade motorists out of their cars and on to public transport. The upgrading of public transport networks for commuters and city centre bans on cars to ease congestion and pollution are expected to provide some partial victories. But net growth of the car population for the forseeable future seems inevitable as the result of increasing prosperity (current recession notwithstanding), the decline of bus and rail services in rural areas, more women at work and other social factors - not least the advent of the 'school run' as parents grow increasingly unwilling to allow their children to cycle or otherwise travel alone. Already, in the UK, there are just under 400 cars per 1,000 population, according to statistics from government departments and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Over the past 11 years, the UK's population has risen by two per cent to reach 57.6m last year, the number of households has grown by 11 per cent - and the number of cars by 28 per cent, to 22.6m. As this year's Lex Report on Motoring* found, in a survey conducted with the MORI polling organisation, the two-car household is already a commonplace. Thirty-four per cent of the 1,277 households surveyed for the report had two cars, six per cent had three, and two per cent four or more. For car makers and dealers, however, it was the attitudes and expectations of the households surveyed that made the most interesting - and from their viewpoint, encouraging - reading: Of households with at least one car, 15 per cent expected to have acquired a second, third or fourth car by the end of next year. Only 7 per cent expected to give one up. Intriguingly, the proportion expecting to acquire an additional car was higher than in the previous year's survey, indicating a willingness to look beyond the recession towards more prosperous times. The Lex/MORI research indicated that of the additional 1.6m cars expected to take to the UK's roads between the beginning of this year and the end of next - after allowing for scrappage of existing ones - around one-half will be 'second' cars. Just over 80 per cent of these are expected to be used vehicles. But that still leaves some 100,000 purchases of new 'second' cars a year - a valuable market for the trade and industry, particularly at a time when the overall new car market remains severely depressed. Not suprisingly, however, second (or third, or fourth) car sales are concentrated at the lower end of the price spectrum, reflecting the use of most of them as runabouts. The Volkswagen group's own regular new car buyers survey illustrates the point. Last year, 45.5 per cent of its Polo small hatchback sales were identified as being not the main car in a household (the small hatchback average is just under 40 per cent). The percentage slipped to 23.8 per cent in the case of the Golf, and to just under 4 per cent for larger and more expensive cars like the Passat and Audi 80. A much smaller proportion is of more specialised vehicles, such as 'leisure' four-wheel-drive vehicles bought for their 'image' - many of which will never stray from the highway - or sports cars, now a rapidly reviving sector. The reason usually identified by surveys as the most common one for acquiring an extra car is of least immediate concern to manufacturers: a younger member of the family passing his or her driving test. Even among more affluent families, that usually means the purchase of a used car. Of those planning to buy new secondary cars, the Lex/MORI report found most people, 32 per cent, listing increased income making it possible to buy a car that had long been wanted. Other key reasons included the increased needs of a growing family (20 per cent), starting a job where a car is needed (20), moving home to where an additional car is needed more urgently (20) and even lower car prices (8). Unlike the 'first' car of more than 3m drivers in the UK - those running company vehicles - secondary cars are ovewhelmingly a private purchase made out of individuals' after-tax income. That, at least, is the evidence provided by the Monks Partnership's annual survey of UK company car policy**, even though in many larger companies envy-provoking speculation tends to be commonplace that senior executives and directors' run spouse's cars 'on the firm' as a matter of course. The findings of Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt and his colleagues at Monks are that such cars remain extremely uncommon even at chief executive and director level, only three per cent of companies making them available. With the UK motor industry harbouring growing fears that total new car sales this year could fail to match even 1991's 1.59m units, nearly one-third down on the 1989 record of 2.3m, wooing the second car buyer has become a significant concern for car makers and dealers. The bad news - for the industry - is that, since government statistics show four out of ten drivers now to be women, the battle for sales will depend heavily not on styling, chic or other emotional factors - but on price. For it is by women that the majority of second cars are driven, and the industry's market research shows up consistently that three-quarters of them care little about what car they drive, provided it is relatively small and gets them from point A to B. Looking beyond the immediate problems of the recession, however, the long-term indicators for the growth of the second car market remain positive. The hope of the environmental lobby, for example, that increasing congestion will act as a disincentive to car purchase appears ill-founded, with various surveys indicating that little more than one in ten drivers would consider using public transport more. And congested though the UK's roads may appear to be, the vehicle population per head still has a very long way to go before it reaches US levels - 602 per 1,000 population - or even German, 492 per 1,000. Nor does the argument that other countries have many more miles of roads to drive on. Italy has considerably more cars per head than the UK - 476 per 1,000 - despite a congested 91 cars per kilometre of road compared with only 61 for both the UK and Germany. *Lex Report on Motoring 1992; available from Lex Service PLC, Lex House, 17 Connaught Place, London W2 2EL; Pounds 175. **Company Car Policy UK; Monks Partnership, Debden Green, Saffron Walden, Essex CB11 3LX; Pounds 100.</p>

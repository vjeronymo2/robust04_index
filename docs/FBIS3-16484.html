Ukrainian submachine-gunners do not allow medical personnel  in, if the latter refuse to take an oath of allegiance to  Ukraine.    Hospital workers said that Major Shevchenko of the Ukrainian  armed forces had presented them an ultimatum in accordance with  which they must either serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces or  will lose their jobs.    A high-ranking representative of the Black Sea Fleet, who  preferred to remain anonymous, said that earlier this year  Ukrainian submachine-gunners had seized the military hospital in  Nikolayev. Special forces were involved.    The same source announced that the Black Sea Command  qualified those actions as "actions carried out by uncontrolled  bandit formations, because the Ukrainian Defense Ministry did  not inform the Black Sea Command of its plans to resubordinate  the Black Sea Fleet's establishments and units."    He stated that if such unilateral actions were repeated, the  Black Sea Fleet personnel would be given the order to use arms  to rebuff them.</p>

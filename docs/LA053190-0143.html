			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 60 OFFICERS ARREST 4 IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING;  </P> <P> SANTA PAULA: THE MEN ARE ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO A GANG SUSPECTED OF ATTACKING  A RIVAL GANG MEMBER'S CAR.  </P> <P> Sixty law enforcement officers, including two SWAT teams, converged on a Santa  Paula neighborhood before dawn Wednesday to arrest four alleged members of a  local gang suspected of involvement in a drive-by shooting in Ventura.  </P> <P> Larry Renteria, 23, Arthur Banuelos, 22, Michael Banuelos, 38, and Steven  Bracamontes, 23, were arrested without incident after a 5 a.m. search of four  houses on Mill Street. The four, accused of belonging to the Crimies gang, are  suspected of attacking a car driven by a member of the rival Party Boyz gang on  May 18.  </P> <P> Renteria and Arthur Banuelos, being held on $250,000 bail each, were booked in  Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder. Bracamontes was arrested  on suspicion of illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun and violating  probation. He was jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail. Michael Banuelos, 38, was  being held in County Jail without bail for violating state prison parole.  </P> <P> "Communities within Ventura County have just about had it as far as gangs and  their potential for growth go," said Lt. Pat Rooney of the Ventura Police  Department, which organized the investigation. "We don't ever want to be in the  same position as some of our sister counties."  </P> <P> Police said the four men are suspected of chasing a car driven by alleged Party  Boyz member Mario (Dino) Castro on May 18, about 8:20 p.m. At least three shots  were fired at the car in the 1100 block of Citrus Drive at the eastern edge of  Ventura, police said.  </P> <P> Neither Castro nor his passenger were injured, and both vehicles sped away to  Santa Paula, police said.  </P> <P> Witnesses reported the shooting and with the help of the Santa Paula Police  Department, Ventura police officers identified Castro.  </P> <P> Santa Paula police Cmdr. Bob Gonzales said Castro was known to police as a  Party Boyz gang member with a history of gang affiliation. Based on his  association with gangs, authorities were able to identify his attackers,  Gonzalez said. During the search Wednesday, officers found 14 guns -- an AK-47,  three handguns, two sawed-off shotguns and seven rifles and shotguns, police  said.  </P> <P> SWAT teams from the Ventura Police Department and the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department were on hand, Rooney said.  </P> <P> Participating in the arrests were officers from the Ventura Police Department,  the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the Santa Paula Police Department, the  Ventura County district attorney's office and the State Department of  Corrections.  </P> <P> The police raid Wednesday morning followed a fatal shooting in Santa Paula  Monday in which a Santa Paula man is accused of killing his next-door neighbor  -- a shooting that police have linked to a quarrel about alleged gang activity  involving their children.  </P> <P> Santa Paula police arrested Delfino Lopez, 43, on a murder charge Monday in the  shooting of Samuel Ruiz. He was rearrested Wednesday, police said, allowing  them to hold Lopez for another 48 hours while they finish reports on the  slaying.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison said Lopez will be arraigned today or Friday  in Ventura County Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Lopez's wife and son, speaking outside a courtroom before his arraignment was  delayed Wednesday, said Ruiz and Lopez were the best of friends until a week  before the shooting, when they began arguing about a fight among their sons.  </P> <P> The wife and son, Martha and Freddy Joe Lopez, vehemently denied police reports  that the shooting was gang-related, although the son, Freddy Joe Lopez, said he  belonged to a Santa Paula gang 2 1/2 years ago.  </P> <P> Martha Lopez said she looked out her window on Monday afternoon and saw Ruiz  next door, drunk and yelling threats at her family. She said she saw Ruiz pull  a gun from under his shirt, cock it and point it at her husband, Delfino Lopez,  while the two continued arguing.  </P> <P> She said she called 911 and while she was on the phone, Ruiz began shooting.  She said her husband shot back at Ruiz, although she couldn't see him around  the window frame. Moments later, Delfino Lopez walked into the house, without a  gun, Martha Lopez said.  </P> <P> "And he goes, 'You better get an ambulance' " she said.  </P> <P> Police have not found the weapon used to kill Ruiz. Ventura County Coroner Dr.  F. Warren Lovell ruled that Ruiz died of a gunshot wound to the chest.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Psyche Pascual contributed to this story.  </P></p>

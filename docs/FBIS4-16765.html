			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the "Realists" Club on the presidential draft </F> Agreement on the Attainment of Civil Accord, under the  "Document" rubric]    [Text] We do stand for civil accord in society. But we  oppose an illusion of accord or a myth about accord which is  being specially created. In the draft Agreement on the  Attainment of Civil Accord, which has been made public by the  Russian Federation president, everything testifies either to the  naivete of its authors or their desire to use the text only as a  tactical weapon in the struggle against those who -- even to  some extent -- do not support one administration and government  policy or another. The document's period of validity, its  demand for unilateral compromises, its declarative nature, the  betting on embryonic party structures that have virtually no  social support base in society, a lack of clear- cut obligations  to be assumed by the executive branch, the restriction of  constitutional rights for entire categories of people, the  hastening of the preparation, discussion, and adoption of the  document, and, finally, its mechanism of arbitration and  sanctions for violating the agreement -- all this makes us warn:  the document will not have any role to play at best, but at  worst (which is most likely) it will, on the contrary, aggravate  the standoff in society. The very idea of civil accord may be  discredited.    Holding talks on the attainment of accord is, of course,  better than not holding them at all. But the result is  attainable when it can be attained in reality, not by an earlier  set -- and apparently politically motivated -- date. This is  why, while welcoming the president's readiness to strive for  civil accord in society, but at the same time thinking it  impossible for us to assume responsibility for the consequences  of putting into practice the published draft Agreement under the  established mechanism of finalizing and signing it, we propose  different principles of the Public Agreement on the Attainment  of Civil Accord:    1. The renunciation of the use of armed force in resolving  any political and social conflicts.    2. The adherence to the current Constitution, while at the  same time working out a mutually agreed mechanism of adjusting  it.    3. The renunciation by all political institutions and  structures of the claim on the introduction of any "state  ideology" and the use of "the image of an internal enemy" in  their campaigning.    4. All parties to the agreement, particularly chiefs of  state structures, ought to conduct policies that are as moral as  possible and that would not raise opponents' suspicions of  insincerity.    5. The restoration of an independent, strong judicial  branch as soon as possible.    6. The determination of clear dates and the mechanism of  all elections for all elected government authorities. The  parties to the agreement should forgo any changes in the dates  or rules of elections. Democratic, free, and regular elections  are the best mechanism of realizing the idea of civil accord.    7. Political forces that lay claims on power should  publicly pledge to forswear revenge on the vanquished and yet  another redistribution of property in favor of the winners in  elections.    8. The joint determination of further stages of political  reform.    9. The agreed determination of the minimum social  standards and the quality of life standards of the population to  be binding on any government.    10. The orientation of economic policy toward the domestic  market as an engine of Russian economic development, and  therefore a precondition for raising the living standards of  Russian citizens.    11. A gradual, phased, and agreed upon introduction of a  new model of Russia's federal structure and its policy in the  post- Soviet space.    12. All parties to the agreement ought to pledge to take  part in the comprehensive, full-scale struggle against organized  crime, and also to expel those who may have even indirect  contacts with any persons, organizations, or businesses dubious  in that regard from the organizations signatories to the  agreement.    The text of the Public Agreement should be signed by the  leaders of public and political movements and organizations,  political parties, trade and professional unions, associations  of commodity producers, banks, and other corporate structures,  and only afterward by top government officials. Those who have  signed the agreement will become members of a roundtable which  at the same time will be an arbitration agency responsible for  exposing violations of the agreement by its individual members.</p>

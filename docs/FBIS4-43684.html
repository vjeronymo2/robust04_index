			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michel Colomes: "Culpable Leniency"] </F>   [Text] For one Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) smuggler  arrested on the Autoroute de l'Est, how many explosives, machine  guns, even rocket launchers will have transited unencumbered  through the sieve-like borders of Europe in the direction of  Algeria? How many went to fatten the arsenal of those who hide  their weapons under the tunics of the fundamentalists? Our  neighbors' negligence, our European partners' indifference, and  our American allies' lack of understanding are increasingly  becoming a matter of concern and irritation for French foreign  policy , favoring the goals of the fundamentalists as they do.    Of course, France is the country most concerned with the  tragic fate awaiting Algeria if nothing is done to stop the  decay of its civil institutions. Also, it is easy to understand  how, for the French prime minister, Algeria has become "one of  the most serious worries." But how can the other countries of  the Mediterranean be spared by the earthquake that the arrival  in power of the fundamentalists in Algiers would mean? How could  the fundamentalist wave have no repercussions on those European  countries which, like ours, shelter immigrant Muslim  communities? Finally, how is it possible not to see that the  stability of the Maghreb--and probably beyond it--would be  affected, and that the groundswell would certainly not spare  moderate Arab countries?    And yet, Madrid and Rome continue to grant visas without  discernment to Algerian citizens whom the strong permeability of  borders subsequently allows to go wherever they wish--and  therefore to France.    Without wishing to dramatize the situation, Paris notes that  one of the FIS leaders, Rabah Kebir, continues his militant  action in Germany. And that another FIS official, certainly more  virulent and dangerous, Anouar Haddam, enjoys freedom of action  and expression in the United States, to the point that from  Chicago, he can send his propaganda to French newspapers.    Finally, even if on 18 April the European Union did make  available the Community assistance that Paris wished to give  Algeria, the Americans, through the Eximbank, are doing  everything in their power to complicate long-term credits needed  by the Algerian Government.    The attitude of the United States, which has reopened a  dialogue with the fundamenalists, was actually--together with  Bosnia--one of the reasons for Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's  recent visit to Washington. The minister's message went  something like this: "Neither you nor we have any reason to show  leniency to people who hate us."    It is not certain that it will be heard. First, because from  Saigon to Tehran, and now in Algiers, the Americans are  resolutely pursuing the utopian idea of the "third force," that  of the so-called reasonable revoutionaries with whom it is  possible to talk. With well-known results... Secondly, and more  importantly, because on the other side of the Atlantic, the  unavowed feeling that since the Algerian war France has  continued to have unhealthy ulterior motives vis-a-vis its  former colonies still lingers. To sum up, the Americans are  allegedly cultivating Algerian fundamentalists to counterbalance  the stench of French colonialism. Diplomatic communication is  decidedly a difficult art.</p>

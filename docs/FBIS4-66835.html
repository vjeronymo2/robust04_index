			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa 'Ali Mahmud, Amirah Khawasik, Salih </F> al-Fityani, and Mahmud 'Abd-al-Shakur: "What Do Thinkers and  Scholars of Religion, Politics, and Society Have To Say About  the Confessions of the Penitent Terrorist?"]    [Text] It was the first time people encountered terrorism  face to face; the first time they heard its voice and saw its  image. They know the causes and motives for the theft and  explosion of bombs, and the murder of innocents. Perhaps this  was the reason the shocking confessions of repentant terrorist  'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi in front of television cameras aroused such  wide-ranging reactions among all sectors of the people of all  walks of life.    Despite the fact that these confessions have thrown back the  curtain to expose the secrets of the terrorist organizations,  they left question marks in the minds of many--and exclamation  points, too!    To discuss these confessions, and exactly what they mean,  and  the extent to which they will help to fight terrorism, we met  with a large group of intellectuals, thinkers, religious  scholars, and sociologists, to hear their reactions and draw  results and lessons from them.    To start with, former Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil says  that  "the confessions of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi played a major role in  enlightening the people, especially the youth, as to what is  going on in the terrorist groups. There are a number of points  that caught my attention in these confessions, such as the fact  that they derive their thought from books, despite the different  circumstances in which they were written, as is happening in  Egypt now. There are some who believe that the circulation of  these books should not be tolerated, that they should be  confiscated, but my view is different. Books should be produced  to respond to these, and in an accurate and detailed way, so  that there may be a discussion of every line and every paragraph  in these books, because they have become the major germ of  terrorism.    "We must also review the teaching methods in use, and a way  of instruction that better suits our programs.    "We must take into consideration, regarding these groups,  the  fact that while in Algeria they have known political targets,  they are different here. These groups have no clear target, and  are divided up into small groups, each of which has as its goal  the gathering of the largest number in order to get more funds  from abroad. This explains their conflict over leadership,  because leadership is the source of profit. This requires us to  have a genuine position, because these funds come from abroad in  the form of alms and contributions from some fraternal Arab  countries. This is brazen interference in Egypt's internal  affairs and we must not allow it. We must take strong measures  against it, and monitor the movement of these funds in the  banks, and the persons. When a Saudi Arabian person provides  these funds, he should be accused and charged, and a verdict  must be handed down in absentia, with no niceties, and no threat  to Egypt's security in the name of spreading the Islamic faith.  As to this talk of unemployment as a cause of terrorism, these  confessions made it clear that it is false. It revealed that  those youths found a way to easy money and marriage and easily  achieved legal opinions, such as those certifying the offficial  permissibility [of almost any act]. This penitent, 'Adil  'Abd-al-Baqi, was not unemployed, and his colleagues were not  unemployed. The link between unemployment with terrorism is an  attempt on the part of those who sympathize with these groups to  find an excuse for them. But there is no excuse for them,  because they are acting to destabilize the government in Egypt  and to weaken it at home and abroad."  <H5>  Bats and Phantoms! </H5>   Prominent writer Tharwat Abazah says, "First of all, the  Egyptian media have dealt with this talk, and shown it. The  content of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions had been much  discussed among citizens, but without confirmation like  marriage, without documentation and legitimization and so on.  Today, however, it has been confirmed by one of their own,  indeed by one of their leaders. What pains me, however, is that  some opposition newspapers are attacking this dialogue because  he told the truth, and they have been against the truth for  their whole history. Instead of apologizing for what they have  perpetrated against our people, they attack the man. I consider  them to be beyond the pale of the Islamic religion. God will  judge them. I believe that the government can confront them only  with arms. As to the dialogue and discussion, it is meaningless.  We will not engage in dialogue with bats and phantoms. Is there  anyone who says: `I am a terrorist and I want dialogue?'  Discussion here is a laughable word. What we have heard from  'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi needs no discussion--it needs a clash, it  needs to be confronted with arms and no other means."  <H5>  Possible and Permissible </H5>   Liberal Party chief Mustafa Kamil Murad believes that the  broadcast of the confessions of repentant terrorists--or even of  convicted nonrepentant terrorists--was absolutely essential. "It  helps, in the first place, to reveal the secrets of their terror  networks; second, to help them present their violent, extremist  ideas; third, and most importantly, to mobilize public opinion  against terrorism, which targets the security of the nation and  the safety of its citizens."    He reaffirms the importance of dialogue with those  terrorists  by all possible means and all available methods. He emphasizes  the necessity of presenting these dialogues to psychiatrists for  analysis. In this way, leads could be found that would be of use  in confronting this dangerous phenomenon.    He believes that discussing the terrorists' ideas and  getting  to know their tendencies are more important than trying to  locate the sources of the extremist books the terror groups use  in formulating their own laws--no matter whether these books are  printed secretly in Egypt or smuggled in from abroad. "The  problem must be attacked at its roots. The confrontation here  must be through dialogue, and dialogue alone."  <H5>  The Nature of Our Conditions </H5>   Labor Party leader Engineer Ibrahim Shukri refused to  comment  on the confessions of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi,  saying that he had not seen them, and so could make no judgment  on how true the confessions were.    He believes that the terror phenomenon in general reflects  "the nature of the conditions we live in, politically,  economically, and socially. It is not easy for us to deal with  the confessions, based on some statements printed here and  confessions broadcast there."    He says that a dialogue is needed with these groups to  discuss the various views and present all points of view so that  we can find a genuine way out of the problem, and a decisive  solution to this dreadful phenomenon.  <H5>  Just Rumors </H5>   Yasin Siraj-al-Din, a Wafd Party leader in Cairo, says, "If  we believe 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions, in his capacity as  an actual terrorist, then I believe that they were very  significant, the more so because they confirm what we have heard  about terrorist organizations--we used to imagine that they were  just exaggerated rumors!"    He thinks that the media's initiative in spreading this kind  of awareness is indeed an intelligent one, "especially because  it comes in the form of the confessions of one of the penitents  who lived among the terrorists for 17 years. We as men of law  have this to say: a confession is the best possible evidence."    He added that "these confessions are the best means of  spreading awareness among all sectors of youth, especially those  who have joined the ranks of violence and terrorism, or those  who are thinking of joining. Repeating this process with other,  similar persons will create for us a virtual bulwark against  violence and extremism for all our citizens, no matter what  their background."  <H5>  Willing Tools </H5>   Assistant Secretary-General of the NPUG [National  Prrogressive Unionist Grouping] Party Rif'at al-Sa'id says,  "Apart from the practical value of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's  confessions, and their extensive and decisive effect of broad  masses of the Egyptian people who listened to them on  television--the main information medium reaching the broad  masses of Egypt--they reveal to us two primary truths. How often  have we voiced them! Many people turned away when we  voiced them:     -  "The first truth is that terrorism begins as an idea. This  man, according to his own words, never wielded a gun, but he  made others wield them, and convinced them and taught them to do  that, and told them that it was a legitimate thing to do. They  became willing tools in his hands. Thus we discover that the  real terrorist, committing the greater crime, is the one who  issues the religious edict. The man courageously acknowledges  that. Based on this we may reaffirm that we must fight these  misleading, so-called Islamic ideas, which are opposed to the  truth of Islam, in the cradle; that is, in the sphere of ideas,  where they are born. This could mean in the mosque, in the  education process, or in the media. This is the first truth  'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi taught us.    -  "The second truth is that there is no moderation and no  extremism in the trend of political Islam, as long as it is born  as an idea. Those who repeat extremist ideas and all the  preachers of so-called political Islam, become by necessity  partners in terror. 'Adil 'Abdal-Baqi has offered us proof not  only in the relation between ideas and terrorism, but also in  the field of funding. A lawyer, one of the most famous preachers  of political defeatism, explained that he was offered a quarter  of a million pounds. One of the owners of an economic  Islamization company funds the terrorists directly. Then they  come to us saying they are against violence. How can we believe  them? That is the question."    <H5>    Step By Step </H5>   Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Ibrahim, professor of Sociopolitics at the  American University, believes that "the confessions are a new  model in uncovering the secrets and dynamics of the extremist  movements' recruitment of adolescents, and their exploitation of  the adolescents' piety, winning them over step by step to join  the extremist groups. The new thing that the repentant terrorist  revealed to us is the organized operations to isolate the  victims of this recruitment from the mainstream of normal social  life by creating a rift between them and society. In this way  they hear no alternative thinking, nothing dfferent from what  they are being taught.    "I might add to that the gradual intensification in the  doses  of thought to turn them away from the government and society.  Estranging them from society makes it easier for the extremist  organizations to create a rift even between the recruited victim  and the people closest to him--his family and his friends. It  ends with the recruited victim become wholly dependent on the  organization to fill all his psychological, social, and economic  needs. By magnifying this dependency, the recruited victim  becomes more blindly obedient to the orders he gets, including  orders to rob, sabotage, destroy, and murder.    "As he commits any of these crimes, he becomes more  dependent; his personal security is strongly linked to the  organization's satisfaction with him, and he enters the vicious  circle. He is more obedient to their orders; with this obedience  of his, the orders implicate him even more; with his deeper  involvement, he becomes their prisoner. It is they who hide him  and protect him. Amid all this the recruited victim's own mind  is totally cancelled out; he becomes a sort of robot.    "In short, what the repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi  has revealed to us is a physiological Iranian autopsy of a  journey that began with innocent piety and ended with atrocious  crimes. It is very important to know all the episodes, steps,  and details of this journey, for preventing and treating them.  This is turn must rest on the vital importance of youth being  able to join the mainstream of public life. If the young want to  talk politics, let them do it. If they want to talk about  religion, let them. If they want to get involved in politics,  religion, or athletics, let them. And in every field in which  the young get involved, let us ensure and insist that there be  total pluralism, and plenty of room of argument and debate.    "This means that the government should stop fearing  pluralism  in the broad sense of the word. All the extremist groups need in  order to recruit these innocents, is that there be no  alternatives, active or intellectual, for them to express their  legitimate needs.    "Egyptian emotions and minds must be reopened; the minds, so  that they can engage in issues of the present and future, and  the emotions so that they may become more compassionate and  sympathetic.    "The official totalitarian thinking that societies use paves  the way for another totalitarian idea, opposed to state  policies. There are many examples of this, chiefly what has  happened in the former Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia. They went  from being fierce communists to being even fiercer fascists,  from leftist totalitarianism to racist and fascist  totalitarianism."  <H5>  Useful and Significant </H5>   Professor of Sociology, Dr. Hasan al-Sa'ati, adds that the  confessions of the repentant terrorist are useful and  significant, and that we should emphasize such dialogues in  order to help correct the mistaken ideas of youth, with which  these groups tempt them.    Dr. Hasan Sa'ati believes it is necessary to take advantage  of the terrorist's remarks--especially his saying that it was  economic and social problems that moved him and those like him  along that road. "The government must work diligently to solve  the problems of unemployment and intellectual vacuity among  youth with religious awareness and the sound preaching of  clerics who have a correct knowledge of religion."    Dr. Hasan Sa'ati recommends the confiscation of the books  and  memoranda the terrorists use; religious scholars should respond  to them and refute the glaring errors they contain regarding  religion and society.  <H5>  The Return of Debates </H5>   Dr. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim, president of the Committee on  Religious Affairs in the People's Assembly and vice rector of  al-Azhar University, says, "What the young penitent says about  the absence of preachers is the truth. There is no genuine,  realistic, systematic, dialogue with the young. Religious  scholars have not sat down and talked with them, especially  recently. In the early 1980's, there were serious dialogues in  which religious scholars such as Dr. Musa Lashin, Dr. Ahmad  Haykal, Dr. al-Ahmadi Abu-al-Nur, and the late Dr. Mrhammad  al-Tayyib al-Najjar, took part. These dialogues, initiated by  Major General Hasan Abu-Basha, bore fruit--I do not know why  these public debates ceased. Why did they turn into public  parties to which members of local parties and a large number of  attendees, who had no wish for dialogue, were invited? The same  well-known, unchanging people spoke."    Dr. 'Umar Hashim says that: "there are books containing  erroneous ideas, and the publishing of them should stop, and  they should be corrected. There are other books, which do not  contain errors, but which are interpreted erroneously by the  young. The repentant youth read these books with his own  understanding; but science should be studied with scholars, not  taken from the newspapers. This was the error for which he was  responsible.    "The lesson to be learned from these confessions is for us  to  fill the mosques with qualified teachers; a mosque without a  qualified teacher would be better off shut down, instead of  producing erroneous and destructive thought.  <H5>  Society's Responsibility </H5>   Prof. Fahmi Huwaydi believes that the youth said, at the  outset, that he had not found anything in the school curriculum  that satisfied his wish to acquire knowledge; this was the  responsibility of the teaching curriculum, which is incapable of  arming our children with the minimum of knowledge needed to  protect them from erroneous thinking. He also understood from  his remarks that the mosques were not carrying out their role in  creating awareness among youth. The question is: why has this  happened at this time?    He added that the youth spoke of the "caravans of  consciousness-raising" that imposed their views, and had become  a failed bureaucratic exercise. He pointed out that the  unemployed youth had got married and was given a house, which  confirmed the existence of a social dimension to the problem.  The fact that the young man said he was ready to die poses an  important question about who is responsible for giving youths a  cause for them to defend and for which they would die.    Fahmi Huwaydi believes that this statement gives society the  greater responsibility of creating a national dream and goal for  youth. Society is responsible for many aspects of this problem,  such as unemployment, education, and guiding youth, failing to  give legitimacy to Islamic action, the deterioration of the  school curriculum, and the attacks on al-Azhar as a religious  institution, which undermined young people's confidence in its  scholars. "We must always read these confessions in the context  of societal self-criticism, not cheering the mistakes of these  young people or others. We must seek out the true causes of this  phenomenon. As to books that contain erroneous thinking, they  are a symptom, not the disease itself, otherwise why did this  thinking appear at this particular time, when those books have  been around for years?"  <H5>  Dialogue With Youth </H5>   Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin believes that "the repentant  terrorist's confessions are proof of our failure, because we  have ignored this phenomenon for 17 years. Then this youth comes  along and redeems himself with his words. What strikes us is  that we did not do enough talking with these young people  before they got mixed up in these groups. Perhaps the  methods that proved dialogue spurious illustrate their  corruption now. How often we thought we were communicating with  young people, when we were just fooling ourselves, and  abandoning them to those people who would estrange them from the  right path."    Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin defends the role of the mosques,  asserting that "there were always people there who were  communicating with the young, but they accused scholars either  of blasphemy or of being government clerics. What the repentant  youth said about the lack of a clerical role was an incitement,  slanderous and false, because the clerics existed, but the young  people did not want to see them.    As to what the youth said about the books he read, this  confirms--says Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin--that, "he did not know  the contents of truly Islamic books; all he knew were these  suspect books. I accuse him and others of not having understood  Ibn-Taymiyah's books, and those of media leaders whom he called  responsible for lies and ignorance, of having drawn them to  where they ended up. This is a mistaken idea--dwarfs do not  compete with imams for stature."  <H5>  Extending the Invitation </H5>   Dr. Ahmad Shalabi, professor of Islamic Civilization, says  that the events cited by the repentant terrorist in his  confessions have nothing to do with Islam. They only show how  far these terrorists have strayed from the right  path--especially what he said about iddat [the waiting period  prescribed by Islam before a widow or divorcee may remarry],  even though there are clear and substantial texts that set it  out. Also, in the procedure for declaring certain things to be  licit--they set out their own rules for dealing with other  people, despite the rules Islam has established to protect  property, blood, and honor.    Dr. Ahmad Shalabi emphasizes the need to invite these  terrorists to return to rationality, and to repent, and to leave  the wrong path they were following. "Their destructive ideas  should be confronted with the publication of religious books by  senior scholars known for their enlightened religious thinking."  <H5>  The Koran and the Sunnah </H5>   Prominent writer Sa'd-al-Din Wahbah says that "the young  man's confessions were not new--information had been leaked from  terrorists themselves in the past, about the multiplicity of  wives, without the legal iddat period, plus the legitimacy of  non-Muslims' money. None of these matters are new. The books he  talks about, they too are well-known, and everybody reads them.  The error is that they were not discussed on television and the  radio and the symposiums of the Ministry of Awqaf. There is  actually a lack of discussion of the books of al-Mawdudi,  Ibn-Taymiyah, and Sayyid Qutb.    "But if this young man found in these books the one course  for his Islam, then he must see the error in this, because the  original and true sources are the Koran and the Sunnah. The  strange thing is that this young man did not say, in his  confessions, that he had read the Koran or the traditions of the  Prophet. Even when he spoke of the legitimizing process, he  mentioned that he had read a book by Shaykh al-Ghazali, despite  the fact that the solution to that problem is found in the Koran  and the Sunnah. Therefore, he is not innocent of deliberately  misleading himself and others. When he was speaking of his  return to decency, he said that he had read the story of the  prophet leaving the money of the Quraysh [tribe] with 'Ali  Ibn-Abi-Talib. This comes up in many books on the sayings of the  Prophet, and the Koran--above all--speaks of the custody of  trusts."    "The useful lessons of these confessions," says Sa'd-al-Din  Wahbah, "are that we should let young people interpret the Koran  as they choose in schools. We must talk to them. There is also a  shortcoming in the role of the media, the mosques, and public  debates in resisting this erroneous ideas held by some young  people; this young man says that he restored himself  to the path of good sense."  <H5>  Not New </H5>   Prominent broadcaster Amal Fahmi says that what the  repentant  terrorist said in his confessions was not new. She had heard it  before from the families of young men who had broken away from  society and left their homes for these groups. What was new, was  that one of the actual members of these groups confirmed the  extent of error and delusion in the world of these groups.    Amal Fahmi adds that dialogue brought up many facts about  their groupings, the books they used as references and primary  sources for their religious information; so it was up to the  Ministry of Awqaf to take control of the smaller mosques and  religious establishments [the extremists] control, and motivate  the imams and preachers who have a high degree of enlightened  Islamic culture so that they can refute the extremists,  confiscate the books filled with ruinous and destructive ideas  upon which they rely, and stiffen the punishments for the  printers that printed them."</p>

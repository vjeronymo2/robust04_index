			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Usborne Pounds 13.2m in the red and calls for Pounds 6m Usborne, the grain trading and pig production group, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 13.2m for the year to June 30 against profits of Pounds 1.6m in the previous 18 months following a change in the company's year-end. The company's auditors qualified its accounts because of lack of information on the pig division's stock and fixed assets at the outset of the year. Usborne's chairman, Lord Parkinson, former cabinet minister, also announced a 4-for-3 rights issue to raise Pounds 6m towards paying down debt. The issue is fully underwritten by Thomson Investments, the engineering group, which has a 50.1 per cent stake in the company. Mr John Aiken, finance director, said that the rights issue will enable Usborne to reduce its gearing levels to close to 50 per cent by June. Poor trading conditions in the pig division were exacerbated by a loss of management control in pigs a year ago which left the company with insufficient records to provide the auditors with all the information they needed. Mr Michael Adams, managing director, said: 'We don't like the qualification of the results, but it's a reality. We now have every confidence in the new pig management.' Mr Adams is refocusing the company on its core business in grain trading where it made a profit of Pounds 963,000 (Pounds 2.92m) on turnover of Pounds 183m (Pounds 269m). He is halving pig numbers to 9,000 to concentrate on a contract to provide the Malton Bacon factory with pigs which runs for another 5 1/2 years. 'There are opportunities in the agribusiness sector which we want to take advantage of,' Mr Adams said. The grain business will be expanded with more offices around the country and the company has agreed with Associated British Ports to import and handle fertiliser through a new facility at Southampton Docks. Turnover amounted to Pounds 218m (Pounds 312m), with Pounds 206m (Pounds 186m) from continuing operations. Losses per share emerged at 16.16p against earnings of 2.05p. The shares rose by 1/2p yesterday to 6 1/2p.</p>

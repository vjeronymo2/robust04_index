			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Collapse of bus group prompts MMC probe The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate bus services in the north-east of England after the collapse of the municipally owned Darlington Transport two weeks ago. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday called for an investigation of services in the area. The commission will have six months to make its report to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The Office of Fair Trading emphasised that the investigation would look at all bus services, but Sir Bryan said he was particularly concerned about an offer of free fares by Busways Travel Services, part of Stagecoach Holdings. This was one of the reasons for the demise of Darlington Transport, which is in administration. The monopolies review represents another clash between Stagecoach and the competition authorities over the tactics adopted by the Perth-based company to further its ambitious expansion plans. The OFT has launched a number of investigations into potential monopolies in the bus system since the deregulation of the industry outside London in 1985. Stagecoach, the biggest UK bus operator, has been subject to 20 investigations and received three adverse rulings. Mr Brian Souter, Stagecoach chairman, denied that the company was anti-competitive and said he welcomed the monopolies inquiry in the north-east. He said: 'Our aim is to increase bus usage by improving the service quality for passengers. We do this by investing in new buses, offering a comprehensive network and introducing new services and selective discounts.' The OFT said the investigation would look at competition between bus companies in Tyne and Wear, County Durham and Cleveland following complaints from other bus operators about Busways. The allegations include predatory pricing and putting excessive numbers of buses on a particular route to force competitors to withdraw from the market in Darlington and South Shields. Sir Bryan said: 'I believe that (the Busways' free fares) offer may have contributed to the decision of Darlington Transport to cease operating. Efficiency of operation should determine who should provide the service, not possession of the resources to oust competitors.' Mr David Walsh, chairman of Cleveland County Council's transport committee, called for a meeting of local bus companies to avoid 'a full-scale bus war' in the county. If the MMC finds that there is a monopoly which acts against the public interest Mr Heseltine has the power to order the abuses to be remedied or to ask the OFT to obtain undertakings from the offending company that it will not be repeated.</p>

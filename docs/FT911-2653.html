			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Tania Maria - Royal Festival Hall In her small black sunglasses, short black dress and stilettos, a headset mike fitted around the razor cheekbones, Tania Maria totters on to the stage like a formidable adversary for Mad Max's Tina Turner. She looks as though she means business. The Brazilian singer/pianist's business is hot Latin fusion and on Thursday it came fast and tight as ever. It was the last night of a European tour and, according to the salsasavants, she is at her at 'pre-New York best'. This presumably means that the melodies are uncomplicated and the rhythm, borne by congas, drums and bass, uncompromising. The carnival fireworks are in the voice and the streaming wordless vocals and scatting. Or even whistling (she trilled a complicated 10-minute salsa version of 'Do you think I'm sexy?'). Whistling jazz fusion and getting away with it is one thing: any singer who can make a Royal Festival Hall audience dance has spirit. But the steaming mix of rock and Latin jazz, cranked up by horn and trumpet, was completely irresistible. The Maria method can be applied to any number, 'Ce c'est bon', a carnival stomper fitted in perfectly with an unlikely, but sizzling version of the Stones' 'Satisfaction', carried off bolero style. 'Hup]' the changes are signalled as she comes crashing down the keyboard, cheeks sucked into an impossible pout and out pour the words. She crouches at the keyboards (one is electric) and telegraphs the cues to her slavish accompanists in between batting the lyric around with her hands as it tumbles forth. Block chords are plonked in, when she can restrain her hands, to keep the careering voice on course. It did the trick. By the end of the set more than a few of us were doing the merengue, elbows akimbo, down the gangway to meet the po-faced ushers in front of the stage. 'I'm very happy - a little homesick - but I think we done a very good concert,' Tania concluded modestly as she left an RFH crying out for more. Three hours earlier singer Cleveland Watkiss was taking the stage in support of Tania Maria. Showcasing a splendid new album, Blessing in disguise (Polydor), the young black Londoner has a style and voice which could be mass marketed to a wider than jazz audience. That seems to be the idea, anyhow. But a fine Guildhall-trained voice is no guarantee of commercial success. My feeling is that he is too hard to pin down - and too crafty with the grooves - to appeal to non-jazzers. Like a junior jazz version of Taj Mahal, he has absorbed almost the entire range of black music from calypso and reggae ('Bagah-Orange') to George Bensonesque schmooze ('Memories'). It is clever stuff alright and the six piece band behind him, led by guitarist Tony Remy, are spot on. But it is worth noting that the biggest cheers - led by his mother - were for a straight Motown soul sounding ballad which is pure Marvin Gaye, 'Be Thankful for what you got'.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GOLIA SEXTET BATTLES AMBIANCE AT AL'S BAR  </P> <P> "We're going to play a ballad now so you can hear the pinball machine,"  announced Vinny Golia midway through his opening set at Al's Bar in downtown  Los Angeles. That statement summed up the problems facing the local jazz  saxophonist's sextet during its uneven, hourlong performance.  </P> <P> With the band sandwiched between electronic game noises on one side and pool  table chatter and clatter on the other Sunday, any delicate musical passages  faced serious environmental obstacles. And the unforgiving cement walls meant  that drummer Alex Cline usually (and inadvertently) overwhelmed the band with  volume whenever he attempted to do more than serve as the ensemble's rhythmic  anchor.  </P> <P> Golia's compositions featured long, angular themes that usually resolved in  unexpected and intriguing harmonies from the saxophone-trombone-trumpet front  line. The pieces were laced with counter-melodies, which occasionally led to  delightful passages like the funky trombone, drum and piano riff supporting Ken  Filiano's bowed bass solo on "Not Used."  </P> <P> But Golia miscalculated by focusing too much on playing soprano sax when his  rich, robust tone on tenor tapped into a deeply spiritual vein which merited  more extensive exploration. That was only one example of a set where fine  individual components -- notably the subtle color and textural variations  introduced by Cline's percussion and Wayne Peet's electric keyboards -- fell  out of sync as often as they jelled.

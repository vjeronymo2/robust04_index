			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Siemens gains stake in Thai rail contract A joint venture of Germany's Siemens group and Italian-Thai Development, the leading Thai construction company, was yesterday awarded a turnkey contract worth Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 705m) - excluding financing costs - to build what is expected to be Bangkok's first urban rail system. The consortium signed the agreement with Bangkok Transit System Corp (BTSC), a subsidiary of Thailand's Tanayong property group. Tanayong has a 30-year concession to build and operate two elevated rail lines with a total length of 24km. Bangkok has no mass transit network for its citizens other than buses, and the city's traffic jams are notorious. But like all big transport projects in the capital, BTSC's planned railway has been dogged by delays and controversy. Successive governments have failed to cater to Bangkok's transport needs or to reconcile conflicts between rival projects. Financing for the BTSC project from Deutsche Bank, KfW, the International Finance Corp and other lenders has yet to be finalised, and BTSC says the conditional offer of a financing package from the German-Thai consortium will expire at the end of August if negotiations are not completed. But the project was given a boost this week when Mr Chatri Sophonpanich, executive chairman of Bangkok Bank, South-East Asia's largest bank, announced his support. Mr Chatri's sister, Chodchoy, has spearheaded a protest against the elevated railway on environmental grounds, although BTSC's supporters say the streets of Bangkok are already so unattractive and polluted that the project will not make much difference and may even reduce air pollution as the trains are electrically powered. Mr Wolfram Martinsen, president of Siemens Transportation Systems Group, said just under half of the contract value would go to Italthai for civil works, with the rest going to Siemens for the rolling stock, power supply and other items. Trains would be provided by Siemens' subsidiary Duewag. BTSC says the system, with 25 stations and 102 carriages in three-carriage sets, will be able to carry 700,000 passengers a day. 'The elevated system will provide travellers with a new and exciting view of Bangkok while carrying them above the traffic jams and floods which daily waste our resources and drain the travelling public's energy,' said Mr Anat Arbhabhirama, BTSC president.</p>

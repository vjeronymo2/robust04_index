			<p>BFN     [Text] The Governments of the Lao People's Democratic  Republic [LPDR] and the Union of Myanmar [Burma] signed three  cooperation agreements on the morning of 11 June in the presence  of His Excellency [H.E.] Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the  LPDR, and H.E. General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and  Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union of Myanmar, and  witnessed by the official delegations from the two sides.    Respectively representing the Lao and Myanmar sides in  signing the agreement on tourism cooperation were H.E. Somsavat  Lengsavat, LPDR foreign affairs minister, and H.E. Brigadier  General Abel, minister of planning and economic development of  the Union of Myanmar. The other two agreements -- the agreement  regarding the establishment of a joint Lao-Myanmar commission  for cooperation and the LPDR-Union of Myanmar governmental  agreement on the permanent international boundary along the  Mekong River between the two countries -- were signed by H.E.  Somsavat Lengsavat and H.E. U Ohn Gyaw, foreign minister of the  Union of Myanmar.    The contents of the agreement on tourism cooperation between  the governments of the two countries stipulates that the two  sides agree to create conditions to facilitate long-term  cooperation in tourism development for mutual benefit. The two  sides will provide conveniences to citizens of the two countries  and those of third countries as individual persons or in groups  in travelling from Laos into the Union of Myanmar or from the  Union of Myanmar into Laos for tourism purposes by relying on  the laws of each country and in accordance with international  practices. The Lao Government assigns the National Tourism  Organization and the Government of the Union of Myanmar assigns  the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism to be in charge of  implementing [the agreement] and providing conveniences to each  other in opening offices of tourism representatives in one  another's country on the basis of the valid laws of the country  concerned. At the same time, the two sides will encourage one  another to exchange lessons and documents on the organization,  management, administration, and operation of tourism businesses  and assist one another in training personnel in the tourism  sector.    The agreement on the establishment of a joint commission for  cooperation stipulates that with a desire to increase and  strengthen firmer and lasting relations and cooperation between  the two sides, to reaffirm the wishes of each side in  strengthening the ties and cooperation between the two  countries, with a desire to further strengthen the existing  relations of friendship, and to promote the development of  bilateral cooperation between the two countries on the basis of  the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for each  other's sovereignty, the two governments have agreed that the  two sides will set up a joint commission to facilitate  consultations and cooperation between the two countries,  especially in the economic, trade, scientific, social, cultural,  and other fields of mutual interests. The said commission is  charged with exploring and finding ways and methods aimed at  promoting the said objectives and with ensuring appropriate  coordination and the implementation of the various resolutions  and agreements, including this agreement.    With regard to the governmental agreement on the permanent  international boundary between the two countries along the  Mekong River, the signatories to the agreement have agreed that  beginning on the day the agreement becomes valid, the boundary  between the LPDR and the Union of Myanmar will be permanently  fixed in accordance with the present conditions of the Mekong  River, which have been surveyed and demarcated by the joint  Lao-Myanmar waterways survey team, regardless of any changes  which may later occur in this river. The boundary between the  two countries is 236 kilometers long and is demarcated by 86  border posts on each side of the boundary which was jointly  surveyed by the two sides beginning in January 1991 and ending  in 1993. The agreement also stressed the safeguarding of the  boundary between the two countries in which the signatories will  employ appropriate measures to maintain and protect the boundary  demarcation posts located in their respective territories in  order to prevent their removal, degradation, and destruction.  At the same time, the signatories also agreed that neither side  can carry out navigational operations or utilize the currents of  the Mekong River or water on the side of their international  boundary for industrial purposes, drainage, storage, irrigation,  hydroelectricity generation, and other purposes which may bring  losses to the interest of the other side. In dealing with this  problem, the signatories will continue to closely work together  for mutual interests by utilizing the Mekong River in a correct  and fair manner. This agreement also defines the rights to  navigation along the Mekong River which is the boundary between  the two countries. The rights to navigation of the signatories  will be totally guaranteed even though changes may later occur  along the navigation route of the said river. In addition, the  agreement also stipulates that if boats or nationals of a  signatory country are in danger or broken in the Mekong River  belonging to the other side, that side must provide needed  assistance at all times to the boats, navigators, crew members,  and passengers as well as cargo on those boats. The signatories  also agreed that all materials collected from the boats which  are in danger or broken will not be charged with any customs  duties and fees provided that they are not used in each other's  country.</p>

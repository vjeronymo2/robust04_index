			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones report: "Air Raids May Not Be Over, Says </F> Major"]    [Text] Mr Major gave warning yesterday that NATO would  launch more air strikes against Bosnian Serbs if they continued  attacking safe areas such as Gorazde. "Close air support will  remain available to UN commanders. They will be able to call on  it again if they consider it necessary," the Prime Minister told  the Commons. "There will be no loss of nerve here or, I hope,  anywhere else."    Speaking during Question Time, he said he hoped the Serbs  would learn a lesson from what had happened "so that further use  of close air support is unnecessary."    Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, stressed that UN  forces were not taking sides. "They do not intend to be drawn  into open-ended intervention for or against any of the parties.  But the international community will not tolerate attacks on  Unprofor (UN Protection Forces), and attacks on the safe areas  must cease," he said.    The NATO air strikes received all-party backing, though some  MPs were concerned that Russia had not been consulted in  advance. Mr Hurd said in a statement that he was in touch with  Mr Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister "about the  important Russian role in this effort."    He later said: "If you're going to take air action of this  kind...it has to be done quickly. This took 44 minutes between  the request and the action. It is precisely because of the need  for speed that both the UN and NATO agreed procedures which  allowed for speed. That of course, did not mean that member  states could be consulted in advance."    Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said  Labour accepted the strikes were authorised by the UN Security  Council but questioned why it took two weeks to act.    Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the air  strikes were necessary to support the authority of the UN and  for the protection of UN peacekeepers. He said the West must  keep its nerve, maintain its military determination and increase  diplomatic pressure.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The FRG Economics Ministry is in  favor of clearly reducing wages for relatively unskilled work  and improving them with subsidies from unemployment insurance or  other social benefits. This proposal was made by Economics  State Secretary Johannes Eekhoff in Bonn on Tuesday [9 March]  with a view to the employment conference of the seven leading  industrial states [G-7] in Detroit on 14-15 March.    Eekhoff, who is preparing the conference for the German  side,  pointed to experiences in the United States. Unemployment  benefits there are only 35 percent of the previous salary and is  paid for only half a year. This exerts massive pressure on the  unemployed to accept any job that pays less. "We do not want  that," Eekhoff said. However, in Germany, too, one must have a  more sensible combination of lower wages and social benefits.  This need not necessarily be a citizen's money [Buergergeld],  which unites all social benefits.    Eekhoff does not expect any specific decisions from the  conference of the economics, finance, and labor ministers of the  G-7 countries United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France,  Italy,and Canada in Detroit. There will not be a joint  communique. The point is to learn from each other. Thus, the  conference can provide stimuli for a new dynamism for growth and  employment, he said.    For the German side it is interesting to hear how the United  States has created many jobs over the past years despite a  relatively low growth and why unemployment in Japan is still  relatively low in international comparison. Germany has been  asked for a report about dual vocational training, which is seen  as a reason for the relatively low youth unemployment in Germany.    The G-7 conference is to be opened with a speech by U.S.  President Bill Clinton, who suggested the conference at the G-7  economic summit in Tokyo in summer 1993. Then there follow five  two-hour rounds of talks of the ministers about all aspects of  the labor market crisis, from tax polity to technology issues to  wage policy. These topics are also to be discussed further at  the next economic summit in Naples in July.</p>

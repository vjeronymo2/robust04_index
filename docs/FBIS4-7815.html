			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Jakov Gelo, director of the </F> State Bureau for Statistics; place and date not given: "I Am  Afraid of Emigration of the Croats"]    [Text] [DANAS] What are the possible demographic  consequences of the Croatian-Muslim federation and confederation?    [Gelo] I consider the internal arrangement of federal Bosnia  and Herzegovina very important in this regard. Unless the  boundaries between the two nationalities are relatively  well-drawn, that is, unless the space belonging to the  respective nationality is set off so that the Croats have their  sovereignty in a specified part, we can expect emigration of  Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The central government in  Sarajevo need not be supreme to cause that: economic reasons  will be paramount in motivating Croats to leave Bosnia and  Herzegovina, as they have up to now. Unless Croatia is able to  conduct a differentiated economic and demographic policy toward  the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina where the Croats live, that  is, unless there are special economic relations between the  Croatian cantons and the Croatian state, over the next 10 years,  while a true market is coming to life, we could lose all the  Croats in Bosnia. That is why as a demographer and statistician  I consider it very important to have precise territorial and  political definition of the area and rights of the Croats in  Bosnia and Herzegovina where as a sovereign nation they will  decide the essential matters concerning their future.    [DANAS] How do you make the case for that fear?    [Gelo] The area where the Muslims live is the most heavily  populated, but not the most highly developed. Two-thirds of the  population of Bosnia and Herzegovina live in that area.  Demographic trends show that the Muslims will continue to  increase numerically. Unless there are precisely defined  limitations on moving from one place to another, the Muslims  will spread not only to the territory of the federation, but  even to the territory of the confederation, that is, Croatia.  They will have a hard time integrating with the Croats, because  in religion, customs, and culture they belong to a different  cultural context. Experiences in the past show that with respect  to those criteria the Croats and Serbs are closer than the  Croats and the Muslims. And when it comes to moving from one  place to another, certain restrictions have to be set up between  the cantons in the federation, not only concerning the Muslims,  but this should also be done concerning the Croats from Bosnia  and Herzegovina. They are the smallest nationality in Bosnia and  Herzegovina, they live in the least developed area, they have a  less promising demographic trend than the Muslims, and they  naturally tend to move to the parent state. That is why from the  economic standpoint Croatia must fight for its right to bypass  the central Bosnian government in its relations with the  particular cantons. Unless it succeeds in doing that, this  federal-confederal framework will result in disappearance of the  Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a threat to the present  composition of the population in Croatia.    [DANAS] What would be the ethnic composition of that  confederation?    [Gelo] The confederation would have a population of 7.5  million: 4.5 million Croats, 1.9 million Muslims, 500,000 Serbs,  and the remainder are other nationalities (see the table [not  translated]). So, the Croats would represent about 60 percent in  that community of states. Demographic developments, which cannot  change in a few years, but only over decades, indicate that the  non-Croats will have a stronger population growth, which in time  could have the result that there are more non-Croats than  Croats, which means a threat to the stability and survival of  the Croatian state. Regardless of the war, Croatia has a decline  in population, for two years now there have been more deaths  than births. And the demographic process, as I said, cannot be  changed that fast.    [DANAS] But what if the Bosnian Serbs join the federation  and  then the confederation?    [Gelo] Add to that number of 7.5 million the 1.3 million  Bosnian Serbs, and if we take into account demographic processes  which are unfavorable for the Croats, the Croats would very soon  be a minority in that structure.    [DANAS] What needs to be done to change the process?    [Gelo] A population policy, which has been lacking up to  now,  has to be established in order to correct those negative  demographic trends. And then a migration policy to distribute  the population on economic and strategic grounds. The Adriatic  islands, parts of Slavonia, and the Lika Plateau have a trend of  population loss. We also need to include the return of Croats,  for example, from Kosovo, from Vojvodina, Kotor Bay, Romania,  Hungary....    [DANAS] How do you evaluate the Washington agreement as a  whole?    [Gelo] If it is implemented and if the sovereign Croatian  cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina are not delineated, and if the  right of the Muslims to move into those cantons or to Croatia is  not limited, and then if Croats are not prevented from moving  out of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Washington agreement is a bad  decision from the demographic standpoint. It most likely will  cause a new wave of emigration of Croats not only Bosnia and  Herzegovina, but also from Croatia, because renewal not only of  its country, but also of the much more devastated Bosnia, will  be placed on Croatia's shoulders. Unfortunately, those are the  indications of the science of demography.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Food: Haute cuisine fights to survive - The dangers facing a classic style of cooking CHEF David Wilson has been extolling the virtues of stews, casseroles and braised oxtail - dishes not particularly associated with restaurant dining rooms in Britain nowadays. Wilson, chef/proprietor of the Peat Inn, Fife, applauded their return to popularity at a conference for Scottish chefs. His speech came just two months after another exponent of such dishes, Antony Worrall Thompson, proposed at the annual chefs' conference in Birmingham that 'Haute cuisine is dead.' His audience of 104 chefs, schooled in classical French cooking and trained predominantly in hotel kitchens, defeated the motion 101-3. The simple explanation for the size of this majority can only be that these chefs were too preoccupied with their stocks, sauces and demi-glaces to see what is happening front of house. For in the present economic climate, haute cuisine may not be dead but it is fighting for life. Around Britain, there are certain restaurateurs doing the kind of business others only dream about. In spite of the recession, you have to book well in advance for a table at Kensington Place, Clarke's or the Greenhouse in London; the Ubiquitous Chip in Glasgow; or the Walnut Tree Inn at Abergavenny. Their foods and wines are good and their prices reasonable. But the size of the bill is only one factor. Restaurants are public places where conspicuous consumption, the theme of the 1980s but the antithesis of the 1990s, takes place. As a result, the most expensive restaurants specialising in haute cuisine are not part of the same industry which most restaurant-goers frequent. They are in the luxury market alongside Rolls-Royces, hand-made suits or a costly cuvee from a top champagne house. As managing directors, eyeing static company sales, forsake their expensive cars and cut back on champagne - the UK champagne market was down 34 per cent in 1991 - so they will be less likely to want to be seen on their way to the nearest three-star restaurant. Top French chefs and restaurateurs counter with two arguments. First, the principles of haute cuisine must be pursued in order that the discipline of cooking can progress. Second, haute cuisine has already seen off various challenges ranging from nouvelle cuisine to the anti-butter lobby. But, as well as running the risk of ignoring their customers, they ignore science, economics and developing tastes, too. The principles of haute cuisine were laid down by Auguste Escoffier early in the 20th century; since then these principles have been developed but not seriously challenged. Today, the impetus for challenging them comes not from the kitchen but from the laboratory, as Harold McGee shows in his fascinating new book The Curious Cook (HarperCollins Pounds 15.99). The economic factors are even more compelling. There will simply be fewer and fewer restaurateurs able to swallow the huge capital and running costs involved in opening a new top French-style restaurant. Significantly, London's two newest restaurants offering haute cuisine, the Mirabelle and Les Saveurs (where, at a recent dinner, the customer/staff ratio was 1:3), have been opened by wealthy Japanese businessmen obviously able to adopt their characteristically long-term view to such an investment. There will also be fewer chefs able to travel the world extolling the virtues of this style of cooking. In the 1970s and '80s, the world was keen to swallow everything the top French chefs could put before it. There was a travelling circus which included, among others, Messieurs Bocuse, Verge and Blanc, who could afford to leave their stoves to preach the gospel in London, New York or Tokyo. But the latest generation of top French chefs does not have this opportunity. If they travel, each has to be replaced in his kitchen by someone equally skilled and salaried. It makes more sense to stay home and cook. History could, however, supply the final nail in the coffin of haute cuisine. For generations, chefs from all over the world have learnt their skills the French way, honed them with an occasional 'stage' in a top French kitchen and aimed at copying the very best which only the French could do. Now, a new generation of chefs around the world - in Britain, America, Australia, Germany and Japan - has the confidence to experiment, and the means (via television, cheap travel and a global market for the best produce) to create new dishes which their customers enjoy and can afford. Today, the cuisine which is the most adaptable, and considered to be the most beneficial to our health, comes not from France but from Italy  - the country from which France imported all the best cooks in Europe 450 years ago.</p>

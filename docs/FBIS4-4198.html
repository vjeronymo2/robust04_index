			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Bata Ercang (1572 1044 1422 0221)] </F>   [Text] Ulaabaatar, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- After holding talks  at the State Palace, visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng and  Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray told the press on the morning  of 29 April that they highly appraised the results of the talks  and the Sino- Mongolian Treaty of Friendly Relations and  Cooperation to be signed soon.    The two premiers agreed that the talks proceeded in a  friendly and cordial atmosphere. Both sides exchanged views on  bilateral relations and on international issues of common  interest. When the late Premier Zhou Enlai visited Mongolia 34  years ago, he concluded the Sino-Mongolian Friendship and Mutual  Aid Treaty. The new Sino- Mongolian Treaty of Friendly  Relations and Cooperation to be signed soon will lay the legal  foundation for bilateral relations. Both sides will also sign a  series of bilateral documents on specific cooperation issues.  The talks were fruitful.</p>

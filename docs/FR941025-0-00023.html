			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Boeing states that the effect of specifying Maintenance Manual page numbers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision dates in the AD is that operators may be unable to use the procedure contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Maintenance Manual to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD that would allow the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current version of the Maintenance Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, the FAA finds that specific reference to page numbers and dates of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing 737 Maintenance Manual should not be specified in paragraph (a) of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. However, for that paragraph, the FAA does not agree that copies of the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures should be included in the final rule. Therefore, paragraph (a) of the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been revised to cite only the appropriate section specified in the Maintenance Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for accomplishment of the tests required by that paragraph. The procedures specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that section of the Maintenance Manual contain the appropriate tests recommended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer for verification of the proper operation of the thrust reverser system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the FAA would consider requests from individual operators for approval of use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of alternative test procedures, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Subsequent to the issuance of the proposal and the receipt of Boeing's comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the operational tests of the sync-lock integrity following its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation. The FAA has included these procedures in paragraph (d) of the final rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, the Maintenance Manual references specified in paragraph (d) of the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been removed from the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> One commenter requests that the compliance times be expressed in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycles, instead of operating hours, since degradation of the thrust reverser system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to cycles. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that the simplest expression  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of compliance times for purposes of this AD is in terms of a specific number of hours of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation at which compliance is required for affected airplanes. The FAA based this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination on the fact that the maintenance program for these airplanes is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating hours, the Maintenance Manual specifies compliance in terms of operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours, and the maintenance program is based on operating hours. Further, recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance intervals reflected in a safety assessment completed for the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane/engine combination were expressed in terms of hours time-in-service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Two commenters request that the proposed 5-year compliance time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishing the sync-lock installation be revised to 6 years to allow airplanes to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified during scheduled heavy maintenance visits. The FAA does not concur with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters' requests to extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time for this action, the FAA considered the safety implications, parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability, and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification. In consideration of these items, as well as input from the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regard to parts availability, and industry representatives with regard to incorporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules, the FAA has determined that 5 years represents the maximum interval of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable wherein the modification can reasonably be accomplished and an acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of safety can be maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia faces Dollars 1.5bn US grain credits bill in 1994 Russia must keep up to date on payments falling due this year against US-backed grain loans to remain eligible to receive new US farm credits, a senior US official said yesterday. The payments, against Dollars 1.5bn owed to private banks but guaranteed by the US Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation, start falling due this week and extend through the year. Mr Chris Goldthwait, the USDA's general sales manager, said yesterday that so long as Russia remained current on its existing loan repayments it was technically eligible to receive new credits. However, the Russians have appeared to be cautious about increasing their debt for food purchases. 'The Russians have not requested further credit guarantees,' Mr Goldthwait said. 'In recent discussions, they have indicated that they would rather make their purchases with cash.' Russia spent much of 1993 in default on its US grain loans but became current at the end of the year through a series of payments arranged as part of the Paris Club's rescheduling of the country's overall foreign debt. A final Dollars 147.4m payment was made to the USDA last week. Russia's total debt to the USDA, including the Dollars 1.5bn due in 1994, is about Dollars 3.5bn. Grain traders hopes that President Clinton will offer a combination of farm credits and aid when he meets President Boris Yeltsin later this month are waning. Wheat futures for March delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade jumped more than 8 cents a 60lb bushel yesterday on news that China, long absent from the US market, had bid for 1.1m tonnes of US soft red winter wheat under the Export Enhancement Programme. The wheat would be delivered to China during January and February. Traders said that China's bid - Dollars 88.50 a tonne - would require a subsidy of as much as Dollars 60 a tonne at current prices. The results of the USDA tender are expected today.</p>

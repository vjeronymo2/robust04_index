			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: McDonnell unveils new design for jumbo jet MCDONNELL Douglas yesterday unveiled a radical new design for the MD-12 jumbo airliner it wants to develop with Asian financial backing to challenge Boeing's 747-400, which dominates the top end of the market. In a bold move to seize the commercial initiative, McDonnell has scrapped earlier plans for a three-engined aircraft in favour of a four-engined one, with two passenger levels. This means the 511-seat aircraft could be expanded into a stretched version accommodating more than 600 passengers - the largest on the market. Both Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie have been considering 'super jumbos' of this kind, but neither is committed to the aircraft. The MD-12 is considered crucial to McDonnell Douglas' future in airliners, as its current range consists of only two models. Analysts say that if the company, smallest of the three leading manufacturers, fails to get the new jet off the ground it will be doomed to inexorable decline. The company said the number of engines had been changed after consultations with airlines and to meet their needs for higher passenger capacity and more efficient operating economies. However, McDonnell insisted that the Dollars 5bn price tag which it had put earlier on development of the MD-12 had not been increased by the changes. The cash-strapped company cannot afford to finance the aircraft alone and is trying to persuade Asian nations to take a stake of up to 49 per cent.</p>

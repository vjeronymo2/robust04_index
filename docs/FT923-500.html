			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Shell metals business to emphasise mining side The Royal Dutch/Shell oil and gas group is to change the direction of its loss-making Billiton metals and mining business said Mr Paul Everard, an executive director of Billiton International Metals. Billiton, based in the Netherlands, suffered Dollars 12m (Pounds 7m) net losses last year which deepened to more than Dollars 35m in the first half of 1992. Billiton is to place 'a stronger focus' on its mining operations while the trading and marketing business would underpin mining. Billiton recently closed tin smelters in the Netherlands and Ireland and has effectively put a 'for sale' notice on most of its other downstream businesses. These include two in the UK: British Lead Mills and H J Enthoven, which between them account for about half the secondary lead production in the UK. The group's TDF Tiofine titanium dioxide pigment company in the Netherlands is for sale, as is Billiton's 35 per cent stake in the Aughinish alumina refinery in Ireland. Mr Everard said even if the 50 per cent-owned Budel smelter in the Netherlands resolved environmental problems, its gas supply contract ended in 1999. He said that Billiton was considering whether it should withdraw from ring-dealing membership of the London Metal Exchange and become an associate member instead. Associates had all the benefits of LME membership without taking the extra risk.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Economics Notebook: Payments and settlements 'Payment and settlement systems are to economic activity what roads are to traffic: necessary but typically taken for granted unless they cause an accident or bottlenecks develop.' So far, the world's payments and settlements systems have not caused any serious problems. But as the foregoing comment from the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements indicates, they have been climbing up the agenda of policy makers in central banks, banks and securities houses, over the past decade. The reason is fear that a breakdown in what has always been regarded as the unglamorous end of finance could trigger a massive crisis that would destabilise the world economy. Deregulation and globalisation have led to a spectacular growth in the value of financial transactions both inside countries and across borders. Since every transaction gives rise to obligations that need to be settled through a transfer of money between the parties involved, there has been a commensurate increase in pressure on payment and settlement systems. The figures associated with payments and settlements are mind boggling. The accompanying chart shows how the level of transactions in a year dwarfs economic output in the main industrial countries. In Japan, for example, the value of transfers of funds jumped from 20 times national output in 1980 to 120 times in 1990. On a busy day, the transactions handled by the UK's largest electronic payments and settlement clearing system (known as CHAPS for clearing house automated payment system) can amount to a quarter of the UK's annual gross domestic product. According to the BIS, it takes less than three business days for Japan's interbank funds transfer systems to generate turnover equivalent to the country's annual economic output. It takes just over three days in the US and about four days in Germany. The increase in the demand for payments and settlements services partly reflects an expansion of domestic money market transactions in many countries; partly the ballooning of foreign exchange market turnover, in line with globalisation, and partly the rapid growth and internationalisation of turnover in securities markets. The scale of liquidity and credit risks involved in the settlement process has increased accordingly. The risks have become especially concentrated in the world's banks. Not only have transactions grown in size, but the big companies that channel their payments through banks have come to expect that the funds be made available immediately to the recipients. Because of their payments role, banks have been providing ever greater overdrafts to customers in the course of a day's business. Big UK clearing banks have at times found the equivalent of their entire capital committed in temporary overdrafts by mid-morning. This need not matter if business flows normally. But in event of a failure the authorities could be confronted with a chain reaction that could jeopardise the world financial system. This 'systemic risk' explains why policy makers have become increasingly preoccupied with payments and settlements. Central banks of the Group of 10 countries have a committee on payment and settlement systems that meets regularly at the BIS in Basle. European Union central banks have a 'working group on EC payment systems' which is focusing on large-value interbank payments because these entail the biggest potential risks. In its report, the BIS observed that 'large and unpredictable exposures, together with limited information about their true size and distribution, make up the mixture which could spread and intensify financial shocks'. It painted a grim picture of possible financial meltdown with 'distress sales of assets, leading to general price declines and undermining the solvency of institutions.' There have already been scares in the world financial system, notably during the stock market crash of 1987. Big problems first surfaced in 1974 with the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt, a small German bank with a large scale foreign exchange business. Its closure took place after settlement of the D-Mark leg of foreign exchange transactions but before settlement of the dollar leg. Some of Herstatt's trading partners, faced with non-payment, refused to make payments on their own account or for customers. The result was a chain reaction, which sharply reduced transfers between banks. Simulations carried out on the CHIPS system, one of two US large value interbank transfer systems, have suggested that an unexpected settlement failure by a big participant could result in nearly half of all institutions being unable to settle transactions, with perhaps a third of the value of transactions left in limbo. The BIS has described 'a worst-case scenario' in which 'a vicious circle of induced defaults on settlement obligations, falling prices and insolvencies could ensue.' The good news is that work is well in hand to reduce settlement risks. Plans include the early introduction of 'real time gross settlement systems' which would eliminate the granting of involuntary credits through lags in payments, and 'delivery versus payments' arrangements to achieve the same objective in securities trading. But the fact that 'Herstatt risk' still exists 20 years after the eponymous bank failure shows how difficult progress can be.</p>

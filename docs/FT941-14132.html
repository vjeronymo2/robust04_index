			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gestetner sees red as exceptional Pounds 50m bites Exceptional charges of Pounds 50m sent Gestetner Holdings, the office and photographic equipment distributor, into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.2m in the year to October 31. This compared with profits of Pounds 27.1m last time. Most of the charges went on a restructuring programme flagged last May when Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, took a 15 per cent stake. Mr Greg Melgaard, managing director, said the restructuring would involve the loss of 600 jobs, mainly in Europe, reducing the workforce to just over 10,000. After twice failing to sell Vivitar, its US photographic distributor, the group had decided to retain the business. The group also said its margins were under pressure worldwide, with principal markets in Europe continuing to suffer from recession. Sales increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 1bn, but were only 1 per cent higher in constant currency terms. Trading profits from continuing operations before exceptional charges fell from Pounds 44m to Pounds 28.6m. Mr David Thomson, who joined Gestetner as chairman from Rank Xerox in August, said: 'Europe continues to suffer from the recession with only modest growth expected during 1994. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, but the outlook for North America and Latin America is more optimistic and Asia offers opportunities for significant growth.' Sales of office automation products rose by 3 per cent in constant currency terms to Pounds 812m, but trading profits decreased from Pounds 51m to Pounds 29m. Losses per share were 17.5p, compared with earnings of 12.1p last time. Before exceptionals, earnings fell to 5.8p (14.1p). The final dividend is cut from 6.4p to 1.2p, leaving a total for the year of 3p (8.2p). The directors said the reduction reflected the need to strengthen the balance sheet to support a recovery in the trading position through 1994. Net debt increased from Pounds 94.7m to Pounds 128.9m, raising gearing from 36 per cent to 66 per cent. The group said a significant reduction in debt was a management objective for the current year. COMMENT The new management is taking sensible steps to focus a previously decentralised business and reduce its cost base, but is being forced to grapple with tough conditions in Europe. Hanging on to Vivitar also recognises brute necessity, since there is little point in disposing of a profitable business for a paltry price. Forecast profits of up to Pounds 25m put the shares, down 2p to 159p , on a prospective multiple of 15.8. Most interest focuses on whether Inchcape will raise its stake to 26 per cent by exercising an option on convertible loan stock at 172p per share by July 1. It seem most likely Inchcape will pursue its strategic interest in the group, which would help the share price. However, the shares are unlikely to advance significantly until the new boardroom approach produces some solid trading results.</p>

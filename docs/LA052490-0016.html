			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: GLOW LITTLE GLOW WORM  </P> <P> I was walking down one of the aisles of the L.A. Convention Center the other  day when a woman thrust something into my hand and said, "Constipation  problems?"  </P> <P> I can't recall ever having been asked that in public by a stranger, and it took  me by surprise. Even my best friends don't ask if I have constipation problems.  </P> <P> "No," I said, leaning into her face, "how about you?"  </P> <P> Before she could answer, my wife stepped between us and said pleasantly, "So  good of you to ask, we'll just be on our way. Come, dear."  </P> <P> "Wait," I said, as Cinelli led me off, "we were discussing our constipation  problems."  </P> <P> "I know what you were discussing," she said, "and I want you to leave people  alone. Take notes but don't talk to anyone."  </P> <P> Then she added, "I swear to God, Martinez, if you didn't have a column you'd be  standing on a street corner somewhere swearing at passing motorists."  </P> <P> We were at the Time of Your Life Expo, which consisted of several hundred  exhibits aimed at those over 50, into which category I, alas, fall.  </P> <P> The Expo lasted three days and was attended by 46,000 old people with  constipation problems. The packet handed me was a sample package of a  bulk-forming laxative.  </P> <P> It was one of many samples distributed. Everything from balloons to sewing  kits. Old ladies snapped them up like anteaters at a termite hill, while a  piano played "Glow Little Glow Worm."  </P> <P> Man, I hate that song.  </P> <P> I have mixed feelings about getting old. I was devastated the first time a  movie theater ticket-taker gave me a senior citizens rate without asking. On  the other hand, it saved me $3, so I took it.  </P> <P> "I just don't have a lot of enthusiasm for anything old," I said to Cinelli as  we checked out the exhibits at the Time of Your Life Expo.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't worry about it," she said. "You've never had a lot of enthusiasm  for anything. I can't ever remember seeing you happy."  </P> <P> An exhibitor asked if I would like to be tested for dry mouth. Cinelli answered  for me.  </P> <P> "No thank you," she said, "his mouth seems sufficiently wet." Then she said to  me, "See how easy it is to be polite, Little Glow Worm?"  </P> <P> We took a pamphlet that said dry mouth is the hidden cause of gum disease. Dry  eyes, I learned later, is also a problem of aging.  </P> <P> As you get older, your juices go. It's part of a withering-away process, like  buckeye trees dying on a hillside.  </P> <P> I counted 21 free, quick-hit medical tests at the Old Dog Expo. I could have  been screened for stress, cholesterol, glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, body fat,  bad posture and fatal baldness, to name a few.  </P> <P> "If there were a test for attitudes," Cinelli said, "you'd fail."  </P> <P> A man handed me a booklet of recipes at a Rice For Life exhibit. No doubt for  those whose sense of taste had been irreparably damaged by dry mouth. Treat  yourself to a "Souper Rice Supper," it said. Like hell.  </P> <P> "I'll take it," Cinelli said. "He hates rice, soup, sunny days, puppy dogs and  'Glow Little Glow Worm.' "  </P> <P> There were about 1 million people over 65 living in L.A. County in 1989. That's  a 10% increase over the preceding year. We are either living longer or  octogenarians are being shipped in from Miami Beach.  </P> <P> As a result, everyone wants to cash in on what is perceived to be a new and  growing market. We're talking leisure toys and life-monitoring systems here,  not running shoes and weights.  </P> <P> Buy a spa, geezer. Buy a vibrating chair, a muscle massager, a pulse regulator,  a security system, a motor home, a bike, a burial plot, a stun gun and a blood  pressure kit. Buy a ticket to heaven.  </P> <P> Even Reader's Digest, friend of the emotionally limited, offers a large-type  edition for those with sight problems.  </P> <P> Now, for instance, you can read "God Bless Irving Berlin," "A Christmas  Miracle" and "The Dog Who Knew Better" without undue strain on either the eyes  or the brain.  </P> <P> The Time of Your Life Expo also offered seminars on chair dancing for  cardiovascular fitness, and Ukranian egg dyeing for those with impaired  imaginations.  </P> <P> Additionally, we were entertained by the Dancin' Grannies, the Huff 'N' Puffs  and the Pepper Steppers. Really? Yup.  </P> <P> "Terminal cuteness is also a disease of aging," I said to Cinelli. "Maybe I'll  organize the Writing Whipper Snappers."  </P> <P> "Maybe we'll just leave this place and buy you a martini and some pasta so I  can tolerate you long enough to remember I married you for better or for  worse."  </P> <P> We did exactly that. After two martinis I even whistle "Glow Little Glow Worm,"  but I'll be damned if I'll glimmer.  </P></p>

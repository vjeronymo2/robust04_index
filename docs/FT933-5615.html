			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds Textiles Mr Martin Taylor's farewell to Courtaulds Textiles was bound to be bittersweet. Despite the upturn in the UK market, the lead times in textiles are such that the chairman will not be there to enjoy the full fruits of his labours. Indeed, in the three years since Courtaulds Textiles was demerged, sales of continuing operations are up modestly, profits and earnings are flat and return on capital employed is down. True, that performance leant on pension credits above the line on the one hand and extraordinary bloodletting below on the other. But then the company has had to deal with the horrors of recession and the ERM. Fund managers, meanwhile, have had the cash generation and strengthening balance sheet to help them keep the faith. In the second half, and more particularly next year, the recovery should start to show through more strongly. The replacement management team may thus count itself fortunate since, somewhat unfairly, institutional patience may wear thinner once Mr Taylor's presentational panache is put to work elsewhere. Dropping the pilot this early in the upswing also gives several board members a chance to become more seasoned in their functional responsibilities before they have to face serious navigational hazards.</p>

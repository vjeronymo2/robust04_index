			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Defense Ministry in Bonn intends  to make the export of German armament goods easier by taking the  route via Europe. In a confidential concept for the planned  European armament agency, it says that the project is useful  only if the national restrictions are abolished.    The paper, which has been obtained by DPA, suggests giving  up  the passage in the Maastricht Treaty on Europe, which expressly  leaves decisions about the production and trade with military  materiel to the individual countries. In the future, the  planned agency is to decide on armament deals instead.    For this purpose, the paper recommends treating the future  decisions of other countries on armament deliveries in such a  way "as if the export decision of the partner were one's own,  even if it has not been made for one's own country." In this  way the looser restrictions of France, for instance, would be  applied also to German armament exports.    In addition, it is suggested that more restrained partners,  such as Great Britain, be excluded. Instead of a forthcoming  "minimal solution," Germany should join "four of five" really  determined European partners for armament exports. Then the  free competition would "bring a net profit to the efficient  German armament industry as a whole." Obviously, the concept  has not yet been coordinated with the Foreign Ministry and the  Economics Ministry in Bonn.    According to the defense minister, the point is not  loosening  arms export regulations but "harmonizing armament efforts." In  a statement the Defense Ministry pointed to the decision of the  Maastricht summit in 1991, according to which a "real European  security and defense identity" should be developed. This  includes more intensive armament cooperation with the goal of a  common armament agency. The concept is only a "discussion paper  at the working level," which presents first considerations. A  Foreign Ministry spokesman said upon inquiry that the paper is  not known to the Ministry.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Asarco in sharp decline ASARCO, the US integrated mining company, reported second quarter net earnings of Dollars 4.9m, or 12 cents per share, a sharp decline from the Dollars 15.4m, or 37 cents per share, in the same period last year. Lower metals prices and slack production at several key mines cut into results. Sales were Dollars 487.2m for the second quarter, compared with Dollars 458.9m last year. Copper production at the company's Ray mine in Arizona was impeded by heavy rains and at its Mission mine, also in Arizona, by lower grade and harder ores. Lead and zinc production fell at its Missouri mines because of lower ore grades. In the three months ended June 30, the company's average realised price for copper declined 2 cents to Dollars 1.03 a pound, 10 cents for silver to Dollars 4.11 an ounce, and Dollars 29 for gold to Dollars 364 per ounce. The average realised price for lead remained flat at 26 cents a pound, while zinc rose rose 10 cents to 62 cents per pound. Some of these adverse price and production effects were offset by a second quarter Dollars 2.1m dividend from the Southern Peru Copper Corporation and a credit of Dollars 3.4m from a settlement with Canadian tax authorities. The 1991 second quarter had benefited from a Dollars 5.1m gain from the sale of Asarco's shares in Highland Gold and a credit for capitalised interest worth Dollars 2.1m more than in the 1992 period. For the first six months, Asarco had net earnings of Dollars 11.8m, or 29 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 945m. For the same period last year, net earnings were Dollars 23.4m, or 57 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 924.1m.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (4): Tide of funds has turned - Overseas investment policies are being revised IN THE good old days of soaring Tokyo stock prices, the easy profits to be made at home more than compensated for the risks, foreign exchange and other, of chasing yields in foreign securities markets. The tide of funds has definitely turned, and Japanese insurance companies and banks, the leading purchasers of foreign securities, are revising their longer-term strategies. And, in the short term, they are cashing in some foreign holdings before the close of the financial year in March. Spectacular increases in Japanese purchases during the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s and the sharp fluctuations in capital flows during the past two years of financial turmoil in Tokyo have complicated the charting of Japanese investment intentions. Each of the two eras has been characterised by leaps or plunges in investment levels and, while calmer, clearer trends are yet to emerge, Japanese institutions say that the experience has prompted a reappraisal of their holdings of foreign securities. Mr Haruaki Deguchi, the senior manager of investment planning at Nippon Life, said his industry has been 'thinking about rebalancing our assets, especially our foreign denominated assets'. The likely result, he said, is that Japanese institutions will reduce the foreign securities share of their assets, which in his company's case stands at around 19 per cent, to between 10 and 15 per cent. 'We want to change the philosophy of our investments, and we want to reduce the currency risk. We will be responsible about this change, and keep the volume of foreign investments at about the same level, but because of the inflow of our new money, this level will fall as a percentage of total assets,' Mr Deguchi said. Instead, Mr Deguchi said, his industry will increase its lending to Japanese businesses, an option which has become more lucrative with higher domestic interest rates. This policy coincides with the willingness of Japanese companies to pay market rates for money, having realised the stock market's inability to digest equity issues will endure. 'We want middle level returns and low risk, and with the business loans we can get good interest rate returns and not have to worry about the foreign currency exposure. We were more interested in higher return, higher risk investments in the 1980s, but now that our cushion of hidden share profits is gone, we are more cautious,' Mr Deguchi said. Net purchases of foreign bonds peaked at Dollars 94.1bn in 1989, fell sharply to Dollars 29bn in 1990, and recovered to Dollars 68.2bn last year. The change in direction has been more dramatic in purchases of foreign stocks, which fell from Dollars 17.9bn in 1989, to Dollars 6.3bn in 1990 and Dollars 3.6bn last year. For January, net sales of foreign stocks were Dollars 2.4bn, a record, and the figure is expected to remain high in February and March. Meanwhile, direct investment also slowed last year, down from Dollars 48bn in 1990 to Dollars 31.2bn last year, the ministry of finance reported. The fall was caused partly by the difficult financial conditions at home, which have increased the cost of capital and made companies more selective about foreign exposure, particularly in property markets. Leading property investors during the late 1980s, including EIE International and Kumagai Gumi, the construction company, have become sellers. Life insurance companies have reduced purchases, and medium-sized industrial companies which dabbled unsuccessfully in foreign property are unlikely to return to the market for a while. Manufacturers are continuing to invest in foreign production facilities, as the labour shortage at home and the promise of lower production costs in other Asian countries, particularly southern China, remain good reasons to invest. Some companies are delaying investment plans because of falling profits at home, though, for others, the tougher conditions are an incentive to establish facilities abroad. Acquisitions of foreign companies also declined last year, with purchases of US companies down from Dollars 11.9bn to Dollars 3.8bn, according to Ulmer Brothers of the US. Japanese takeovers in Europe rose in number from 70 to 72, though the value of the acquisitions fell from Dollars 3.9bn to Dollars 1.9bn. Foreign bonds will remain the prime target for institutional money, but Mr Motoharu Fujikura, the director of the international capital division at the ministry of finance, said the yen's weakness over the past month has provided an incentive for companies to reduce US bond holdings. Mr Fujikura explains the pool of life insurance funds has also been partly drained by an increase in demand for subordinated loans from banks, which are seeking to bolster capital adequacy ratios eroded by the effects of weak Tokyo stock prices on their unrealised gains on shareholdings . 'When we look at future trends, we obviously have to take into consideration the international economic situation. The insurance companies have been increasing their loans to banks, and if domestic interest rates remain high, they will increase their business loans. They are very concerned about the exchange rate risk,' Mr Fujikura said. While the level of funds invested abroad may be smaller, the sophistication of the investments will increase, according to Mr Deguchi at Nippon Life. He said that 'we will have to work harder as investors', and this will mean becoming more familiar with emerging investment opportunities in Asia and Europe, and less focused on the US. 'In Asia the level of growth attracts us, but the legal restrictions on investment make it difficult. You have to worry about currency and tax regulations. That is why loans to Japanese companies are very attractive,' Mr Deguchi said.  --------------------------------------------------------------------    NET JAPANESE PURCHASES OF FOREIGN STOCKS AND BONDS (DOLLARS BN)  --------------------------------------------------------------------       Stocks   Bonds 1986    7.0     92.4 1987   16.9     72.9 1988    3.0     85.8 1989   17.9     94.1 1990    6.2     29.0 1991    3.6     68.2  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Two countries plan to set up joint agency for arms procurement France and Germany yesterday signalled their intention to set up a joint arms procurement agency and to develop a new large military transport aircraft and observation satellite system to give their forces more 'strategic mobility', writes David Buchan. Ministers 'approved the orientations' for the new bilateral arms agency designed to co-ordinate the two countries' numerous programmes. But in deference to European partners, the communique said the Franco-German agency would be open to other members of the Western European Union and that the ultimate aim was a wider procurement agency under the WEU. The project for a four-engine transport with a 25 tonnes capacity has industrial backing from Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain, but so far no government backing.</p>

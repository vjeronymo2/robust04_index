			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Welcome to Soviet Belgium - Emma Tucker only wanted to register her car. But she had not reckoned with Brussels bureaucracy In the old Soviet Union, Zaire, or even Italy I would not have batted an eyelid. But in Belgium? The centre of Europe, home to the institutions that gave the EU the free movement of people? Few know it until they get here, but Belgium lives and breathes bureaucracy. Indeed, relocation to Europe's capital, even from another EU country, leaves incoming foreigners bewildered, exhausted and sometimes in fits of enraged tears. Maddeningly, the EU's bedrock, the Treaty of Rome, can offer no relief. Article 48 enshrines the freedom of movement of workers within the EU and abolishes any discrimination based on nationality. But a treaty cannot pronounce on bureaucracy, and since Belgians endure the same rigmarole as foreigners, the country cannot be said to discriminate. My first hurdle on arriving in Brussels in May was registering as a journalist. The Belgian foreign ministry likes to keep a record of all overseas journalists working in the country and rang, soon after I arrived, telling me to turn up with my passport, two photos, and a press card from home. In a colourless, windowless room in the foreign ministry I completed the required forms and after 10 minutes, was handed the laminated card. Unfortunately the card lasted for only three months. To obtain full accreditation I had to submit it to a panel of journalists who would consider my application and decide whether or not I was a reputable representative of the profession. 'Since you work for the Financial Times,' said the woman, 'there should not be any problem.' But as none of my colleagues - not even the most fastidious  -had completed the process, neither did I. I was already equipped with an international press card from the British police and a press card from the commission. But this was to prove to be a very big mistake. The problems began when I bought a car. In order to get number plates, I had to prove that I had registered with the authorities of my local 'commune'. All foreigners are required to do this anyway. So on buying the car I went, early one morning, to the town hall. Having battled through the ranks of mothers with prams, frustrated pensioners, and harassed immigrants, I was told I should have telephoned for an appointment. 'Well, can I make it now please?' 'No, you have to telephone.' The woman then pointed to a pay-phone in the corner of the room. 'You can use that one, but you must ring before 10am.' When I finally got through, there were no appointments until August, two months after I bought the car. The commune then refused to give me a letter confirming that I lived in Ixelles, my commune, so I had to apply for temporary number plates which lasted only a month - another saga. Meanwhile, before my August appointment, I was required to go to the local police station with a copy of my rental agreement. When I rang for an appointment, they told me the policeman who dealt with my street was ill. I heard nothing more. In August, when I turned up for the appointment at the commune, it had been cancelled because I had not contacted the police. But my policeman was ill, I protested. Tough. Another appointment was set for late September. By now, my temporary number plates were well out of date. This time I went to see the now recovered community policeman. He signed a paper confirming that I lived at my address which I took, together with passport, letter from the FT, photographs and details of my parents, back to the town hall. This time they refused to allow me to register because my Belgian press card was out of date. Not only had I not been told that I would need to produce this (what for example, do doctors or teachers produce?) but I had not heard of other journalists having to do the same. Of the many who work in Brussels, only a handful have bothered to get a Belgian press card. But I was turned away with another appointment for late November. Meanwhile, my number plates remain out of date, and a full press card can, I am told, take up to six months to receive. Why does a city which houses so many foreigners - about one-third of the population of Brussels is foreign - make things so complicated. I rang the Home Office in London and asked what a Belgian journalist arriving to work in the UK would be expected to do. 'Show their passport at the airport,' was the reply. There is also a sinister side to Belgium's insistence that all its residents register with the police. Since the mid-1980s, certain Brussels communes have been allowed to refuse to register non-EU foreign nationals. Predictably, this rule has been used mainly to keep out Moroccan, African and Turkish immigrants. In one case, an American who had bought a house in a central Brussels commune, was not allowed to register his wife, who was of African origin. According to the Human Rights League in Brussels, fighting to have the law repealed, it has even prevented people who have lived in Belgium for 30 years from moving between communes. While the rules for some are potentially devastating, for me they have been merely irritating. In the six months since arriving I have not been able to work out why they exist. If it is to create jobs, the Belgians would do better to put their hundreds of bureaucrats to work on the capital's pot-holed roads, or on clearing up the phenomenal quantity of dog's mess from the streets. Belgian officials say their system has developed - in the 160 years since Belgium was created - out of bureaucratic systems borrowed from their neighbours and the need to regulate a traditionally unruly population. A government official said: 'For people coming from the UK and the US where everything is free it is a culture shock. But the great pleasure of Belgian people is to not respect the law.' I do not enjoy exposing the absurdities of a country whose people have been exceptionally welcoming. But it is consoling that all my Belgian friends have urged me to do so. That said, when it comes to equipping all citizens with an identity card, the Belgians cannot understand my objections. 'But what would happen if you were in an accident?' they ask. 'How would the police know who you were?' This bureaucratic mentality prevails across most of the continent. In Italy, for example, incoming EU citizens apply first for a temporary permit, after which they can register with the commune. A colleague who moved from Belgium to Italy said it was laborious - one visit to the local police involved a three-hour wait - but less frustrating than his Belgian experiences. In France, similar problems exist. 'To do anything in France,' said one disgruntled expatriate, 'you need photocopies in triplicate of gas bills, birth certificates and driving licences. And there is always something missing.' In Portugal, foreigners have to apply for a residents' card with the police, but can only get one if equipped with a document from their embassy saying that they are who they are. 'A passport is not good enough,' said a Lisbon-based Briton. Even in the Netherlands, foreign EU workers have to register with the municipality, and after three months get a stamp of residence from the local police. A treaty against bureaucracy is what Europe needs.</p>

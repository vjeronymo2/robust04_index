			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang Xinwen (1660 2450 2429)] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 20 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference who is visiting here, drove to visit  Belgium's northern port city Antwerp on 20 May.    Antwerp Mayor (Kors) welcomed Chairman Li Ruihuan and made  an  ebullient and friendly speech at a ceremony in the City Hall.  (Kors) said: Antwerp is a small city with a population of less  than 500,000, but it maintains good, cooperative relations with  the "largest country" in the world. It received such  distinguished Chinese guests as former President Li Xiannian and  President Jiang Zemin. Now it is a great pleasure for the  government and the people of Antwerp city to have the  opportunity to receive Chairman Li Ruihuan.    (Kors) said: Since Antwerp established a friendly-city  relationship with Shanghai in 1984, the two sides have increased  exchanges and enhanced cooperation in the economic, trade,  scientific, technological and cultural fields day by day. To  date, almost all big companies and enterprises in Antwerp have  set up branches or offices in Shanghai or other Chinese cities.  Among them, the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company has  entered a very successful cooperation with Shanghai, and their  cooperation may be called a model. (Kors) expressed the belief  that Chairman Li's current visit will further promote the  cooperation between the two countries in economic, trade,  cultural and other fields.    Li Ruihuan said in his speech: Antwerp is a world famous,  major port. With advanced diamond, electronics,  telecommunications, chemical, pharmaceutical, and shipbuilding  industries, it holds a very important position in Belgium's  economic life.    Li Ruihuan was satisfied with the friendship and cooperation  between Antwerp and Shanghai. He said: Since Antwerp  established a friendly-city relationship with Shanghai, the two  cities not only have constantly promoted economic cooperation  and trade and cultural exchanges between them, but they have  also made important contributions to promoting the political,  economic, trade, scientific and technological, and cultural  relations between China and Belgium. While China has entered a  new stage of development in reform, opening up, and economic  construction, Li Ruihuan hoped that Antwerp would fully play a  leading role in further promoting the mutually-beneficial and  cooperative relations between the two countries.    Then, Li Ruihuan, accompanied by officials of relevant  departments of Belgium and Antwerp, visited the Bell Telephone  Manufacturing Company and the Belgium Diamond Center, and toured  Antwerp harbor.</p>

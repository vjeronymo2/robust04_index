			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMITH WORKED UP AFTER USC WORKS BEARS OVER, 31-15  </P> <P> After dominating their opponent, winning their fifth consecutive game and  moving into sole possession of first place in the conference race, the USC  Trojans might have expected a pat on the back from their coach.  </P> <P> Think again.  </P> <P> Larry Smith's reaction to Saturday's 31-15 victory over California was a swift  kick in the collective rear ends of his players.  </P> <P> After verbally lambasting his Trojans, Smith was still furious when he met with  reporters.  </P> <P> And embarrassed, he said.  </P> <P> And ashamed.  </P> <P> Because while USC dominated the Bears physically, they lost in the macho  department. In a game marred by fights and penalties, the Trojans had one  player, Junior Seau, kicked out, were penalized 12 times for 137 yards and  nearly lost the momentum they had gained by racing to a 24-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "Our guys played hard," Smith said, "but I am embarrassed of our school, and  ashamed of our players. That's not the way football should be played. It's a  lack of discipline and, as head coach, I take full responsibility. It's not  going to happen again. I can guarantee that."  </P> <P> Smith proceeded to talk about the pluses of a game in which both Leroy Holt and  Ricky Ervins rushed for more than 100 yards, quarterback Todd Marinovich threw  for one touchdown and rushed for another and the Trojan defense, No. 1 in the  nation against the run, played just about to its average, allowing Cal only 40  net yards rushing on the ground.  </P> <P> But asked if he's concerned about next Saturday's game against top-ranked Notre  Dame, Smith became incensed again.  </P> <P> "If we have that number of penalties," he said, "we'll get killed, 90-0. This  Notre Dame team may be the best in 20 years."  </P> <P> Cynics might think Smith's tirade was just another way to psyche his team up  for next Saturday's showdown, but USC receiver John Jackson doesn't approve.  </P> <P> "I think the coach was overreacting," he said. "Winning this game and moving  into the conference lead was a big thing. And for the coach to be so negative,  well, you can see the mood in the locker room now. We're certainly not riding  on a high."  </P> <P> Jackson got involved in the first big confrontation.  </P> <P> With the Trojans facing a third-and-goal at the Cal seven in the first quarter  of a scoreless game, Marinovich kept the ball and gained two yards.  </P> <P> But when defensive lineman Rhett Hall appeared to be overzealous in slamming  Marinovich to the turf, Jackson had words with the Cal defender.  </P> <P> USC was slapped with a personal foul and a 15-yard penalty and had to settle  for Quin Rodriguez's 37-yard field goal.  </P> <P> The mood of the day was set. The Trojans would never be caught. Not on the  scoreboard. Not in penalty yards.  </P> <P> USC moved into a 10-0 advantage in the second quarter when Marinovich, who  completed 16 of 26 passes for 206 yards with no interceptions, hit Gary Wellman  with a 32-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> But the offensive star this day was Holt, the often overlooked fullback who  spends much of his time clearing the way for Ervins, the tailback.  </P> <P> He did that again Saturday, coming up with a key block on Ervins' 10-yard  scoring run in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But Holt also found plenty of holes for himself. He rushed 21 times for 160  yards, including the 55-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that broke the  game open.  </P> <P> Ervins also went over the 100-yard mark, picking up 134 in 31 carries.  </P> <P> Even Marinovich got into the act, scoring on a keeper from seven yards out.  </P> <P> Cal Coach Bruce Snyder said before the game that there was little use trying to  run on the impregnable front wall of the Trojan defense.  </P> <P> He knows his team.  </P> <P> What the Bears got came through the air. Quarterback Troy Taylor got both  scores on touchdown pass plays to Brian Treggs, for 75 yards in the second  quarter and 14 in the fourth.  </P> <P> Taylor followed his second scoring pass by hitting Brent Woodall in the end  zone for the two-point conversion, and suddenly, the Memorial Stadium crowd of  52,000 had a reason to look at the scoreboard other than checking on the  progress of the World Series just down the road.  </P> <P> With still 10 1/2 minutes left after Cal's second touchdown, Snyder went for  the onside kick.  </P> <P> And almost got it.  </P> <P> The ball appeared to be within the grasp of several Cal players only to have it  bounce off the face mask of one into the firm grasp of USC's Matt Gee.  </P> <P> That caused the fans, the few hardy who remained, to go back to checking on the  Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants.  </P> <P> Much of the earlier tension was gone.  </P> <P> So was Seau, who was tossed out for fighting, along with Cal offensive lineman  Steve Gordon.  </P> <P> "It was just one of those stupid things," Seau said. "I've got to learn from  it. I could have backed out. I should have. I saw two of their guys on one of  ours and I just went over to make sure he was OK. I got into a little tangle  up.  </P> <P> "A lot of guys were involved, but it seemed like I stuck out. I felt the  officials used me as an example to settle things down."  </P> <P> But nothing could settle Smith down.  </P> <P> It course have been worse, though. Imagine what he would have done if the  Trojans had lost?  </P> <P> USC Notes  </P> <P> USC, ranked 10th before Saturday, is 5-1, 3-0 in conference. Cal falls to 2-4,  0-3 in the Pac-10. There will be no roses for the Bears again this season. . .  . USC had 499 yards of total offense to Cal's 288. . . . The Trojans sacked  Troy Taylor five times. Dan Owens was credited with 2 1/2, Craig Hartsuyker  with two. . . . Taylor completed 13 of 31 for 248 yards. . . . Brian Treggs  caught three for 129 yards. . . . Gary Wellman was USC's leading receiver with  two catches for 60 yards. John Jackson had two for 51. . . . Saturday marked  the first time since 1985 that two Trojans rushed for 100 yards in the same  game. Against Stanford that season, Aaron Emanuel had 122 and Fred Crutcher  105. . . . Ricky Ervins began play Saturday with 547 yards rushing, which  already put him ahead of last year's season leader, Emanuel, who had 545. . . .  The Trojans have beaten Cal four in a row, 11 of the last 12 and 26 of 31.  </P></p>

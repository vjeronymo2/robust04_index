			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 22 (AFP) -- British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said here Tuesday [22 March] that he was  not hopeful of an early agreement in a row over voting rules  which is blocking enlargement of the EU [European Union].    Speaking as he arrived for an urgent meeting of EU foreign  ministers on the issue, he said: "I'm not very hopeful of  reaching an answer today."    But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of  jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in Austria,  Finland, Norway and Sweden.    Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos was  holding separate meetings with Hurd and Spanish Foreign Minister  Javier Solana just ahead of Tuesday's meeting, the fourth in so  many weeks to grapple with the issue.    Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement  of  the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger  countries to block decisions they do not like.    The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshhold of  blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of  90 to take account of the incoming members. But this would  weaken the ability of the EU's bigger countries to block  controversial decisions.    The issue has caused a deep split in the EU, with most of  its  members accusing Britain and Spain of wanting to cripple the  Union's decision-making ability.    The four applicants, who completed their negotiations to  join  the EU earlier this month, cannot enter until the issue is  resolved.    Hurd said no compromises so far advanced were satisfactory  to  Britain. "We intend to work until we get satisfaction," he said.    Failure to reach a decision this month could make it  impossible for the four countries to join the EU on schedule on  January 1, and could also dampen the enthusiasm of their  electorates to endorse membership.</p>

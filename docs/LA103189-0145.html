			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NORTHWEST SETTLES CRASH CLAIMS  </P> <P> Lawyers have settled all 157 lawsuits against Northwest Airlines in the crash  of Flight 255 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, leaving McDonnell-Douglas the  only defendant, a federal judge announced today.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. did not disclose any details of the  out-of-court settlement, which was prematurely revealed during the weekend by  one of the attorneys involved in the case despite Cook's gag order.  </P> <P> Phoenix-bound Northwest Flight 255 crashed shortly after takeoff Aug. 16, 1987,  killing 156 people. A 4-year-old girl now living with relatives in Alabama was  the sole survivor of the nation's second-worst air disaster.  </P> <P> After announcing the settlement in the Northwest case, Cook immediately began  questioning the six jurors and six alternates as to their impartiality to hear  arguments in the suits against McDonnell-Douglas, the St. Louis-based  manufacturer of the ill-fated MD-80 aircraft.  </P></p>

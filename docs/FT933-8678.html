			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Seoul orders halt to strike at Hyundai THE South Korean government yesterday decided to use its emergency powers for a second time within a month to end a strike at Hyundai, the country's largest conglomerate. It ordered that workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's shipbuilding subsidiary, immediately to suspend their industrial action and return to work as a 20-day cooling off period takes effect. HHI and Hyundai Wood Industries, a furniture company, are the last two of nine companies affected by strikes that plagued Hyundai since early June. The strike at HHI, which began July 5, has cost the group Dollars 198m (Pounds 135m) in lost sales, including Dollars 124m in exports. The government said it was taking the action because of HHI's importance to the economy as the country's largest shipbuilder. Negotiations at HHI have become bogged down over the trade union's demand that workers fired for labour activity should be reinstated and that the managers who sacked the workers should be reprimanded. The government also intervened last month in a dispute at Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car maker, which led to a quick settlement of the strike.</p>

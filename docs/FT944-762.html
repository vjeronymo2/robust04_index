			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Titanium development to cost over ADollars 200m Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, is to invest over ADollars 200m (Pounds 99m) in developing a titanium minerals deposit at Beenup in Western Australia. When operational, in about a year's time, the dredge mining and mineral separation operation at Beenup will generate about 600,000 tonnes of ilmenite and zircon a year. BHP added that it had also negotiated a smelter joint venture with the Tinfos group in Norway to process the ilmenite from the mine into high-quality titanium pigment feedstock. This will be used in the Tinfos Titan &amp; Iron smelter at Norway's Tyssedal. Sale contracts covering the bulk of the ilmenite and slag output had been negotiated, BHP said. The Beenup deposits, discovered in 1988, contain an indicated resource of 83m tonnes of ilmenite. Of this, 33m tonnes is measured. BHP said there was also exploration potential, which could extend the resource. The company's shares closed 14 cents higher on the news, at ADollars 19.60. Robe River, the iron ore producer which is 53 per cent owned by Australia's North group, yesterday announced that it had negotiated a 7.3 per cent increase in the selling price of iron ore sinter fines for 1995-96 in its annual contract negotiations with the Japanese steel mills. It said it had also agreed a guaranteed minimum sales volume to Japan of 12.5m dry long tons for 1995/6, the same as in the current year. Much of the benefit of rises in the pricing current round could be eroded by the increased strength of the Australian dollar over the past year. The contract prices, and the percentage increases, relate to US dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] New York has the Statue of Liberty, Paris has the  Eiffel Tower, now Shanghai will have its own imposing monument  to symbolise China in the 21st century.    When the statue, tentatively called "China Colossus", is  finished around the year 2000, it will be 118 metres high, twice  the size of its New York counterpart, according to Xie Lin, of  the city's statues commission.    But comparisons with the Liberty Island lady, which ran  rampant in the Shanghai press after the decision was made this  week, were not being encouraged. "In terms of meaning, ours  will be completely different from the Statue of Liberty," Xie  said.    "The China Colossus will be a profound symbol of the Chinese  nation, symbolising the reform and opening policies of our  powerful country at the onset of a new century." Like its New  York counterpart, it would be likely to be a woman, but other  human representations could also be considered, Xie said.    An exact replica, as was erected by students in Tiananmen  Square five years ago, was "impossible", Xie said.    Xie said arguments were still raging about cost-sharing  between the central and local governments and some political  questions concerning the design. "Experts from the central  government have many ideas. This is not something we can decide  in a flash," he said.    Xie said it might be premature for him to even talk about  the  choice of Shanghai, a decision made while Beijing's statues  group was in the city this week. "I can't disclose which  departments in the central government are in charge. But they  feel this matter is not ready for public announcement," he said.    But he could not restrain his enthusiasm over the city's  success in winning the statue. Guangdong province had been the  front runner when the central government first began secret  discussions about erecting a "symbol of rising China" last  November.    "We will have to draw on all the experience of thousands of  Chinese sculptors around the world for this solemn task," he  said. Nor could the city's press refrain from a little chest  thumping after the supposedly secret conclave on the statue left  town this week.    "Standing aloft in Shanghai will soon be a statue of 118  metres, twice as high as America's Statue of Liberty," the  Shanghai Labour Daily said. Beijing leaders are understood to  be angry at the reporting of the statue in Shanghai before the  official New China News Agency (Xinhua) was informed.    "Beijing will have the final say on what the statue looks  like and where it stands, not Shanghai," one Shanghai official  said.    Present plans call for the statue to be built up-river of  Shanghai proper along the Huangpu River, the official said.  This would avoid any charge that the statue was incompatible  with the traditional architecture of the Bund.    It would also ensure that China's newest symbol is not  diminished by the 450-metre Oriental Pearl television tower,  which is already halfway to the skies across the river in the  Pudong new area.</p>

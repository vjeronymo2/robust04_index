			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / A summer storm that is set to last: US airlines face a long and difficult journey to recovery April may be the cruellest month but, for US airlines, August was a close contender. At the height of the summer travel season, when the industry traditionally lines its coffers, it was instead plagued by fare cuts, tumbling share prices and warnings of poor financial performance for the rest of the year. In one week alone, Northwest slashed fares by up to 47 per cent on Pacific routes. American Airlines, one of the nation's leading carriers, scuppered a proposal by Delta, the third largest carrier, for a proposed 5 per cent rise in domestic fares. And bankrupt Trans World Airlines stepped up the dogfight over Atlantic fares by offering Dollars 398 (Pounds 201) return tickets from New York, Washington and Boston to various European cities. On top of this, the finance director at American Airlines - a bellwether for the industry - told analysts that the company would post a heavy third-quarter loss. On Wall Street, airline shares are trading close to their 52-week lows. The events of this summer, which come against a background of losses, have exacerbated a crisis in the industry and are forcing a rethink in strategy, even among the largest and strongest carriers. Delta has announced 'down-sizing' moves, including the loss of about 4,000 jobs - about 5 per cent of its employees - greater use of contract services and more 'seasonal' scheduling of flights. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United, the largest US airline, has also hinted that unspecified 'alternative actions' by the Chicago-based carrier might be necessary to reduce expenses, should the industry's economics fail to improve. Already, capital expenditure plans, which traditionally consume about 15 per cent of a carrier's revenues, have been cut. 'Neither we, nor other airlines, can continue spending capital unless we can earn a profit on our investments,' says Mr Bob Crandall, head of American Airlines. 'Without profits, the airplanes and facilities that our customers - and the country - want us to provide simply won't be there.' Such dire warnings are a long way from the goals of industry deregulation, a policy launched in 1978 when Congress decided that airlines should be able to fly freely within the US, charging whatever they liked. The objective was low-cost air travel and an industry driven to efficiency by competition. Today, air travel is cheap and carriers are certainly cost-conscious. The US Air Transport Association, for example, estimates that air fares have risen 53.4 per cent since deregulation, while consumer prices have gained 108.9 per cent - meaning that air fares have fallen in real terms. This summer's particularly savage fare war took domestic prices back to 1983 levels. Service quality also appears to have improved - at least according to official statistics. Figures compiled by the US Department of Transportation show travellers' complaints on a declining trend since the late 1980s. The number of on-time flight arrivals, for example, stood at 82.5 per cent last year, compared with 78.7 per cent in 1988. But all this has been achieved at the expense of profits. Since the start of the 1990s aggregate losses have totalled Dollars 7bn (see graph) and there is little sign of a return to profitability in the immediate future. In only one of the past 10 years has the industry's annual after-tax profit margin topped 3 per cent. For the period as a whole, the average after-tax profit margin has actually been negative. The reasons behind the crisis now facing US airlines are complex. Much blame has been put on the Gulf war and the US recession by both the airlines themselves and by industry observers. The Middle East crisis led to sharply higher fuel prices in the second half of 1990; the stagnant domestic economy resulted in a 2.2 per cent fall in domestic traffic last year, the first downturn for 10 years. But the problems run deeper. Ever since deregulation, which introduced dozens of low-cost competitors, the industry has been in turmoil. In addition to the greater number of competitors, upheaval was created by the development of national 'hub' networks, a strategy adopted by the big airlines to combat the new entrants and which led to a process of acquisition and consolidation. Under the hub system, an airline arranges for flights from different cities to fly into a central 'hub' airport at roughly the same time. Passengers then join connecting outward flights. This is plainly efficient; there would be limited demand for a direct service between, say, Detroit and Little Rock. But by funnelling passengers who start from a large number of cities through Memphis, for example, there is a good chance of filling the aircraft from Memphis to Little Rock. To maximise the benefits of this system, carriers sought to expand their domestic coverage - and mergers were a quick method. Sometimes these were relatively painless, as in the 1987 merger between Delta and Western. But, more often, the combining carriers encountered severe problems of integration. Northwest Airlines' takeover of Republic in 1986, for example, was dogged by labour difficulties, operational disruptions and consumer disenchantment. While this consolidation trend was underway, deregulation and the ready availability of acquisition capital lured a number of financial operators into the industry. These include Mr Carl Icahn at TWA and Mr Al Checchi at Northwest Airlines. As a result, several carriers came under the control of people whose management skills in a difficult industry were untested. At the same time, acquisitions brought billions of dollars of debt to the airlines' balance sheets, a burden which carriers such as TWA, Continental and Northwest are still carrying. Given these airlines pressing need for cash flow in a market dogged by overcapacity, the outbreak of fare wars was only to be expected. And that is precisely what has happened. This summer, for example, half-price travel was available on most domestic routes. No sooner had these fares been withdrawn from the market, than 30 per cent was lopped off advance autumn fares. So how and when will it all end? In theory, corporate Darwinism should take over; airline failures should reduce the overcapacity in the industry. So far, the 1990s have seen the demise of Pan Am, Eastern, Midway and the reincarnated Braniff. The futures of some larger, and similarly distressed carriers - including Continental, Northwest and TWA - are still unresolved. But in practice the US bankruptcy system provides an obstacle to the process. A company that obtains bankruptcy court protection from its creditors - which Continental, TWA and America West have done - gets relief from most debt payments while it tries to restructure. Since a 'dead' airline is worth relatively little (there is a surplus of equipment and aircraft, so only international routes and landing slots tend to attract buyers), creditors have every reason to encourage a reorganisation plan. But the carrier still needs to earn enough cash to pay its operating bills, often resorting to either asset sales and/or ticket promotions. This has been the catalyst for many of the fare wars, with stronger carriers obliged to match aggressive fare-cutting by their bankrupt rivals. The current crisis has prompted growing demands for reform by the solvent airlines. 'Congress should change the nation's bankruptcy laws, which have worked badly in every industry,' says Mr Crandall of American. Unfortunately for Mr Crandall and his counterparts, however, there is little prospect of any overhaul of the system. As in other troubled industries, foreign investment is an alternative solution. The Dollars 750m that British Airways proposes to invest in USAir, for example, is a significant contribution, given the US carrier's Dollars 2bn debts and Dollars 760m of losses in the past two years. But relief from this source may also be limited. US rules restrict foreigners to 49 per cent of a domestic airline's equity, and 25 per cent of the voting rights. Moreover, globalisation of the airline industry is a two-edged sword. In contrast with the US domestic market, international travel is still growing, and the stronger US airlines also want to continue their own push into international markets. Many have historically had little exposure overseas. International revenues accounted for a third of the total at United in 1991, and only about 21 per cent at American. Accordingly, the larger US carriers would like their government to use approval for deals, like the BA-USAir transaction, as a bargaining counter to win concessions abroad for US carriers. An alternative approach to the industry's problems is presented by Southwest Airlines, the only sizeable carrier to remain consistently profitable in recent years. Based in Dallas, Southwest has specialised in flying direct city-to-city services on popular commuter journeys, rather than funnelling flights through a hub and attempting to provide national coverage. It uses one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737; keeps its costs and fares to a minimum; and regularly attracts the fewest consumer complaints of any leading carrier. Its performance has attracted interest from larger rivals. American, for example, recently said that it might either have to bow out of certain markets where Southwest competes, or attempt to rival its low-cost operating structure. For most of the industry, however, the immediate prospect is for more of the same. The fare cuts offered this summer and autumn have probably doomed carriers to sizeable losses in the third quarter of 1992, and the final three months of the year traditionally lose money. A further round of consolidation is also widely-expected. The continuing losses and dwindling cash at TWA is pressuring Mr Icahn, the carrier's owner, its creditors and its unions to negotiate a reorganisation plan under which the creditors and unions would become the leading shareholders. But with some of its international assets already sold, and BA-USAir a potential buyer of others, it seems likely that any 'restructured' TWA would be a smaller operation. BA is clearly a possible saviour for USAir, and there are still suggestions that Northwest and Continental will eventually combine. Over the summer, however, Continental has received formal investment proposals from two separate Texas-based investors, and from the loss-making Air Canada. Only when this final shakeout is complete, the economy recovers and domestic traffic improves, may the fare wars abate and some semblance of profitability return. The travelling public will probably bemoan the day, but for the US carriers it cannot come a moment too soon.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     US AIRLINES: FLIGHT INTO LOSS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US Airlines By revenue passenger miles 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 UAL (parent of United) 2 AMR (parent of American) 3 Delta  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 4 Northwest Airlines 5 Continental Airlines 6 USAir  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 7 Trans World Airlines 8 America West 9 Southwest Airlines  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Operating income            Net income Majors                  1991              1990      1991        1990                       dollarsm          dollarsm  dollarsm   dollarsm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AMR                      5.0             124.0    (239.9)      (39.6) America West           (99.4)            (31.6)   (213.8)      (74.7) Continental           (218.9)           (426.6)   (305.7)   (2,343.9) Delta                 (274.6)           (227.2)   (258.1)     (172.6) Northwest              (60.1)           (141.7)     (3.1)      (10.4) Southwest               62.9              81.9      26.9        47.1 TWA                   (353.5)           (182.0)     34.6      (237.6) UAL                   (494.1)            (36.3)   (331.9)       94.5 USAir                 (173.5)           (501.1)   (349.6)     (487.5)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total majors       (1,606.2)         (1,320.6) (1,640.6)   (3,224.7)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other airlines Alaska                  34.6              28.4      10.3        17.2 Atlantic Southeast      52.5              39.9      32.5        25.4 WestAir                 (9.5)            (11.2)       6.5       (12.3)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total other airlines    77.6              57.1      49.3        30.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NB: This excludes Pan Am, Eastern and Midway losses Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

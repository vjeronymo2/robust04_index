			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAT ROBERTSON TARGETS NEA OVER 'SEX' IN ATLANTA PUPPET SHOW  </P> <P> Evangelist Pat Robertson charged today that a children's puppet show featured  simulated oral sex during a performance last week at an Atlanta arts festival  allegedly subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> Robertson's claims were vigorously denied by the NEA, the Georgia state arts  council and puppeteer Jon Ludwig of Atlanta.  </P> <P> "This is just the latest example of the continual distortion of fact by the  arts endowment's most virulent critics, those intent on eliminating the agency  at any cost, even that of the truth," said chief NEA spokesman Jack  Lichtenstein.  </P> <P> Robertson said the puppet show, performed at the Atlanta Arts Festival on  Friday before 800 people, including children, featured "approximately five  minutes of simulated foreplay between two puppets followed by an exhibit of  oral sex acts."  </P> <P> Robertson, a 1988 presidential candidate, said his Christian Coalition in  Chesapeake, Va., responded by generating 27,000 petitions demanding that the  NEA be abolished and sending them Tuesday to every member of Congress.  </P> <P> Lichtenstein and Frank Ratka, the council's executive director, denied that any  NEA funds went to the festival.  </P></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: BR privatisation bid essential to send 'message of hope' Sir, Your editorial, 'Right lines for rail privatisation' (October 22), argues that British Rail should not be allowed to bid against commercial operators to run train services on the grounds that BR could win most of the franchises by cross-subsidising its bids in order to fend off competition. The National Consumer Council cannot agree with this. If the intention of the government's rail privatisation programme is to lead to improved rail services, then BR must be allowed to bid. This would send a message of hope to the many thousands of disenchanted rail users up and down the country, by letting them know that the government is serious about achieving this aim. It can only be to the consumer's advantage if BR's services are forced to meet the rigorous standards of service set down by the new franchise authority. We can envisage no better discipline for BR than for it to be subject to these controls over fare and service levels. Quite simply, if BR did not provide value for money it would lose the franchise. The alternative is to leave BR to run the services that nobody else wants to run. Our National Consumer Council's concern is that, all too soon, this could lead to a two-tier rail service, in which BR becomes a provider of last resort, rail fares climb higher still, and rail passengers are the losers.

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: MIM posts ADollars 14.8m quarterly loss FLOODS and weak metal and coal prices plunged MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, into operating losses of ADollars 14.8m (USDollars 11.56m) in its third quarter for the 1991 financial year. As a result, the group is undertaking a rigorous cost-cutting programme at its Mount Isa copper and lead mine and is reviewing future projects, said Sir Bruce Watson, chairman. The result for the 16 weeks to April 7 was MIM's first quarterly loss for five years and compares with a ADollars 35m operating profit for the previous quarter and a ADollars 67.6m in the same quarter last year. MIM was caught in a squeeze between a ADollars 60m decrease in sales because of severe production losses during the quarter and a ADollars 29m increase in costs. Last quarter's loss clawed back profit for the first nine months of the year to just ADollars 30m, compared with ADollars 164.2m for the same period last year. MIM's share price dropped 5 cents to ADollars 1.77 on the news of the quarterly loss and predictions by stock market analysts that the company's annual dividend would be cut to 5 cents or 6 cents, compared with 12 cents last year. The interim pay-out was trimmed to just 3 cents from last year's 4 cents. The 16-week period proved to be disastrous for MIM, with the collapse of a cooling tower at Mt Isa, closing the lead smelter for four weeks, and heavy flooding in northern Queensland, disrupting the rail link between the city and its export port, Townsville. The flood also cost four weeks' production from its Newlands and Collinsville coal mines. While MIM can do little about the weather, the company has embarked on a vigorous cost-cutting exercise to improve margins. MIM sacked 150 workers from its loss-making Collinsville coal mine in January and warned then that it would slash ADollars 100m from annual operating costs of the Mt Isa mine over two years. Sir Bruce revealed that MIM was discussing with its banks the future of the Collinsville and Newlands coal mines, given that earnings from the mines failed to fully service interest costs. Weak export coal prices and the stubbornly strong Australian currency had conspired to erode coal earnings for the group. MIM's coal operations lost ADollars 37m over the three quarters. 'The return to profitability of the Newlands and Collinsville coal operations is a matter for urgent resolution,' Sir Bruce said yesterday.</p>

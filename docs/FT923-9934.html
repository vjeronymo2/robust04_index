			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Vigilance is needed when booking INTERTOURS, the London-based travel agency, this year became one of the few outlets prosecuted successfully under UK consumer protection law, Catherine Milton writes. The company, registered with the Association of British Travel Agents, was fined after several complaints to Westminster City Council that prices charged were higher than those advertised. In June, magistrates ordered Mr Christopoulous Panayiotou, director of Intertours, to pay Pounds 3,000 in compensation and costs for a variety of offences under consumer protection law. One trip to Delhi was quoted at Pounds 425, but the client was asked to pay Pounds 485. At a London magistrates court, Mr Panayiotou pleaded guilty to all charges. Mr Chris Rogers, chief trading standards officer at Westminster council, said: 'This is a typical complaint, and very often we do not get sufficient evidence to build a case. This is fine from the point of view of criminal proceedings, but it does not help people who just wanted their money back in the first place.' Mr Panayiotou refused to discuss the details of his prosecution, but said: 'We did not intentionally charge anyone more than the advertised price.' He said the court case arose out of a 'complete misunderstanding' last year. The prosecution involved 1.3 per cent of his 12,000 customers last year. 'We have gone through turbulence but Intertours is now a smooth, clean operation.'                         *      *      * HUNDREDS of people were caught out by what appears to be a loophole in UK regulations when an Icelandic company, Air Tours Rekjavik, ceased trading and grounded its UK-based subsidiary, Iceland Air Tours (IAT), in June, Catherine Milton writes. They booked tickets to Rekjavik believing their money was protected under the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Travel Organisers Licence (Atol) system, which guarantees refunds to clients when travel companies fail. Although IAT did not have a licence, clients believed it had agreed to pay another company to share its licence. That kind of arrangement is proper and fairly common. No such contract had been signed, however. IAT probably did not need a CAA licence to trade under UK regulations. The licence is necessary only for companies that sell charter packages (including accommodation). Iceland Air, the state airline, put together a rescue package to help those stranded overseas when the companies collapsed. However, hundreds of people who had booked holidays for July, August and September were still left out of pocket. The CAA said the situation was confused. All IAT personnel have returned to Rekjavik and the telephone number for Air Tours Rekjavik is no longer in use.                         *      *      * BOOKING a cheap flight on a reputable airline is no guarantee of fair treatment, as some bucket shop customers have found to their cost, Tim Lawrence writes. Ms Sue Freeman, for example, understood the risks involved in booking a package holiday with a bucket shop. But she did not know that booking a flight could be equally fraught. In mid June Ms Freeman, a journalist, booked an American Airlines flight to Boston on July 30 for Pounds 379 with Lifestyle Travel, a bucket shop in Tottenham Court Road in central London. She eventually caught the flight, but only after an ordeal of claims and counterclaims, she says. Ms Freeman paid for the ticket and was told it would arrive within 10 days. When no ticket arrived, she embarked on a daily merry-go-round of increasingly heated telephone calls to Mr Frank Deluca, owner of Lifestyle Travel. Three days before the flight she was told that the flight was overbooked. Mr Deluca blamed an agent acting for American Airlines for overbooking the flight. Lifestyle Travel offered her a much longer flight to Boston via Chicago. The agent claims it sent two reminders to Lifestyle Travel before the reservation expired on June 26. By the time Lifestyle Travel's cheque arrived on June 30, the flight was full. Eventually American Airlines resolved the difficulty by making space for Ms Freeman on the original Boston flight  - although not in Club Class.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> THE CRITTERS IN REDONDO WON'T MEET SIMILAR FATE  </P> <P> When Redondo Beach empties two park ponds as part of a reconstruction project,  John Oliver will make sure that a large population of marine life doesn't go  down the drain.  </P> <P> Oliver, Redondo Beach's city clerk, and about 40 other users of Hopkins  Wilderness Park plan to save the ponds' critters by placing them in a large  wading pool until workers have finished putting in new cement bottoms.  </P> <P> "Instead of pulling the plug on them and killing them, we're going to save  them," said Oliver, who is a member of the Friends of the Wilderness Park  organization. "Our No. 1 concern is to save the animals. You hate to see  anything like that die."  </P> <P> Crayfish, mosquito fish, frogs, turtles, salamanders and even fresh-water  shrimp are believed to inhabit the two ponds.  </P> <P> Oliver said they hope a company will donate a large wading pool or sell one for  about $300.  </P> <P> "It's got to be rigged up where we can keep people from terrorizing them,"  Oliver said about the animals.  </P> <P> The 11-acre park at Knob Hill Avenue and Camino Real is valued by Redondo Beach  officials for its camping and nature study facilities among trees, meadows,  streams and ponds.  </P> <P> The federal government, which had used the site for the Nike missile  radar-tracking system, gave Redondo Beach title to the area in 1971. The site  originally was part of the El Segundo sand hills, which extend about 12 miles  from Playa del Rey to the Palos Verdes Hills.  </P> <P> In 1975, the city planted about 1,000 trees, including eucalyptus, sycamore,  gumwood, pine, ash, elm and California redwood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clogged by Mud  </P> <P> Pumps were installed to feed water into two streams that flow into the ponds,  which were built with a sand and porous clay bottom. Since then, mud has  collected on the bottom and has blocked inlets. When the water is drained, the  mud will be scraped out and workers will build concrete bottoms.  </P> <P> Oliver said construction, which was to have begun about two years ago, was  delayed by budget problems. The animals were to have been transferred to  another body of water.  </P> <P> Those plans were scrapped when it was found that many of the animals could be  carrying spores from duckweed, a lime-green plant that spreads across the water  surface. But officials feared that the duckweed would be spread throughout  another body of water.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a Catch-22," Oliver said. "If you want to kill the weed, you have  to kill the animal."  </P> <P> So the organization has proposed putting the animals in the wading pool.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weeds Cover Water  </P> <P> On the park's largest pond, called Green Swamp, the duckweed has spread so much  that signs were put up to warn visitors, especially children, not to try to  walk on the water, said Bob Atkinson, the city's director of parks and  recreation. But he said that the weed is more of a nuisance than a harm to  wildlife.  </P> <P> At Manhattan Beach's Polliwog Park, much of the marine life was lost when the  city started construction on a pond about three weeks ago to improve its water  quality. But Oliver stressed that the Polliwog pond is much bigger. Users of  Hopkins Park, he said, also had time to mobilize an effort to save the animals.  </P> <P> "We have a real active community here," Oliver said. "It's too bad that they  couldn't get something going on it."  </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Nato rebuff for Russians Nato ambassadors yesterday rebuffed Moscow's demand for an alternative to the Partnership for Peace arrangement, in a move that casts a shadow over next week's visit to Brussels by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister. Gen Grachev has said Russia is not prepared simply to join the queue of East European countries signing up to the partnership, an arrangement that provides for joint exercises and an exchange of military know-how. At a meeting in Brussels yesterday, the ambassadors said the most they could promise was 'dialogue and co-operation' of a kind that reflected Russia's importance in European security. However, this dialogue would be in addition to Russian adherence to the partnership, not a substitute. An alliance spokesman said Nato 'looked forward' to Russia subscribing to the partnership, which already has 18 members. 'We do not like the term special relationship,' said a Nato official, adding that any links between Russia and the alliance must be transparent and stop well short of giving Moscow a veto over future alliance decisions.</p>

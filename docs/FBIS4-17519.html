			<p>BFN     [Text] State Duma deputies received Thursday the second  version of the Civic Accord draft developed by a working group  created by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The new draft  removes the thesis on non-utilization of assessments of the  events of August 1991 and September 1993 as factors behind  heightened social confrontation from the political section of  the first draft.    The provision committing parties to the agreement to refrain  from amending the Constitution in such a way as to destabilize  society is retained. However, the new document does permit  conciliatory procedures to draft amendments and additions to the  Basic Law in the interests of strengthening human rights and  improving the system of power division, local government and the  development of federalism.    The new document, in contrast to the original, specifies the  commitments of state authorities in politics and economics.    For instance, the Federation Council and State Duma must, in  the short term, pass legislation governing elections, and laws  on referendums, parties, the rights of citizens to form  associations, and the procedure for holding demonstrations and  other public and politically-orientated events. The two  parliament chambers are also responsible for the creation of a  legislative base to overcome the social and political crisis,  including by means of passing a Constitutional Law in the next  six months on the government, a Budget Law, Civil and land codes  and a number of other acts.    In turn, the government is bound by the draft to bring  inflation down in 1994 and guarantee financial stabilization.  It will attract more investments and create a platform for  economic recovery. It will ensure that the principles of social  partnership and other aspects of the country's life are applied.    Regarding national security, the document contains new  provisions on the joint responsibility of the president, the  Federation Council, the State Duma and the government to reform  the law and order bodies. The draft also recommends that the  speakers of both chambers of parliament take an active role in  the work of the Russian Security Council and involve  representatives of the relevant committees of both chambers in  the interdepartmental Security Council commissions.    Provisions on accountability for violating the Treaty are  have been reworded and amplified: now, according to the  document, the Conciliatory Commission of authorized  representatives of the president, the government, the chambers  of the Federal Assembly, State Duma fractions, the Public  Chamber under the president, and trade unions will "ensure that  the provisions written into the acting Document are observed."  In the original, the Conciliatory Commission had the right to  raise the issue of removing the signature of any party to the  Accord discovered to have violated the said agreement and may  use the mass media as a means of informing the nation of such  violations. It may also propose measures concerning the  political accountability of such persons "including their  dismissal from office or stripping of their deputy's mandate."    The document includes a new section on the procedure for  signing the Accord, which the working group explains as follows:  the Accord is signed by the president, the speakers of both  chambers of parliament, the head of government, the leaders of  constituent members of the Federation, and by authorized  representatives of political parties in the State Duma, the  presidential Public Chamber and trade unions "after which the  Accord will be open for signature by other parties."</p>

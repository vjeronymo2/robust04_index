			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S STAND ON THREATS TO OZONE  </P> <P> The purpose of this letter is to express concern about the current political  activities of the mayor of Irvine and several members of the Irvine City  Council. They have made public statements concerning radically reducing the  budget of the Department of Defense, they passed an ordinance broadening civil  rights, and now they are discussing special rules designed to protect the ozone  layer of the earth's atmosphere. A very ambitious project for any city council!  </P> <P> Even if we concede that the council members are acting out of the noblest  motives, it is clear that they are greatly exceeding their mandate when they  concern themselves with national issues. We have elected President Bush and  Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) to deal with such matters. It only  causes confusion when cities formulate their own policies on national defense,  universal civil rights and environmental issues that really call for  international agreement. Are we going to have an Irvine policy on NATO, Central  America, South Africa and immigration?  </P> <P> We elected Mayor Larry Agran and the other council members to look after local  problems, such as zoning, streets, parks, police and fire protection. We voted  for them because we believed they were competent in these matters, and because  we more or less agreed with the positions they had taken on the local issues.  It does not seem right that they should take their election to the local office  as a mandate to meddle in broader matters that are properly in the purview of  our national government.  </P> <P> Most of us would differ with them on the national issues, and it is highly  unlikely that they would receive the vote of the majority of the residents of  Irvine if they decided to run for Congress. As a matter of fact, we should  already be asking if we made the right choice by electing to the council people  who do not find running the city challenging enough and intrude into the domain  of other branches of the government.  </P> <P> BELA A. LENGYEL  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KNOX KEEPS HARTFORD LEAD BY ONE STROKE  </P> <P> Leading the Greater Hartford Open is nothing new to Kenny Knox. Staying on top  would be.  </P> <P> Knox shot a four-under-par 67 Friday at Cromwell, Conn., for a two-round total  of 132 and held a one-stroke lead over Clark Burroughs, who is seeking his  first PGA Tour victory.  </P> <P> Lee Trevino had the best round of the tournament. His 64 put him in a tie for  third place at 134 with David Frost (who shot a 65), Jim Carter, Bill Britton  and Robert Wrenn.  </P> <P> Knox had shared the first-day lead at 65 with Paul Azinger and Bob Gilder. But  Azinger, the 1987 Hartford champion, had a second-round 70 for a 135, and  Gilder shot a 74 for a 139.  </P> <P> Knox, with two victories since turning pro in 1978, had a good chance to win  the 1986 tournament. He was tied for first place after three rounds, then  soared to a 75 and ended up tied for 24th.  </P> <P> Jane Crafter and Susan Sanders, both seeking their first LPGA tour victories,  shared the lead in the first round of a $275,000 tournament at Sylvania, Ohio.,  at four-under-par 67.  </P> <P> Betsy King, the year's top money-winner, was only one shot back, tied with  Liselotte Neumann of Sweden, the 1988 U.S. Women's Open champion.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass shot an eight-under-par 64 to take the first-round lead in a  $300,000 Senior PGA Tour tournament at Concord, Mass.  </P> <P> Douglass, who equaled the competitive course record set by Bruce Crampton in  1986 and matched by himself in the second round last year, held a one-stroke  lead over Mike Hill and Bob Charles.  </P></p>

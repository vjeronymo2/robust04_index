			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Management: Doctrines to salve corporate souls - Tim Dickson considers the Christian view of modern business Commercial interest in one of the most important Christian festivals reaches fever pitch this week. But turning the spotlight the other way, what about the Christian view of modern business? This issue was addressed last month in a lecture to the Christian Association of Business Executives by the Reverend Jack Mahoney, professor of business ethics and corporate responsibility at the London Business School. Mahoney argued that Christian beliefs underpin a variety of attitudes, but that giving 'due weight' to all of them permits encouragement for what business is capable of doing, tempered by criticism and impatience for what it is not doing, or doing to an insufficient degree. He outlined several ways - among them ethical shopping and whistle-blowing - in which Christians can promote business conduct in accordance with their values and principles. To a large extent, Mahoney explained, Christian attitudes reflect the emphasis individuals put on the four leading doctrines of Creation, Sin, Salvation and Completion. Traditional beliefs about death, judgment, heaven and hell, for example, have often turned people's attention to the future and to the way in which God will bring human history to 'completion'. This has led some Christians to regard with suspicion, or at least moral reserve, all secular or worldly activities, including business and the enterprise of wealth creation. Completion admittedly took on a more dynamic expression with the development of Christian political theology in the 1950s, partly in dialogue with post-war Marxism. Hope, as Mahoney put it, 'was no longer a sedative or spiritual aspirin' but a prescription for working to enable all people to live lives worthy of their destiny. Liberation theology was just one of several social and religious movements to find inspiration in this approach, betraying not so much hostility towards business as such as indignation at the unrelieved plight of the world's poor. Sin is seen by many Christians as the outstanding characteristic of society, with life viewed as a series of spiritual pitfalls - nowhere more evident than in the world of business. Mahoney, however, rejects this absolutist view, suggesting that the denunciation of consumerism may 'conceal a deeper suspicion of material creation which at times verges on the heretical in Christian terms'. He says New Testament warnings against individual accretion of wealth should be put in the context of early Christians' lack of interest in social ethics. The Gospel, he adds, has nothing to say about the spiritual and moral dangers arising from poverty. It is the doctrines of Creation and Salvation, though, which Mahoney says most effectively counter the stress put on the role of business as social villain and exploiter. The theology of the former shows that 'wealth and riches should not be considered demonic or evil, but as having a positive and God-given social purpose in the continuing work of advancing human society'. Salvation contributes 'a note of Christian optimism . . . a belief that even given the influence of sin there remains a radical goodness about creation'. Turning to ethics, Mahoney examined the responsibility of the three big stakeholders in business: customers, investors and workers. While not aligning himself formally with the 'vigilante' consumer movement in the US, he nevertheless stated that the 'socially responsible use' of personal or family resources was a 'Christian way of using one's economic purchasing power to influence markets and guide business'. He said shareholders should see themselves as 'trustees of an organic ongoing enterprise rather than simply as the absolute possessors of inert property'. Mahoney also urged labour to mobilise its influence and power on behalf of other stakeholders. Whistle-blowing may popularly be equated with disloyalty, but 'it expresses a wider loyalty to society'.</p>

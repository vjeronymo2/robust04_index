			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Building Societies - Shifting ground: Rival banks could top Lloyds' offer in auction Britain's retail banks are all likely to reconsider their attitude to taking over societies as a result of the Lloyds' move. But has Lloyds done enough to ensure that another bank does not simply top its offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester? Such a move could be attractive either for a large UK bank or an overseas bank wanting to enter the UK market. There is nothing to stop one doing so because C&amp;G is mutually-owned, and an auction is not constrained by the Takeover Panel. The attraction of bidding for C&amp;G is that the society is known as one of the best-managed of medium-sized societies, with a very low ratio of costs to income and careful risk management controls on residential mortgage lending. If the court case due for May to establish whether a third party such as a bank can pay bonuses to a society's members goes in Lloyds favour, this would not only open up other societies but C&amp;G itself to potential counter-bids. However, there are several difficulties for any bank considering trying to top Lloyds' offer: Lloyds is probably the only UK bank with enough spare capital to make a Pounds 1.8bn bid in cash. Lloyds has shown that it can pay up to Pounds 940m in goodwill from its capital without even having its debt ratings lowered by ratings agencies. Another bank would probably have to top the bid by using its own shares to pay C&amp;G members. Although JP Morgan, C&amp;G's adviser, did not preclude such an offer in the bid process, this would be less attractive to C&amp;G members. In a move designed to prevent rival bids, C&amp;G's board has agreed not to put any other offer to members for an undisclosed period. Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, says this means it 'would not be easy for anyone else to participate'. Without a recommendation from C&amp;G's board, it would be very hard for a rival bid to succeed. The voting requirements to gain approval are so stiff that a strong recommendation not to accept an offer could almost certainly prevent it. C&amp;G's board chose Lloyds because it was happy not only with the price it was offered, but the promises it was given on management independence. Another bank would probably have to match such guarantees to be considered. C&amp;G directors also believe that a higher price paid to its members might rebound because the new owner would have to raise mortgage rates or reduce savings rates in order to raise margins to recoup the money it had just paid out.</p>

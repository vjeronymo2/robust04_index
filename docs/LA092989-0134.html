			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POET TAKES ROLE IN SOLVING HOMELESS PROBLEM: SHE'S BEEN THERE  </P> <P> Although she's never had to sleep on the streets, Laguna Beach poet Terry  Kennedy has known the pain of being poor, unemployed and homeless.  </P> <P> Kennedy's early-1988 bout with homelessness was brief (she and her husband were  given housing by a friend she calls "my godmother," and they eventually  acquired an apartment of their own), but the experience left a deep imprint on  the poet.  </P> <P> Now a part-time community college instructor and free-lance writer, Kennedy  still struggles to make ends meet. Today, however, she lives in a gracious  apartment with her husband, fiction writer Mark Miller. For the past eight  months Kennedy has also been involved with the Orange County Homeless Issues  Task Force.  </P> <P> "When I was finally hired back as a teacher and a writer, I felt so grateful. I  was just so grateful that I had a roof over my head, and I wanted to help other  people," she said.  </P> <P> As chair of the Community Education Committee of the task force, Kennedy has  researched and written a report on the need to create affordable housing in  Orange County.  </P> <P> And as part of her work to raise public consciousness about homeless people's  problems, she's organized a free "Homeless Awareness Reading" for Sunday from 2  to 5 p.m. in Laguna's Heisler Park. At least 12 poets will read poems on a  variety of themes.  </P> <P> "We're not raising money, just hopefully people will pass by and hear some  poems and want to get involved in some way," Kennedy said. The kickoff speaker  will be Scott Mather, chair of the California Homeless Coalition. Orange County  poets Marcia Cohee, John Brugaletta and Lee Mallory, San Fernando Valley poets  Sylvia Rosen and Nancy Shiffrin, Long Beach writer John Brander and others will  perform.  </P> <P> Subtitled "A Shake-Up Wake-Up Out of Your Apathy Poetry Reading," the event is  sponsored by the California Poets for the Poor. That group consists, basically,  of one person: Kennedy.  </P> <P> Kennedy is a short, vivacious woman who speaks passionately -- with audible  exclamation points -- about most things that draw her interest. The idea for  the "Homeless Awareness Reading" came from her desire to somehow make a  difference in public consciousness about homelessness.  </P> <P> "Being a poet, you do have a responsibility to awaken this spiritual part of  people," said Kennedy, who's the author of three published books of poetry.  "That's what poetry is about, it's about awakening this spirit in people, this  giving, loving, generous spirit. . . . People on the street are not  second-class citizens. They deserve a roof over their heads, and they deserve  respect."  </P> <P> Father Colin Henderson is the director of Friendship Shelter, the only homeless  shelter in Laguna. Henderson, who originally suggested to Kennedy that she work  with the Homeless Issues Task Force, said he supports the idea of the "Homeless  Awareness Reading."  </P> <P> "I think, in a city which has strong links with the arts, this is an  interesting way of approaching (homelessness)," Henderson said. "People tend to  think of homelessness in stereotypical terms, and they need to think of it in  personal terms. People do not know or understand how difficult it is for people  of low incomes to live in Orange County, and probably beyond. I don't think  it's getting any better, and I'm afraid it's bound to get worse."  </P> <P> John Brugaletta, a Cal State Fullerton English professor and poet, said he will  read poems on several different themes, including some about homelessness.  </P> <P> "I feel there is a need for raising people's awareness of the homeless," said  Brugaletta, who's a regular volunteer at a Fullerton soup kitchen. "I'm not  sure how effective a poetry reading is for doing this, but I think everybody  ought to be doing everything they can. This is what poets can do."  </P> <P> Terri Brint Joseph, a Chapman College English professor, said she'll read a  number of poems about "homes, how I've felt about places I've lived, what a  home can mean to us."  </P> <P> Homelessness is a good theme for a writer, Joseph said. "It's so emotionally  laden. I think part of us is always a stranger, and isn't fully attached or  fully related to those around us. I think that experience is somehow related to  literal homelessness."  </P> <P> Kennedy's research has shown her that there's plenty of literal homelessness in  Orange County, which has one of the most expensive housing markets in the  country. Not only is there a dearth of affordable housing (in her report,  affordable housing is defined as housing that takes less than 60% of your  income to maintain), but "I've found so many people who are literally just one  paycheck away from homelessness," Kennedy said. The first real financial  emergency could put these people on the street, she noted.  </P> <P> "Millions of dollars are given in Orange County to keep pieces of sculpture,  pots, photos, paintings in a museum," she said. "Why can't those same  (grant-giving) corporations give money to the homeless? I just don't understand  the mentality that cannot help people in need."  </P> <P> Kennedy hasn't always been active on social issues. At one time, "I was a very  wealthy lady," she said. "How I viewed (the homeless), if I did, was that they  were sort of 'over there.' I never in my life dreamed that I could become a  person who was homeless."  </P> <P> Formerly married to a wealthy Bostonian, Kennedy was divorced in 1980 and came  to California soon afterward. She lived in Laguna Beach and the Lucerne Valley  while she taught, wrote and traveled. She married and divorced again before  getting together with Mark Miller, her current husband. And in July, 1987, she  and Miller won a grant from the Massachusetts-based Barbara Dunning Foundation  to travel to Australia and New Zealand.  </P> <P> "To live in New Zealand was very inexpensive for us," said Kennedy. "We were  writing every day, and the cost of living was an artist's dream." The couple  planned to stay overseas for another year, but Kennedy's attorney called to say  her small, ramshackle Lucerne Valley cabin had been sold. Kennedy and Miller  came home to collect the money, only to learn the offer on the house had been  bogus.  </P> <P> With their funds extremely low, the couple boarded a bus, came to Laguna and  immediately began looking for jobs. They were lucky: By the end of the first  day, Miller was employed at a bookstore and Kennedy had a job in a maternity  shop. Yet, "we didn't even have enough money for a hotel," Kennedy remembers.  That was when Luella Russell, Kennedy's Leisure World "godmother," gave them a  home for two weeks. "I literally don't know what we would have done without  her," Kennedy said.  </P> <P> "I never told anybody what was happening to me," Kennedy added. "I was too  embarrassed." They found a small apartment, and both worked more than full time  at a variety of low-paying jobs they traveled to by bus. "We were working all  the time to get a car. Once we got a car last November, then a whole new world  opened up for us in terms of jobs," Kennedy said.  </P> <P> Miller now teaches six writing classes at four different schools, while Kennedy  teaches three classes through Orange Coast College and Rancho Santiago College.  Both take the first few hours of each day for their own writing, even when it  means rising at 4 a.m., Kennedy said.  </P> <P> Kennedy feels her involvement with homeless issues has strengthened her poetry.  And she hopes that California Poets for the Poor will draw area poets together  into an ongoing organization that runs workshops and sponsors readings at  homeless shelters and other sites.  </P> <P> "I think poets want to be actively involved somehow, politically, but they  don't know how," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA  </P> <P> A former sheriff's deputy pleaded innocent Friday to a federal charge of  violating the civil rights of a Vista man during a 1987 arrest.  </P> <P> Benjamin Galvan of Escondido appeared before U.S. Magistrate Barry Moskowitz,  who set bail at $5,000.  </P> <P> Galvan, who was indicted earlier this week, surrendered Friday after his  arraignment and was briefly taken into custody. He was released after posting  bail.  </P> <P> Galvan is charged with depriving John McDougall of his civil rights by beating  him with a flashlight while McDougall was being restrained during an arrest.  </P> <P> The defendant no longer works for the Sheriff's Department, but his attorney,  James Gattey, said in court that Galvan is appealing his firing.  </P> <P> The case is one of about 70 being investigated by the U.S. attorney's office  after complaints of beatings by deputies, mostly in jails. It is the only one  in which charges have been filed.  </P> <P> The charge is a misdemeanor, and Galvan could be sentenced to one year in jail  and receive a $100,000 if convicted.  </P> <P> The magistrate ordered the former deputy to return to court Monday to schedule  future hearings.  </P></p>

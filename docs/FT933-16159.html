			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Italian pay accord prompts cut in interest rates: But the country still has the most rigid labour system within the EC THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut its discount rate by a full percentage point to 9 per cent, the lowest level since 1976. The cut, effective from today, follows the four-year pact agreed on Saturday between employers and trade unions on wages and working conditions. The agreement also enabled Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, to leave for the Tokyo G7 summit with clear evidence of his government's determination to hold down inflation and tackle the public sector deficit. Mr Ciampi had set Saturday as the deadline for Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, and the three trade union confederations to resolve the issue. The agreement is Mr Ciampi's first important achievement since taking office two months ago. Nevertheless, the outcome still leaves Italy with the most rigid labour system in the EC. The wage element in Italy's high labour costs may now tend downwards but other aspects (such as social security, pensions and job security) are scarcely affected. However, the deal is a compromise with many unresolved aspects. The most important is how to tackle employers' demands to avoid matching a rise in social security contributions on wage increase above the national minimum. This issue had been one of the sticking points in the talks and had to be left out of the agreement. As a result, the agreement will not be signed until July 22. This will give Mr Ciampi time to produce a proposal, probably based on offering tax concessions against the extra cost of social security contributions. The union leadership will also have time to test the reaction of its members, who could be hostile. Many view the concessions which have been made as a further erosion of union bargaining power. Within the framework of a four-year pact, the trade union leadership has accepted that wages cannot match inflation and that increases must be linked to productivity. This endorses the parlous state of Italy's public finances and company profitability. In the current recession generous (and inflationary) wage settlements are out of the question. Another union concession has been to drop opposition to the principle of temporary employment and lower starting salaries. Acceptance of lower starting salaries is the first step towards breaking down labour rigidities. However, temporary employment is scarcely a breakthrough because the agreement is surrounded by many caveats and much potential bureaucracy. In return for union concessions, the government has agreed to speed benefits applied to workers who are temporarily laid off and to extend lay-off payments to small companies. Until now, only employees in large companies have benefited. Despite ultimatums, the employers did not wish to be viewed as responsible for sabotaging the agreement and undermining the stability of the Ciampi government. They have achieved considerably less than they need to modernise industrial relations and they have lost their argument to deal with the unions at one level - local or national. But in return the centralised hegemony of the three trade union confederations has been weakened in favour of greater local initiative, and individual works councils will have greater autonomy. These changes should speed a shake-up of the confederations which evolved reflecting the Cold war divisions - the former communist dominated CGIL, the Christian Democrat CISL and the Socialist UIL.</p>

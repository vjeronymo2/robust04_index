			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: Le Baruffe Chiozzotte - European Arts Festival Giorgio Strehler's Piccolo Teatro of Milan has not been seen in London for over 25 years and is here all too briefly now as part of the much under-publicised European Arts Festival. Strehler's direction of Carlo Goldoni's Le Baruffe Chiozzotte is pure pleasure, tinged perhaps with a slight tear at the final curtain. Goldoni was the man who put an end to the improvised Commedia dell'arte in the 18th century by insisting that performances should have texts, not just a rough scenario. Le Baruffe is not one of his best-known pieces, though a programme note tells us that it was singled out by Goethe as being the work of a master when he saw it in Venice in 1786. British audiences will know him most for The Servant of Two Masters, but his output ran to some 200 works, each taking on average about eight days to write. The genius here seems to belong largely to Strehler and his team, including the musicians and the designer (Luciano Damiani) as well as the cast. While the piece is played in Italian, the title has been translated into The Chioggian Quarrels. 'Squabbles' might be more appropriate, for these Italian fights calm down as quickly as they flare up. Chioggia is the fishing port near Venice: the women wait for the fishermen to return and wonder about who will marry whom. When the boat comes in, the fighting starts. All is resolved in the end, however, by referring the disputes to the local assistant magistrate, Isidoro. The historical interest is that this was the post in Chioggia held by Goldoni before his play-writing took off. Isidoro (Luciano Roman) is a wonderfully detached figure who just watches in solitude when the wedding party takes place: that is the cause for the final tear, plus the fact that the performance has been so perfect. The joy lies in the depiction of the fishing village. Some times there is ensemble playing, as when the women do their weaving and await the men. At others an individual stands out, as when one of the men loses his temper. Strehler has a marvellous way of producing caricatures who are not stereotypes: for example, the magistrate's aged clerk who proceeds at his own slow pace, regardless of events, or the old fisherman, Padron Toni, who can hardly speak but to whom everyone tries to listen. An entire village is here with a cast of little more than a dozen: note the emergence of the children who initially are heard not seen. There is magnificent use of the Lyttelton Theatre's space. Much of the stage is bare, with the canal where the boat comes in in the background. That leaves plenty of room for the squabbles. The two tall dark houses at the sides have shutters which suddenly open to reveal the women. It is as if the whole place had eyes. As Strehler has a passion for Shakespeare, it would be a treat to see what this company would do with Romeo and Juliet. I should add that there is a touch of Marxism: you can be forgiven for thinking of Brecht, though Brecht at his best. Strehler is a socialist director, stressing his feelings for the poor, and if one wanted to be slightly unkind, one could say that is designer socialism par excellence. I mean that as a compliment. The chief memory is of the sheer delight the Italians take in their language and in every detail of the playing. This is a spoken opera. Lyttelton Theatre. (071) 928 2252. Ends today.</p>

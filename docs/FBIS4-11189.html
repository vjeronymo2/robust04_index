			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate </F> for the Nationalist Republic Alliance, in San Salvador -- live]    [Text] Thank you very much for this great opportunity to  address the Salvadoran people through Radio Cadena YSKL to tell  them that today is a historic day for El Salvador. It is a day  when the Salvadoran people, with their vote, support --  necessary support -- marking the path that El Salvador must  follow. In this sense, the democratic process is being  consolidated. Peace is also being consolidated. We are  attaining that blessed stability El Salvador needs for  development and progress and to provide the help we need, the  help thousands upon thousands of Salvadoran brothers need.    I wish to invite the Salvadoran people to cast their vote.  Let us express and consolidate our strongest wishes for the  consolidation of democracy and peace. This process will be part  of our history. It is a historical process in which, for the  first time, Salvadorans who had never believed or participated  in the democratic process are now participating. This  participation has made these elections historical and the  process has become historical.    El Salvador is setting new standards. El Salvador is setting  new standards for plural participation. We are establishing  pluralism, which is possible with this democracy we are  building, to which each of us are contributing.    I wish to ask the people to vote. Only by voting can we  ensure the future of our children. Only with our vote can we  ensure progress, welfare, development, and improved standards of  living so greatly needed in El Salvador. Only in this manner  can we ensure better and clearer institutions for the good of  all Salvadorans.    I can see that all is going well. The guidelines established  by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal are working. The people are  finding that voting is much easier today. The voting tables  have been set up in alphabetical order. Getting information is  much easier today. No one should refrain from casting his vote.  We must all express our sovereign will. It is not possible to  refrain from participating; it is not possible to remain  isolated; it is not possible to refrain from voting when it is  our marvelous duty to express our wishes. Let the countries and  peoples see the democracy the Salvadorans are proudly building.    Onward, fellow countrymen. Onward, Salvadoran people. Let  us all vote and express our sovereign will.    Thank you for this opportunity you have given me to call on  the people and to tell them that all is going nicely, and we  hope it will remain so. We hope there will be nothing for us to  regret. This is a civic feast. This is a feast for all  Salvadorans to celebrate with the joy, with that flavor the  Salvadoran people give to all these great events.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> East German Secretary of State for Religious Affairs Kurt Loeffler will visit  Israel next week, Israeli officials said. Communist East Germany has never had  diplomatic relations with Israel and until recently refused to accept any  historical responsibility for the crimes of Nazi Germany. Loeffler is the most  senior East Berlin official to visit the Jewish state. Israeli officials said  they are not aware of plans to discuss East German reparations for the victims  of Nazism, although East German leader Erich Honecker last year offered to pay  compensation after talks with officials of the World Jewish Congress.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Peter Hall Quits Glyndebourne: An artistic tiff over Peter Sellars' staging of  Mozart's "Magic Flute" at the Glyndebourne Festival has resulted in Sir Peter  Hall resigning last weekend as artistic director.  </P> <P> Hall, 59, said he had not been consulted about Sellars' radical production --  which has no dialogue and is staged on a Los Angeles freeway. In his  resignation letter, Hall said his quarrel was not with Sellars, but with  Glyndebourne "which now attaches little importance to my artistic opinion."  Hall had been artistic director of the festival, one of the world's most  prestigious opera organizations, since 1984 and associated with it for 20  years. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

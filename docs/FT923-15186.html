			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Allied Radio loss at Pounds 357,000 midway Allied Radio, which was formed last August through the merger of two commercial radio companies, County Group and Mercury Group, followed by a reverse takeover of Third Mile Investment, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 357,000 for the half year to March 31. Mr Ken Prichard Jones, chairman, said that in order to fall in line with the quoted radio sector Allied had changed its year end to September 30. Accordingly it was announcing pro forma six-month results for the main trading subsidiaries, County Sound and Radio Mercury, and a three-month period for Allied Radio. He said that the company had significantly improved its trading position, mainly through merger rationalisation. The cost reduction programme had exceeded the original estimate and the disposal of non-core assets in the previous Third Mile Investment was almost complete. In addition, the relaunch of Radio Mercury on FM and County Sound on AM had started well. The pro forma pre-tax loss last time was Pounds 703,000. Group turnover for the first half amounted to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 2.52m) and operating losses were Pounds 249,000 (Pounds 541,000). Losses per share came through at 0.85p (2.06p). To comply with Stock Exchange regulations Allied will announce results for the six months to June 30 in due course.</p>

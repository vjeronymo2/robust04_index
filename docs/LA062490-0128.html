			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST: GARDENING  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurseryman on what to do in the garden this week:  </P> <P> If feeding camellias and azaleas with an acid-promoting fertilizer doesn't  "green" them up, use an iron chelate available at your local garden center.  </P> <P> Soak hanging basket plants under a sprinkler or in a tub every now and then to  insure roots are getting thoroughly irrigated.  </P> <P> Bougainvillea bloom will be intensified if you keep the plants on the dry side.  If they're not blooming at all, chances are you're watering too much.  </P> <P> Chrysanthemums bought in bloom this month can be cut back when flowering is  finished for a second bloom in the fall.  </P></p>

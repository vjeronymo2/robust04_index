			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: Love and dissolution in a cooler climate - The latest offering from an acclaimed author who is finding that the critical pendulum is starting to swing against her / Autumn Fiction WRITTEN ON THE BODY by Jeanette Winterson Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 190 pages YOUNG people who want to write for a living no longer starve in garrets, but they can still have a pretty rough time until the money starts to roll in from the books and the TV-scripts - if ever it does. Take the case of Jeanette Winterson. In 1983 she was 24 and down from Oxford, with a first novel inside her bursting to get out. Its title was from a saying of Nell Gwynn's, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit. Winterson's circumstances while writing it were distinctly straitened, as she explains: 'At that time, I was sharing two rooms and a hip bath with the actress Vicky Licorish. She had no money, I had no money. We could not afford the luxury of a separate whites wash and so were thankful of the fashion for coloured knickers, which allowed those garments most closely associated with our self-esteem not to be grey'. Just that one brief quotation makes it abundantly clear that we are dealing with a Writer; someone whose printed words contain the magic that turns them into a voice talking to you, forcing you to continue reading the book. Winterson's singular talent was first recognised in the publishing world by a woman editor at the newly formed Pandora Press, who accepted the novel but published it only in a paperback edition. Winterson explains: 'It went unnoticed, except in the most banal way, by most reviewers and started to sell at an alarming rate. Small bookshops and word of mouth were the foundations of my career. . .' The debutante novelist had two trump cards which she played skilfully. She was Lancashire working class and had been brought up in an eccentric denomination of the Christian faith, the Pentecostal Evangelists. The latter fate - an off-beat spiritual up-bringing - makes for a strenuous childhood but it does in recollection provide wonderful copy for a writer, as was shown by Edmund Gosse who was raised in the even sterner creed of the Plymouth Brethren. His account was called Father and Son. Winterson's might just as easily have been called 'Mother and Daughter.' Oranges went on to win the Whitbread prize for a first novel and was made into an award-winning television drama. Then in 1987 came The Passion, which won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize, and in 1989 Sexing the Cherry (both available at Pounds 9.95 in the attractive new hardback Bloomsbury Classics). By then Winterson had, through her writing, become a totem for the alternative society. Its high priest across the water, Gore Vidal, gave her his accolade by describing her as 'the most interesting writer I have read in 20 years.' Now, Winterson has come up with Written on the Body, involving a change of publisher from Bloomsbury to Cape and expectations from the fiction-reading public, whipped up by the publicists, at their highest. The novel has been heralded by a flurry of interviews, from which we gather that the hip bath has gone for good and the former female companion has also been replaced. Meanwhile, the critical pendulum has started ominously to swing against Winterson. Reviews have begun to appear by those impatient to knock the book; some of them were not even prepared to wait for it to be published officially before putting in the boot. Clearly, those reviewers who failed to praise Winterson when it was fashionable to do so are not going to let themselves be caught out a second time, now that it is becoming fashionable to denigrate her. And yet, Written on the Body is no better and no worse than any of the previous novels. It has exactly the same intimacy of manner, the same quota of brilliant one-liners, the same digressive tendency leading the writer to indulge in whimsical reminiscence to the detriment of her plot; and it explores that same high plateau of passion in which the lover seems to be in love not so much with another person as with the condition of being in love. She (or maybe he - one assumes, rashly, the first-person narrator is a she although that is never actually stated) is determined to preserve this bliss for ever in all its white-hot incandescence. In the novels after Oranges, the writer put on the mask of some humble historical figure - Napoleon's under-chef in the Grand Army, the assistant gardener to John Tradescant during the Civil War period - to demonstrate such passion as an element in a wider cataclysm. The vulnerability of the leading women characters was compensated for by giving them some grotesque physical abnormality from which they drew strength - huge girth, webbed feet (see Angela Carter's winged heroine, Fevvers, the model for this particular feminist strategy). It is all here again but, this time, made contemporary. The male ogre who stands for the stultifying imprisonment of a conventional affluent marriage is a Jewish doctor, a cancer specialist from north London's Stamford Hill. The hero/heroine - the I - who finds an ultimate love object in his wife is a translator. The affair, involving the ditching of a previous girlfriend, is described with dithyrambic Wintersonian intensity that is often quite hard to take. Such a passion in Winterson's world is never transformed by the process of procreation, its natural and usual culmination, so what may alter or frustrate it? The answer, here, is the onset of cancer, portending the death of the love object. Leukaemia afflicts the doctor's wife, who returns to him. That leads Winterson to some high definition writing on the inroads the disease makes on the body, and also to an extended description of the agony it imposes on the mind of the sufferer's beloved partner. This is a very real human problem, one not exclusive to the experience of either gender. It is studied at the end of this short novel with poignant realism.</p>

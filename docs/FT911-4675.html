			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Bonds: Roche US unit in Dollars 1bn innovative warrant deal ROCHE Holdings, the US subsidiary of the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, added to the supply of equity-linked paper yesterday, launching an innovative Dollars 1bn warrant bond issue. The deal is Roche's first debt issue in the international market and is structured to protect warrant holders from any serious decline in the share price of the Swiss parent company. Priced at par, each bond pays a coupon of 3 1/2 per cent and was issued with 73 warrants attached. The European-style warrants are exerciseable on May 16, 1994, with each 100 warrants entitling the holder to receive one share. However, holders have the option of taking a SFr7,000 cash payment if Roche shares are below this level. The cost of this protection is that the company has the option of making a SFr10,000 cash payment in place of shares. Hence both the risk and the reward of the warrants are moderated by the structure. This is the first time that 'bull spread' warrants on the shares of a single company have been issued in the international market. Lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said that the minimum annual return was 1.7 per cent and the maximum return 14.6 per cent. Roche shares yield around 0.56 per cent on the Zurich stock market and yesterday closed slightly higher on the day at SFr7550. Participants said the structure appealed to Swiss institutional investors, many of which have to meet minimum investment return targets under law. SBC also expects to sell paper to retail investors through its branch network. Issued at par, the bonds were trading at 100.25 bid by late afternoon with syndicate members reporting a good response. A very different equity-linked transaction was launched by Credit Suisse First Boston for the PT Inti Indorayon Utama, an Indonesian pulp and textiles firm. The Dollars 60m convertible bond issue is the third by an Indonesian company in the international market. Indorayon is Indonesia's fifth largest company with a market capitalisation of around Dollars 1bn. However, the deal follows the weak performance of the last convertible deal from an Indonesian company, a Dollars 125m deal launched earlier this year by PT Astra. Issued at par, Astra bonds were yesterday trading at around 95 bid. The Indorayon deal will be priced on Monday at an indicated conversion premium of between 6 per cent and 10 per cent over the current share price. The coupon will be fixed at between 7 per cent and 7.25 per cent. The lead manager commented that the smaller size of the deal should ensure firmer price performance for the bonds, although the issuer hopes to lift the deal to Dollars 75m if market conditions allow. Elsewhere, Sears, the UK retailing group, launched a Pounds 100m five-year deal lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The deal will be priced today at an indicated yield spread of 135 basis points over the benchmark UK government bond. Sweden has announced a tender offer to buy back up to Dollars 1bn of Eurodollar and US bonds via Salomon Brothers. The Pounds 250m 8 5/8 per cent Eurobond maturing 2016 will be bought back at a fixed spread of 60 basis over US Treasuries. Four US issues will also be bought back at a fixed spread over Treasuries. The offer is open to April 24.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers lift There were signs that the clouds might be lifting over the food retailers as two leading securities houses turned more positive, although the shares remained largely unmoved in lethargic trading. Since the new year, the sector has been worried by a combination of price war fears, the erosion of margins and the arrival of US-style discounters. Brokers have responded by advising investors to go underweight. Yesterday, NatWest Securities turned positive, arguing that 'the sector is capable of growing earnings by at least 14 per cent per annum for the next two years'. The threat of the discounters was dismissed as 'overdone', while the large financial commitments of the majors was likely to keep price competition fears in check. SG Warburg took the opportunity to respond to the recent weakness in the shares and Friday's retail price data, underlining its positive short-term stance on the sector. Both houses recommend Argyll Group, whose shares faded after an initial spurt to close a penny down at 338p. NatWest upgraded its profits estimate for the stock by Pounds 10m to Pounds 553m for 1994-95. Asda was also on the NatWest buy list, with Kleinwort Benson also said to be positive yesterday. The shares gained 2 1/2 at 68 1/2p.</p>

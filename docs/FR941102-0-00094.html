			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In sum, the revised Rule requires broker-dealers to disclose whether they receive payment for order flow. If any type of payment for order flow is received, the broker-dealer must provide a detailed description of the nature of the compensation received and, as discussed below, information about the routing of unspecified orders and whether those orders can be executed at prices better than the NBBO at the time the order is received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Order Routing and Best Execution <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent that market center structures differ materially in the opportunity for unpriced orders to be executed at prices that are superior to the NBBO, the receipt of payment for order flow could be viewed as improperly affecting a dealer's determination regarding where to route customer orders and the dealer's ability to satisfy its best execution obligation, if the dealer does not provide as good an overall opportunity for best execution as it would without the payment for order flow. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  In particular, this could happen when dealers decide to route orders to a market center which does not provide an opportunity for price improvement, although other factors such as the size of the order, speed of execution, and the costs and difficulty associated with achieving best execution in a particular market may negate this conclusion. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  The Commission noted in the Proposing Release that broker-dealers are under a duty to seek the ``best execution'' of their customer's orders. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  Broker-dealers accepting remuneration from a market center for directing order flow to that market center are still obligated to fulfill their duty of best execution to their customers. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  The Commission understands that most firms that pay for order flow guarantee, at a minimum, executions at the NBBO. As stated in the Proposing Release, such so-called quote-derived executions in many ways are not materially different from automated execution systems operated by the regional exchanges for years. While automated execution systems offer fast and assured executions to customers, orders sent to an exchange for manual handling and orders sent to an OTC dealer for manual (or in some cases automated) handling may have a greater opportunity for an execution between the spread than do orders that are routed to a quote-based automated execution system. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Market 2000, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, Study V at 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report on Bank Securities Activities, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [While] brokers have not been held by the Commission, the self-regulatory organizations or the courts to an absolute requirement of achieving the most favorable price on each order [,] [w]hat has been required is that the broker endeavor, using due diligence, to obtain the best execution possible given all the facts and circumstances. These factors include, among other things, the size of the order, the trading characteristics of the security involved, the availability of accurate information affecting choices as to the most favorable market in which execution might be sought, the availability of technological aids to process such data, the availability of economic access to the various market centers and the costs and difficulty associated with achieving an execution in a particular market center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Second Report on Bank Securities Activities: Comparative Regulatory Framework Regarding Brokerage-Type Services <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  97&hyph;98, n.233 (Feb. 3, 1977),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> as reprinted in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  H.R.

In its purest form, best execution can be thought of as executing a customer's order so that the customer's total cost or proceeds are the most favorable under the circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Market 2000 Concept Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, note 57 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A broker-dealer's duty to seek best execution of customer orders derives from, among other sources, the common law agency duty of loyalty, which obligates an agent to act exclusively in the principal's best interest. The Commission noted in the Proposing Release its concern that the availability of payments in return for order flow commitments may influence the evaluation by a broker-dealer of the most advantageous market or market maker to whom to route its customer order. Indeed, some opponents of the practice of payment for order flow believe that acceptance and retention of payments by brokers from market makers constitute a breach of duty not permitted under agency common law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Restatement 2d Agency section 388 (1958). While the Commission is concerned about a broker-dealer's fiduciary duty to seek to obtain the best execution for its customer, it believes that bulk order routing based, in part, on the receipt of payment for order flow is not, in and of itself, a violation of those duties. Disclosure of payment for order flow, moreover, could help inform customers and negate the concern that customers are unable to evaluate whether they receive inferior executions due to undisclosed rebates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19047 (Sept. 14, 1982), 47 FR 41896 (Sept. 21, 1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposing Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1, 58 FR at 52941 n. 59.

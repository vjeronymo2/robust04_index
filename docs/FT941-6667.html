			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Howard retreats over police bill Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has been forced into a humiliating climbdown in the face of determined Lords opposition to his plans to increase Home Office control of police authorities. The climbdown will be announced in the Lords today by Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister of state, when debate resumes on the police and magistrates courts bill. Earl Ferrers will tell peers that Mr Howard has given way to demands by backbench Conservatives, backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, for local control of police authority membership. Mr Howard intended to take powers to appoint five of the 16 members of reformed police authorities, including the chairman, which would have given unelected Home Office nominees and magistrates an inbuilt majority over local authority representatives. The proposals would have changed the character of police authorities, which at present are two-thirds local councillors and one-third magistrates. The government began to back down after the bill was savaged during its second reading debate by Conservative peers led by Lord Whitelaw, former deputy prime minister. Compromise proposals that would have distanced the home secretary from the selection of nominated members and allowed authorities to pick their own chairman were dropped after a second backbench rebellion by Tory peers. Earl Ferrers will tell the Lords that the government now accepts that local authority representatives should always have a majority over magistrates and the home secretary's nominees. He will say that most police authorities will have nine councillors, compared with five Home Office nominees and three magistrates. A few authorities will be larger, but the proportions will be similar. The Home Office nominees will be chosen from a list produced by selection panels consisting of three groups: equal numbers of members chosen centrally by the home secretary, and locally by councillors and magistrates; and a separate delegation chosen jointly by the first two groups. The extent of the climbdown reflects Mr Howard's fear that the bill would be rejected by the Lords, which would have forced ministers to rely on a small Commons majority.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces, chaired the national ceremony  marking the 33rd anniversary of the proclamation of the  socialist character of the Revolution and combatants day. More  than 6,000 people participated in the popular gathering where a  military review was held. The review was brightened with  patriotic poems and songs as well as typical elements of the  national culture.    The Mariana Grajales Plaza of the Revolution in Guantanamo  City also served as the site for the promotion ceremony of  reservists and combatants and the decoration of combatants that  served important missions along the perimeter that borders the  Yankee naval base. The occasion also served to award outstanding  people and institutions, with a replica of Maximo Gomez's  machete for their excellent work in the cultural field. The  ceremony was held outside of La Fortaleza de la Cabana for the  fist time.</p>

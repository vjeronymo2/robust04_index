			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Until a security system is installed in September, veterans of the Vietnam War  plan to guard a Sacramento memorial that has been vandalized over the last few  months. Pairs of volunteers, some of them attired in camouflage fatigues they  wore in Vietnam, will stand guard in four-hour shifts at night and on the  weekends. State police and members of the California Conservation Corps will  keep watch during weekdays. The $2-million memorial to more than 5,800  Californians killed in the Vietnam War was dedicated in December at the east  end of Capitol Park. Vandals broke parts of an M-16 rifle sculpted in bronze  and a miniature M-16 on a wall plaque in late February and again in April. A  flag was also stolen in April.  </P></p>

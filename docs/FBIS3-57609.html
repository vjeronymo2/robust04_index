			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, </F> Vyacheslav Tomilin, and Georgiy Shmelev]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 27 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia and China  see the preservation and development of long term bilateral  relations of good neighborliness, friendship, and mutually  beneficial cooperation as the most important condition for their  prosperity and stability and a weighty factor in international  security. This was emphasized at talks between the Russian and  PRC foreign ministers that were held today at the Diaoyutai  residence in Beijing for honored guests.    The heads of the two countries' foreign policy departments  discussed a set of issues connected with preparations for a  return visit to the Russian Federation by PRC Chairman Jiang  Zemin. He is expected to arrive in Moscow for the second  Russian-Chinese summit meeting in the third quarter of this  year. The visit will be preceded by a trip to Beijing by  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and a trip to Moscow  by PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.    The coming Russian-Chinese summit meeting, Andrey Kozyrev  said during the talks, is meant to raise relations between our  two neighboring states to a new level, a level of constructive  partnership. The development of Russian-Chinese links, he  emphasized, is of priority importance in Russian foreign policy,  which is not subject to any temporary variations.    China, the PRC foreign minister noted in turn, attaches  great  importance to dialogue and contacts between the leaders of the  two countries, which promote deepened mutual understanding and  trust.    The ministers stressed the importance of the set of mutual  commitments by the sides not to use force against one another in  any form, including not being first to use nuclear weapons.  These fundamental accords were reached at the first  Russian-Chinese summit meeting in December 1992.    After their talks the ministers signed an intergovernmental  agreement about border crossing points between the two  countries. The document specifies the legal and technical  mechanism for the functioning of the crossing points and the  procedure for their organization. These urgent matters,  incidentally, were discussed at a regional conference of Far  Eastern administration chiefs in Blagoveshchensk, in which  Andrey Kozyrev took part, and during his meeting with the  leadership of China's Heilongjiang province and the town of  Heihe before his arrival in Beijing. So far there are 21  crossing points along the Russian-Chinese border. Last year  over 2.5 million people crossed the border from both sides.    A protocol was also signed on regular consultations between  the Russian and Chinese foreign ministries on matters of  interest to the sides. [passage omitted]    In the evening Andrey Kozyrev took part in the presentation  of a Russian art exhibition at the Russian Embassy in Beijing.  Works by the well-known artist Tatyana Nazarenko are  represented in the display. Examples of traditional national  handicraft and Russian costume were presented by Leonora  Gorbunova, general director of the Ivanovo history museums.    The Russian foreign minister will be received tomorrow by  PRC  Chairman Jiang Zemin and will have a meeting with PRC Prime  Minister Li Peng. In the afternoon he will fly to the Shenzhen  special economic zone in southern China.</p>

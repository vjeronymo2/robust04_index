			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No privatisation means paralysis for Post Office Sir, It is good that the government is at last to propose privatisation of the Post Office although a full sale of the component parts would make more commercial sense than partial retention of public ownership. The privatisation legacy of the 1980s, which has enhanced both the quality of customer service as well as national return on capital throughout all the privatised sector, has left the Post Office out of kilter with everything around it. It cannot modernise and revamp its assets without meeting Treasury opposition. It cannot participate in a joint venture with, for example, an air freight operator, or make an acquisition without that being called a nationalisation. It is therefore currently held in a full Nelson, one arm financially and the other arm politically. For any business this would be bad, but for a communications business it must mean long-term deterioration. Because of recent organisational improvements, the Post Office is currently throwing off net cash to the exchequer and therefore assisting in public borrowing reductions. It has been fiscally convenient to milk this cow while indecision about privatisation continued. A normal business would be using a good part of this cash flow to protect and enhance its future competitive position. There are several parts of the Post Office which could be privatised in their entirety, such as Parcelforce, and the Counters business, without putting the thorny issue of Lettermail and the Queen's head on the political centre stage. Lettermail should, of course, ultimately be privatised, with simultaneous abolition of the monopoly. Deliveries to the Isle of Mull could be protected either by direct state subsidy or by the inhabitants paying a commercial rate. The use of the Queen's head could either be discontinued or, better, licensed with the royalty going to royalty. Those who wish the Post Office well should not be deceived into believing all will be safe if the state retains ownership and control. Such control can only bring paralysis leading to the ultimate destruction of the business. George Guise, 90 Long Acre, London WC2E 9RA</p>

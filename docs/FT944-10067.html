			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Signal out of the blue: The US move to opt out of the arms embargo against Bosnia has strained the transatlantic bond Only a few days before a landmark meeting of nine European nations on greater self-sufficiency in defence, the US has startled its allies with a change of policy over Bosnia. The US decision to end enforcement of the international arms embargo against Bosnia was bound, under a congressional mandate, to be announced by November 15, and its practical consequences may prove to be manageable. British ships, such as the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, are understood to have been fitted with high technology control systems, which could make it possible for them to take over part of the co-ordinating role currently played by the US in the Adriatic. But the US move's timing and presentation - described as 'breath-taking' by one senior European official - have given a new sharpness to the debate about the future of transatlantic co-operation in foreign affairs and defence. As European observers see it, the White House would have found a sympathetic response if it had quietly warned its allies of the impending decision and sought to limit the diplomatic fall-out. British and French officials have shown some understanding for the US administration's dilemma as it weaves its way between the pro-Bosnian lobby in Congress, and the concerns of European allies, who fear a conflagration in the Balkans. But from the European perspective, any hopes that transatlantic differences could be finessed have been disappointed. Word of the US move reached Europe 'out of the blue' through an article in the US press and comments by unnamed officials accompanying President Bill Clinton to a conference in Jakarta. It has been received in Europe as the wrong signal, at the wrong time: both to the warring parties in Bosnia, and to the European nations whose peacekeeping forces and aid workers are acutely vulnerable to any further flare-up in the fighting. 'This is not a helpful move,' said a British Foreign Office spokesman, with the practised understatement of his trade. Mr David Clark, defence spokesman for the British Labour party, was blunter. 'This promises a dangerous escalation of the Bosnian conflict,' he said. 'It is like pouring oil on to a burning fire.' Mr Clark's conclusion that 'the American action reveals the need to enhance Europe's own defence effort' will be echoed by many European politicians. Officially, the 'contact group' on Bosnia - comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - is still on the road, and will plod onwards with its efforts to present the Serbs, Croats and Moslems with a joint position. In recent weeks, the group has been haggling over a package of incentives that might be offered to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic if he agrees to recognise Croatia and settle the armed stand-off there. But it is already plain that the group - whose effectiveness depends on unity - is fundamentally divided. The US believes the refusal by the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan is a sufficient ground for authorising the open supply of arms to their Moslem and Croat enemies. The British, French and Russians disagree: they believe that diplomatic and economic isolation - by the entire outside world, including Serbia  - represents the best hope of forcing the Bosnian Serbs into a more reasonable stance. This transatlantic spat is made far more significant by its timing, just three days before a meeting in the Netherlands of the Western European Union. Until recently a Sleeping Beauty of international diplomacy, the WEU is experiencing a revival. There are policy-makers and diplomats who argue that this is in the interests of both Europe and America and implies no diminution in the warmth of political ties across the Atlantic. They argue as follows: the end of the cold war, and US budget constraints, make America less willing to commit men and armour to Europe. However, the Europeans remain dependent on the US for the assets that make it possible to deploy troops at short notice: air and sea transport, electronic intelligence and command systems. It is, therefore, logical to construct a new model for military missions launched from Europe: the Europeans will provide the men and basic hardware, while borrowing strategic assets from the US. This argument holds good as long as the strategic interests of the US and Western Europe are virtually identical. But if they diverge, this endlessly discussed model - known by the horrible acronym of Combined Joint Task Force - seems unlikely ever to come into being. Yet the only alternative to co-operation with America is for Europe to spend enormous sums developing its own strategic military assets: a prospect that would fill European finance ministers, and taxpayers, with horror. It is still too early to say how deep a split in strategic interest the US-European dispute over Bosnia reflects. It could ultimately prove to be the kind of passing squabble that often arises between ground commanders and air chiefs fighting the same war. Both western Europe and the US are weighing up the same factors in formulating their policy towards Bosnia. They want to prevent a wider war in the Balkans and beyond; maintain the west's credibility in the eyes of its friends in the Moslem world; and avoid a rupture in relations with Russia. However, the relative importance of these factors looks different from different sides of the Atlantic. America has been more vulnerable to pressure from pro-western Moslem nations, perhaps because grass-roots opinion in countries such as Egypt and Pakistan is particularly sensitive to US behaviour. Europeans, for their part, have been more dubious than the US about the feasibility, and desirability, of isolating Serbia for an indefinite period. They fear that this approach could ultimately drive the most powerful nation in former Yugoslavia into the hands of a chauvinist Russia. So there are, to put it mildly, differences of emphasis in the US and west European approaches to the Bosnian war. Officials on both sides of the Atlantic agree that the significance of these differences is far outweighed by a broader need to maintain the transatlantic relationship. The price of failure, it is widely acknowledged, could be a disorderly 'renationalisation' of the defence policies of the leading western nations, with each one pursuing its own agenda. In December, the US, Canada and all European states including Russia are due to confer in Budapest on the prospects for a new security order stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Diplomats may have to work hard to prevent the Bosnian dispute overshadowing this meeting and turning it into a fiasco.</p>

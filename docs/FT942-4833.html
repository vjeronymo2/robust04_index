			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Pounds 232,000 fine over securities selling Securities regulators have fined David Coakley, a private client futures and options firm, and its directors and employees a total of Pounds 232,000 for using high-pressure sales tactics to sell to unsophisticated investors and for 'churning' client accounts to gain commission, Norma Cohen writes. Additional payments towards regulators' costs and client compensation brings the total charges to Pounds 276,160. The Securities and Futures Authority, which last year ordered the firm to close, said that a disciplinary tribunal hearing had concluded that the pattern of its activities were 'discreditable, reckless and scandalous'. The firm was fined Pounds 100,000 and Mr David Coakley, its sole director, was fined Pounds 50,000 and expelled from SFA registers. Mr Stewart Blake, head of dealing was fined Pounds 30,000 and expelled from SFA registers. Five account executives were fined amounts ranging from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 4,000.</p>

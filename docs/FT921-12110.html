			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading AN OVERHEATED premium in stock market futures held back turnover yesterday as investors waited for the underlying equity market to catch up, writes Peter John. The FT-SE contract for March delivery opened at 2,575, 45 points above cash, and ticked up a further five-point gain in response to the general economic optimism. Although it ran out of steam at 2,580, the enthusiasm emanating from a weekend MORI poll and the present G7 summit deterred any unwinding of long positions. On the other hand, the high premium of March, against its new estimated fair value premium of 16, ensured that it was far too expensive to buy. Active morning trading drifted into desultory two-way business, which resulted in a small slide and low closing turnover of some 5,000 lots before after-hours' dealing. By the official close, March had recovered to end the day at 2,580, a premium of 39. In the LTOM, volume was just over 24,000 contracts. The busiest stock option was BT, with 1,520 lots traded. Most of the turnover was represented by a bearish hedging trade as one UK investment bank bought 1,300 of the May 300 puts at 6. Lonrho was also active with 1,475 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Coffee prices closed the day off their lows but still Dollars 8 a tonne below the previous close with the November futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange closing at Dollars 3,920 a tonne. It was a dull session as the market awaited fresh news of the Brazilian auctions. Copper failed to hold onto the the Dollars 2,500 a tonne mark with three-month metal at the London Metal Exchange slipping to Dollars 2,483 a tonne. The gloom in the copper market spread over into other metals pushing prices for nickel and lead lower and dampening the rise in the aluminium market. Aluminium prices closed slightly higher at Dollars 1,575 a tonne from Wednesday's close of Dollars 1,568 a tonne. Lead was down to Dollars 612 a tonne from Dollars 620 a tonne and nickel closed at Dollars 6,370 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

The movement stresses  that this massacre by Israeli settlers took place in collusion  with Israeli troops and the intelligence service. It coincided  with the yesterday's [24 February] massacre when the Israeli  Army waged a battle with rockets against Hamas fugitives in Abu  Dis, near Jerusalem. The movement considers this massacre and  this escalation a glaring violation of the Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993 and the  peace process. The movement holds the Israeli side and its  political, military, and security leaders responsible for all  the massacres, killings, and assassinations that are taking  place against our Palestinian people. They are responsible for  allowing settlers to carry the weapons that they aim at the sons  of our people and use to commit massacres and killings. The  movement views today's massacre, the collusion of Israeli troops  in it, what happened in Abu Dis yesterday, and the earlier  Israeli military escalation as an assassination of the peace  process and sufficient justification for military escalation by  all Palestinian resistance factions and for continued jihad and  revolution against the nightmare of Israeli occupation. Our  Palestinians will not forgive these massacres. God is great.  Glory for the free mujahidin.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Court procedures may be simplified A review of civil court procedures in England and Wales is to be carried out by Lord Justice Woolf, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, announced yesterday. He said in a Lords written reply: 'My aim is to reduce the cost of litigation, simplify the rules and remove unnecessary distinctions of practice and procedure.' The review, expected to last two years, also aims to improve access to justice. Although the High Court and county courts have their own rules and procedures, the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 resulted in the removal of many jurisdictional limits in county courts. The Lord Chancellor said he supported the recommendation of the Civil Justice Review that there should be a common core of procedural rules in the High Court and county courts. Lord Woolf will be assisted by a small team of experts with a secretariat provided by the Lord Chancellor's Department.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Zambia airline sell-off row may hit aid A dispute between the Zambian government and international donors over privatisation of the state-owned national airline could jeopardise external support for the country's economic recovery programme. The row stems from the government's decision to use a Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) oil purchase facility, provided by a Kuwaiti bank, on behalf of the heavily indebted Zambia Airways. Donors, who have met government twice this week, say it contravenes an agreement with the International Monetary Fund which includes a ceiling on public sector borrowing, and fear that the government may be backtracking on a commitment to privatise the airline. Donors and government officials are due in Paris on December 5-6 for World Bank chaired conference to review progress under the reform programme, and discuss future funding. Failure to resolve the dispute could result in donors withholding aid. Zambian government officials have strongly defended the use of the oil facility, arguing that it does not break the IMF deal, and insisting that they intend to privatise the airline. The facility was originally negotiated by the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zimco), the holding company of all Zambia's state-run enterprises, and has been used to finance oil purchases by Zamoil, the government fuel agency. Zambian officials point out that the rolling loan is replenished through the sale of the oil in Zambia, with the local currency proceeds being converted to US dollars. They argue that they are co-ordinating the needs of Zamoil with the short term refinancing and restructuring of the airlines' debt, and have paid off arrears which otherwise would have left some aircraft impounded. This will also allow time to implement a radical cost cutting plan. It includes reducing staff from 1,300 to 500, closing and selling all offices outside southern Africa except London, and selling much of the airline's property in Lusaka, including staff housing and a hotel. Some leading donors express scepticism, however, and have interpreted the government move as a last ditch attempt to avoid privatising the airline. They fear it also may signal a weakening of commitment to privatisation of the state-owned copper mines, which donors believe is essential to the recovery plan undertaken by President Frederick Chiluba on taking office three years ago. The government faces elections next year, and privatising the airline, and in particular the mines, faces considerable electoral opposition. But any weakening of government resolve would reduce donor support of Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m a year, say aid officials. Earlier this year, the government had seemed prepared to let the airline go to the wall. In a letter to Zimco, finance minister Ronald Penza wrote: 'The government is left with no option but for the airline to go into voluntary liquidation.' A year ago the International Air Transport Association (Iata) suspended the airline over arrears exceeding Dollars 5m. The airline's DC-10 was grounded over other debts, and earlier this month a New York bank seized airline assets when seeking payment of a Dollars 1m debt. Zambia Airways has accumulated a loss of Dollars 37m over the past two years. A further obligation stems from a 1990 order for a McDonnell-Douglas aircraft due to be delivered in 1996. If cancelled, it will cost Dollars 25m; if the order goes ahead, the aircraft will cost Dollars 132m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aviation Colonel General Petr Stepanovich </F> Deynekin, commander in chief of the Air Force, by Gennadiy  Lisankov; date, place not given: "Aircraft First"]    [Text] In our country military airmen are most often  mentioned in connection with emergencies on land or in the sky?  But what about the ordinary days? What problems does Russia's  air force resolve every day? That is the subject of journalist  Gennadiy Lisankov's talk with Aviation Colonel General Petr  Stepanovich Deynekin, commander in chief of the Air Force.    [Lisankov] What is the most important thing in the Air  Force's development at the present stage? How is its structure  being coordinated with Russia's defensive military doctrine?    [Deynekin] On the basis of the air force formations  inherited from the former Union an essentially new, highly  maneuverable branch of the armed forces is being created. A  balanced personnel, the existence of modern aviation equipment  and arms, the ability effectively to resolve the entire complex  of tasks in joint or independent operations, minimal expenditure  on maintenance -- those are just a few of the most important  criteria for the development of the Russian Air Force.    An important avenue of our work is the qualitative  improvement of the Air Force by reequipping the formations and  units with new multipurpose complexes with high-precision  all-weather weapons.    [Lisankov] Petr Stepanovich, from which CIS states will  student pilots be studying in Russian air force schools? How is  cooperation with NATO countries developing?    [Deynekin] Under agreements servicemen from Armenia,  Belorussia [Belarus], and Kazakhstan are studying at our air  force higher education establishments. It is planned to admit  student pilots from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan]. We are prepared to collaborate in the development  of national air forces and in other directions.    As for cooperation with the NATO countries these questions  are at the development stage. We are receiving proposals on the  mutual exchange of aviation specialists for study and industrial  training. We are studying them attentively and where possible  we are making contacts. Last year a number of student pilots  from the Kacha pilots' school underwent training in France while  French students trained at the Kacha school. The result  satisfied both sides.    Direct context when training air force cadres make it  possible to understand each other better and to reduce tension  in resolving military issues. Nor should we forget the material  advantages, that is the money which will go to develop the air  force's training and material-technical base and the solution of  social problems.    [Lisankov] Is it true that the Air Force's purchase of  MiG-29 and Su-27 type aircraft is not planned because of the  lack of funds?    [Deynekin] The Air Force has indeed stopped the purchase of  aircraft of the Mig-29 and Su-27 type but not because of budget  restrictions. The reason is simple: The plan to rearm the  fighter aircraft has been fulfilled. As Russia's economic  situation stabilizes we plan to increase the pace of the air  force's reequipping with equipment and arms of a new generation.    [Lisankov] What is the fate of the strategic bombers in the  former union republics, in particular Ukraine and Kazakhstan?    [Deynekin] The armed forces of the republics of nearby  foreign parts lack structures capable of ensuring the safe  storage of nuclear warheads and the good repair of strategic  aircraft. As a military specialist I am convinced that apart  from Russia no armed forces of the CIS countries can ensure the  good repair of the aircraft component of the strategic nuclear  forces since that requires very great material expenditure, the  highest qualifications for the servicing personnel, and aid from  design bureaus and manufacturing plants.    In Kazakhstan there were 40 Tu-95 MS aircraft. In accordance  with the commitments adopted by Russia as the heir to the Union  with regard to the strategic forces they were withdrawn to  Russia. The four last aircraft were withdrawn 19 February. The  moving of the heavy bombers, as it is customary to call them  under the treaty, although they are in fact strategic  missile-carrying aircraft, from the territory of Kazakhstan to  Russia does not contradict the provision of the START I Treaty  since it is being carried out within the national territory of  the former Soviet Union.    Aircraft from the air force nuclear forces remained in  Ukraine: There are 23 Tu-95 MS bombers at the Uzin airfield near  Kiev and 19 Tu-160 aircraft at the Priluki airfield, Chernigov  Oblast. Of these 42 strategic aircraft only a few can take off  because the repair stocks have been exhausted in the Ukrainian  Air Force line units.    Talks are under way with the Ukrainian Government on the  withdrawal of this grouping of strategic aircraft to Russian  territory. But so far we are failing to find mutual  understanding.    [Lisankov] Petr Stepanovich, you are a combat pilot. What  aircraft have you flown in your time in service?    [Deynekin] I have flown a Tu-16 and been in command of a  regiment on these aircraft. The forces were cut back yet again  -- this was in the early sixties -- and I became a civilian  pilot. When I returned to the Armed Forces I mastered the  Tu-22M, the renowned "Backfire," the first supersonic long-range  combat jet bomber with variable wing geometry.    Then I studied at the General Staff Academy and after  graduating I was commander and instructor pilot of a Tu-95  strategic combat jet. Later I mastered the Tu-160 strategic jet  aircraft. In this period I commanded first an air army and then  strategic aviation.    In May 1992 in America I made three flights on the U.S. Air  Force's Bi-B strategic bomber with in-flight refueling from a  KC-135 stratotanker.    When I was already commander in chief I flew a "Tucano" in  Brazil and a "Jaguar" in India. The latest Russian aircraft I  have mastered include the Su-25, Su-27, Mig-29, and Mig-31.    Finally I want to take this opportunity to say this. We have  spoken of military aviation's present but we must not forget the  glorious past of the Air Force and its history and traditions.  Without the past there is no future. In the Russian Air Force  now there are six twice Heroes of the Soviet Union, 15 Heroes of  the Soviet Union, and three Heroes of the Russian Federation.  And I bow low to our frontline veterans. The forthcoming  victory holiday is particularly dear to me -- both as commander  in chief and as the son of an Air Force office who died in  1943....</p>

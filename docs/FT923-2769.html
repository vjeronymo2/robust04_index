			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Observer: After-dinner treats Being a 'close friend' of analyst-cum-author Terry Smith, who is making the most of his 15 minutes of fame, certainly brings its own reflected glory. Paul Compton, UK engineering analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is resigning this morning to go to Credit Lyonnais, a move that would undoubtedly have gone largely unnoticed - apart perhaps from a brief envious glance from his colleagues in the direction of his 'much better salary' - had he not been a regular dinner companion of Terry Smith. Smith, the author of Accounting For Growth and recently sacked by UBS P &amp; D, has been basking in the glare of publicity and the ensuing flurry of questions about the independence of analysts at City investment houses. He has asked Compton to appear as his witness in the second disciplinary hearing. Compton, in turn, is ruling out any connection between his resignation and his witnessing activities. Pointing out that another colleague, still with the firm, was the witness at the first session, he goes on to explain that he is joining John Holmes, formerly head of Morgan Grenfell Securities, for whom he worked before joining UBS four years ago. He has been in discussions for the past six months, - though he is not denying that the dismal atmosphere at the firm in the wake of the Smith upheaval may have speeded his departure.</p>

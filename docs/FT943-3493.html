			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Big cable companies consider TV investment boost The biggest cable television companies are considering a significant increase in investment in programmes - including the possibility of launching between three and five new channels in the next two years. The leading companies, including TeleWest, Nynex and Bell Cablemedia, believe a wider range of material exclusive to cable may be necessary to drive cable television subscriptions to higher levels. The cable companies have invested Pounds 1.5bn in building cable networks in the UK out of a total projected investment of Pounds 10bn. The industry is now considering setting up a company to acquire rights to programmes and events and perhaps create new channels. The company, with its own chief executive and programme director, would function rather like a small version of the ITV Network Centre, which commissions programmes for the national ITV network. Debate is continuing on whether the initiative should take the form of making individual programmes or sports events available for individual cable companies to show as they like, or through the provision of new channels. Some senior cable executives would like to see new exclusive sports, entertainment and even movie channels for cable. There is likely to be a parallel increase in local and regional programming. Apart from trying to increase the subscription rate - there are already more than 730,000 subscribers to modern systems with 1m forecast for the end of this year - the cable industry would like to become less dependent on British Sky Broadcasting. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, is still the dominant provider of premium channels. The cable industry recently bought the rights to the 1996 Rugby World Cup and Channel One, a 24-hour news channel, launches in the London area later this year. TeleWest, the joint venture between US West and TCI of Denver, the biggest cable operator in the US, is convinced of the need for better programming on cable. The company feels so strongly about the issue that it is likely to go ahead on its own if an industry-wide initiative cannot be agreed and funded.</p>

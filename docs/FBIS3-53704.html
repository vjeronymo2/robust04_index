			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, assistant secretary  general of the Arab League for political affairs, has emphasized  that the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva has achieved a positive  shift in the Arabs' favor that must be consolidated in the next  round of talks in Washington.    He said that the 12th round [of Arab-Israeli talks] will be  a  final test of Israel's commitment to peace and of the United  States' ability to carry out its responsibilities and  commitments. This, he added, is directly linked not only to  security and stability in the Middle East but to the United  States' future relations with the countries in the region.    In statements made today on the outcome of the  al-Asad-Clinton summit, he said that Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad was able to rearrange the Arab-Israeli conflict and link  all the tracks in an attempt to achieve a comprehensive  solution, which U.S. President Clinton affirmed at the end of  the summit.    Peace, as viewed by the Syrian president, involves not only  the Syrian track but the Lebanese and Jordanian tracks and the  legitimate Palestinian rights. Thus, we can say that the issue  has regained its balance and comprehensiveness.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pernik, June 26 (BTA) -- Considering the conditions  and the way in which the census in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is being conducted, the  lack of normal conditions for the expression of ethnic identity,  the curtailment of freedom of speech and the expression of  personal views and critical statements, considering certain  facts of police coercion, and the open anti-Bulgarian campaign  waged by the government-controlled media, I cannot accept the  results of the census as objective and accurate, Nikolay  Slatinski MP, chairman of Parliament's National Security  Committee, told BTA.    He said he expressed his personal view. The official  government position is delayed, obscure and inadequate,  according to him. According to him, the policy pursued by the  Macedonian authorities, of putting obstacles to normal  good-neighbourly relations, could lead to a review of the  Bulgarian position, and a firmer Bulgarian stand on Macedonia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA estimated annual cancer incidence for baseline and the five control options using the EPA's Human Exposure Model (HEM), the site-specific cancer risk factors, and TSDF industry profile data bases. This risk value is based on the estimated number of excess cancers occurring in the nationwide population after a lifetime exposure (defined to be 70 years). For statistical convenience, the EPA divided the aggregate risk by 70 and expressed the risk as cancer incidence per year. The information provided in RCRA docket entry numbers F&hyph;92&hyph;CESA&hyph;S00014 and S00015 describes the estimation methodology in more detail. The EPA estimates baseline nationwide annual cancer incidence from exposure to TSDF organic emissions to be 48 cases per year. The estimated nationwide TSDF cancer incidences, assuming implementation of the individual control options, are two cases per year for Option A, two cases per year for Option B, four cases per year for Option C, five cases per year for Option D, and nine cases per year for Option E.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA uses the MIR parameter for relative comparisons of pollutants, emission sources, and control alternatives. For the impact analysis, the EPA estimated the MIR parameter assuming that exposure of the individual to the ambient air toxic concentrations occurs for 24 hours per day for a lifetime of 70 years. The EPA realizes that this is a conservative assumption since most people do not spend their entire lives at one location. However, it is completely possible for an individual to live in the same place for his or her entire life. Furthermore, other uncertainties in the analysis could lead to underestimating the risk. For example, the actual exposed subpopulations (such as children or asthmatics) may be more sensitive to the emitted air toxics than the reference adult male for which the unit risk factor extrapolations are based. In addition, the analysis does not address potential indirect exposure pathways to humans, or potential harm to environmental receptors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MIR parameter reflects the added probability that a person would contract cancer if exposed continuously over a 70-year period to the highest annual average ambient concentration of the air toxics emitted from a TSDF. Baseline MIR from exposure to TSDF organic emissions is estimated to be 3 &times; 102. The estimated MIR's, assuming implementation of the individual control options, are: 4 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Option A, 4 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Option B, 2 &times;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Option C, 3 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Option D, and 3 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Option E. These MIR values apply only to the very few TSDF, of the approximately 2,300 TSDF operating in the United States, that are estimated to have the potential to cause the highest risk. The values do not represent actuarially measured risks nor do they apply to all TSDF in the United States. The EPA is not attempting to estimate any specific individual's potential of developing cancer. Finally, the EPA is not interpreting any of these estimates as indicators of the absolute risks of contracting cancer. Rather, the purpose of this cancer risk assessment, both for incidence and MIR, is to compare relative differences among the individual control options (i.e., ``degree'' of human health protection).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

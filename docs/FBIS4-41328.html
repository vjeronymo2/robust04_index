			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The despatch of a  multi-national force under French command does not fully conform  to the "classic" criterion of U.N. peacemaking, but under the  conditions of continued tragedy there it is a necessary step for  stabilizing the humanitarian situation in that country, Grigoriy  Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department in the  Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing today.    "Russia had supported this U.N. Security Council resolution,  regarding that such a decision is an emergency, but a necessary  measure under the present circumstances. We proceeded from the  assumption that the unprecedented human tragedy in Rwanda, and  the continued massacre of the civilian population in that long-  suffering country dictates the need to take swift and adequate  measures capable of stopping the further bloodshed in Rwanda.  Besides this, we took into consideration the condition that  sufficiently long period of time will be required for a full  deployment of any additional U.N. force," Karasin said.</p>

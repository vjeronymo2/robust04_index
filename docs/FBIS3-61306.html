Until recently public opinion  in Russia considered that particular Republic of the former  Soviet Union a relatively safe one. Contributing to this was in  large part the image of Nursultan Nazarbayev, an intelligent and  farsighted politician pursuing a moderate course. Against the  backdrop of "ethnic cleansing" in the Baltic countries the  de-Russification policy, at first merely of a "precautionary"  nature (replacement of Russian city names, restrictions on the  activities of Russian Orthodox Church congregations, severe  curtailment of Russian-language education, etc.), seemed more  tolerant and well-balanced. The situation changed after the  Kazakhstani Ministry of Justice decided on 14 December 1993 to  ban and forbid registration of all Russian communities. At  virtually the same time criminal proceedings were begun against  one of the leaders of the Russian community movement,  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Boris Suprunyuk, who was  accused of "inciting interethnic strife." According to a report  received from the Congress of Russian Communities [Kongress  russkikh obshchin], what is happening is an intentional campaign  against the human rights movement. This could inflame the  situation in the Republic by prompting retaliatory acts by the  non-Kazakh population. This is particularly true of Kazakhstan's  northern oblasts, which historically have had a predominantly  Russian population. In this situation much will depend on the  position taken by Russia's leaders; it is clear that neither  side wants another Transdniester on its hands.</p>

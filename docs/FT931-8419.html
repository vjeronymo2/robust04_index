			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tax bills put at about Pounds 500 THE AVERAGE council tax bill in England is likely to be around Pounds 500, according to a survey published today by Local Government Chronicle. The average household bill from the 169 English councils which had set or recommended their council tax by Wednesday will be Pounds 494.58. The survey, carried out with BBC-TV News, covers the council tax for all but one of the 39 county councils, 118 of the 296 districts, seven of the 36 metropolitan councils and six of the 32 London boroughs. With most London and metropolitan councils still to declare their figures, the final average is likely to be marginally higher than Pounds 495. However, the final figure for the average council tax bill is likely to be less in real terms than under the poll tax. It will also be less in cash terms than the average household paid in the last year of domestic rates. The highest figure so far is that for Newcastle City council: their council tax figure will be Pounds 791.81 for a Band D property worth between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000. The figure is high because of the relatively low property values in the area and the high proportion of single-person households (43 per cent) entitled to a 25 per cent discount.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Intimacy in Festival Hall - Concert The BBC Symphony Orchestra's concert on Saturday night was given as part of the South Bank's Deutsche Romantik festival and under that rubric was remarkable for turning the Festival Hall into a recording studio for radio drama, notably Byron's Manfred as fitted out with music by Schumann. But the second half seemed to round off the BBC's own 'Reinventing the Orchestra' Berlioz series, comprising the romantisme of Berlioz's Harold in Italy symphony in which the superb soloist was the Japanese viola player Nobuko Imai. Two Romanticisms for the price of one, and that price the very economical BBC tenner giving free access to the hall's main floor. Thanks to this pricing policy, the BBC Symphony winter concerts are at last gaining sensible audiences, and in more than one meaning of the word, for those who turned up on Saturday were rewarded with very fine playing. The Manfred overture and incidental music Op. 115 (1848) is a late work of Schumann's seldom heard in its entirety, though the overture is familiar enough. Given that Byron did not intend his verse drama to be staged - it is typically Romantic theatre of the mind - and that Schumann's recension of it is not obviously designed for performance whether as accompanied play, dramatic cantata or opera manque, it is hard to see how Op. 115 can be properly presented at all, still less establish itself. For this performance Jeremy Sams arranged Schumann's reduction of Byron's text as a telling sequence of gobbets spoken by three actors (whom he directed) at the front of the platform, with the orchestra behind, the BBC Symphony Chorus behind the players, and to stage-left a quartet of vocal soloists representing the Four Spirits whom Manfred with his occult powers invokes. Philip Franks took the role of Manfred, the quasi-Faustian, proto-Nietzschean restless spiritual voyager, with a passion and aplomb  - the verse-line weighed with the most exacting care and given, where apt, a ringing vehemence that never once seemed hollow - which threatened to upstage the music. With his fellow actors David Firth and Maria Friedman, he created a vivid dramatic immediacy remarkable in so large a hall. Schumann wrote no more music for the play than would probably have been commissioned by a radio producer, but his score contains some delightful inventions. The overture holds a gentle air of mystery and foreboding and was skilfully balanced by conductor Andrew Davis, whose placing of the double basses at the rear opposite him had a subtly beneficial effect here and throughout the concert. The orchestral accompaniment to Manfred's speech hailing the Witch of the Alps has a quicksilver quality rare in Schumann, more common in Mendelssohn; while in the bleakly unwinding violin melody for the invocation of Astarte's ghost was a distinct if unlikely pre-echo of Shostakovich. After such an enterprising event the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra's Festival Hall concert under its colourfully gestural chief conductor Kazushi Ono the following night seemed a routine affair. Strauss's Don Juan and Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe second suite showed that this orchestra can do the big banging tutti with the best of them, and show off the feathery delicacy too; but the crucial middle range of textural and dynamic gradation was scamped. Prokofiev's second violin concerto got an unenlivening performance from soloist Raphael Oleg; and Masataka Matsuo's Phonosphere 1 for Kifu Mitsuhashi's shakuhachi (bamboo flute) and orchestra (1993) was a highly accomplished exercise in cultural synthesis that left me cold.</p>

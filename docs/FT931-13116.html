			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks lead the market down WEAKNESS in the US currency depressed dollar earning stocks in London yesterday, adding to the pressures on the stock market from domestic factors. Uncertainty over prospects for domestic interest rates continued, fuelled by weaker December money supply and bank lending data than expected. Also fears of impending rights issues hovered over the investment scene. The impact of a relatively optimistic report on business opinion in the UK from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) had no lasting effect on the market yesterday. Although the CBI said that significantly more members had expressed economic optimism than in the previous survey, taken four months ago, share prices soon abandoned a brief foray into positive territory yesterday morning. The FT-SE Index was 14 points down at the day's low but rallied when Wall Street, ignoring the dollar, opened the new trading session with a gain of 30 Dow points in London trading hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,771.9 for a net loss of 9.3. Trading volume was modest, at least among the blue chip stocks. But second line issues attracted increased attention, with turnover in non FT-SE listed stocks providing around 65 per cent of total Seaq volume of 490.3m shares. 'Investors see no rush to get aboard the FT-SE listed stocks at present,' commented Mr Michael Hicks, senior trader at Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm of Societe Generale. Adverse developments among the pharmaceuticals, added to dollar weakness, took a heavy toll of the blue chip sector, with Glaxo a notably dull feature in the wake of negative reviews in the UK press. Currency factors unsettled ICI, replacing an early gain with a small loss at the end of the day. The heavy end of the insurance sector lost ground. Hopes of acquisition or similar corporate developments continued to rise, although there were no developments yesterday to justify speculation. Shares in Johnson Matthey, the metals refiner, traded quietly as the market pondered the disclosure that Johannesburg Consolidated may bid for part of the Matthey stake on offer from Charter Consolidated, although it is not interested in making a full bid. Both the UK government bond and equity markets were inclined towards caution ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 8.5 per cent bonds. The auction is expected to proceed smoothly but is likely to turn attention back to the prospects for this year's heavy government funding programme. At Nikko, Mr Peter Thirne comments that while he remains convinced that the UK and US economies are recovering the FT-SE may continue to 'languish around 2,800' until there is clearer evidence of such recovery trends. For the end of March, however, Nikko sets a FT-SE target of 2,900. The market's impression that the next base rate cut will be held back until the March budget were expressed by Mr Peter Spencer at Kleinwort Benson Securities, who commented that the 'political fallout' from last week's depressing statistics on UK unemployment had been less than might have been expected. 'We could be in the doldrums for another couple of months,' suggested the Kleinwort report.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UN demand to Iraq over arms search THE United Nations Security Council yesterday demanded that Iraq immediately let UN inspectors search Baghdad's Agriculture Ministry for weapons information. It said Baghdad's attitude was a 'material and unacceptable breach by Iraq' of a Gulf war ceasefire resolution but did not say what it would do if Iraq did not comply. The confrontation began on Sunday when a weapons inspection team was unable to enter the ministry. Iraqi authorities said information kept there was beyond the scope of UN weapons inspections and not covered in Security Council resolutions.</p>

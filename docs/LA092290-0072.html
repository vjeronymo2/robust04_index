			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINLESS LONG BEACH PLAYS HOST TO PACIFIC  </P> <P> George Allen, still winless in his return as a college football coach, tries  again today at 1 p.m. when Cal State Long Beach plays University of the Pacific  in Veterans Stadium.  </P> <P> The Big West Conference game will be the home opener for the 49ers, who are 0-3  overall and 0-1 in the league.  </P> <P> Long Beach, which lost last week to San Diego State, 38-20, has committed 10  turnovers and given up an average of 41 points a game.  </P> <P> "I think each game we're getting better," Allen said. "We just have to  eliminate all these mistakes."  </P> <P> The 49er offense has relied on quarterback Todd Studer and wide receiver Mark  Seay. Of Studer's 35 successful passes, 14 have been caught by Seay for 199  yards.  </P> <P> Pacific (1-2, 0-1) also is pass-oriented. In a 28-14 loss last week to San Jose  State, the Tigers were thrown for minus-one yard rushing, but quarterback Kris  King passed for 282 yards. DICK WAGNER  </P></p>

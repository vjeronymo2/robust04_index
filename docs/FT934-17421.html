			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Recall for defective Lucozade bottles SMITHKLINE Beecham yester-day ordered the recall of 12m glass bottles of its Lucozade soft drink after discovering a defect which caused the neck on some of them to crack when opened. The company said it had learned of the problem from Rockware, the manufacturer, late on Monday. It said the problems affected 'only a very small number' of bottles. It has immediately stopped production and launched an investigation to identify how many bottles had reached the market. It has asked retailers to remove affected stock from their shelves and has set up a free telephone helpline - 0800-318-066. Production remained suspended while SmithKline Beecham and Rockware worked to correct the defect. SmithKline Beecham could not estimate the cost of the recall and loss of output, but said it would not have a material impact on its financial position. The recall covers 250ml and 300ml bottles containing original Lucozade and orange barley, lemon barley and tropical barley flavours. No other products in the Lucozade range were affected. Two years ago, 5m bottles of Lucozade were recalled after the Animal Liberation Front said it had contaminated some of them. The scare turned out to be a hoax.</p>

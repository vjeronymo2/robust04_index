			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in  Angola, and the troika of observers have just returned from  South Africa where they met with President Nelson Mandela. The  South African leader is willing to help resolve the Angolan  dispute by peaceful means.    Beye is about to leave for Luanda to meet President of the  Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos, probably this afternoon. Beye  will go to Huambo tomorrow to meet Jonas Savimbi, leader of the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    A UN Angola Verification Mission source told Radio Nacional  de Angola a while ago that for the time being there will be no  summit as was reported. There will be consultations, either in  Angola or South Africa.    Government and UNITA negotiators did not meet this morning.  They could meet this afternoon to begin discussing the  application of national reconciliation modalities. These  include the integration of Jonas Savimbi into Angola's political  life.</p>

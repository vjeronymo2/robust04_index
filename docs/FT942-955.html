			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel: All the fun of low fares - Richard Tomkins explains how to track down cheap US flights Pity the US airline industry. Hardly a day seems to pass without news of another US carrier slashing fares on short-haul domestic routes in an attempt to preserve market share from low-cost competitors. For most airlines, the prospect of a decent profit looks as far away as ever. But what is bad news for the industry is good news for the cost-conscious business traveller. Although air fares in the US may not have sunk to the depths they plumbed in the fare war of summer 1992, they still represent a bargain. How, though, to take advantage of them? Many must have heard about the inroads being made into the big US airlines' markets by upstart, low-fare carriers with names like Kiwi International, UltrAir or Republic Air, and wondered how to book with them. Cut-price fares in the US fall into two main categories. The seasonal promotions frequently offered by big carriers on selected routes are almost useless to business travellers, because they commonly require advance booking and Saturday night stay-overs, they are ineligible for exchanges or refunds, and the number of tickets is rationed. But on the routes where low-cost carriers are in operation, rock-bottom fares are a permanent fixture on all flights, and rarely carry any restrictions. Booking with these low-cost carriers should be easy. Unlike People Express, the low-cost US airline of the 1980s that tried to save money by cutting out the travel agents, nearly all today's low-cost carriers are on the travel agents' computer reservations systems. So theoretically, once inside the US, it is just a matter of finding the nearest agent and asking. Predictably, though, things are not always quite that simple. So here are a few tips: Travel agents work on commission, so obviously they earn less by selling you a cheap ticket than an expensive one. The American Society of Travel Agents bristles at suggestions that any of its members would be swayed by such considerations but, to be on the safe side, deal with a reputable agent and make it clear that you are looking for the lowest-cost option. The biggest low-cost carrier - Southwest Airlines, the one that started it all - is not on three of the four big computer reservation systems, so some travel agents may not automatically quote its rates. Ask whether Southwest flies the route you want and, if you run into difficulties, dial Southwest direct on 1-800-435-9792. Do not be too surprised if there is no low-cost option on your chosen route, particularly if you are flying in the east. The really low fares have still reached only about 20 per cent of domestic routes and most of these are in the south and west - though they have begun to spread in the east this year. If you know your itinerary in advance, check out the bargains to be had before you leave. American Express's air fare management unit in New York says packages available from some US airlines could end up much cheaper than getting a transatlantic flight on a big carrier and switching to low-cost airlines. It recommends you consult an experienced travel agent - like, er, American Express.</p>

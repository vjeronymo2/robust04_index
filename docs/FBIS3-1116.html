The police union also urged that no witch-hunt be  undertaken against any policemen for past deeds.    The TEC should also urgently investigate indemnity for those  policemen, who formed part of the covert structures of the past,  SAPU said.    SAPU said drastic measures such as the forced leave of  police  generals allegedly involved in gun running, uncovered by the  Goldstone Commission, was demoralising the police force.    SAPU said the possibility of policemen bill of rights should  be urgently investigation in consultation with the police union.</p>

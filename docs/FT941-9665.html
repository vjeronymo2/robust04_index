			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / International Press Review: Bosnia If the Bosnian Serb forces surrounding Sarajevo needed any back-stiffening as the Nato deadline to begin bombing them ticks away, their cousins in neighbouring Serbia appear to be happy to oblige. After all, no one is, yet, threatening to bomb Belgrade. Thus Politika, the largest circulation Belgrade daily, which is close to the Socialist party of President Slobodan Milosevic, said in a column called The 14th Threat: 'If we're counting correctly, this is the 14th threat to bomb the Serbs. It's hard to believe that any action will start, even if those responsible for taking such a decision can reach full agreement.' Someone in the hills around the Bosnian capital must have read this before deciding temporarily to stop Serbian guns being handed over to the UN peacekeepers at the weekend. 'Nato has imposed this rusty institution of an ultimatum, overtaking the UN and the clock has started ticking. What will happen after February 21?' asked the newspaper. 'Even the Nato planners have no vision of what they'll do after the first decisive step.' Borba, the independent Belgrade daily, scuffled around for more neutral territory, though it was careful not to alienate its more chauvinistic Serb readers. 'It is naive to imagine that Nato's military machine cannot be stopped. At the same time, it is unwise to think that this is merely a verbal explosion,' an editorial said. 'If belligerent nationalists react noisily, the risk of air strikes being implemented increases. 'We must praise the readiness of the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs to make conciliatory arrangements quickly towards lifting the siege of Sarajevo.' * * * Fortunately for Serb morale, the big French daily, Le Figaro, takes an age to get to Sarajevo. In Paris the Nato ultimatum has been greeted as ending months of mounting frustration for France's UN blue helmets at their powerlessness to stop the killing in Sarajevo, while reflecting satisfaction at the central French role in orchestrating the military and diplomatic moves. Le Figaro noted with evident pleasure that 'for the first time for a long time, it is France that has led the game. With President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Balladur on the same wavelength, the foreign minister (Mr Alain Juppe) was able to convince some, intimidate others, make alliances and above all make a united stand with the US.' But a writer on Liberation probably better reflected the cautious mood in the rest of the continent. Just why was it that the west suddenly changed tack after the mortar attack on the Sarajevo market? 'Why did we react to the TV images of this attack more than to others? Because they were better filmed? Bloodier? Because the presenter of ABC News was - at last] - in Sarajevo to present it live? Or was it for a more sordid and arithmetical reason? Because our stomachs could not swallow in one go 66 deaths and nearly 200 wounded, even if over the past two years they have had no trouble digesting nearly 10,000 victims in Sarajevo alone, but in smaller mouthfuls?' * * * Italian commentators have applauded Nato's resolve. But since Italy houses the principal bases from which air strikes will be mounted, they also worry that possible Serb reactions could include air raids and sabotage. Mr Indro Montanelli, the doyen of Italian journalists, warned in Corriera della Sera the new policy contained two dangers. 'One is that intervention occurs and leads to nothing, thus worsening the situation. Alternatively there is no intervention and this inaction plays into the hands of those who blame the west for being indifferent to the Bosnian tragedy.' Mr Montanelli came down firmly against military intervention since it would resolve none of the bitter ethnic problems that have torn apart ex-Yugoslavia. * * * For the German press, the events of the past week in Bosnia, Brussels and beyond raise more questions than answers. 'Can Nato bomb its way back to peace?' the left-wing Der Spiegel magazine was asking yesterday. 'The west hopes to be able to bring the Serbs back to political reason, without itself having any overall strategy for the new ethnic and political order in Bosnia. 'If this risky game doesn't have an effect after the first air attacks, then Europe will have to lift its arms embargo against the Moslems in order to enable at least a marginal improvement in the arms balance.' The other leading question was: who is most powerless in the entire sorry story, the western allies, the UN, Russia, or the German government? Unsurprisingly, Germany wins the prize from its own news media for the least effective role. 'Just as on the eve of the Gulf war, Bonn is simply hoping that nothing happens next week, and that the Serbs take the threats of the west earnestly,' said the conservative Die Welt on Saturday. Much of which makes the truculent scepticism at Politika in Belgrade sound quite reasonable. From Kerin Hope in Belgrade, David Buchan in Paris, Robert Graham in Rome and Quentin Peel in Bonn</p>

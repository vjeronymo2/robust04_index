			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ossetian-Ingush talks at the level of working  groups of the two republics' experts were renewed in Nalchik  (the capital of Kabardino Balkaria). Head of the Ossetian  negotiation, Georgiy Jikgayev, told Interfax that a draft treaty  on implementation of the Russian president's decree on return of  refugees and displaced persons to their homes on North Ossetian  and Ingush territory was being coordinated at the meeting of the  experts.    The document had been adopted in general at the first round  of the talks with the participation of Ossetian President  Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush President Ruslan Aushev in Nalchik  in early April. Jikgayev was certain that experts would manage  to work out a single draft document which the two presidents  would discuss at their summit in Nalchik on April 14.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: More boardroom upheaval at VW - The rise and fall of the Audi chairman Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, the soon-to-be-ex-chairman of Audi, had good reason to be grateful to Mr Ferdinand Piech. Less than two years ago, Mr Piech, the Volkswagen group chairman, plucked the 42-year-old from the obscurity of a Mercedes-Benz distribution centre in Bonn. Mr Kortum was to be Audi marketing director. Within eight months he was to take Mr Piech's then job at the helm of VW's quality car subsidiary, while his ambitious protector was to make the great leap forward to the top of Europe's biggest automotive group. However, Mr Kortum's gratitude did not extend to his adopting the role of trained lapdog. Even when he was offered the job of spokesman - a sort of first among equals on the Audi board - he held out for the higher ranking of chairman. In spite of this uneasy start, the inexperienced Bavarian started off by following his master's voice. Until last summer, he was still claiming Audi would break even in 1993 in spite of a DM198m (Dollars 116.4m) first-half loss. He was only echoing Mr Piech's own forecasts for the group. But by the end of the holidays, he realised a level result was out of sight. Internal business forecasts suggested car deliveries would fall during 1993 to 364,000 compared with 472,000 in Mr Piech's last year. In the event, the predictions proved spot on. Audi has recently reported a 24 per cent drop in sales for last year to 360,000, and a 30 per cent cut in production. Both figures are worse than at BMW and Mercedes. At the Frankfurt motor show last September, he omitted a reference to breaking even from the text of a speech previously vetted by VW group. Two months later, he was publicly blaming Mr Piech and the previous board for an expected but unspecified loss. Audi's distribution lacked punch, he said. 'This weakness is an important reason why Audi is in a worse position than others. Clear failings in the past have to be corrected,' he said. Audi's domestic rivals had a 20-year lead. Like others, Mr Kortum had fallen foul of the worst motor industry downturn in post-war history. But he had other burdens. As he was to discover, record volume sales for 1992 had been bolstered by an old trick. Audi France officials confirmed yesterday that 'several tens of thousands' of cars had been parked with French distributors, only to be shipped back to Germany last year. Since many of them lacked airbags and ABS braking systems  -regarded as essentials in the Germany quality car market - selling them was no easy task. Mr Kortum had to contend with Mr Piech's persistent demands that his brainchild, a revolutionary aluminium-bodied car, should be brought to market this spring. According to industry sources, manufacturing difficulties have forced delays. In the end, it was all too much for the mild young salesman. Like his colleagues at Seat in Spain, he had been instructed by headquarters to prepare a business plan which would yield a balanced result for the full year. But as he and Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat chairman, were to discover, the numbers would not bend sufficiently. Mr Diaz, recently accused of deception by Mr Piech, was fired last September after an 'unexpected' loss of DM1.25bn came to light. Now it is Mr Kortum's turn in the revolving door, raising once again the question: who's next?</p>

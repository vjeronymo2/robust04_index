			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON HIRES NEW FINANCE DIRECTOR  </P> <P> After months-long protests from the NAACP that blacks are not represented in  top administrative posts in Carson city government, City Administrator Jack  Smith has chosen a black woman, Lorraine A. Oten, as finance director.  </P> <P> Smith, who is white, said that Oten, 53, who is leaving a position as finance  director of Lynwood, "was selected solely on her experience and skills."  </P> <P> But he added that he was pleased that Oten would add balance to the  administrative team.  </P> <P> "It does something to appease a segment of our community who were crying out  for more representation," he said.  </P> <P> In Carson city government, four white males and an Asian male are the other  appointed department heads, and the deputy city administrator is an Asian male.  The elected city clerk is an Asian female, and the elected city treasurer is a  white female.  </P> <P> Smith said that in filling the position, the city personnel department  "intensified our efforts to recruit in all segments of society. In the last six  or seven months, we have made a very diligent effort to get the word out."  </P> <P> Oten, whose salary range is from $60,000 to $77,000, starts works Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: SE Banken cuts losses further THE recovery in the Swedish banking sector was underlined yesterday when Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank, announced sharply reduced losses for the first nine months. The bank's operating loss fell to SKr92m (Dollars 11.2m) from SKr3.75bn as it benefited from increased revenues, cost-cutting and reduced loan losses. The third-quarter profit of SKr206m built on the SKr310m second-quarter surplus, but was insufficient to reverse losses of SKr608m in the first three months. The healthier trend underscored the bank's decision to withdraw its request for state aid in August and rely instead on a SKr5.3bn rights issue to rebuild its capital base. Operating profits before credit losses rose 64 per cent to SKr7.63bn, showing successive improvements in every quarter. Lower interest rates positively influenced the performance, as did SKr560m in gains from bond sales. Costs were reduced by 2 per cent to SKr5.69bn, partly due to staff cuts. Credit losses at SKr7.72bn remained high, but they were down 8 per cent compared with last year. The bank said 44 per cent of write-offs related to the real estate sector, where collapsing values did more than anything to provoke the crisis in the Swedish financial sector. Net problem loans at September 30 were SKr21.5bn, down 17 per cent from the total at the end of last year. SE Banken also announced it had sold its remaining shares in Skandia, rounding off a saga that began in 1990 when it tried to forge a giant Scandinavian banking and insurance combine by buying a 28 per cent stake in the insurer.</p>

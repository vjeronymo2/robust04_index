			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP)--Chinese dissident Wang Dan  threatened Tuesday to go on hunger strike to protest the  constant police surveillance to which he has been subjected  since returning to Beijing at the weekend. In a telephone call  to AFP, the former 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement student  leader said he feared for his safety. "Two plain clothes police  accompany me wherever I go, walking alongside me and fixing me  with menacing looks," he said. Wang Dan, 24, said that four or  five other police in plain clothes and uniform are outside his  home day and night.    "Neighbours have complained about the situation and my  mother  has gone today (Tuesday) to the local police station to get this  persecution stopped. If the police are still there Wednesday at  9:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) I will start a hunger strike," said Wang,  who returned to Beijing after spending time in Shandong  province, east China, to avoid trouble with police during the  fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre.</p>

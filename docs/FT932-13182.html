			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: New approach is needed to art collecting Sir, I read Susan Moore's report, The hammer falls on Spink, with interest, (April 22). There are a number of comments I would like to make. The growth of interest in the fine and decorative arts over the past decades has been a global phenomenon. However, despite this, art finance has lagged behind. The art world's most precious commodity is confidence and that can only be sustained by making the fine and decorative arts more accessible and understood. Due to an emphasis on auction sales, distortions in some art markets have taken place with the bubble bursting, as Susan Moore suggests, at the end of the 1980s. This unsatisfactory state of affairs demands a new approach to art collecting for the 1990s and beyond. For it is only when the financial risk in the acquisition and disposal of fine art and antiques has been minimised that one can derive the maximum enjoyment from them. The answer is objective information and sound investment strategies with access to the latest financial instruments.

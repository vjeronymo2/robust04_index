			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / EC states agree telecoms reform: Liberalisation package brings another denial of two-speed Europe A MINIMUM of six EC countries, including the largest member states, agreed last night to open all domestic and international telephone calls to competition by January 1, 1998. But poorer and smaller countries have won between two and five more years to adapt to the liberalised system. EC telecoms ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, postponed discussion of European Commission plans to allow certain groups of users access to alternative networks for ordinary phone calls. Mr Arne Melchior, the Danish minister who chaired the meeting, said after the eight-hour discussion that the deal was not another example of a 'two-speed Europe' with richer member states, including Britain, France, and Germany forging ahead of their partners. 'We want everyone to be on board, but we are realistic enough to take account of the factual situation,' he said. Earlier, Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC's industry commissioner, warned member states that it would be against their own interests to postpone the Commission's proposed 1998 deadline for opening all telephone calls to full competition. The plan is supposed to reduce telephone charges across the Community, particularly for international and intra-EC calls. The Commission has yet to agree formal draft legislation to liberalise so-called 'voice telephony', so yesterday's meeting produced only a broadly worded resolution. Before July 1996 Brussels must come up with draft measures laying out the regulatory framework for liberalisation, and in the meantime it is to 'work closely' with the less developed countries to accelerate the modernisation of their telephone systems. At yesterday's meeting Luxembourg and Belgium asked to be classified as 'very small networks', which would not have to liberalise telephone services until the year 2000. Less developed networks - Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece - would benefit from an automatic postponement of the deadline until 2003 to allow them to modernise their infrastructure. The Commission said it was pleased with the outcome of yesterday's meeting, but it marks a step back from Brussels' original ambitious plans, which followed earlier liberalisation of the market for telecoms equipment and specialised services. Internal pressure had already forced Brussels to drop an earlier plan to liberalise cross-border telephone calls within the EC by 1996 before moving to full competition by 1998.</p>

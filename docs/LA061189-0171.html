			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;  </P> <P> SEGOTA'S TWO GOALS LEAD SAN DIEGO TO TITLE, 6-5  </P> <P> Branko Segota scored a pair of goals, and the San Diego Sockers held off a  last-quarter, four-goal rally to defeat the Baltimore Blast, 6-5, Saturday and  win their fifth Major Indoor Soccer League championship.  </P> <P> It was the fifth championship in six years in the MISL and the second in a row  for San Diego, which beat Baltimore, four games to three. San Diego has beaten  the Blast three times in championship series play -- in 1982, 1983 and 1989.  </P> <P> But the Blast put a scare into the Sockers, scoring four times in 7:27 of the  final quarter after replacing goalkeeper Scott Manning with sixth-attacker  David Byrne.  </P> <P> Domenic Mobilio led the Blast comeback, scoring three consecutive goals. Kai  Haaskivi started the rally with his third goal of the playoffs 3:05 into the  final period.  </P> <P> "We tried to cool down and settle down," said Socker midfielder Steve Zungul,  who earned his sixth MISL championship ring. "Even when they started scoring,  scoring, scoring, we didn't panic."  </P> <P> San Diego goalkeeper Victor Noguiera, who had 21 saves in the final, was named  the series' most valuable player. Socker midfielder Paul Dougherty was chosen  the series' unsung hero.  </P> <P> "You can't play against Zungul and Segota in a one-game series and expect to  win," Blast Coach Kenny Cooper said. "It's hard to get any offense against a  team that plays a zone defense."  </P> <P> San Diego, runner-up to the Blast in the regular season, broke open a 2-1 game  by scoring three times in the opening 2:33 of the third period.  </P> <P> Segota's second goal gave the Sockers a 3-1 lead 35 seconds into the third  quarter, and Brian Quinn and Zungul scored goals 35 seconds apart for a 5-1  advantage.  </P></p>

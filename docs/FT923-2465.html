			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Body Shop shares fall 40% on profit warning ANITA and Gordon Roddick, the founders of Body Shop International, yesterday saw the value of their personal shareholding fall by Pounds 56m as the natural cosmetic company's shares dropped 41 per cent following a profits warning. The company, which until now had been one of the few UK retailers to have defied the recession, said lower than expected UK sales since June would hit profits for the six months to end-August. Although international trading profits had increased substantially, Body Shop forecast that group pre-tax profits would fall to 'not less than Pounds 8m' compared with the Pounds 9.1m achieved the year before. The interim dividend would remain unchanged at 0.68p, the company said. The stock market reacted savagely whittling away the company's premium rating and marking Body Shop's shares down 108p to 158p. Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop's chairman, said: 'I think it is a huge over-reaction. If you look at our underlying business there is nothing strange. There is nothing odd going on with borrowings or capital expenditure or anything else.' Mr Roddick said UK profits had been affected by the continuing recession, a dispute with one of the company's franchisees which had led to the temporary closure of six profitable stores, and the expenses associated with the relocation of its Cos-Tec manufacturing subsidiary. But he added that the recession could well last longer than anyone had previously expected. City analysts suggested Body Shop's UK same-store sales had declined 3 per cent to 5 per cent during the past three months. One speculated 'some of Body Shop's unique appeal may also have been diluted recently by the bigger retailers becoming more environmentally-friendly and the fact that its products are not cheap'. Boots has had success with its own-label range of Natural Collection products and supermarket groups, such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, have also earmarked the personal care sector for growth. Mr Roddick dismissed such suggestions as 'absolute rubbish'. 'You only have to look at the customers in Boots to know that they are not the same as ours.' The company will release its interim figures in mid-October. Letters, Page 25; Market report, Page 48</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Business starts at 500 a day in 1980s NEARLY 500 businesses started up each working day during the 1980s, according to the most comprehensive study made on the role of small companies in the UK economy. Such rapid growth in net business starts - after allowing for failures  - took the total number of businesses to just under 3m at the end of 1989 from 1.8m at the end of 1979, a study published today in Employment Gazette, a Department of Employment magazine, shows. Nearly 97 per cent of UK businesses employed fewer than 20 people, and those buisnesses accounted for almost 35 per cent of total employment outside central and local government. Less than 0.1 per cent of businesses employed more than 500, although those companies accounted for just over 34 per cent of employment. The growing role of small business in the economy is reflected by the fact that in 1979 companies employing fewer than 20 people accounted for less than 27 per cent of total employment. The largest companies accounted for nearly 43 per cent of employment. The study is based on detailed statistics up to 1989, but the increased role of small businesses has been maintained since then, the magazine says. The number of businesses registering for value added tax rose by 1,000 a week during 1990, and business starts continued to outnumber failures last year. The overall numbers are dominated by the very smallest companies, employing only one or two people. But even if the one-person business, run only by the owner, is excluded, the general picture is little changed, the researchers said. The overall number of companies then drops below 1.5m but the proportion of those employing fewer than 20 people is still around 95 per cent. Although the latest studies are comprehensive, small businesses are still hampered by the large number of sources of data, each of which gives only a partial view of their role in the economy.

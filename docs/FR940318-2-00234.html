Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Introduction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The development and enforcement of adequate regulations governing the listing of securities on the Exchange is of critical importance to the investing public. Therefore, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 3 of its rules to revise its listing requirements for initial and continued listing of securities on the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange seeks to impose more stringent listing requirements by establishing mandatory minimum requirements. The Exchange believes that the employment of mandatory requirements, as opposed to mere guidelines, will serve as a mechanism to equitably screen issuers and to provide listed status only to bona fide companies ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  companies with sufficient financial resources to meet their financial obligations). Limited exceptions to the mandatory minimum requirements will be made only in cases, described more fully below, where a security is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') or NASDAQ National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS''). However, no exceptions will be made for any security listed under the Tier I designation under the Exchange's rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial Listing Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments proposed by the Exchange are substantial and comprehensive, as they impact not only common stock but also preferred stock, warrants, and debt instruments. In addition to reorganizing and defining specific terms within Rule 3.1, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  the Exchange is proposing to add Rule 3.2(a), which outlines definitive requirements to be considered in an application for listing. The Exchange will consider not only established numerical requirements, but also other qualitative factors, including the nature and scope of the company's operations, the financial condition and accounting practices, composition of assets, management experience, and the extent of competition and economic conditions within the particular industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange rules governing the listing of currency and index warrants have been incorporated into Rule 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Exports forecast to spark revival in German economy AN EXPORT-LED revival of the German economy next year was forecast yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the country's economics minister, in spite of the strength of the D-Mark in the European monetary system. Most economic indicators suggested the sharpest downturn in the German economy since the second world war had bottomed out and a gradual recovery was likely for the rest of the year, Mr Rexrodt said. He forecast growth of 1.5 per cent for west German gross domestic product in 1994, compared with a decline of the same amount this year. He warned that unemployment was likely to keep rising in Germany to 4m by the end of the year, with a further increase in 1994. Job creation schemes in east and west Germany came in for particular criticism as a positive incentive for employers to scrap genuine jobs. While expressing some concern about the revaluation of the German currency against other European Community currencies over the past year, he insisted that the problem should not be 'over-dramatised'. He calculated the effect of the currency turmoil in Europe of the past year as an effective revaluation of the D-Mark by 8 per cent against other EC currencies, and 11 per cent against all EC currencies and member states of the European Free Trade Association put together. At the same time, the revaluation meant cheaper imports, and the D-Mark had moved in the opposite direction against both the dollar and the yen  - by 13 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Mr Rexrodt said the recent upwards movement of the D-Mark in the currency markets was largely based on speculative money movements, and he discounted big changes in European exchange rate differentials over the longer term. His cautiously optimistic view was presented in a traditional summer assessment of German economic prospects by the Economics Ministry. He forecast an inflation rate, currently running at an annual 4.3 per cent in west Germany, decreasing to 4 per cent by the end of the year, and continuing to decline in 1994 - in spite of a sharp increase in oil taxation next year. 'The downward path of the economy has come to a halt,' he said, citing both reviving business confidence and the recovery of demand for German exports. He admitted that domestic industrial demand, particularly for investment goods, was still depressed. Mr Rexrodt predicted a much sharper recovery of 5 per cent in east Germany in the current year, accelerating to 6.5 per cent in 1994, but not a genuinely self-sustaining growth rate. Construction, the communications industry and vehicle manufacturing were all eastern growth sectors, although the manufacturing industry was still in severe difficulty.</p>

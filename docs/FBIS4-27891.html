			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk interspersed with music: "National Glory </F> and Korea's Dignity"]    [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In  our country at the moment, the work of the party, the state, and  the military is being well carried out, and the socialist  construction is being successfully implemented under the  leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il. [music] Mt. Paektu forests,  endlessly throb! The whole land of Korea, let us shout cheers!  Sun of guidance, shine in glory! Comrade Kim Chong-il held in  high esteem by people! [music]    This song is being sung by our people with heart, filled  with  endless dignity and joy! The song, which each of our people is  singing, overflowing with great dignity and joy of holding the  dear comrade leader in high esteem at the head of our party and  revolution [uridanggua hyongmyongui suwie nopi mosin], is  reverberating throughout rivers and mountains. [music]    The new era of history is advanced and brightened by the  great leader [yongdoja]. For a country, for a nation, there is  no other greater fortune than holding in high esteem such a  leader [yongdoja], (?at the head of the era), as the one who is  great in idea and philosophy, outstanding in the leadership  quality and capability, and sacred in personality.    Our people are holding in esteem the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the fate of the nation and the glory of the world, as  the great leader [yongdoja] of our era! We recall the bygone  days, unable to suppress the gushing forth of the boundless  national dignity and pride of holding two great leaders  [yongdoja], the most outstanding great men, in one generation.  [music]    One summer, the dear comrade leader took a walk for a while,  attending upon the great leader [suryongnim]. The Workers  Party of Korea [WPK] flag was vigorously flying at the roof of  the party Central Committee building with the twilight of the  setting sun. Our party flag has truly profound stories and a  sacred history.    The respected and beloved leader looked for a long time at  the party flag flying up high in the sky . With the tone of  deep emotion, he said: Time really flies. It is already nearly  40 years since we upheld the banner of the Korean revolution. He  recollected the unforgettable past when he pledged, in front of  the red banner of revolution, to fight with life for the  realization of the program for Down With Imperialism Union while  putting forth that program's proposal for building a socialist,  communist society in our country.    His retrospective remarks, which began with his  recollections  of the bygone days of the Korean revolution when he pulled up  the anchor along the sea route of independence in the beginning  of the 20th century, extended to today and the future.    The meaningful remarks were made by the respected and  beloved  leader who said: The way to the revolution is still long and  rough. The vast future requires great efforts. Reflected in the  remarks were his profound intentions and great expectations to  see his pledge, which he had made in the days of history, surely  materialized in this land.    This was really an emotion-evoking scene which was recorded  in the history of the Korean revolution.    One day after that day, the dear comrade leader met with  responsible functionaries of the party Central Committee. That  day, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave precious  teachings about well carrying out their work by well upholding  the great leader. He continued to say: The cause of the  revolution we are carrying out is the one that the leader  [suryongnim] had pioneered. Our revolutionary cause is the  rewarding one that had begun in Mt. Paektu. In other words,  that is our party's sacred cause for communist construction  which has recorded its first glorious trace in the history since  the program of Down With Imperialism Union was put forth.    This remark by the dear comrade leader which involves the  deep meaning of the beginning and future of our revolution was a  great declaration to bring a great golden age in the socialist  cause to this land by going across the past generations with his  extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom, excellent  leadership ability, and iron-like will and courage. [music]    The WPK has been firmly united and consolidated as one mind  under the slogan of modeling the whole party after the chuche  idea! The socialist system of our own style under which the  principle of independence in politics, self-reliance in the  economy, and self-defending in national defense has been  realized and all the people have become a large revolutionary  family! The revolutionary people who are firmly united with  loyalty and filial piety around their leader [yongdoja], while  regarding the chuche idea and socialism as their lives and  living! The matchless strong Army which has become an invincible  army under the banner of modeling the entire army after the  chuche idea!    From these excited events which lead us to be optimistic  about the future of mankind not only in the present century, but  also in the 21st century; from the amazing changes and  transformations which are being created; and in the noble  appearance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has  brilliant wisdom, matchless courage, tested leadership ability,  and extraordinary organizational ability our people and all of  mankind are witnessing the appearance of the great leader  [widaehan yongdoja] of the 21st century, a new era of history.    The 21st century will be more bright and prosperous in the  future! Our people are indeed the happy people who live and work  with high ideal and with a firm belief in the future, upholding  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the great leader.    The animated and dignified chuche socialist Korea which is  upholding as the great leader Comrade Kim Chong-chol who, taking  upon himself the bright future of Korea and the destiny of  socialism, is leading history to vigorously advance toward the  21st century along the route of independence!    Ogami Kenichi, director of the Secretariat of the  International Institute of the Chuche Idea, in his article  entitled "The Great Leader [widaehan yongdoja] Leading the 21st  Century," admired the dear comrade leader as follows: The world  will enter, under Secretary Kim Chong-il's guidance, a new era  in which the chuche idea is extensively embodied and brought  into full bloom. Without learning from Secretary Kim Chong-il it  is impossible to look ahead to the new era of mankind.    Yes, it is true. There is no people in this world who are  happier than our people who are struggling to consummate the  socialist cause, upholding Comrade Kim Chong-il as the great  leader. This is precisely our people's glory and Korea's pride.  This glory of our people and this pride of chuche Korea are  echoing rivers and mountains as a great song. [music]</p>

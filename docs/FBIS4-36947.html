			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri by Dino </F> Frescobaldi in Beirut; date not given: "Beirut: Prime Minister  Accuses Italy: `Ambassador Causing Us Trouble'"]    [Excerpt] Beirut -- [passage omitted] [Frescobaldi] What  happened to all the old militiamen who belonged to and were  obedient to the warlords?    [Al-Hariri] They have been integrated into the system. Their  leaders have handed over their weapons. Now there is a single  army of 50,000 men, partly volunteers and partly draftees,  within which the representatives of those armed groupings  account for no more than 10 percent, which is answerable to a  single defense minister and which is obedient to the Council of  Ministers and the national Parliament.    [Frescobaldi] What role do you think a new Lebanon can  perform in the region?    [Al-Hariri] First, a role as a catalyst in finance, trade,  and the promotion of light industry, which are its traditional  tasks. But also a role in stimulating culture and advancing  democracy on the basis of its own experiences. I can cite  evidence of this. In recent days we held the funerals of the  victims of the latest bombardments -- outright massacres. There  were tens of thousands of people there, but not a single shot  was fired. Everything went calmly. This means that people no  longer want anything more to do with trouble, and that they  respect the power of the state, the police, and the Army.    [Frescobaldi] In this situation a threat could nevertheless  stem from Islamic fundamentalism.    [Al-Hariri] I will answer you with a question: In a country  where tourism is so important to everyone -- as are finance,  culture, and openness to the world, for that matter -- in a  multi-confessional country comprising both Christians and  Muslims, what kind of role do you think the fundamentalists  could have? Merely a trouble-making role. The fact is that the  fundamentalists have no future in Lebanon, even if they may  receive help from here and there. The majority of Lebanese have  now converted to moderation.    [Frescobaldi] We must not forget that this is taking place  against the background of an overall peace process. How  optimistic are you in this regard?    [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you that the Arabs have decided to  make peace and are ready in this regard. Now it is up to Israel  to decide. It must decide what its role is to be in the region.  If the Israelis want to be dominators, it means that they will  have many problems. If, however, they want to be a country that  lives in peace with its neighbors, then I think peace is very  near. And with regard to the 12 percent of our territory that  is occupied, it must be returned to us to the very last inch.    [Frescobaldi] So can we talk in terms of a miracle in  connection with Lebanon?    [Al-Hariri] Why not? We are one of the few countries whose  currency is not only stable but is also growing stronger, albeit  not by much. Where investments are flowing in from all over the  Arab world, where the private sector is forging ahead. As for  the Europeans, they come here to work; to sign contracts; to  sell supplies, especially for construction; and to bring  know-how.    [Frescobaldi] What does Italy do?    [Al-Hariri] It too is taking part. It has concluded a good  contract in the electrical field. As for your ambassador, he is  causing us... [Al-Hariri ends]    [Frescobaldi] The interview ended here because al-Hariri  made  me switch off the tape recorder. But he made me understand that  the Lebanese Government would not be displeased if the  ambassador were to be replaced.</p>

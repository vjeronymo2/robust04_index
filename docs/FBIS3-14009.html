Akbar: "Histrionic About History"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This country now has to deal  with the United States' good intentions these days. There is a  new mantra wafting out from Washington. Get everyone onto a  table and talk, talk, talk. Or as they used to put it in old  fashioned Americanese, it is better to jaw than to war.    The big success story of this mantra of course is the west  Asia peace process, the entente between Israel and the Palestine  Liberation Organisation. If you can make a Jew and a Palestinian  talk, you can open up a dialogue between God and Lucifer without  problem.    Therefore the U.S. president, Mr. Bill Clinton, and his  Oxford friend and present U.S. assistant secretary of state for  south Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, have decided that the time has  come to make India and Pakistan talk to Kashmiris about Kashmir  and to each other about this and other topics.    If only this wide world, full of all sorts of different  characters, was so amenable to one plastic code. Sadly this is  not so. Kashmir and Palestine are not in the same place. You  cannot even will them to be the same. Palestine now remains in  the last, if most tortured, item on an agenda which has  gradually been edging towards a resolution after three major  wars and one momentous peace--though the latter was only between  Israel and Egypt. Any change in the status quo will  be the beginning of problems rather than the end of them.    If there is a comparison, and it is not a too steady one at  that, then it is with the former constituent republic of  Yugoslavia, Bosnia. When a hundred Bosnias erupt all across  India as Muslims pay the price for Mr. Clinton's theatrics,  where will Ms. Raphel's concern for human rights get us? The  problems of Kashmir cannot be separated from the events of 1947.  Even more so the problems cannot be separated from the  legitimacy of the rationale of the partition and all that went  with it.    If the United States puts its weight behind the idea that  Hindu and Muslim can never live together in the Indian  sub-continent then we are staring at a tragedy of gruesome  proportions. There is no force in the world large enough to  control an India blazing with communal hatred.    Perhaps this is why Ms. Raphel is also seeking to change  history when she suddenly begins to question the legality of  Kashmir's accession to India. Such a policy is madness. Good  intentions are a poor excuse for irresponsibility of this  magnitude. A little more reading of the facts, a touch of larger  vision, would certainly help Washington. Words these days mean  lives. We should take neither lightly.  *</p>

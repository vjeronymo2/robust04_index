			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [S.Z. attributed report: "`The Authorities are Resorting to </F> Violence'"]    [Text] Belgrade -- The Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS]  has warned the public that, in the period following the  elections, prominent members of the party are increasingly being  attacked.    According to a statement issued by the DSS Information  Service, the chairman of the Communal Council in Vrsac was  forced to defend his property himself after his business  premises had been broken into several times and the police had  failed to react. In Bujanovac, a DSS parliamentary candidate  was brutally attacked and injured by Goran Veljkovic, son of the  local strongman, Socialist Party of Serbia deputy Randjel  Veljkovic, while in Surdulica -- claims the statement -- the  local authorities have selectively and illegally seized the  business premises belonging to the wife of the DSS Communal  Council chairman in this town.    All these cases show -- the statement concludes -- that the  authorities, instead of solving the vital problems that they  have caused, are increasingly resorting to violence.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No case for holding up Nato expansion (2) Edward Mortimer is quite right about Nato ('How to widen the circle', January 5). The US-inspired 'partnership for peace' is indeed a fudge - and I believe a dangerous one. Nato should certainly expand eastwards, starting now with a firm timetable. There is no danger of 'isolating' Russia in this process. How one isolates a continent-sized entity like the Russian Federation is anyway not clear. What is very clear, on the other band, is that the underpinning of European security and the embracing of Poland and other east/central European states in an enlarged Nato cannot possibly wait for the ponderous and uncertain timescale of Russian reform. To follow that path would be not just to cast away a crucial opportunity for helping the new democracies through to stability within the Europe of which they are unquestionably a key part (the three small Baltic states should also be included). It would also play right into the hands of Russian extremists, who are already delighted to see the ambiguous signals issuing from the west. The people in Washington (and London) who argue the other way are doing a disservice both to Russian democratic prospects and to Europe's future consolidation and security. I do hope that Britain, with its history of support and understanding for the needs and hopes of the nations of east and central Europe, large and small, will help correct the apparently rather deep American misunderstanding of the position.

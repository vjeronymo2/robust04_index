			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Leading Article: French jam tomorrow IT IS convenient for a new government to blame unpopular decisions on its predecessor. It is not surprising, therefore, that the new centre-right government headed by Mr Edouard Balladur should have blamed fiscal austerity on the Socialists. The tragic suicide of his predecessor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, will make this approach seem more bitterly partisan even than usual. The main question, however, is whether the scale and the timing of the proposed action is warranted. For 1993, claimed Mr Balladur yesterday, the total fiscal deficit would, if unchecked, be FFr410bn or 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product. His government's intention is to limit the deficit to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP this year and bring it down to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP, within the Maastricht fiscal criteria, by 1997. The government's 'medium-term financial strategy' rests on tight control of public spending, which is to grow less fast than inflation in nominal terms. Meanwhile, reductions in the deficit this year will depend partly on tight control of spending, including limits on increases in public salaries, and also on an increase in the 'general social contribution', a surcharge on income tax, from 1.1 to 2.4 per cent of incomes. Growing deficit Mr Balladur made much of the unsustainable fiscal position he inherited. The deficit has tripled in three years, he pointed out. Meanwhile, public debt has risen 40 per cent since 1988, when he left office as finance minister, to reach a third of gross national product. In the absence of decisive action, he argued, France risks losing all margin of manoeuvre. Judged by current British fiscal standards, let alone those of the Italians, Mr Balladur protests too much. Nevertheless, recent data from the IMF show that the French general government financial deficit is only below those of Italy, the UK and (marginally) Canada among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The IMF also suggests that the deterioration in the French structural fiscal deficit will be 2.1 per cent of GDP between 1991 and 1993, only fractionally less than the estimated cyclical deterioration of 2.2 per cent over these years. France shows, in more modest form, the same development as the UK: a large fiscal deterioration in reaction to an exceptionally tight monetary policy. The difference between France and the UK is that the former has only limited control over monetary policy. The soon-to-be-independent Banque de France has managed to reduce its important interest rates five times since the new government took power, as the credibility of the parity has grown. Short-term interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the D-Mark have more or less disappeared, while the differential on long-term bonds is less than half a percentage point. Question of timing These reductions in interest rates are as much as can be expected from improved credibility. From now on lower interest rates will depend on reductions in German interest rates, which will be slow at the short end and may be slower still at the longer end. But this means that French long-term real interest rates may remain at around 5 per cent for an extended period, while short-term ones may fall only slowly from their current levels of around 5 1/2 per cent. It is little wonder then that the French economy is expected to shrink, in the government's view, by 0.4 per cent this year. The government's fiscal programme has to be judged against this bleak background. It is not whether action needs to be taken at some point, but its timing that needs to be questioned. Should the budget proposals allow the French government to lower still further, or even reverse the interest rate premiums against Germany, then they would be well timed. But should they merely tighten the fiscal grip, while the monetary one remains as severe as it is now, their economic wisdom would have to be questioned. Politics is almost always more important than economics. For the government, it may be better to impose ill-timed measures it can blame on its predecessor than well-timed ones which would be blamed on itself. For the French public, therefore, it is rigueur today - and more rigueur tomorrow.</p>

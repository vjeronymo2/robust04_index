			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Teng Mei-ling (6772 5019 3781) from Beijing: </F> "Zheng Hongye Criticizes the United States for Making a Mountain  Out of a Molehill"]    [Text] Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade, criticized the United States  yesterday for having "made a mountain out of a molehill" on the  issue of Chinese textile import. Although Zheng expressed the  hope that the Sino-U.S. talks in two days time would be a  complete success, he stressed that the mainland has a very big  trading market. Anyway, "if not in the east, then in the west,"  he said.    When answering reporters' questions at a closed-door meeting  of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  [ARATS] in Beijing yesterday, Zheng Hongye said: U.S. trade  makes up only a small portion of the mainland's total foreign  trade volume and is "not worth mentioning."    He stressed that there are different views and opinions  between China and the United States and the two sides have held  several talks on the textiles issue. He believed, provided both  sides observe the principle of "equality and mutual benefit,"  the problem will not be hard to resolve. However, if one keeps  only itself in mind, it will be very hard to resolve the issue.    He refuted the U.S. criticism that the mainland is not  opening its market, saying that the it has never closed its  doors to the U.S. market. What actually happened is that the  mainland wanted to import some commodities from the United  States, the latter refused to offer. But he did not clearly  point out what the commodities were.    On the forthcoming Sino-U.S. meeting on the textiles issue,  which will be held from 15 to 17 January, Zheng Hongye stressed  that he was confident that substantive results would be achieved.    He also said, if the United States insisted on imposing  economic sanctions on the mainland, the development of bilateral  trade would be harmed. Anyway, he said, if the United States  really imposes economic sanctions, the mainland still has many  trade markets outside, "if not in the east, then in the west."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 15 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Jose Angel Talavera,  alias "Chacal," the leader of the 3-80 Northern Front  "recontras," and more than 300 rebels in his group, surrendered  their rifles to the Nicaraguan Government today, thus concluding  the disarmament process of the anti-Sandinist rebels.    During the disarmament ceremony, which was held at the  Quilali community that borders Honduras, Esteli Bishop Abelardo  Matta invoked God and thanked Him for the rebels' decision to  give up their weapons "for the sake of peace" in this part of  the country.    The weapons surrendered by the "recontras," approximately  150, included Soviet-manufactured AK rifles, pistols, several  surface-to- air missiles, and other military materiel, were  destroyed at the location of the demobilization ceremony.    The disarmament process of "Chacal's" men started on 2 March  and continued on 25 March. On those dates, approximately 300  "recontras" gave up their rifles and entered civilian life.  Almost 100 demobilized rebels entered a police academy in  Managua, where they will receive training in the fields of  security and public order so they may, in the coming months,  join police units in northern Nicaraguan municipalities.    A military source in Quilali, reached by telephone, told  ACAN-EFE that chieftain "Chacal" surrendered his rifle and  ratified his commitment to work "from the civilian field" to  improve the living conditions of the now-demobilized "recontras."    The disarmament ceremony was attended by Government Minister  Alfredo Mendieta for the government; Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo  Wheelock for the Army; Bishop Abelardo Matta, who is the  International Commission of Support and Verification  coordinator; Argentine Sergio Caramagna; and human rights  organization representatives.    The government and the rebels agree that now that the last  phase of the 3-80 Northern Front's disarmament process has  concluded, northern Nicaragua will initiate "a new phase of  peace" and leave behind a war that left thousands of soldiers,  civilians, and rearmed rebels dead or injured.    "Hopefully God wants this (the peace process) to advance so  that we can find tranquility," Bishop Matta exclaimed. Matta is  one of the representatives of the Catholic Church in the area  who contributed to the signing of the peace agreement between  the government and the rebels. The Catholic bishop, who  expressed his satisfaction with the government's decision to  create the necessary conditions "that would result in the  successful" disarmament of the rebels, called on the country's  authorities to promote true socioeconomic programs to avoid a  new rearmament process.    The rearming of the rebels started in Nicaragua in 1990, a  short time after Violeta Chamorro assumed office as president,  when several thousand of the 22,000 former "contras" who had  demobilized initially, rebelled because they considered that the  government had not kept the promises it made to them to get them  to reenter civilian life.</p>

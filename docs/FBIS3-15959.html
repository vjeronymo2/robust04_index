			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in  Russian at 0232 GMT on 10 March carries a report by ITAR-TASS  correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Vitaliy Chukseyev on a news  conference held in Washington on 9 March by State Duma Chairman  Ivan Rybkin regarding the results of his visit to the United  States. Rybkin says he and his delegation of Russian parliament  members had meetings with House Speaker Foley; Senators  Mitchell, Dole, Pell, and Nunn; Defense Secretary Perry; Strobe  Talbott; and "others." The final meeting was with President  Clinton and Vice President Gore.    Rybkin says that "breaks in contacts between the legislators  of such large countries as the United States and Russia" are  "inadmissible" and that the Washington visit "has shown that  Russian and U.S. members of parliament alike shared this  conviction."    Replying to ITAR-TASS, Ivan Rybkin says he told the U.S.  President and vice president and U.S. congressmen that a  "qualitatively new situation was taking shape in Russia:  Millions of property owners had appeared, some owning fortunes  running into thousands of millions, others medium-size business  people, and yet others owning small plots of land. That is why  any rolling back of reforms and turning back is completely out  of the question."    He says that currently he sees the Duma "as the most  reform-minded branch of power in Russia." "Its members are made  up by three quarters of the former government; many came to it  from the presidential structures and occupy key posts in the  parliament. If you look at the factions, many of them changed  their names, but among their members are bankers and commerce  people, legal experts and farmers, and that is why, when we come  to adopt the most important laws that will clear the obstacles  on the path of reforms, things will be much easier for us than  for the former Supreme Soviet. However, there must be an  awareness that without civic consensus, without cooperation  between authorities, we cannot move an inch further. Those who  failed to understand it are now beginning to understand. Even  here, reading TASS reports, I see how the positions of those  who, for example, were opposed to the adoption of the memorandum  on accord, are beginning to change."    Rybkin speaks at the news conference about the importance of  cooperation between executive, legislative, and judicial  authorities in Russia and America, and says the  intergovernmental commission chaired by Gore and Chernomyrdin  would hold an exceptionally important meeting soon.    During the news conference Rybkin is asked how he views  speeches by certain members of the Duma who paint a catastrophic  picture of life in Russia while on foreign trips. He says  everybody is, of course, entitled to their point of view.  However, he says, I have always called for restraint and said  that the personal views of deputies should bear some relation to  what the people who elected them are thinking. Maybe they  should visit their constituencies more often and go on fewer  foreign trips. Then everything would fall into its rightful  place, he says.    Rybkin is asked to comment on reports that the elections in  Kazakhstan were marred by contraventions of the electoral rules  and that this could give rise to serious problems. He says  problems are cropping up along the entire length of our  frontier, in areas where tens of millions of our fellow  countrymen are living. However, he says, such problems should  be resolved in a civilized way. If anyone tries to infringe  people's rights, he will soon discover how much this will cost.  Just look at those countries which tried to expel our fellow  countrymen, he says. All their hi-tech industries have ground  to a halt, and now they are turning to us once more for help.  The rights of people living in various territories must be  respected, irrespective of nationality, and these people must be  represented on bodies of power in proportion to their numbers,  he says.    During the news conference, members of the delegation  representing different factions expressed totally opposite views  on the recent political amnesty for those involved in events of  1991 and 1993. In response to an ITAR-TASS correspondent  question on whether the Russian delegation was united in its  position at the talks with their U.S. counterparts or  demonstrated similar differences of opinion, Rybkin says that  whatever differences there are, if any, they are only over minor  nuances. "On the principal issues in our life we were  unanimous," he says. He concludes: "Our talks were precisely  about the principal issues, the principles of Russia's relations  with the United States. These principles have not changed.  Their permanent feature is partnership and cooperation for the  sake of peace and accord in the world, for the sake of the  difficult reforms in Russia. We have agreed on many issues,  worked out programs for cooperation and decided that mutual  exchange of information should be full and frank so that there  will be no rough patches in our relations, which usually appear  when information is not complete."</p>

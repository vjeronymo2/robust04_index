However,  after weathering storms over the past year or so, many peasants  have experienced various dilemmas caused by not knowing what  course to take.    One of them is: Who will manage agriculture after the  peasants head for the market? Since the beginning of last year,  the whole society has been publicizing leading agriculture to  the market and letting the peasants grow whatever brings them  money. However, being accustomed to doing production work  according to plans worked out by the higher-level authorities  over the years, the peasants have found it difficult to adapt  themselves to the new situation overnight. It sounds good to  grow whatever brings them money, but they do not know what to do  when they actually try. Growing grain alone will not bring them  much money, but if everyone rushes headlong into growing cash  crops, they certainly will not make any money either. It makes  one's heart ache to think of the fall in the price of apples in  Gansu, hot peppers in Shaanxi, and water melons, garlic, and so  on in the provinces of the central plain. Red beans, white  beans, black beans, and broad beans sold well last year, but who  can be sure that they will also sell well this year? It is also  difficult for just one or two households to grow special cash  crops. Where can they buy the seeds or learn the relevant  techniques? Where should they sell their products? At present,  most peasants can only grow enough grain to ensure they have  enough to eat and resign the rest to fate.    The market economy is an economy characterized by economic  results. It really is a tough job for peasants, who are simple  and unsophisticated, universally badly educated, and not  economically minded, to grope for information, carry out market  analysis on their own, and forecast what crops they should grow  to make money.    Another dilemma is: How can one wade across a river without  finding stepping stones? Since the peasants cannot clarify the  market situation, they are compelled to act blindly. However,  as we all know, agriculture is quite different from other  sectors. The most distinct characteristic of agriculture is  that its production cycle is long and its risk index is high.  The risks are mainly expressed in five aspects. The first is  the risk of natural disasters. At present, peasants in the  overwhelming majority of localities depend as much on human  efforts as on the climate. The second is the risk of pests.  Many insects' resistance to pesticides has increased, and if  dosages are not increased or if any mistakes are made in using  the pesticides, it is possible that nothing will be reaped. The  third is market risk. The market is like a battlefield in which  commodity prices are ever-changing. Moreover, cycles of  production of agricultural and sideline products are long. At  sowing time, prices may be good, but the prices may change by  harvest time. The fourth is the risk caused by inferior and  fake means of production in agriculture. At present, fake  chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds have done serious  harm to the peasants, and the peasants can do nothing about  them. The fifth is that inputs to agriculture have decreased  markedly. Peasants' hidden burdens remain at a high level. All  this has inevitably caused a sense of misery and hopelessness of  "finding no stepping stones to cross the river" among more and  more peasants who have just become involved in the market  economy.    The third dilemma is: High output does not necessarily lead  to high income. In recent years, peasants' incomes have  increased slowly mainly because the relative interests of  agriculture are indeed too low. High output may not necessarily  lead to higher income, and higher output can even result in  greater losses. Although in recent years, prices of agricultural  and sideline products have risen a little, the extent of price  rises for the agricultural means of production far exceed those  for agricultural and sideline products. According to  statistics, since the beginning of last year, price rises for  various agricultural and sideline products have been less than  12 percent, but for pesticides, plastic sheeting, chemical  fertilizers, farm machinery, and so on, the rises are over 20  percent, and for diesel oil, kerosene, gasoline, and so on, over  80 percent. The prices of some agricultural means of production  have even soared or doubled, and this is really dreadful.  However, peasants cannot do without them. Relatively speaking,  prices of agricultural and sideline products have apparently  been on the low side and the scissors difference between the  prices of industrial and agricultural products is increasing day  by day. Since peasants' real incomes are not increasing, their  enthusiasm about farming cannot be aroused. This has compelled  able-bodied laborers to earn money in other localities and  farmland being laid waste is unavoidable. No wonder peasants  have cried out: Where is the way out for peasants? Where is  the way out for agriculture?    The answer is naturally to further deepen reform. How should  grain production be protected as agriculture moves toward the  market, especially after restrictions on grain prices have been  removed? Is it to develop "high output, high efficiency, and  high quality" agriculture and earnestly increase peasants'  incomes? Although this has already attracted great attention  from the CPC Central Committee and governments at all levels, it  is even more necessary at this time for the whole society to  show common concern, give support, and carry out studies and  explorations.</p>

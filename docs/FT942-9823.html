			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Saloons set for showdown - The choices facing GrandMet's pubs joint venture Among the customary blizzard of detail accompanying Grand Metropolitan's interim results yesterday, there was one notable omission. The market had half hoped for news on how GrandMet aimed to tackle one of the most troublesome parts of its business: Inntrepreneur Estates Limited, its pub joint venture with Courage. Instead, the official statement contained just one line: 'IEL reached break-even for the half year, in line with expectations.' Given that IEL is by far the UK's biggest publican, with 6,500 pubs valued at Pounds 1.7bn, this might seem a pathetic result. Quite the contrary, according to Mr David Tagg, the GrandMet director in charge of IEL. Everything is going to plan. When it was formed in 1991, IEL was deliberately loaded with debt by its two owners. It has lost money ever since. 'When we set it up,' Mr Tagg said yesterday, 'we said we would break even in 1994-95. We've done that. We also said we would consider with Courage what to do when we got there. We're doing that now.' Mr Tagg would not be drawn on various market rumours, such as a planned management buy-out or the flotation of a couple of thousand pubs as a wholly new company. 'There are a range of options,' he said. 'We can go anywhere from retaining the whole business to getting out. Refinancing is an option somewhere in the middle.' And how long will the decision take? 'That's very hard to say. Not weeks: it might be months - maybe years' (probably within the year, according to his boss, GrandMet chief executive George Bull). There is no doubt that GrandMet wants out: or, as Mr Tagg put it diplomatically, 'IEL does not fit GrandMet's strategic profile.' The snag is that Courage presumably wants out as well. Its parent, the Australian brewer Foster's, is not flush with cash, and has recently made clear that its ambitions lie not in Europe, but in the nearer and faster-growing markets of Asia Pacific. A further snag is that the two partners suffer from an inherent conflict of interest. As a pure pub operator, GrandMet will naturally aim to push its rents as high as possible. This puts pressure on the individual publican to raise beer prices, thus reducing sales. This is bad news for Courage, which supplies beer to more than 4,000 of the pubs. The contract for that supply lasts until the end of March 1998. Presumably, Courage would like to extract itself from the venture in a way which left the contract in place. This, says Mr Tagg, is not impossible. 'All these issues are in the melting pot. It's all for discussion.' Besides making no money, IEL has an image problem. According to its rivals, the estate is in poor shape, with a long tail of small and grotty pubs. Mr Tagg disputes this. 'We've disposed of almost 1,000 pubs since we started the joint venture, largely at the tail end,' he said yesterday. 'The estate is now in pretty good shape. I would say there isn't much of a tail compared with the other major estates.' The whole saga illustrates the continuing effect of the changes imposed by the government on the beer industry in 1989. Five years on, the industry is less stable than ever. As long as IEL's 6,500 pubs overhang the market, it is hard to see that changing.</p>

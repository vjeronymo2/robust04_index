Winkel report on interview with Carlos </F> Westendorp, Spanish secretary of state for european affairs, in  Brussels; date not given: "Spain Is Not Rejecting EC  Enlargement Altogether"]    [Text] Brussels -- By enlarging the European Community to  include the three Scandinavian countries and the alpine Republic  of Austria, the political focus of the Community will be shifted  to the north. For Spain, which managed to wrest itself out of  lengthy political and geographical isolation on the basis of its  EC membership, this is not an attractive prospect.  Consequently, Spain certainly wants to be seen as the driving  force behind a discreet front comprising EC member states that  are endeavoring to slow down the accession of new member states  by making their entry to the Community subject to the  fulfillment of absurdly harsh preconditions.    Nothing could be further from the truth, contends Carlos  Westendorp, Spanish secretary of state for european affairs --  every inch a Spaniard despite his Netherlands grandfather -- in  the third of a series of interviews on Europe and the  enlargement of the Community. "The EC is becoming a community  of blond, blue-eyed people. All along we have resigned  ourselves to this. If we still want to remain part of it, then  we shall have to bleach our hair and start wearing blue contact  lenses. And above all quit our bad economic habits."    "We are a satisfied power," says Westendorp, with a broad  grin, when asked about the manna that will fall over Spain from  heaven if the rich Scandinavian countries become member states  of the EC. Unlike Spain and Portugal, which joined the Community  in 1986, the new member states will consolidate the core of  so-called net paying member states in the EC. However, their  contribution will not be at all sufficient -- merely somewhere  in the region of ECU1 or ECU2 billion, according to Westendorp.    The real negotiations on contributions to the Community  budget, on the one hand, and receipts in the form of  agricultural and regional subsidies, on the other, have not yet  begun. In the Council of Ministers, Westendorp is playing a  ruthless game, as diplomats and politicians from member states  which are more inclined to embrace enlargement assure us.  Enlargement? OK, but not over Spain's dead body. If some  Arctic regions are fighting to overcome their own structural  problems, then their struggle should be financed out of other  people's pockets.    As Westendorp puts it: "We are playing an honest game. In  order to qualify as a less well-developed region, per capita GDP  must be less than 75 percent of the EC-wide average. In the  province of Teruel that is indeed the case, but unfortunately  the average for the region as a whole is 80 percent, so we  receive no EC support. We are merely asking that the same  criteria be applied in the far north." According to the Spanish  negotiator, the problems concerning the financing of agriculture  and regional policy are insoluble. He has more doubts where  fish are concerned. Spanish fishermen have an eye on certain  rich Norwegian fishing grounds that they had to leave in the  1970's, but the Norwegians have so far failed to budge one  centimeter. "We are asking for 7,000 tonnes of cod. If the  Norwegians continue to insist that they cannot part with even  one fish, then we will run up against serious problems."    The institutional reservations that Westendorp has attached  to the result of the negotiations on behalf of his government  seem much graver still. The Spanish Government does not want  the new member states to be counted when the member states look  in 1996 to see whether a majority of EC countries is in  sufficiently good economic condition to proceed with the third  phase of Economic and Monetary Union [EMU].    A second hiccup concerns decisionmaking within the Council  of  Ministers. At present, 23 votes are required in order to block  a decision. Between them, either two large and one small member  state, or one large and three small member states, or even five  small member states can come up with this number of votes.  Spain is recommending that the blocking majority be raised to  27 votes if a number of small countries joins together, but  wants to stick to 23 if this number of votes is attained by a  combination of only three countries. In practice, this  constitutes an elegant way of boosting the relative clout of the  larger member states within the Council of Ministers.    Westendorp explains: "The 23 votes usually represent  something like 115 million people. You cannot make decisions  that go against the wishes of one-third of the EC's population.  The lower number of inhabitants in the candidate member states  would mean that in some cases the 27 votes would represent the  wishes of no more than 40 million citizens of Europe."    In its attempts to gain acceptance for such an approach,  Spain proposed -- in vain -- that the influence of the  Netherlands within the Council of Ministers be increased,  reveals Westendorp. "With 15 million inhabitants, the  Netherlands is not getting its dues with just five votes. It is  a question of democratic legitimacy; we are all equal, but some  are more equal than others."    For Spain, this constitutes one potential reason to take a  rain check on the accession of the candidate member states, and  the fisheries problem constitutes another. However, Westendorp  let it be known that the situation is different regarding the  demand that the new member states be excluded from the decision  on whether or not to proceed with EMU in 1997. "We have tabled  that proposition, and expect a certain degree of understanding  from our partners. However, it is not some kind of breaking  point."    However, Spain is by no means ruling out the possibility of  the hard core (France, Germany, and the Benelux countries -- HET  FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) -- possibly with the addition  of Denmark and Ireland -- daring to take the step toward a  single currency in 1997, after all. Under the terms of the  Treaty of Maastricht, a majority of the member states must  fulfill the criteria regarding inflation, budgetary deficits,  and exchange rate stability. And that is where the shoe  pinches. The new member states will above all push down the  average rate of inflation, thereby increasing the gap for  existing member states like Italy and Spain, which will most  certainly not succeed in coming up to the new mark. "We, too,  want to make the leap in 1997," says Westendorp: "We are also  capable of doing so." Westendorp continues by saying that there  was no mention of the role of the new member states when the  criteria for Maastricht were laid down.    Westendorp is pessimistic regarding the possibility of, say,  seeing the approval of the treaties of accession go hand in hand  with that of modifications to the Maastricht Treaty, a course  which the European Parliament (including future member Piet  Dankert, who is currently still a secretary of state in The  Hague -- HET FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) now appears to  be steering. "We have always been in favor of giving the  European Parliament more extensive rights, but I think that many  member states have no sympathy for this idea at present." For  his taste, even the agreement to meet again at government level  in 1996 in order to review the treaty is too much to ask. "That  date is too close, unless the economy makes a spectacular  recovery, and the whole climate in Europe changes."    Westendorp still has an unpleasant aftertaste following the  difficulties surrounding ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  "We will only make progress if we turn the thing around. There  should be no more negotiations between technocrats, followed by  the submission of proposals to the European Council in fearful  trepidation of referenda in certain member states. We must go  straight to drawing up a European constitution, and then put it  to the European Parliament and the national Parliaments."    If no constitutional foundation is laid, says Westendorp,  then within a few years the EC could become unmanageable. "We  cannot stop enlargement at Malta and Cyprus; we must also admit  the new democracies in Central and East Europe. That will be  unworkable if no far-reaching reforms are implemented."    He sees a hard core emerging, which will make further  progress on defense, foreign policy, and the fight against  crime. Cooperation in these areas, formally included within the  scope of the European Union, must then be integrated into the EC  proper. Outside this core of states, there will then arise a  number of countries in favor of a looser form of primarily  economic cooperation. British (and German -- HET FINANCIEELE  DAGBLAD editor's note) involvement in EMU will constitute a test  case.    Westendorp claims that the Greek-Netherlands desire to  entrust these institutional questions to a committee of wise men  is not acceptable to everybody. "Nobody is wiser than the  governments. We should set a group of intelligent government  representatives to work with a view to preparing the 1996  conference. Complemented by one representative from the  European Parliament, and one or two independent experts, this  would strongly resemble the Delors Committee which set the EMU  ball rolling back in 1988."    There is one thing with which this group should not meddle  at  all, says Westendorp. Spain is no longer ready to contemplate  making do with just one member in the European Commission.  "Having 17 commissioners means that, together, the five larger  countries have 10 votes, i.e., a majority. If there were 20  commissioners this would no longer be the case. We certainly  cannot put up with this any longer. In addition, if each member  state had just one commissioner, then the European Commission  would be a purely intergovernmental affair, like the meetings of  national ambassadors."    Westendorp finds it "interesting" that British Commissioner  Sir Leon Brittan is currently publicly touting himself as a  candidate to succeed Commission President Jacques Delors.  However, he believes that the Briton has no chance against Ruud  Lubbers. "There is a consensus about Lubbers. He comes from  the circle of heads of government, and is therefore a logical  choice. Mr. Brittan will only be able to offer him his hand as  a good loser."</p>

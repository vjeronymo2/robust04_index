			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Birt plea for rise in TV licence fee MR JOHN Birt, BBC director-general, last night argued against any freeze in the television licence fee. Speaking at a launch to celebrate the BBC education department's 70th anniversary, he said: 'We must argue fiercely . . . for an increase, not a decrease, if we are to maintain the quality of our programming.' The government is considering a report it commissioned from consultants Touche Ross which is believed to present as an option a cut in the real value of the Pounds 83 licence fee.</p>

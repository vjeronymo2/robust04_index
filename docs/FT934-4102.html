			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Move to reassure Ulster unionists The British and Irish governments yesterday offered reassurances to the Northern Ireland unionists in an attempt to keep peace negotiations on course. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said on Irish radio that reports of British concessions on the constitutional issue were 'ill-informed nonsense'. He confirmed that the Irish government was willing to offer a written pledge to hold a referendum - but only as part of an overall settlement. The talks were still 'firmly on course' in spite of serious disagreements exposed on Friday. He added, however, that time might be running out for a deal. Mr Reynolds said later in a television interview that Ireland was halfway to peace. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, bluntly rejected suggestions that Britain agreed to compromise on the Irish claim to Ulster during talks in Dublin on Friday. He said there had been 'no softening on any point of principle. The principle here - and this is the key to the whole thing - is consent.' Mr Hurd said the talks between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Reynolds had gone through some 'rough passages'. But there was agreement on both sides that the future of Northern Ireland would remain firmly in the hands of the people of the province. His remarks were intended to reassure unionists that the government would not accept any deal which failed to include an Irish referendum on articles 2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to Northern Ireland. Officials said the government's position might have been misinterpreted because of confusion about the form a peace agreement might take. One suggestion is that the first paper produced by the talks would be restricted to a general statement of principles, intended to sustain the momentum of the process. It would be followed by a more detailed paper in which the republic would be expected to offer guarantees that a referendum on the disputed articles would form part of an overall peace agreement.</p>

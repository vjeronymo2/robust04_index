			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pascoe's cuts loss Pascoe's Group, the pet food manufacturer, reported that the expected improvement in the six months to July 2 did not materialise. Mr Douglas Strachan, chairman, blamed 'several unforeseen factors'. He added that the results reflected the costs of restructuring the business. The shares closed at 30p, a fall of 25 per cent since before the results announcement. On turnover of Pounds 4.36m (Pounds 8.31m), including Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 4.12m) from discontinued activities, pre-tax losses were halved at Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 2.5m). The result was stuck after provisions of Pounds 609,000 (Pounds 1.13m) relating to property write-downs. The company expects net assets to fall below half paid up nominal share capital and has arranged for a Pounds 400,000 convertible loan note to be issued to an existing shareholder, who will also underwrite the issue of new shares worth Pounds 225,000. Losses per share were 8.57p (34.21p) or 6.61p fully diluted.</p>

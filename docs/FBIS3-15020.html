[passage omitted] Here is Ritums Rozenbergs reporting  by phone from Moscow:    [Rozenbergs] Commenting on the blowing up of an electricity  pylon of the Skrunda military site, (Sergey Grikhayko), head of  the Baltic Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated  the following: We hope that the Latvian authorities will adopt  all necessary measures to clarify the causes and perpetrators of  the incident, and we hope that this action will not affect the  talks by our groups of experts and will not disturb the  documents we have agreed on for the short term and the  agreements signed on military questions.    It seems that the Russian side's reaction to the explosion  of  the pylon will not arouse broad debate. At the moment Russia  has on its agenda questions of a much more serious scale.  First, the spy trial has to be concluded; second, it has to go  on settling the question of the Bosnian Serbs; third, the debate  on the consequences of the amnesty has to be concluded. Ritums  Rozenbergs, special correspondent for the newspaper LABRIT in  Moscow, specially for Latvian Radio.</p>

He has switched from peremptory accusations against Ukraine  to the search for forms of cooperation. Asked whether he is not  afraid that Kiev will block the second round of elections, Yu.  Meshkov answered: "I trust Leonid Kravchuk very much; he is one  of the most eminent politicians of the present day, and he knows  how to settle the situation in Ukraine and abroad. He has  stated that the actual disposition of forces in the Crimea  precludes the use of strong-arm methods to influence the  situation, and I believe that he is speaking sincerely."    Yuriy Meshkov stressed: "The people of Crimea have voted for  change, for a departure from the old nomenklatura-based laws of  life, and for a close alliance with Russia" and the CIS  countries. This will make it possible to improve relations  between Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow. He said that by this vote  the people have legitimized the institution of the presidency in  the Crimea and that Kiev's dissatisfaction with the first round  results is a "reaction to personalities, not to the legislation  and constitution of the Crimea.... It is a short-term  dissatisfaction and will soon evaporate."</p>

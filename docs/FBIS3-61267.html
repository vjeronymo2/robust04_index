Viktor Sheynis Believes That the Election Statute Has Flaws"]    [Text] Despite Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis being a quite  prominent political figure, here are a few words about our  interlocutor.    Until the late 1980's, the door to politics was closed to a  person with his political views. Science, which he engaged in  with great pleasure, became the only area for  self-accomplishment. Had it not been for "perestroyka,"  everything would have developed as it had.... His first  experience in entering politics occurred much earlier, when he  wrote a small work about Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956.  This work of the young graduate student was designed for what  was later named samizdat, but ended up in the KGB first. As a  result, he was expelled from the graduate school and worked as a  borer at the Kirov Plant for six years....    As the former chief of the parliamentary working group for  revising the Election Statute, he perceives the experience of  the last election campaign in a philosophically calm and  politically calculated manner.    [Sukhomlinova] An ancient story about the relationship  between the creator Pygmalion and the result of his inspired and  tormented labors, Galatea, has been implemented anew...in the  course of the last election campaign. How do you evaluate your  "Galatea," the Election Statute?    [Sheynis] Alas, this lady has turned out to have flaws....  The Election Statute has advantages and, unfortunately, obvious  disadvantages. I consider the introduction of a mixed voting  system to be the main accomplishment; under the system, half the  deputies are elected on a proportional basis from the lists of  electoral associations to which political parties and other  organizations belong. They objected to me, as a rule in a  demagogic manner: Why give preference to parties at a time when  in our country they do not even amount to parties in the greater  scheme of things. I believe that they will not appear here until  we have multiparty elections in the country. After all, only the  "party of a new type" engaged in everything from ideological  conditioning of the working people to the distribution of all  kinds of benefits. For their part, parties which exist in the  environment of a democratic country mainly "work" for elections.    [Sukhomlinova] Therefore, we may hope that the process of  asserting a modern power structure has begun.... However, why  was precisely this provision, whose potential is obvious, very  difficult to "push through?"    [Sheynis] The reasons are many. I will give one of them. All  of this is unusual to us, and new things are, as a rule,  rejected. Opponents suggested that we first conduct an  experiment and see what happens: to elect 10 percent of the  deputies the way we proposed, and 90 percent--the old way, in  single-seat districts. In conjunction with this, I recalled an  old joke: At one point they became concerned here about the poor  condition of street traffic. They sent a delegation to England  to gain advanced experience. Upon its return, they concluded:  Indeed, street traffic is doing very well over there, probably  because it moves on the left. Let us try this in our country  too, and by way of an experiment convert just one motor vehicle  pool to driving on the left.... We would have had the same  experiment with these 10 percent....    Still, despite the resistance we managed to ensure that the  president agreed with us (he was precisely the one to introduce  the Edict on Elections). We managed to meet with him, explained  our position, and gave all the arguments "in favor" and  "against"--and he agreed with us.... I think that our former  parliament would not have resolved to pass such an election law.    [Sukhomlinova] Still, what is its principal flaw?    [Sheynis] Our main mistake was that we introduced a system  of  one-round voting in single-seat districts. A situation developed  which was similar to the 1989-1990 elections. Just as at that  time, a multitude of candidates, frequently without a clear  association with parties, competed within the same district, and  this "split" the vote of the electorate. However, those  elections were held in two rounds, after all. This time there  were random results in many districts....    I tried to change the situation by setting an example and  withdrew as a candidate in a single-seat district, suggesting  that the voters support another candidate from the democratic  bloc, Pavel Medvedev, who was elected as a result. I counted on  something greater: on others following my example. Alas.... The  two-round system would have allowed us to correct the situation  to a degree and to concentrate the votes of the electorate with  similar political orientations around the most promising  candidates. Having perceived the mistake, our working group  passed on to the president the draft amendments to the Election  Statute as early as 3 November. At the time amendments were  still being made. However, either the president turned down our  proposals or the draft simply did not reach him--it is not easy  to find a way to the president.... Well, the issue was closed.    [Sukhomlinova] However, can we say that this is an issue for  the future?    [Sheynis] Certainly. We will analyze our original draft law  most thoroughly against the background of the actual electoral  process and will, of course, try to introduce amendments to the  law which the parliament has yet to adopt. After all, the  statute in effect is devised solely for the 1993 elections. It  has other drawbacks, too. The extremely short period allowed for  the election campaign is the common source of the drawbacks.  When preparing the draft law we proceeded from the necessity of  135 days for the entire campaign. This is not a random number  but one calculated with the experience of other campaigns and  the conditions specific to our country taken into account.  However, the elections were announced, and the real election  campaign was conducted within a considerably shorter period of  time, which undoubtedly influenced its results.</p>

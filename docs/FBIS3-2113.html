At the same time, its  preferential policy of reducing and remitting taxes on other  trades in which foreign investors are engaged will remain  unchanged in the future.    According to this official, owing to the rich natural  resources for tourism in Hainan, the province has taken tourism  as a leading form of trade to bring along the development of  tertiary industry in the past few years. The development of  real estate is a prerequisite for boosting tourism, so when  examining and approving real estate investment projects, the  province did not include office buildings, auditoriums, hotels,  and guest houses as a category in which construction is  restricted. Instead, it regarded them as means of production in  the hope that the development of real estate will contribute to  boosting tourism. Since the exercise of macroeconomic  regulation and control last year, the central authorities have  withdrawn many landlocked provinces' funds for real estate  investment in Hainan, investigated the excessively large scope  of investment, and imposed sanctions on Hainan by banning  domestic remittances for any investment project in the province.  So far, such economic sanctions have not been lifted, but  trade-related remittances have been relaxed only recently.  Superficially, the central authorities forbid mainland banks to  lend money to coastal areas, but in fact the economic sanction  is applied only against Hainan. Moreover, the central  authorities openly criticized Hainan by name for its excessively  large scope of investment. The Hainan official believes that  Hainan, being the youngest province in the country, has no  backing among the central authorities, who therefore dare to  bully only Hainan, but are afraid of offending other major  provinces or cities.    As Hainan is the largest economic region in China, the  central authorities have provided it with many preferential  policies and vested in it the power to examine and approve  projects. Since 1 January this year, the separation of  financial and taxation departments and the collection of the VAT  on land have come into effect throughout the country. However,  in light of the hint given by the central authorities that  taxation policy in Hainan will not be changed, the province has  no intention of levying the VAT on any real estate developed by  foreign investors, as this practice will adversely affect the  national economic development of Hainan. The provincial  government hopes that the property market in Hainan will boom.  At present, a large number of real estate projects have had to  be laid aside owing to the withdrawal of funds last year. The  official added: At this crucial juncture, the province will not  recall the land, but will let the original investors keep it so  that they can develop it when "spring" comes.    This official continued: The Hainan Special Economic Region  had very remarkable advantages in the past, but as the central  authorities also practice preferential policies in the  landlocked areas, such advantages have weakened accordingly.  The greatest advantage of the province now is that the market  economy system was being practiced there five years earlier than  in other provinces in the country, so its basic framework has  taken shape. In addition, the provincial government is bold in  action and ready to take responsibility. It always has the  interests of enterprises and investors in mind. In order to  reflect the strong points of the special economic region, the  provincial government has decided to continue practicing the  preferential policy of reducing or remitting taxes on  foreign-invested enterprises. In the meantime, the government  will allow the existence of second- and third-hand property  markets.    It has been learned that last year, Zhu Rongji intended to  investigate and affix the local government's responsibility for  the excessively large scope of investment in Hainan because the  province originally planned to invest 10 billion yuan in  infrastructural construction, though actual investment came to  17.5 billion yuan. Although the province has invested 21.7  billion yuan in capital construction over the past five years,  infrastructure facilities in the province have been improved  greatly. Therefore, when Zhu Rongji understood this, he praised  the rapid development of Hainan instead of criticizing it. The  province plans to invest another 20 billion yuan this year to  improve the investment environment.</p>

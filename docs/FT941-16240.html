			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Gillette shake-up costs Dollars 164m Gillette, the US shaving and consumer products group, yesterday announced plans to reorganise its overseas operations in a move that will bring 2,000 job losses over the next two years and a one-time after-tax charge of Dollars 164m in the fourth quarter of 1993. It said sales, profits and earnings were expected to reach record levels in the fourth quarter before special charges, reflecting the introduction of new products and the first-time inclusion of results from Parker Pen, which it bought last May. The company said the job losses, which represent about 6 per cent of the workforce, would fall largely outside the US, but would not specify where. It said the cuts were likely to be balanced by growth elsewhere, so overall employment would remain roughly at today's level of 34,000 by the end of the year. Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the company needed to reorganise to compete more effectively and expand in international markets. Part of the plan will be to reorganise its international manufacturing operations, dedicating plants to specific product lines instead of expecting each of them to make a diverse range of goods. The group also aims to improve efficiency by consolidating some of its warehouses and sales centres and by integrating computer networks. Gillette's products include razors and toiletries sold under the Gillette brand, Oral-B toothbrushes, Parker and Paper Mate pens, and Braun electrical goods. Most of its operations are in the US, Europe and Latin America, but it is also expanding in other markets, such as China, India and Turkey. Mr Zeien said the effect of the efficiency savings would be felt mainly next year and there would be no significant impact on the current year's results.</p>

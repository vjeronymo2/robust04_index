			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / French nuclear body wants compensation over merger FRANCE'S atomic energy commission (CEA) is pressing the government to compensate it for the income it expects to lose under the planned merger of the state's civil electronics and nuclear interests. The new group is unlikely to be making substantial profits for several years given the financial needs of the electronics activities, in the view of Mr Philippe Rouvillois, general administrator of the CEA, which has spearheaded France's ambitious nuclear energy programme. This is the first official recognition of the financial challenges facing the new company, to be called Thomson-CEA-Industries (TCI), plans for which the government revealed last month. Mr Rouvillois told a French news agency that he expects the commission to lose around FFr400m (Pounds 41m) a year from the merger, in the form of dividends now paid to the CEA from its industrial unit's nuclear plant and fuel operations, which would be moved into TCI. In exchange, the CEA would have a 30-35 per cent stake in TCI, which would clearly be unable to yield substantial dividends while saddled with the losses of Thomson Consumer Electronics. The latter reported a FFr2.7bn net loss in 1990. This stake would incidentally give the CEA a blocking minority in TCI. That is intended to give it power to veto any attempt break up TCI or fully privatise it. This comes at a time when the CEA's budget is already under pressure. It expects to receive FFr6.2bn from the state this year to fund its huge civil research programmes, 25 per cent down over five years, say officials. The state budget covers 65 per cent of the CEA's needs; the rest comes from commercial revenues. Despite his financial anxieties, Mr Rouvillois stressed that he was confident of the CEA's future as an essential body in nuclear research and policy advice.</p>

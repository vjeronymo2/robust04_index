			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal -- live] </F>   [Excerpt] Jerusalem sources have said that negotiations  with the PLO on the completion of the Gaza and Jericho agreement  will resume only after the PLO enters the self-government areas.  Foreign Ministry sources believe that the negotiations will  resume in Cairo, and will be held on the level they were held so  far -- delegations under Major General Amnon Shahaq and Dr.  Nabil Sha'th.    Speaking in Cairo, Sha'th announced that negotiations on the  return of tens of thousands of misplaced Palestinians from 1967  will begin next month. Jerusalem confirmed that the  negotiations will be held according to the Oslo agreement in a  four-way committee of representatives from Israel, the PLO,  Egypt, and Jordan. According to Sha'th, Jordan has agreed to  participate in the talks at the beginning of next month.    Foreign Ministry sources said that they do not know that a  date has been set for the convention of the committee, but they  said that Israel has agreed in principle that the committee  convene in some two months. [passage omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 6 May adds:  "Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan says that there never were  200,000 Palestinian refugees of the Six-Days War. There were  only several dozen thousands [as heard], mostly from three  villages from the Latrun region." Eytan further says that "the  public is being misled, and that through these refugees, the  government wants to grant the Palestinians the right of return  it had canceled in the past.    ["The Likud says that the government no longer serves Jewish  and Zionists interests, as seen in its readiness to implement  the Palestinian right of return. The Likud spokesman has said  that returning hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees  into the boundaries of Eretz Yisra'el will result in a  demographic disaster for Israel."]</p>

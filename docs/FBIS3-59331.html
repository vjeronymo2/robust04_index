Besides the one or  two friends who knew about it, there was almost no one else who  knew, which greatly surprised friends overseas and in the  mainland.    Friends ask me: "Why did you go back to Beijing?" "To get  some books, and second, to meet some friends, especially good  friends," I answer half jokingly. In fact, there might be more  important reasons, like checking out the atmosphere and seeing  Beijing.    It is strange that while I was in Beijing I hated it there,  but after being away, I always think back to Beijing. I remember  once returning to Beijing from Singapore. I walked on Xiwaida  street, and the crowded pedestrians and the noisy environment  made me immediately feel warm and happy: I had come back home. I  also remember that on 11 June 1989, I went to Guangzhou, and my  Hong Kong friends there advised me to leave the country. I  hesitated for a while, but eventually decided to stay and after  a little while I went back to Beijing (Even though I was a bit  regretful later on). There are many reasons I did this, but  among them there was an unconscious reason, a fear of being  parted from Beijing. Anyhow, I lived for forty years in Beijing.  It seems strange that although the last several times I was away  from Beijing were for less time than this one, when I walked  into my living and study rooms I always had some familiar and  strange feelings. This time when going back, I of course also  expected this kind of feeling. I do not know why the similar  feelings did not arise: Everything was still familiar, just as  if I had only left for several days.    Sure, everything seemed as familiar as before, and  everything  seemed unchanged. Beijing was still as crowded as before, dust  was still flying around, and the air was still so unfresh. These  feelings were emphasized having come from an extremely clean  country such as Switzerland, which has less people and more  space.    It may not have changed overall, but there still may be some  smaller changes: There are more vendor stands selling food and  clothing, especially the small yellow "loaf of bread" taxis that  are all over the streets, and will stop when you wave to them.  The fare is reasonable and inexpensive, at ten yuan per ten  kilometers. Before, I have always said that among the four  essential items of food, clothing, housing and transportation,  the first three are satisfactory for the people of Beijing, with  only transportation posing a problem--it is particularly  difficult for people to get onto the public buses. Today, it  seems that this problem has been solved. My friends all say so,  and I have been happy about this for a long time. Even though  the yellow taxis may not look good in the scenery--this kind of  extremely ugly bug crawling everywhere and polluting the air and  environment badly--they benefit the people.    Over the course of a year, there have been some changes:  More  abundant commercial products, more crowded and noisy markets,  higher quality clothes, more expensive restaurants, and more  wealthy people. To get a haircut is seven yuan, but when I left  the country it was only eight jiao. To take a shower is three  yuan, but before it was six jiao. Of course the prices for  grain, meat and vegetables, and clothes did not increase this  much, and most of them did not increase by more than half. Thus  it seems that my friends do not have many complaints. One friend  told me that she earns six to seven hundred yuan per month which  is enough to support a child. But I think that she cannot go to  a restaurant on her salary. Even though not going to  restaurants, she can still eat chicken, duck, fish and meat,  which are not very expensive at market prices. Thus, let those  who have the money and would like to pay for a restaurant go  there. Also, there are different levels of restaurants. Even the  food sold by the roadside is not completely inedible. I think  this is very good and hope that the gap between rich and poor  will not widen. Multiple life-styles, different options and  levels of consumption are a healthy road for development. In  this way the people who "would like to stay poor" have the means  to "stay" poor; otherwise, if there is really no food to eat,  how can those people carry out their studies?    Nevertheless, a lot of people still persuade me that I had  better stay abroad, there is no research to do in China. Of  course, I understand that in China to do research is not better  than doing business. There will not be a "culture fashion,"  rather, the "doing business fashion" will continue to prevail.  This is what I had expected, and I think this is a good thing.  At the same time I also understand that there are still a lot of  people who did not "jump into the ocean," or are unable to "jump  into the ocean," or are not willing to "jump into the ocean,"  but are seriously pursuing their research. Moreover, there are  younger intellectuals who are growing rapidly in number. They  abandon politics, concentrating on knowledge. With strong  ambitions and boundless enthusiasm, they came to see me. It  seems that so long as you do not touch upon politics, and do not  speak about human rights and democracy, you can read about  Sarte, speak about Nitzche, and write about Hobbes. No one will  interrupt you. Two years ago people criticized my left-wing  opinions, now people hardly repudiate me. As for those points  that have been criticized, there are still a lot of people  writing about them, using them, and "spreading" them. They just  don't mention my name. This is very ridiculous, but history and  truth are often absurd and astonishing, especially in today's  China.    Of course, my friends are still unhappy that the news is  still in the same form, with politics and ideology showing no  signs of freedom. To recover the relatively lenient situation  and environment prior to "4 June" is not very easy. It still  takes a lot of effort, and even a longer period of time. This is  in my expectations. I also predict that there will not be a  change for the time being. Changes come slowly, but I think that  slow change also works as long as we do not go backward. Not  going backward is going forward. Of course, that great change  will come eventually. I still hope it will come gradually, step  by step; if it comes too fast, too easy, too unbelievably, it  may not be good. This year one of my students published an  article that says that the object of philosophy is ideas, and  "ideology" is already far removed from Marxist-Leninist  philosophy; the article is written profoundly and logically.  Thus it was published without questions, and nobody tried to  stop it. Isn't this nice? Culture, knowledge and literature that  were once denounced as "corrupt, anti- revolutionary, backward,  modern western capitalistic" culture, are again circulated by  publishing companies, isn't this good?    This trip to Beijing went very fast, altogether about twenty  days. Besides Zaifu and one other friend who knew, there was  almost nobody who knew before the trip, which greatly surprised  my friends on the mainland and oversees. Since coming back to  Beijing, I have of course returned to my previous unit and also  met several institution directors. After some small talk, one  person laughed at my "lightning" trip, and criticized my  anti-leftist articles in the journal FANGZUO BEIWANGLU [PREVENT  LEFTISM MEMORANDUM]. I said that I agree with the "non-argument"  principle, but are not the leftists still constantly attacking  me? I of course had a reason to rejoin with my article in the  fourth issue of ZHONGLIU, and to take a "lightning" approach  when visiting Beijing to "prevent unexpected events." The  director is also my friend, who smiled embarrassingly and again  pointed out that my trip was welcomed and assured me of the  freedom to come and go. This is really funny. When I was in  Beijing, I read the July issue of the journal ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU,  which still carried the article criticizing my views. It is  ironic that the writer who criticized me in various ways in the  article eventually went to the United States to look for  democracy, and it seems that he will never come back. After I  read about this, I could not help secretly laughing: Does this  mean that Beijing will always remain as your world? Today,  haven't I come back? Moreover, I will still come back in the  future. Beijing's democracy, and China's democracy, are more  important to me than American democracy.</p>

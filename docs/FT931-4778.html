			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad The air was full of the hissing of deflated expectations after the German-owned Thomas Cook unveiled the terms of its tender offer for 12 1/2 per cent of Owners Abroad. Having rejected Airtours' increased offer, the onus was on Owners to come up with a far sweeter deal. But Thomas Cook's continued reluctance to slap hard cash on the table will surely count against it. For better or worse, British fund managers are more likely to be seduced by short term financial gain than longer term industrial logic. Owners' proposed alliance with Thomas Cook certainly has its commercial attractions. It would furnish considerable cost savings, broaden Owners' marketing appeal and open the door to other European markets. But the 150p tender price represents only a small premium to Airtours' offer. Owners' shareholders would worry about the value of their remaining holding slipping without a bid premium. The company has hardly shown a slavish devotion to investors' interests in the past. Airtours' bid offers more elusive industrial rewards but more tangible financial inducements. Given the wonders of UK accounting policies and the timing of the bid, Airtours can write off Owners' winter losses while fully benefiting from its summer profits. This will provide a substantial boost to profitability this year. Airtours' share price is likely to move ahead sharply on completion. The worries will only surface next year when any integration difficulties materialise and the intentions of the traditionally combative market leader, Thomson, become apparent.</p>

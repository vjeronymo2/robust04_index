			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Silence May Be Prudent"] </F>   [Text] The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan's strong  attack on the proposed East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] is  unsettling. Not because the EAEC could turn out to be contrary  to Australian interests. After all, Malaysia's Prime Minister  Mahathir proposed the EAEC as a regional forum expressly  excluding the "white" economies of North America, Australia and  New Zealand (all members of the Australian-initiated  Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation [APEC] group). But over the  past year, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator  Evans, seemed to represent a sensible view that we had little to  gain by making direct attacks on EAEC, and possibly something to  lose.    Now Senator McMullan says our Government has a "distinct  preference" that the "EAEC either not go ahead or not get any  additional significance because we think it would be divisive in  the region".    He also emphasised that even if Australia were allowed to  join, our Government would still think EAEC wrong in  "principle". It may have been wiser to wait and see how both  APEC and EAEC develop, and how the relationship between the two  grows.    The war of words over the two bodies had eased after last  year's ASEAN meeting in Singapore. A compromise was effected  whereby Malaysia's EAEC would go ahead, but as a caucus within  APEC. Australia was assured that the EAEC would not be allowed  to develop in a divisive manner.    At that time Senator Evans implied Australia should moderate  its public attacks on the EAEC. Moderation had several things  in its favour. Little would be gained by provoking Dr Mahathir.    In any event, it was premature to make judgments about the  direction of the EAEC. Indeed, since Singapore, there has been  a strong push within ASEAN and among Australian trade experts,  including Professor Ross Garnaut, for the EAEC eventually to be  opened to Australia.    Conversely, departing from moderation as Senator McMullan  has  done carries risks. Over the past year a view has arisen in  regional capitals, including Tokyo, that APEC has grown so large  that it risks losing coherence as a grouping. There has also  been concern that it could be too subject to American influence.    That influence is resented when it is seen to try to impose  trade quotas on Japan, link China's trade with human rights, and  Indonesia's with labour rights. The United States is also using  its influence to try to thwart the EAEC, and the danger for  Australia in openly attacking that body is that we may be seen  within the region as a stalking horse for American influence.    What Senator McMullan -- and presumably the Government --  seems to be forgetting is that Australia's interests in the  region should be paramount.    APEC was an Australian initiative and a diplomatic triumph.  In the long term it should not matter if Australia's  self-interest is also served by a non-discriminatory EAEC or a  link between the free trade areas of ASEAN and Australia-New  Zealand, or by some combination of these all within the  framework of APEC and operating under the new GATT rules. We  should not risk limiting our options at what is still a  relatively early stage of our integration with this dynamic  region.</p>

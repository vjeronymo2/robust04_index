			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Confidence grows of 51% Royal Mail sale Leading supporters within the cabinet of privatisation of the Post Office are confident that the government will press ahead with a majority sale of the Royal Mail. They believe, however, that formal approval for the sale of a 51 per cent stake in the Royal Mail might signal an indefinite delay in the government's equally controversial plan to open up the domestic gas market to competition. A final decision on the Post Office sale will be deferred until the conclusion of the consultation period at the end of this month. In spite of the opposition of a hard-core of Tory MPs, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, expect the cabinet to adopt the preferred option set out in the government's white paper in July. Mr Clarke, in particular, believes that a decision in favour of privatisation is essential to demonstrate that the government has maintained its radical momentum. Mr John Major is still wary about the potential political cost of a decision which the Labour party says will signal a significant run-down in rural post services and the closure of many village post offices. But Mr Douglas Hurd, who in spite of his role as foreign secretary has emerged as a pivotal figure in the cabinet debate over the future of the Post Office, is said by aides to remain in favour of a 51 per cent sale. On that basis, Downing Street officials expect Mr Major to give the go-ahead for the sale. That would allow Mr Heseltine to announce the decision at the Conservative party conference in mid-October. Ministers believe that strong conference backing for the plan would put pressure on dissident backbench MPs to fall into line. The dissidents have been calling for a minority sale of the Royal Mail, with the government retaining 51 per cent of the shares. But Mr Bill Cockburn, the chief executive of the Post Office, has dismissed that idea as 'unworkable'. On the assumption that a majority sale will go ahead, the Department of Trade and Industry has already established a separate team to prepare the legislation. The Treasury is also considering a number of financial arrangements for a privatised Post Office. The expectation that the sale will go ahead, however, has cast further doubts over whether the government will meet its commitment to open up the domestic gas market by April 1996. Ministers backing the break-up of the monopoly enjoyed by British Gas acknowledge that it might be impossible to fit legislation into the forthcoming parliamentary session alongside a Post Office bill. British Gas has also alarmed many Conservative MPs by insisting that competition in the domestic market will lead to higher prices for millions of consumers. The threatened price rises might be particularly steep in the rural areas where Post Office privatisation is causing most public concern.</p>

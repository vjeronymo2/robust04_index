			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reports on interviews with Federation Council members </F> during the 11 January session by Sergey Kaverin: "Federation  Council: The Process Is Under Way"]    [Text] In the Federation Council's lobby our correspondent  managed to strike up a conversation during yesterday's meeting  with some of the "key figures" of the current political Olympus.  <H5>  Kalmykian President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov </H5>   [Kaverin] How do you assess the parliament's lineup?    [Ilyumzhinov] I think that the Russian president has gotten  a mirror reflection of our society, which is actually entirely  natural... after the October shooting of Russians.    [Kaverin] Your attitude to the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia leader?    [Ilyumzhinov] It is normal, despite the press' hysteria  about an onslaught of the browns. I do not see that.    [Kaverin] That is, you agree with his concept of a unitary  and indivisible Russia, where all entities will be territorial?    [Ilyumzhinov] No, we are not going to be part of anything.  <H5>  Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev </H5>   [Kaverin] Is Tatarstan planning to take part in the next  elections for the Russian parliament?    [Shaymiyev] Everything will depend on whether we will be  able finally to straighten out our relations with the Russian  Federation. If these relations are straightened out and a treaty  is signed, the elections will undoubtedly take place in  Tatarstan.    [Kaverin] Are you sure that this treaty will be signed?    [Shaymiyev] I think that both sides are presently interested  in it.    [Kaverin] What is your status at this forum?    [Shaymiyev] I am a guest.  <H3>  Ramazan Abdulatipov, Chairman of the Council of the  Nationalities of the Former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet </H3>   [Kaverin] According to what principle do you think factions  will be formed in parliament?    [Abdulatipov] According to their interests. For example,  those who call for the Federation Treaty to be observed. In  other words, we should join forces on substance, not according  to formal characteristics.    [Kaverin] What problems do you think the upper chamber may  encounter in the near future?    [Abdulatipov] I think these are primarily relations between  the Federation components and the federal authorities. As for  the substance of the federal structure, I think that the form of  Federation components' joining the Federation should be retained  and the rules of the game should be the same for all. So that  regardless of the status of a Federation component people who  live there will feel as equals.    [Kaverin] Are there "hidden snags" in the parliament's work?    [Abdulatipov] Control over the budget, in the first place.  The current state authorities are out of control from top to  bottom.    [Kaverin] What are your impressions from the president's  address?    [Abdulatipov] He returned for yet another time to the  principle of the separation of the powers of the Center and the  Federation components. I think that this effectively amounts to  Boris Nikolayevich's return to the Federation Treaty. I can  give you an absurd example where half the seats in the Duma are  held by parties that operate only in Moscow.  <H5>  Peasants' Party Leader Yuriy Chernichenko </H5>   [Kaverin] What is the main area of the Federation Council's  activity?    [Chernichenko] It must discuss bills coming from the State  Duma. This is why the Council itself will not be much of a  problem. The most important thing for it now is to create a  democratic staff, approximately 10 committees, that would make  it effective. We also need to do it so as to put a deputy above  the staff, not the other way around.  <H5>  Former Moscow City Soviet Chairman Nikolay Gonchar </H5>   [Kaverin] What is your reaction to Yeltsin's speech?    [Gonchar] A positive one. I liked the idea that there is no  alternative to searching for accord.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Berlin-Moscow road-rail deal Work on upgrading road and rail links along a 1,800km corridor between Berlin and Moscow is to be co-ordinated by the European Commission and the four governments involved under an agreement reached this week. Delegations from Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia and the Commission have signed a memorandum of understanding intended to ensure that European Union support is properly targeted and to encourage private sector involvement. The proposal to improve roads and railways and build better border crossing points could cost between Ecu5.4bn (Pounds 4.2bn) and Ecu9bn and has already attracted considerable interest from banks, the Commission said. Priority projects in the scheme are road and rail links between the German border and Warsaw, the railway between Warsaw and the Polish/Belarus border and the border crossing between Poland and Belarus, where the railway gauge changes and long delays occur. Work has already begun on some parts of the corridor, but some parts of the scheme will not be completed before 2010.</p>

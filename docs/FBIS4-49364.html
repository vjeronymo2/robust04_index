			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Arms Exports: Gain or Drain </F> on U.S. Economy?" -- XINHUA headline]    [Text] Washington, May 3 (XINHUA) -- To U.S. arms dealers,  economics is increasingly a driving force for the country's  booming weapons trade, disrupting the world peace for which  Washington says it cherishes a deep love.    To the workers at St. Louis, Fort Worth and Boston, where  major export items like F-15, F-18 aircraft, F-16 fighters and  Patriot missiles are made, closing plants is the least they want  from President Clinton.    Controlling 57 percent of the global weapons market, the  U.S.  sold 35 billion U.S. dollars of weapons last year to the world's  volatile regions, 10 times greater than Russia and more than 100  times greater than China.    "The real scandal at the heart of American foreign policy is  that the U.S., the world's leading democracy, has become the  world's number one arms dealer," said William Hartung, author of  "And Weapons for All".    U.S. officials point to the commercial interests in such  deals: weapon sales volume in 1993 is about one third of the  U.S. merchandise trade deficit during the period, some 150,000  jobs will be lost if arms sales are reduced.    A recent study by the New York-based World Policy Institute,  however, finds that the preoccupation with the economics of arms  trade is one-sided. Arms exports provide "marginal, short-term"  gains for the economy.    Over the past 10 years, total U.S. arms exports averaged 19  billion dollars a year. During the same time, government loans,  grants, cash payments and other subsidies averaged over six  billion dollars a year.    This figure includes the costs of security assistance  programs that support arms exports, U.S. Government involvement  in air and trade shows, the 20,000 U.S. Government personnel  involved in arms exports and the costs of writing off bad  foreign military sales loans.    "This seriously undercuts the net gains to the U.S. economy  from foreign military sales," the study says. In fiscal 1994,  arms export-related subsidies accounted for 43 percent of the  entire U.S. foreign aid budget.    Once the impacts of arms sales in stimulating arms race and  undermining the economic growth in developing countries are  taken into account, arms sales may even be a net drain on the  U.S. economy, observers say.    The International Monetary Fund, in a study released last  month, says that if the world arms expenditure is cut by one  fifth, the world's consumer market will be 190 billion dollars  larger, which is about four times the revenue of global arms  market.    On defense-related employment, a Congressional Budget Office  study in 1992 estimates that a substantial cut in U.S. arms  sales to the Middle East will affect less than two percent of  all defense workers and less than one in every thousand workers  across the country.    This is hardly a figure to cause serious damage to the  overall economic growth of the U.S., especially when only five  states -- Texas, California, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts  -- suffer the bulk of defense conversion, observers say.    However, despite of the promise to curtail world arms trade,  the Clinton administration and congress have repeatedly passed  up the moral, political and even economic concerns that such  trade may raise, observers say.    The Commerce Department has taken a hands-on role in  promoting arms exports even as the State Department has opposed  an industry proposal to create a new one billion dollars  guarantee fund for weapons exports.    Although a few deals have been scaled back or withdrawn  under  the threat of congressional action, the vast majority of 50 to  100 major arms deals made by the U.S. each year sail through  congress with little or no scrutiny.    "If last year is any indication, America's arms sales  addiction is alive and well," said William Hartung. "A change  in policy is possible, but it's not going to happen unless the  public and congress demand it, loudly and clearly."</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Fortune favours the cautious - The Bottom Line FORTUNE is said to favour the brave, but a cautious approach has helped to turn First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions group, into one of the classiest acts in the hard-hit leisure sector. While many groups expanded rapidly during the 1980s, only to collapse under the burden of debt when the consumer spending boom ended, First Leisure was careful to keep its gearing low. The company nevertheless used its strong cashflow to invest heavily in large discotheques, both in city centres and new edge-of-town sites, and its resorts, such as the Blackpool Tower, pier and Winter Gardens. John Conlan, chief executive, has also helped bring 10-pin bowling up to date with the group's Super Bowl sites. These aim to attract families, with simple scoring systems, fast food and electronic games. The resilience of these businesses was demonstrated this week when First Leisure maintained its 10-year record of profits growth. Even more impressive, in spite of what it described as 'increasingly adverse trading conditions', the group reported a slight increase in its net profit to sales margin of 29 per cent. First Leisure started in 1983 as a Pounds 37.5m buy-out from Forte by Lord Delfont. The 85-year-old, who is still life president of the company, stepped down as chairman last year, to be replaced by Lord Rayne, a comparative stripling at 74. Since flotation in 1983, the group's market value has grown more than tenfold and stands at over Pounds 500m. Inevitably this sort of quality comes at a price. The shares trade on a prospective multiple of nearly 20, a hefty premium to the market. The main question concerning the group is whether it can continue to grow at this rate, without making a significant acquisition or finding a new business area. Conlan emphasises the considerable scope for organic growth in the existing businesses - particularly 10-pin bowling. The group spent Pounds 34m on capital investment last year, and will spend as much again this year. Some Pounds 8m of last year's total went into refurbishment of six of the group's largest discos. The venues were closed for several months, but the group is confident that the improvements will be justified by attracting customers when consumer spending does recover. The fall in property values in the south-east of England gives the group a chance to increase its cover particularly around and within the M25, where it has been previously been under-represented. Lord Rayne, chairman, is enthusiastic about the group's increasing scope to benefit, as it expands, from economies of scale in buying its drinks, goods and equipment such as amusement machines. It is investing Pounds 3m in electronic point of sale technology and hopes to use it to emulate large retailers by improving margins and stock control. To that end the group last year hired Graham Coles as finance director. Before spending a brief spell at Amber Day, the discount retailer, Coles was finance director for three years with BhS. Two years ago First Leisure took its first, tentative, step into continental Europe by buying a large discotheque in Amsterdam. The venue is trading profitably, but Conlan said its main benefit was in training managers in a foreign market. He is aware of the importance of understanding different cultural backgrounds to making a success of a leisure venue. Not least for that reason, he is likely to concentrate on the south-east of England before venturing further into Europe. The company has identified two possible new areas for expansion - mass-market health and fitness clubs, and bingo. The huge high street bingo market is carved up between Bass and Rank and neither seems a likely seller. Conlan is interested in bringing bingo to more upmarket, edge-of-town sites. Analysts are not sure that bingo can be transferred from its present high-street environment of converted cinemas and the like. But one said he knew that First Leisure would do its homework, and only make the move if it was sure of success. That sort of confidence goes a long way to explaining the group's premium rating.</p>

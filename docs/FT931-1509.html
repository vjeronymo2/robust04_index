			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Eni to rationalise foreign units after Italian scandal ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals concern implicated in Italy's political corruption scandal, plans to rationalise its network of foreign subsidiaries. The aim is to improve transparency and accountability at the group, which had sales of L50,883bn (Dollars 32bn) in 1991 and has 209 subsidiaries registered abroad. The Eni group comprises the parent company and 12 main subsidiaries, all but one of which, Eni International Holding, are based in Italy. The biggest subsidiaries in terms of sales are Snam, involved in gas supply and distribution; EniChem, Italy's biggest chemicals concern; Agip, the upstream oil and gas operation; and Agip Petroli, which handles the downstream side of the oil business. While Eni International Holding, a purely financial operation, has four subsidiaries, all abroad, Eni's other big subsidiaries have many of their operations registered outside Italy. Agip Petroli and EniChem together have around 60 non-Italian companies, while Agip has 30 subsidiaries registered abroad. Among the most common locations are financial centres or tax havens, such as Geneva and Jersey. Details of the streamlining are still vague, but the changes are expected to affect mainly the Eni group's financial subsidiaries or holding companies. Eni has become a focus for investigations into political corruption and illegal financing of Italy's main political parties. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, chairman, and the heads of three big subsidiaries are still in a Milan jail after being arrested earlier this month. Mr Franco Ciatti, chairman of its Nuovo Pignone turbines subsidiary, who was also detained, has now been released. Illegal payments to politicians and kickbacks on big contracts have allegedly been channeled through Eni's foreign operations. Political contributions were allegedly paid through profits from unbooked foreign exchange transactions. In some cases, kickbacks for big equipment orders were allegedly made through bank accounts held by foreign subsidiaries. Most of the foreign operations come under the control of Eni's subsidiaries. The planned restructuring is to be spelled out by a special committee of the group's board. It is supposed to tighten financial controls, partly by working closely with leading international accounting and consulting firms. Eni also plans to scale down Eni International Holding, its main foreign financial operation, based in Amsterdam. Eni International Holding, in turn, has foreign subsidiaries. These include Eni International Bank, registered in Nassau with a capital of Dollars 160m, and Hydrocarbons International Holding, based in Zurich and Luxembourg. The annual meeting of Eni International Holding is to be brought forward to early next month, when the small stake held in it by Enirisorse, Eni's non-ferrous metals subsidiary, will be moved to the parent company. Eni yesterday announced plans to sell Inca International, a small plastics subsidiary of its EniChem chemicals arm. The company, which had sales of L45bn last year, specialises in making bottles and packaging from plastics.</p>

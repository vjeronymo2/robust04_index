			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agreement in sight on PNG gold mine RTZ, THE world's largest mining group, and the Papua New Guinea government have patched up their differences over how the USDollars 609m Lihir Island gold project in PNG should be financed. It is now suggested that all the present partners - including Nuigini Mining, the Battle Mountain Gold subsidiary,as well as RTZ and the government - pool their shareholdings in a new company, tentatively called Lihir Gold, which would be floated on the Australian stock exchange. Venezuelan Goldfields, a small Canadian explorer, would be involved and the state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation would be invited to take 20 per cent of the floated vehicle. Mr Maskett Iangalio, PNG minister of mining and petroleum, told his parliament yesterday that by injecting USDollars 250m to Dollars 400m in equity, project borrowings would be reduced to a manageable level and early dividends could be paid. Lihir has one of the biggest gold deposits outside South Africa, 40m ounces. Mr Iangalio said, in order to preserve PNG's interest in the venture at 30 per cent, local investors would be given preferential treatment in the proposed floatation.</p>

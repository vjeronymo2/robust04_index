			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Japan calls on UNSC to reflect 'realities' JAPAN yesterday called for changes in the functions and composition of the UN Security Council to reflect 'the realities of the new era'. However, in a speech to the Council's summit session, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, stopped short of formally pressing for a permanent seat for Japan. He said it was necessary for the UN to evolve, while adapting to a changing world, and get away from concepts that pre-dated even the Cold War and were based on the world of 1945 when the organisation was founded. Mr Miyazawa promised he would do his utmost to ensure the the approval of legislation on constitutional change necessary to permit Japanese troops to join international peace-keeping operations. Japan is expected to be asked to provide at least 20 per cent of an estimated Dollars 1bn budget for planned UN operations in Cambodia. Mr Masamichi Hamabusa, the prime minister's spokesman, told reporters outside the council chamber that Japan aimed to obtain permanent membership by 1995, the UN's 50th anniversary. It became a two-year member this year for the seventh time - a record for an elected state. The spokesman noted that Japan's 12.5 per cent assessed share of the UN budget was more than the combined total for Britain and France, which are among the present five permanent veto-holding members.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER BOOK ON MOSSAD  </P> <P> I am outraged that Arabist Cockburn can be given so much space and legitimacy  to spout his longstanding total hatred of Israel.  </P> <P> He is not "Column Left," but "Column Hate."  </P> <P> How strange it is that at this moment of American crisis we should have such a  concentration on the supposed duplicity of Israel. Does one have to be an  expert to detect the Arabs' secret weapon? Make Israel the secret culprit and  the enemy of America.  </P> <P> JOSEPH SIMON  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Arts: Philadelphia Here I Come - Wyndham's Theatre Brian Friel's Philadelphia Here I Come] has arrived at Wyndham's Theatre in the West End after its widely acclaimed performances at the King's Head in Islington, writes Malcolm Rutherford. First produced in 1964, it seems to me an even better play than Friel's later Dancing at Lughnasa, which continues at the Garrick. Superb performances by (among others) Pauline Delany as Madge and Jonathan Arun as one of the two parts of Gareth, the young Irishman about to leave for America. Direction is by Dan Crawford.</p>

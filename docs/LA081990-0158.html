			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GILT-EDGED BONDS LETS PIRATES GIVE GOOD ACCOUNTING AGAINST REDS, 3-1  </P> <P> Barry Bonds refuses to talk about his sensational season. But he is easily the  main reason the Pittsburgh Pirates have a two-game lead in the National League  East.  </P> <P> Bonds hit a home run and drove in two runs Saturday at Cincinnati to lead the  Pirates to a 3-1 victory over the Reds and give Zane Smith his second victory  in two starts for his new team.  </P> <P> With five weeks remaining in the season, there is nobody in the league with  better credentials for the Most Valuable Player award than the 26-year-old  outfielder.  </P> <P> Bonds is batting .319 (fourth in the league), has 24 home runs (fifth), 93 runs  (first), 90 runs batted in (third), 40 stolen bases (third) and 68 walks  (fourth.). And he is batting .429 with runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> Smith (8-7) was traded to the Pirates by the Montreal Expos on Aug. 8. He has  quickly become a believer in Bonds and the Pirates.  </P> <P> "Barry exemplifies the spirit here," Smith said. "This team wants to win. I  think it shows in every game we play."  </P> <P> Bonds doubled in a run in the first inning and homered in the fourth to give  Smith all the support he needed to beat the Reds for the first time in two  years.  </P> <P> Smith, a left-hander who specializes in getting out left-handed batters with  off-speed pitches, spent most of his career with Atlanta, for whom he won 15  games in 1987.  </P> <P> He was having a poor season in 1989 when the Expos, in the battle for the East  title, made a deal for him. The Expos used him in relief and in 31 games he was  0-1 to finish with a 1-13 record.  </P> <P> In this game he gave up six hits in 7 2/3 innings. The Reds had only one  left-handed hitter in the lineup, Hal Morris, and he had one of the hits off  Smith.  </P> <P> The Pirates have won four in a row; the Reds now have lost three in a row.  </P> <P> Said Red Manager Lou Piniella: "I've been very patient with a lot of people.  And, I'll tell you, I'm starting to lose my patience a little bit. I don't know  what to say. You have to score runs to win, for certain."  </P> <P> New York 9, San Francisco 2 -- David Cone struck out 13 and pitched the Mets to  their first victory at Candlestick Park in more than a year. Cone had not  beaten the Giants since 1987 and the Mets had lost seven in a row in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Cone (9-6) has won eight of his past 10 decisions.  </P> <P> Trevor Wilson (8-5) had only himself to blame. With two out in the third, he  walked Cone, who has nine hits this season, on four pitches. The left-hander  never got another out.  </P> <P> Mark Carreon doubled and Dave Magadan singled to left for two runs. Howard  Johnson also had a two-run single in the five-run inning.  </P> <P> Cone also had two singles and a sacrifice bunt.  </P> <P> Atlanta 17, Chicago 6 -- It isn't unusual for a lot of runs to be scored at  Wrigley Field, but it is surprising that there were 35 hits and not one home  run.  </P> <P> Mark Lemke had five of the Braves' 24 hits, scored a run and drove in two.  Rookie Lance Dickson (0-3) was chased in a five-run third inning.  </P> <P> It was a breeze for Charlie Leibrandt (5-7), who ended a four-game losing  streak. He went six innings, giving up two runs and six hits and getting a 15-2  lead.  </P> <P> Houston 3, St. Louis 2 -- The Cardinals will be glad when Franklin Stubbs gets  out of town.  </P> <P> Friday night he broke up Bob Tewksbury's perfect game, and in this game he took  some luster off rookie Omar Olivares' debut.  </P> <P> Olivares gave up three hits in eight innings and led, 2-1. But Stubbs hit his  18th home run, off Lee Smith in the ninth, to tie it.  </P> <P> Stubbs led off the 11th with a single, his fourth hit, and eventually scored  the winning run on a single by Mark Davidson.  </P> <P> San Diego 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Jack Clark's three-run homer with two outs in  the sixth inning carriedthe Padres to a win at home.  </P> <P> Andy Benes (9-8) improved his career record against Philadelphia to 5-0, giving  up seven hits in six innings for the victory. Craig Lefferts pitched the final  inning for his 19th save. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

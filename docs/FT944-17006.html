			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Nuclear safety breach claimed Safety regulations have been breached at Drigg, the repository for low-level nuclear waste at Sellafield in Cumbria, according to Greenpeace. The environmental group said a team entered the dump one night in July and found evidence suggesting that it contained intermediate level waste. The waste was uncovered, and contained jagged edges which could tear the membrane which isolates it from the water supply. British Nuclear Fuels, which operates the site, said it had been running the site for 35 years to the complete satisfaction of the authorising bodies.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / International Company News: Former chairman faces trial A Milan judge decided at the weekend to send for trial Mr Paolo Berlusconi, brother of the Italian prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, former socialist prime minister, Mr Roberto Mazzotta, former Cariplo chairman, and 17 others, on charges related to bribes allegedly paid on property deals with the Cariplo pension fund. Investigating magistrates believe some L14bn of bribes were paid to the Christian Democrats and the socialists. Mr Berlusconi has claimed he paid only normal intermediary fees. Cariplo itself says the affair is purely a personal matter for those involved and that its inquiries show the affair will have no impact on the bank's operations.</p>

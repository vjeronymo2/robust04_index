			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KECK GRANT TO ORANGE COUNTY ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> The W. M. Keck Foundation has awarded $1 million to the Orange County  Performing Arts Center's Endowment Fund, Center officials announced Monday. The  grant will be used to launch a campaign to increase the endowment's cash assets  from the current $3 million (including the Keck grant) to $12 million by the  end of 1993.  </P> <P> The gift represents a "major step forward" in financial stability for the Costa  Mesa Center, which uses endowment funds for programming and operating costs,  said Center Chairman Henry T. Segerstrom.  </P> <P> "Building the cash in the endowment broadens our financial support base so we  don't have to depend so heavily on ticket sales and can perhaps engage in more  (artistically) daring" programs and exercise "more flexibility" in programming,  Segerstrom said.  </P> <P> At present, about $70 million has been committed to the Center's Endowment  Fund, established in 1982, primarily in deferred estate gifts such as will  bequests, Center officials report. But these funds are not expected to be  converted into cash assets for 20 to 30 years.  </P> <P> In considering the gift to the Center, which was created and sustained entirely  by private sector funds, "we were particularly impressed by the way people of  the area have rallied to build and support this marvelous facility," said David  A. Thomas, chairman of the W. M. Keck Foundation's Southern California Program  Committee.  </P> <P> Thomas also said that though it is unrestricted, the grant is an attempt "to  encourage continued development" of arts education and community outreach, a  particular focus of the Los Angeles-based foundation which limits its arts  support to Southern California. The Center currently sponsors several  educational programs of its own plus helps subsidize others presented by  regional groups using the facility.  </P> <P> "We depend on (foundation grant recipients) to ever expand their educational  outreach programs even though our grants are not necessarily directly tied to  their expansion," Thomas said. The foundation has made similar gifts to the  Museum of Contemporary Art ($2.2 million in 1988), the Los Angeles Philharmonic  ($1.2 million in 1988) and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra ($100,000 in  1989.)  </P> <P> The W. M. Keck Foundation, which has donated more than $24 million to arts and  culture in Southern California since 1980, contributed $1 million to  construction of the $73.7-million Center in 1983. The foundation annually gives  a total of $35 million to support a wide range of needs nationwide in addition  to arts and culture.  </P> <P> The foundation was established in 1954 as a grant-making entity by the late W.  M. Keck, founder of the Superior Oil Co. Its primary focus is support for  science, engineering and medical research.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Silvio Mendiandua] </F>   [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- The most noteworthy results  of a visit by Ecuadoran deputies that ended today were the  pledge to increase solidarity with Cuba and the prospect of  broadening exchange of experiences.    The multiparty delegation that was in Cuba between 22 and 27  May was headed by Professor Juan Jose Castelo, president of the  education, culture, and sports commission of the single-chamber  parliament, and made up by Secretary Abdon Monroe Palacio,  Gilberto Vaca, Osvaldo Coronel, and Magaly Robalino.    Castelo, who spoke on behalf of the South American deputies  in an interview with Jaime Crombet, acting president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament),  expressed his satisfaction at the fruitful exchanges with their  Cuban colleagues.    The visitors, aside from seeing the National Assembly and  other official departments, visited hospitals, institutions for  infants, and educational, scientific, and cultural centers.  They spoke to directors and workers.    During a two-hour conversation with Crombet, the deputies  expressed their admiration for the Cuban people's efforts to  overcome the severe economic difficulties following the collapse  of the European Socialist Bloc -- Cuba's historic ally -- and in  the face of Washington's increased economic blockade.    Castelo underscored that this struggle is carried out  without  impairing Cuban independence and sovereignty, or without  affecting achievements in health, education, and social  security, which deserve support and solidarity.    Castelo, as president of an important commission comprising  10 percent of the total number of Ecuadoran parliament deputies,  spoke about Ecuador's interest in participating in the Pedagogia  95 congress that will be held in Havana in February 1995.    Castelo also believes that the fluid dialogue that began  should continue together with broadening the parliamentary  visitor exchange program so that both countries can take  advantage of their experiences for the benefit of their  political and economic processes.    In reply to PRENSA LATINA, Castelo, in his role as national  leader of the Democratic People's Movement (MPD), disclosed that  this force, the number one leftist force, will promote electoral  unity in order to win the 1996 elections and multiply solidarity  with the Cuban revolutionary process.</p>

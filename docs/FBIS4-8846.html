			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The situation in Gorazde is extremely critical and  dramatic. After Karadzic's fascists literally razed to the  ground all the villages on the outskirts of town and massacred  and burnt hundreds of people in the villages around Gorazde,  this morning they launched a fierce onslaught from the direction  of Foca on (Osana) and Ilovaca. Thousands of fascists are  moving from the direction of the Praca River valley toward  Orahovice and Zorovici. Over 50 new tanks are on the move as  are thousands of artillery pieces. A fierce Chetnik offensive  has been launched from the direction of (?Deseva) toward  (?Ranje) and Ostro.    Dozens of the most destructive shells are landing in the  town's center every minute. There are dozens of massacred,  heavily wounded lying in the streets. No one can help them as  the entire town is under heavy artillery and sniper fire. About  700 wounded in the war hospital have been left to die since  there is a lack of even the most basic of medicines. There are  also no bandages.    At the moment of filing this report, we received the  information that the aggressor has fired chemical agents at the  war hospital.    The town of Gorazde is dying despite all the appeals and  warnings of these people sent to domestic, European, and  international institutions. According to the latest  information, dozens of thousands of new refugees are heading for  the town center. The aggressor is firing at them with mortars  and tanks. Your correspondent from this town has no words to  describe the horror in this area.    The members of our army are still courageously resisting the  onslaught of the fascists, but the question is how long they  will be able to endure. It is a question of hours before  Gorazde becomes the next Vukovar.</p>

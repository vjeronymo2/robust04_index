			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Shkurko, senior officer at Ukraine's </F> Ministry of Defense Press Service: "Ukraine's Military Policy:  Oriental Motifs"]    [Text] There is something odd about the vector of public  opinion in our state. Whereas attempts by Ukraine's Ministry of  Defense to establish contacts with Western partners invariably  meet with support and even understanding, any movement from that  department in an easterly direction gives rise to mistrust and  even protests. Just recall the widespread condemnation of the  meeting of ministers of defense of the CIS countries in  Ashgabat. At that time, an extremely broad range of emphatic  accusations were voiced, starting with admonitions for the  allegedly servile position assumed by Ukraine's Ministry of  Defense and ending with "exposures" of the secret intentions of  "hostile forces" to join the Collective Security Treaty.  However, realities are such that the East is by no means less  important for Ukraine, than the West. Even from the point of  view of this circumstance alone, the recent visit by our  military delegation to Almaty and Tashkent could not fail to  give rise to intense public interest.    Its leader, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense Colonel  General Ivan Oliynyk repeatedly stressed that Ukraine is  building relations with its partners on the principles of mutual  respect, trust, and mutual advantage. This determined the  readiness to discuss all the apparently most acute issues.    Both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are interested in regaining,  as fast as possible, the technology and armaments of their  national armies (as of 1992) that are presently stored at  Ukraine's repairs enterprises. The Ukrainian side confirmed its  readiness to immediately return that technology to the clients,  taking into account the cost of the operations performed on  them. Right at the negotiating table, an order was issued to  prepare military convoys for shipment; even the procedure for  arming the guards who would accompany them was discussed. As a  result, trains with repaired military technology will soon set  off eastward.    The Ukrainian side not only expressed its readiness to  provide its own repairs base for the services of Kazakhstan's  and Uzbekistan's military departments, but also to improve those  that they have. Research institutes in these countries have  been invited to take part in elaborating an intensive  modernization of military technology.    For its part, Ukraine is interested in repairing military  transport aviation aircraft at Uzbekistan's enterprises and in  using the Baykonur space-vehicle launching site and Kazakhstan's  unique testing areas for implementing our scientific research  programs.    Incidentally, the subject of space missiles was a major  topic  at the negotiations in both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Each one  of these countries has its matchless missile technology and  scientific research basis. Cooperation in this sphere will be  extremely useful and advantageous for all sides taking part in  the negotiations.    In both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the sides reached an  understanding of the fact that large-scale relationships between  the military departments must be reinforced by bilateral  agreements on military cooperation at the level of heads of  state. Draft agreements are already in the process of  elaboration. If such documents are signed, this will open up  wide prospects for the interaction between Ukraine, on the one  hand, and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, on the other, in the  military technological sphere.    It is worth recalling that a very telling phrase has been  included in the communique on the results of the negotiations  and in the protocols that have been signed: "...bilateral  contacts are in conformity with the international agreement of  obligations of the sides and ... do not restrict the interests  of any of the third countries."    Both right after the disintegration of the Union and in the  years that followed, it was difficult to picture a state that  would come out in favor of integration within the framework of  the CIS more consistently than Kazakhstan. However, today, even  there, people seem to realize that the role of the leader in the  tight pack "Russia -- the rest of the CIS countries" may result  in more of a headache than mutual advantage.    For example, no sooner did Kazakhstan raise the question of  fair principles in withdrawing nuclear weapons from its  territory, than Russia immediately responded by launching its  propaganda campaign, which has already been tested in Ukraine,  to the effect that "Kazakhstan's nuclear facilities are in a  critical state." The result was directly opposite to that  expected. According to chief of General Staff of Kazakhstan's  Armed Forces Major General Alibek Kasymov, today, the removal of  nuclear munitions from Kazakhstan has been halted, with the  exception of those whose service life has expired or that have  serious defects.    It might seem that Kazakhstan's right to exercise control  over the Baykonur space-vehicle launching site, situated on its  territory, is beyond doubt. The initial attempts to exercise  this right resulted in a sharp reaction on the part of Moscow:  We, they said, will adapt the Plesetsk space-vehicle launching  site for our own purposes and, after we withdraw, Baykonur will  fall apart on its own. Just like that!    Uzbekistan is encountering similar problems -- although at a  different level. The disintegration of the centralized system  of management has painfully affected everything, starting from  replenishing the weapons arsenal and ending with logistic  support. Despite the requests of assistance in most elementary  issues, yesterday's "big brother" remains unmoved.    A paradoxical situation is taking shape in which Russia's  excessive striving for leadership and the related arrogance  discredits the Collective Security Treaty and turns it into  fiction, although Russia itself is one of its most active  proponents.    Against this background, mutually advantageous bilateral  military cooperation between countries of the CIS may be much  more productive and intensive than within the framework of a  collective treaty. There are no contradictions here. First,  potential customers and real producers can do away with the  services of the great go-between in relations between one other.  For example, systems of weapons manufactured in Kazakhstan may  be sent directly to Ukrainian depots, bypassing the  "book-keeping" of Russian military-industrial structures, and so  on. This itself promises considerable savings of funds.  Second, bilateral cooperation will raise the potential of every  state manifold. For example, not a single one of them, including  Russia, is capable of maintaining such a facility as Baykonur on  its own. However, this particular space-vehicle launching site  may be efficiently used and serviced with the help of joint bi-  or multilateral space-missile programs. Third, the system of  relations on the bilateral basis rules out the creation of  military alliances and, as a result, the very possibility of  confrontation. In our specific case, a step has been made  toward a kind of "partnership for peace" on the territory of the  former USSR. Finally, fourth, the more actively the states use  one another's industrial base, the less dependent they will be  upon the former center. However, strange this might sound, this  will be a guarantee of the irreversibility of democratic  transformations in Russia itself. The sooner Russia rids itself  of the illusions on the "spheres of influence," the sooner it  will emerge at the level of normal partnership relations with  other CIS countries, which, incidentally, at present, only  demand equality and respect for themselves.    The recent visit by Ukraine's military delegation to Almaty  and Tashkent is one of the first signs of the fundamentally new  approach toward mutually advantageous cooperation between  Ukraine and CIS countries. However, as is known, spring  inevitably follows the arrival of the first swallow....</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Tough talk is not enough Prison works, says the home secretary. Does it? Consider the 47,000 convicted offenders he keeps behind bars. Many are inadequate, or institutionalised. Too many suffer from mental abnormality and drug and alcohol dependence. Many are simply dangerous. Some are evil, and need to be kept out of society for a very long time. This characterisation is not mine. I have lifted it, word for word, from the speech delivered by Mr Michael Howard to the prison service on Wednesday. We can agree on the dangerous and violent convicts he accommodates at an average cost to taxpayers of some Pounds 22,000 a year, each. You will get no liberal whining about that lot from me. Bang 'em up and lose the keys. What of the rest - the majority of time-servers? Mr Howard says that crime is reduced by incarcerating them. He gives two reasons. Criminals cannot be housebreaking or car-smashing or whatever while locked in. When outside, they are deterred by the knowledge that offending leads to jail. Anyhow, nobody knows how to prevent crime. The home secretary can only ensure that the courts, the police and the prison service function effectively. This is disingenuous, silky barrister-talk. Inadequates, the institutionalised, the mentally abnormal, and drug or drink dependents are society's failures. Not all of them are, as the Victorians might have insisted, Satan's children. Very few of us are inherently wicked. There has to be a correlation between the number of social failures and the rate of unemployment, the availability of affordable housing, and the effectiveness of education. Perhaps television violence plays its part. Governments, if not home secretaries, can do something in each of these areas. They can also watch their mouths. Politicians cannot inculcate moral values, but the values they espouse do matter. Privateer capitalism is a wonderful mechanism, but it does not teach self-restraint, or discipline, or respect for the criminal law. It merely asks that the lower classes be born with such qualities. This is not to condone crime. Mr Howard's hopeless cases have doubtless been imprisoned for sound reasons, but he should know that they will be more likely to offend when released. There will be more victims, not fewer. As to deterrence, certainty of capture is the key. If thieves do not believe that they will be caught, sentences of 100 years plus life will not deter them. Habitual criminals, who may be rounded up after a spate of burglaries in a particular area, may regard their chances of getting away with it as too low for comfort. In such cases, putting them in jail may be a cost-effective means of reducing crime, as some evidence suggests. Whatever its value, prison alone is not the answer. The numbers tell the story. Criminal statistics are notoriously unreliable, but the official ones are all we have. We must do our best with them. According to the British crime survey, published by the Home Office on Wednesday, some 15m offences were committed against individuals and their property in 1991. That is an increase of 36 per cent over the 1981 estimate. About a third of these were recorded in police incident books. The police 'clear up' about 26 per cent of the crimes they record. The proportion of crimes resulting in conviction, the BCS notes, is about 3 per cent. We know that only a fraction of those end in imprisonment. Seen in this perspective, Mr Howard's plan to build six new prisons aims a thimbleful of water at a prairie fire. If the new jails are, like the old, universities of crime, it might even be a thimbleful of petrol. Very well, you say, what should he do? First, he can make the police more efficient. Yesterday's report from the Audit Commission suggests ways of using police time more effectively. The government may accept these recommendations. The rest of us will wonder what the law 'n' order Tories have been doing about police management during the past 14 years. Mr Howard's celebrated '27 points', announced at the recent Conservative party conference, are, he says, designed to facilitate the detection of crime and the conviction of the guilty. Some of the latter will be sent down. That is why he is building more prisons. Disingenuity is this chap's art form. Next, the home secretary can focus on crime prevention. The Audit Commission says that the police cannot be held responsible if cars are manufactured with poor security, or if individuals do not do all that can reasonably be expected of them to protect their own property. Oh yes? It was just this point that landed Lord Woolf in such trouble when he criticised the home secretary's approach a few weeks ago. Yet here is the Audit Commission saying the same thing, only leaving out the Woolf slip-up, which was to suggest fines for people who failed to protect their property. And over here is the BCS report, which tells us that 'the technology exists to make cars much harder to break into, and much harder to drive away', and that 'there is also room for encouraging builders to 'design out' opportunities for crime'. It floats the notion of discounts on insurance for houses that are properly burglar-proofed. If he works on these themes, Mr Howard will be tackling half the recorded crime at one go. He says that the government is spending Pounds 200m a year on crime prevention, which he supports. Silly us. We had not realised that he has been stressing a strategy of prevention. As to violence, most assaults are caused by drunkenness. The British yobbo is the product of the demon drink. Mr Howard might invite his predecessor, now chancellor, to raise the price of alcohol. Tax differentials could be used to encourage the sales of low-alchohol beers and wines. Domestic violence, or the dreadful random murders we read about are tragedies that no minister can prevent. The real question that should be asked of the home secretary is, does he think talking tough works for him? It went down a treat at the Tory conference, but thinking voters prefer the 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime' approach of Labour's shadow home secretary, Mr Tony Blair. Mr Howard may feel that his policies add up to the same thing, but he has a long way to go to convince the rest of us. He has an intellectual argument to win. His career depends on it.</p>

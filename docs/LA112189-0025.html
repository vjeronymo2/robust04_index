			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL '89-90;  </P> <P> AFTER LOOK IN MIRROR, BRUIN BAD BOY WILSON TRIES TO CHANGE IMAGE  </P> <P> The rhythmic, taunting chant begins almost as soon as Trevor Wilson steps onto  the basketball court. It grows louder each time the UCLA forward commits a  foul, stares down an opponent, fires off a missive at an official.  </P> <P> Treeeeeh-vor. Treeeeeh-vor.  </P> <P> Wilson views it as a badge of honor, verifying his status as the most vilified  player on what may still be the most vilified team in the Pacific 10  Conference.  </P> <P> "I think it's great," he said. "It's a sign of respect because they're picking  you out, keying on you because they think if they can get you off your game,  they have a better chance of winning."  </P> <P> For a long time, it didn't take much to distract Wilson.  </P> <P> He was a powder keg, waiting to explode, and the slightest provocation threw  him into a rage.  </P> <P> His mood swings, in fact, were so pronounced that Coach Jim Harrick, who  arrived in Westwood in the spring of 1988, suggested strongly that Wilson meet  with a sports psychologist, Dr. William Parham, who works regularly with  several UCLA athletes.  </P> <P> Harrick, in fact, made it a weekly requirement for Wilson.  </P> <P> "Trevor had a lot of energy that he sometimes was using in the wrong  direction," Harrick said. "He's very highly spirited, which I like, but it's  got to be channeled in a proper direction."  </P> <P> Except for a flare-up at the end of a game against USC, when Trojan Calvin  Banks found himself embraced in a headlock by the Bruin forward, Wilson was on  his best behavior last season, funneling his efforts into his play, which at  times was spectacular.  </P> <P> In earning all-conference recognition for the second consecutive season, he  averaged 18.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, scoring a career-high 32 points against  Boston University and equaling a career-best by pulling down 15 rebounds  against Washington.  </P> <P> Quick, agile and strong -- former teammate Pooh Richardson called him Rock  because of his chiseled physique -- the 6-foot-8, 211-pound Wilson was as  tenacious in pursuing excellence as he once was in chasing down officials.  </P> <P> An unsavory image is hard to shake, but Wilson, believing he owed it to  himself, gave it a shot.  </P> <P> "After my sophomore year, I just wasn't happy with my image on the court," said  Wilson, who is expected to provide senior leadership this season for a young  but talented Bruin team that is made up primarily of freshmen and sophomores.  "And then when Coach Harrick came in, he talked to me about improving it."  </P> <P> His image, Wilson believed, was that of a villain.  </P> <P> It was cemented in the minds of some during a summer league game at Cal State  Los Angeles in 1988, when Wilson raged out of control and refused to leave the  gym after being ejected.  </P> <P> When an official called a forfeit, Wilson reportedly followed him outside,  where he continued to berate him and, according to a police report of the  incident, left two scratches on his car.  </P> <P> It was speculated last season that the incident made Wilson realize that his  fuse was short and that he might not be able to control his temper without  help.  </P> <P> Wilson, though, said that he suspected long before then that he needed to  control his temper.  </P> <P> "It was a gradual realization," he said. "There were times when I'd pull up and  say, ' . . . I've got to stop doing this.' (But) a few months later, I'd do it  again.  </P> <P> "It's not like it was an everyday thing, but it happened often enough that it  got to the point where I had to make a conscious effort to stop it."  </P> <P> Of his time with Parham, Wilson said: "It gives you someone to talk to. You can  say whatever you want about anybody you want.  </P> <P> "He deals with how to improve you as a player. Part of that is working on your  confidence, working on your self-respect."  </P> <P> The sessions, Wilson said, have helped him to mature.  </P> <P> "I feel good about myself now and, to me, that's the only thing that really  matters," he said. "If I feel good about myself, I know that I'm doing  something right. Beforehand, I knew deep down that what I was doing was wrong."  </P> <P> Wilson regrets tangling with Banks last season.  </P> <P> "But no one's perfect," he said. "And by no means do I consider myself perfect.  I do consider last season successful in terms of controlling my emotions.  </P> <P> "That one incident was one too many, but basketball is a game of emotions and  sometimes you can't control them."  </P> <P> Magic Johnson showed that this month when he fought with Kevin Johnson of the  Phoenix Suns, Harrick said.  </P> <P> "I'm not certain that a leader isn't going to lose his poise every once in a  while," the coach added.  </P> <P> Leadership is among the many attributes Harrick expects this season from  Wilson, whose potential is such that Harrick told him last summer: "I've never  had a guy so gifted who needed to work on so many things."  </P> <P> Foremost among them is Wilson's concentration, which tends to lapse, Harrick  said, when he's playing defense.  </P> <P> "When he puts his mind to it, our guys really have a hard time scoring against  him in practice," Harrick said.  </P> <P> Wilson believes that he'll be a more dangerous scorer this season, but that it  might not be reflected in his statistics because the Bruins are deeper and more  talented with the addition of a highly regarded group of freshmen.  </P> <P> Wilson's goals are to provide the Bruins with more assists and steals and to be  more aggressive on defense "on a consistent basis."  </P> <P> Expecting a challenge from freshmen Tracy Murray and Zan Mason, Wilson embarked  on the season with a more positive attitude and has been the Bruins' most  diligent worker, Harrick said.  </P> <P> "The hardest worker we've had every day, no question," Harrick said. "He's been  hammered and pushed around and he's taken the challenge to try to stop Murray  from scoring and he's taken the challenge to fight off Mason, who's kind of a  bulldog."  </P> <P> And he's done it without a lot of fuss, his teammates say.  </P> <P> "He's a lot more mellow," said Kevin Walker, a senior who has clashed with  Wilson in other seasons. "He doesn't get upset as easily. He doesn't let little  things affect him. He's basically just going out and playing and not letting  anything bother him.  </P> <P> "Before, he'd get upset and you'd lose him for a few minutes before he cooled  down."  </P> <P> Harrick has been a major influence, said sophomore Don MacLean, who has known  Wilson for almost 10 years and considers him a close friend.  </P> <P> "Coach Harrick's not going to put up with Trevor throwing the ball up into the  bleachers during practice, or cussing everybody out," MacLean said. "I think  Trevor realized that if he wanted to be part of the team, he'd better shape up  or he'd have to ship out."  </P> <P> Wilson, of course, is aware that one false move could greatly affect his  future.  </P> <P> "He knows a lot of money is on the line," MacLean said. "People are coming to  practice -- a lot of pro scouts -- and I think he realized that he's got to  keep a level head so these guys can see that he's really mellowed out."  </P> <P> Wilson believes strongly that he'll be a first-round NBA draft choice "as long  as I keep myself under control mentally and just show my talent and show what  I'm capable of doing."  </P> <P> Game films, he said, have helped him hone his abilities.  </P> <P> "That's the best way to critique yourself," he said. "You may think you're  doing something correct, but seeing yourself on film is the only way to (detect  flaws)."  </P> <P> Watching film also persuaded Wilson to clean up his act.  </P> <P> "I would look at tapes where I would blow up and (see) how I looked in other  people's eyes, and I didn't like it," he said.  </P> <P> Those who watch Wilson this season will like what they see, Harrick said.  </P> <P> "You'll see a new Trevor Wilson -- one who's really dedicated to making himself  a complete player, a shut-down defender, a guy who will play hard all the time  and let his play do the talking."  </P> <P> And will let opposing fans do the taunting and woofing.  </P></p>

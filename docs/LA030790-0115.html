			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> JUDGE HALTS BUILDING FOR CITY PLAN UPDATE  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge on Tuesday blocked the city from issuing  any building permits for residential development until officials update Seal  Beach's general plan, a blueprint for commercial and residential development.  </P> <P> State law mandates that general plans be updated every five years, but Seal  Beach's plan has not been revised since 1982. Seal Beach officials expect to  approve a revised general plan by late April.  </P> <P> The court's decision represents a partial ruling in a December, 1989, lawsuit  in which the Wetlands Restoration Society sought to block a development that  the group claims will destroy 105 acres of wetlands in northwest Seal Beach.  </P> <P> The society is also asking the court to invalidate a land-use permit that the  city granted for the 329-unit residential project proposed by Mola Development  Corp. As part of this development planned for the old Hellman Ranch property,  Mola would restore about 40 acres of wetlands.  </P> <P> The judge is expected to rule on the land-use permit later this week, society  attorney Jonathan Lehrer-Graiwer said.  </P> <P> Seal Beach City Manager Bob Nelson said officials don't know how to interpret  Tuesday's verbal order by the judge.  </P> <P> "We're disappointed with the decision, of course," Nelson said. "We don't know  what kind of permits this will affect or if it applies to remodeling. . . .  We're still waiting for an explanation from our lawyers."  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Carol Lynch said city officials hope the ruling will apply  only to new development.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine that the court would prevent us from approving remodeling,"  she said. "If someone wants to put a new bathtub in, we should be able to  approve that."  </P> <P> If the court rules that Mola's permit is invalid, the company would have to  resubmit its project for City Council approval.  </P> <P> "I think sooner or later, this development will be approved," said District 3  Councilwoman Joyce Risner. "It's just updating that housing element. What I  hope for is that everything will be determined valid. We've gone through so  much on this."  </P> <P> But society vice president Galen Ambrose believes there is a chance that the  council will block the development if it is reconsidered.  </P> <P> "If they don't try to rush this through before the citizens get a chance to  elect a new council (March 27), there's a chance that the next council will  vote differently," said Ambrose, who is running for City Council in District 3.  </P> <P> Ambrose added that if the court rules that Mola's development agreement with  the city is valid, the society will appeal that decision.

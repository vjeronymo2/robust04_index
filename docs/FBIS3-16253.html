			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-Pil by </F> Sergey Turchenko: "DPRK Getting In Someone's Way"]    [Text] As we have already reported, the United States has  been bringing heavy pressure to bear on the DPRK of late and  there have even been threats to use military force. This time  the "world gendarme" has opted for "concern" over the alleged  nuclear threat from North Korea as the reason for attacking an  independent socialist state. The DPRK has taken a firm and  resolute stance.    Recently there was a meeting between DPRK and U.S.  delegations at which this question was discussed. What was its  outcome? We put this question to North Korean Ambassador to  Russia Comrade Son Song-pil.    [Son] We were able to elaborate an accord on four points:  the cessation of the "Team Spirit-94" military exercises near  the Korean border; the start of International Atomic Energy  Authority inspections at our facilities; the resumption of the  meeting of representatives from North and South on questions of  exchanging special envoys; and the holding of a third round of  Korean-American talks in Geneva, starting on 21 March 1994.    By and large we are satisfied with these decisions. But  there was a strongly negative reaction to them on the part of  Japan and South Korea. They are attempting to wreck the  negotiating process.    [Turchenko] What are the reasons for this approach?    [Son] Japan already has stocks of 26 tonnes of plutonium.  By 2010 they are forecast to reach 100 tonnes. This is enough  to make 10,000 nuclear bombs. In February Japan launched a  large long-range missile, the "H-2," which could be used to  deliver a nuclear weapon. A similar situation exists in South  Korea. It started developing nuclear weapons back in the  seventies, and it has now entered a very significant stage.  Both these countries need to be constantly grumbling about the  imaginary nuclear problem in the DPRK in order to be able to  continue their own developments.    [Turchenko] In connection with the Korean-American talks  there was a report on Russian television to the effect that the  DPRK had allegedly somewhat relaxed its resolve to steadfastly  follow the path of building socialism, and a statement by the  supreme leadership on a switch to Chinese-style reforms was  supposedly expected in the very near future. What comment can  you make on this?    [Son] It is sheer disinformation. We have established and  will develop our own style of socialist system.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Watchdog seeks rule on stock options US COMPANIES will have to disclose the value of options granted to executives and deduct them from profits under an accounting rule change proposed yesterday by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). However, FASB, a private sector group which sets standards for the accounting industry, tried to placate institutional investors, who have argued in favour of the changes, and companies who have opposed them, by proposing a three-year interim measure. The full force of the proposal would not take effect until 1997. Stocks options can bloat an executive's salary. In 1992, Blockbuster Entertainment's chief executive had Dollars 65.7m (Pounds 43m) in stock option gains, the head of Toys 'R' Us received Dollars 30.5m from stock options and Chrysler's Mr Lee Iacocca reaped profits of Dollars 5.8m in stock options. Under the plan, grants of stock options would be listed in a table in the footnotes of financial statements for three years after the accounting change is approved. Thereafter, stock options would be recognised as an expense on the day the options are granted, but the expense would be spread over the entire vesting period. The stock would be valued using an options pricing model that would take company growth and the stock's volatility into account. FASB has been under pressure to change the rules governing stock options since 1991, when Michigan senator Mr Carl Levin introduced a bill that would require stock options to be valued and charged against earnings. Senator Levin recently reintroduced the bill to force an accounting charge if a FASB rule is not adopted soon. While institutional shareholder groups have supported the proposed accounting change, some corporations have opposed it. Treasury secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen wrote to FASB voicing his reservations about the proposal 'which would require companies to take a highly debatable charge to earnings when granting stock options'. Mr Bentsen has called for an alternative that would stress full disclosure without changing accounting rules. The FASB proposal comes at a time of increasingly tough rules governing disclosure of executive pay.</p>

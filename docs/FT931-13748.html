			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Major rejects independent role for Bank of England THE new governor of the Bank of England is to be told by Mr John Major that he has rejected calls to reinforce the government's anti-inflation strategy by granting the Bank independence. Mr Major has already decided who to appoint and will make an announcement in the next two weeks. An official said that one of the leading candidates, Sir David Scholey, chairman of SG Warburg, had been ruled out. That decision appears to leave Mr Eddie George, deputy governor, as the front-runner to replace the current governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Another possible candidate is Sir David Walker, deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank. The new governor will take the post on the understanding that there is no question in the foreseeable future of the Treasury ceding control of monetary policy. Downing Street refused last night to comment on when the new appointee will be named. The most likely date is after Mr Major returns at the end of next week from a trip to India. The decision to rule out independence for the Bank will disappoint those in the City and at Westminster who saw it as a mechanism to underpin anti-inflation policy following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major has said there is no prospect of Britain rejoining the ERM this year and that even in the medium term it may prove difficult to relink sterling to the D-Mark. The commitment in the Maastricht treaty to an independent bank would apply only if sterling became part of a single currency. The prime minister has decided that the political sensitivities of interest rate changes are too great to transfer responsibility to a body not directly accountable to the House of Commons. Some ministers and Conservative MPs support the idea of giving the Bank statutory authority over monetary policy. But Mr Major's judgment is that such a transfer would provoke a serious Tory backbench rebellion. The prime minister has told senior colleagues he does sympathise with the arguments for the transfer from the Treasury of day-to-day management of monetary policy. Mr Major was chief secretary to the Treasury when Mr Nigel Lawson, chancellor at the time, proposed such a move four years ago. But the political realities of a 21-seat majority, of the recent uproar in the Tory party over the Maastricht treaty and of the disquiet at Westminster over economic recovery, point strongly in the opposite direction. The government believes that comparisons with other European countries miss the fact that the high level of home ownership in Britain makes changes in interest rates far more sensitive.

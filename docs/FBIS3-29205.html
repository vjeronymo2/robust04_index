			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been revealed that the United States has  indicated to Japan that it intends to partially withdraw its  proposed plan to lower tariffs on electronic equipment as agreed  last December at GATT's Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  talks on market access. The United States apparently plans to  put pressure on Japan because Japan has rejected U.S. demands to  abolish or reduce tariffs on forest products and other items.  The Japanese Government has raised objections, charging that  "the United States is breaking its promises."    The Uruguay Round of trade talks came to a successful  conclusion on 15 December 1993 when GATT member nations agreed  on abolishing or reducing tariffs. Since then, the United  States has demanded that Japan further reduce or abolish tariffs  on such items as forest products and nonferrous metal products.  Japan, however, has rejected such demands, asserting that  agreements have already been reached. During trade negotiations  at the Uruguay Round talks, Japan had staunchly demanded that  tariffs on electronic equipment be abolished. In this  connection, the U.S. plan to withdraw its proposed tariff cuts  could be considered a retaliatory move against Japan.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> 'Ghetto' Named London's Best Play: Israeli playwright Joshua Sobol's Holocaust  drama "Ghetto" has been named London's best play of 1989 in the prestigious  Evening Standard Drama Awards, presented annually by that London newspaper.  "Ghetto," set in a Lithuanian ghetto in 1942, opened at London's  state-subsidized Royal National Theater April 27 to near-unanimous raves and  ran in repertory through Nov. 9. It played the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles  in 1986 to mixed reviews before flopping on Broadway, closing after 33  performances. Nicholas Hytner, the Englishman who staged "Ghetto" in London,  was named the year's best director for both "Ghetto" and the recently opened  hit musical "Miss Saigon." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

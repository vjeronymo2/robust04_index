			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / People: Deaner dives out of MSR chair Martyn Deaner, 49, the entrepreneur at the centre of one of the North Sea's more spectacular financial disasters, has resigned as chairman of Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, the loss-making company operating the Emerald oilfield off the Scottish coast. He is the biggest individual shareholder in MSR which was the stock market's top performing share in 1989 when its shares nudged 200p. They are now standing at 2 1/4 p. The company says Deaner 'felt his resignation was appropriate in the light of claims for repayment made against him by lenders from whom he has borrowed or guaranteed in support of his investment in Midland &amp; Scottish Resources'. Deaner, a former diver, was appointed chairman in May 1989 shortly after his private company came to the stock market through a reverse takeover of Jebsens Drilling, a loss-making offshore drilling company. His aim was to create a business providing low-cost development systems for small oilfields that might otherwise remain unexploited. The idea was that MSR would use the money it earned from operating its first project, the Emerald Field, to help pay for its floating production system which could then be re-used as cheap production facilities for other small oilfields. A year after Deaner took over as chairman, MSR launched a Pounds 149m rights issue. However, the Emerald field project ran into financial problems because of production delays, cost over-runs and the fact that there was less oil than first thought. This compounded MSR's problems since it owned a big chunk of the field. Over the past three years MSR has made pre-tax losses of Pounds 191m. Jack Birks, 74, who retired as a managing director of BP in 1982, has taken over as chairman. MSR says that Deaner's resignation will not affect the day-to-day management of the company and his services will continue to be available on a consultancy basis.</p>

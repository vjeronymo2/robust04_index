			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Annuities, a big gap between best and worst - The myriad market choices for those who are approaching retirement age BUYING AN annuity at retirement is the biggest investment most people ever make. But few insurance companies offer a complete range of products and few advisers know enough about the more technical options to provide a comprehensive service. An annuity is a regular income for life, secured by paying a lump sum to an insurance company. Once the annuity has been bought it cannot be changed and, in most cases, the capital invested is lost when the annuitant dies. By law, most of the proceeds of money purchase pensions must be used to buy a 'compulsory purchase' annuity. A money purchase pension is one where contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement, unlike pensions based on final salary. Personal pensions, executive pension plans, free-standing additional voluntary contributions and contracted-out money purchase schemes are all examples of money purchase pensions. The first step towards choosing the right annuity is to make use of the 'open market option.' This allows you to take the proceeds of your pension fund away from the plan provider and buy your annuity elsewhere. The top names in personal pension plans are quite different from the top names in the annuity market so, in most cases, it makes sense to shop around. Annuities can be sold only by life offices because they alone have the size to cope with a large spread of risk. If your pension plan is provided by any other sort of financial institution - say, a unit trust group - then you have no choice but to use the open market option. This can improve the income provided by your annuity by up to 25 per cent - the difference at present between the best and worst rates on offer. But some life offices penalise policyholders who use the option, while others pay a 'loyalty bonus' to those who stay put (which amounts to the same thing). Either way, the differential must be considered when weighing-up the benefits of the better rates available under the option. The annuity sold most commonly provides a fixed or level income for life. Its popularity is mainly because it provides the highest income at the start, compared with other options. Clearly, however, the 'real' value of the income plummets once inflation takes its toll. Early retirement - whether voluntary or enforced - combined with increased longevity increases this problem. In recent years, the choice of annuities has increased. Mitchell Philpott, account director of annuity specialist Norex Pensions Communications, says: 'An annuity may be structured to provide a fixed rate of escalation, commonly 3 per cent or 5 per cent per annum, or increases may be linked to the retail price index (RPI). Each type of annuity obviously carries a cost in terms of a loss of income in the early years to compensate for increasing income in the later years. 'What is important is that each individual must strike a balance between their need to safeguard their income against inflation, their need for immediate spending power and perhaps, most important, their expectation of life.' A limited form of inflation-proofing now applies to preserved pensions that are left behind in a company scheme when an employee changes jobs. The same provision for inflation-linking will be extended soon to company pensions being paid. In this light, it seems odd that a similar facility is not included automatically with annuities. But the reason why few '5 per cent escalating annuities' are sold can be seen in Table 1. The initial income is about 30 per cent less than available with the level annuity, and the break-even point does not occur for 14 years. The average life expectancy for the 65-year-old male used in the example is 13 years so, clearly, the life offices are not giving anything away here. But for those who live longer, the 5 per cent escalating annuity provides a much better deal after year 14. With the future rate of inflation uncertain, there is a strong argument for an annuity that increases in line with retail prices. In the past, this has proved to be more expensive than 5 per cent escalation but, at today's rates, there is little difference between the two in terms of the initial income. Only a handful of insurance companies offer RPI-linked annuities. These include Standard Life, Eagle Star, Prudential, Sun Life and Sun Alliance. Table 2 shows how the RPI and 5 per cent escalating annuities would have compared over the past 20 years although, obviously, future inflation could be constrained by sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). But, given the long-term nature of an annuity, the RPI link does provide additional insurance against high inflation when retirement is taken early and is expected to span two decades. There are other types of annuity that can provide a hedge against inflation by securing growth through a unit-linked or with-profits fund. The with-profits annuity is a complex product and is offered only by Equitable Life and Prudential. (Provident Mutual offers a with-profits annuity but, generally, this is cost-effective for, and available only to, existing policyholders). Under a with-profits annuity, people get a fairly low guaranteed income plus annual bonuses from the with-profits fund. To lift the initial income, it is possible to set an anticipated rate of bonus. Where the actual declared bonus rate is lower, the income will fall, and vice-versa. Table 3 illustrates the difference between a with-profits and level annuity where the anticipated bonus is 5 per cent and the actual declared bonus is 8.5 per cent. To assume a bonus rate higher than 5 per cent would be taking a risk in the present environment and could lead to a falling annual income. Unit-linked annuities are offered by just a handful of providers including M&amp;G, Equitable Life and Commercial Union. Under this system, the value of the annual income reflects the unit value of the underlying fund and, as such, can fluctuate considerably. As a long-term investment, the unit-linked route can provide an element of capital growth unobtainable with a level or escalating annuity but, for most people, this option should be considered only where there are other sources of retirement income to meet regular bills and spending. Initial income under the unit-linked annuity is likely to be worth about 50 per cent of the level annuity. Some providers allow clients to boost this by incorporating an element of anticipated capital growth. The danger here is that if the underlying fund fails to achieve the predicted growth assumptions, then the annual income derived from the annuity will fall sharply. Finally, depending on the type of pension arrangements used to yield the retirement fund, it might be possible to opt for phased retirement. For example, under a personal pension - and, from this year, a buy-out bond (used to take transfer values from company pension schemes) - it is possible to cash-in part of the plan to provide an annuity at, say, 60 and to leave the rest to appreciate in value until age 70 or even 75. This option could appeal to the increasing numbers of employees who take early retirement and continue to work part-time.

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: On the one hand City headhunters take note. Officials at Lehman Brothers have dispensed with the highly-priced services of the middle man and are letting their own fingers do the walking. The investment bank has recently lost its chief international economist to the Institute for Public Policy Research and its UK economist to ITN.

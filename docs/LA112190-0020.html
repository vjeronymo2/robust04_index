			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SWEET STAYING WITH DECISION TO PLAY BASKETBALL AT ARIZONA  </P> <P> The announcement last week that North Hollywood High basketball standout  Jacinda Sweet had signed a letter of intent with Arizona was supposed to end  the phone calls.  </P> <P> It did, but only from coaches.  </P> <P> Ever since, North Hollywood Coach Rich Allen has been inundated with calls from  newspapers, network television and cable sports programs. They all ask the same  question: Why did Sweet, who is black, decide to attend Arizona in light of the  controversy over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday?  </P> <P> Sweet said this week that she had based her decision solely on the strength of  the Wildcat program.  </P> <P> "I liked it from the start," she said. "I won't change my mind because of that  (holiday issue)."  </P> <P> Allen said last week that Sweet expressed concern over the results of the  state's recent election in which voters rejected a ballot initiative that would  have created a paid holiday on King's birthday. Some believed that the outcome  was a reflection of the state's position on the issue of race. Sweet decided to  see for herself.  </P> <P> "Nothing like that's going to stop me," she said. "It's none of anybody else's  business -- they don't have to live there for four years."  </P> <P> Allen said Sweet told him that had she decided not to sign with the school she  believed that she would be running away from the problem. And since she is  black, she felt strongly that she should address the situation head-on, Allen  said.  </P> <P> "I'll just have to see for myself," Sweet said.  </P></p>

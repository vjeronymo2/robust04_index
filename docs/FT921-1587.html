			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / France delivers stern message to Mitterrand: The president and his party will struggle to recover from the regional poll results THE MASSIVE popular rejection of the French Socialist Party in Sunday's regional elections is a critical turning point in the presidency of Mr Francois Mitterrand. It has finally destroyed the credibility of the government of Mrs Edith Cresson; it has delivered a deeply damaging blow to the prospects of the Socialist Party in next year's general elections; and it has, as a result, inflicted a wound on the president himself from which he may not recover. Cumulatively, these problems may prove insuperable for the president and his party. No-one in France would make the historic mistake of under-estimating President Mitterrand's enormous powers of manoeuvre and survival. Yet there is a palpable sense that France is entering the stormy waters of the end of a regime, which may test his powers to breaking point and beyond. 'These elections,' wrote Mr Serge July in yesterday's Liberation, 'mark without doubt the end of the Mitterrand years.' His most immediate problem is the credibility of the government. Faced with the disavowal of more than 40 per cent of the Socialist Party's voters, compared with the last general election of 1988, President Mitterrand is bound to search around for some way of reversing the tide. A common assumption is that he will dismiss Mrs Cresson, whose record-breaking unpopularity must surely bear some of the responsibility for the poor showing of the socialists in Sunday's vote, and replace her with a more popular figure. There is only one problem: it is not clear that there is any alternative candidate who could restore the Socialist Party to public esteem. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is repeatedly cited as by far the brightest star in the socialist firmament; but he owes his considerable popularity, at least as much to his distance from the discredit contaminating the rest of the Socialist Party in France, as to the international glamour of his role in Brussels. In any case, it is hard to see how he could usefully answer a call of duty from France's Socialist president, without at the same time throwing away his European reputation. He owes a duty to all 12 governments; and his immediate priorities are the follow-up to the Maastricht treaty and the preparation of a Community policy towards the new candidates for membership. If he were to leave Brussels early, he must surely give several months' notice; but by then, he might have too little time to win back public opinion to the Socialist Party. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the heavyweight finance minister, is manifestly only too ready to offer his services as a replacement prime minister, and no doubt he would be a safe pair of hands. Since he also represents the personal guarantee of France's commitment to the hard franc and a consistent anti-inflation policy, no doubt his appointment would be welcomed by the international bankers. The trouble is that the international bankers already approve of French economic policy; what Mr Beregovoy lacks is the kind of charisma which would be likely to excite ordinary French voters. It is possible, therefore, that President Mitterrand may simply turn a deaf ear to the clamour for a new government, and instead decide to soldier on with Mrs Cresson. But even then, he would need a strategy for avoiding a catastrophic defeat in the general elections just over a year from now. It turns out that Sunday's regional vote significantly overstates the degree of popular disaffection with the Socialist Party; a poll conducted outside the voting booths indicated that 22 per cent would vote socialist in a general election. Yet even that figure would imply a landslide for the conservatives, with 410 seats to the Socialists' 100-110. But the main significance of Sunday's regional election was the operation of proportional voting rules, which made possible the rise of the extreme right-wing National Front and the two ecologist movements, at the expense of all the traditional parties of government. The Socialists took a hammering, but the conservative vote also suffered serious erosion. Inevitably, Sunday's vote has set up a renewed clamour of controversy over the repercussions of proportional representation. The conservatives have denounced PR as an iniquitous system, partly because they believe it robbed them of votes on Sunday, but mainly because they fear President Mitterrand will reintroduce it for general elections, to rob them of votes next year. Indeed, it is a fact that President Mitterrand has indicated a clear inclination to move towards PR; but he has not said how far he wants to move. Recent simulations suggest that only a fully proportional system would prevent a conservative majority: they would get the most seats in parliament, but critically short of an absolute majority. Some people assume, therefore, that President Mitterrand will be determined to go for full PR. This could lead to serious conflict with leaders of the Socialist Party, however. They say that they favour an element of PR, as a gesture to potential allies in minority parties, like the ecologists; but they are resisting full proportional representation, for fear that it should look too much like bare-faced electoral engineering. Sunday's popular rejection of the traditional parties of government no doubt contained some element of gratuitous ill-temper. The voters knew they could afford to express their general discontent, because their vote would not automatically have specific policy consequences. But it is hard to deny the two most obvious lessons of the poll: after 12 years in power, the Socialists have probably out-stayed their welcome; and as the alternative party of government, the conservatives arouse very little enthusiasm indeed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Republic of Kazakhstan Minister of Finance </F> Yerkeshbay Derbisov: "Where Will We Get the Money!?"]    [Text] Today, whatever the sector, crisis is  paramount. [There is] inflation, a payments crisis... Various  systemic changes are being made in connection with a transition  to a market economy. For everything finances are needed.  Government continues to expand. What do we do in such  circumstances?    World experience has proven that the four props upon which a  market economy rests are holding companies, trust companies,  financial and industrial groups, and transnational corporations.  However, no attention has been given to the organization and  efficient operation of structures such as these [in Kazakhstan].  Fulfillment of the president's edict: "On Refinement of the  System of Organs Managing the Economy" continues to be put off.    Up to now, the system of Republic state control organs has  been changed several times. At present 32 ministries and  committees, 10 chief administrations, and various agents and  authorities are included among Republic administrative organs.  The high number of those working in the central apparatus of  these organizations has exceeded 6,526. Just when it was  announced that we will have to strictly regulate the number of  such workers, this figure was increased by 12.6 percent, or by  780 persons during the period of January through September 1993.  Within this, the Ministry of Defense has grown by 200 persons,  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by 197, the Ministry of  Economics by 109, and the Ministry of Transport by 58. Some  ministries want to establish their own subordinate departments.  For example, the Ministry of Industry has asked that it  considerably increase the number of its employees in order to  establish departments for the mining and metallurgy sector and  for consumer goods. Giving ministries and authorities control  over their own structures and staffing has resulted in excessive  increases in the number of employees. Various departments have  proliferated in ministries using such power. The number of  managers managing them has increased. This is a matter of "one  person can herd sheep, but it takes a thousand to herd the soul."    There are 54 workers in the apparatus of the State Committee  on Youth Affairs. To manage these workers there is a  manager-in-chief, three deputies, and 14 administrative heads.  That means one manager for every two workers. Managing 91  workers in the Ministry of Tourism, Physical Culture, and Sports  are six deputy ministers, and 21 division and unit chiefs. The  Ministry for External Economic Relations is not far behind. Some  three to six persons work in their four administrations. They  manage one another and are their own deputies. At least 65,000  rubles salary is paid to the managers given in the examples.  Putting all of this together, we see how much money is flowing  out of the state purse.    Is the fact that state organ systems have grown so  inordinately of any benefit to their work? We cannot say that it  is. The excessive increase in staffs is creating problems with  retaining the needed employees. Competent and knowledgeable  cadres which leave due to shortages of funding are going over to  commerce. Wages there are two-three times higher than those paid  in the state sector. Can budget organizations, pressed by budget  shortfalls, retain them?    There is no doubt that to carry out fundamental economic  reform a very strong executive authority will be needed.  However, the conclusion should not be drawn from this that all  authority is to be collected in the hands of the central  authority. Reform is also going forward in local areas. We  should note in this connection the important role being played  by the law "On Local Self-Government and Republic of Kazakhstan  Local Kenges of People's Deputies." Authority must be divided in  an intelligent manner at every level. However, granting the  right to the local kenges of people's deputies to allocate funds  for paying the salaries and the expenses of state authority and  control organs financed by local budgets is making the  conservation of state funds impossible. The number of those  working in organs funded from local budgets was 32 percent  greater in 1993 in comparison to 1989, or 15,150 persons more.  That means a total of 46,787 workers. Accordingly, the number of  local kenges is growing. In 1992 some 405 of them were added to  a total of 16,543. Their staffs grew correspondingly. For  example, there are 23-26 employees [working] in the oblast  kenges of Aqtobe, Aqmola, western Kazakhstan, and Pavlodar  oblasts, and there are from 33-37 in the eastern Kazakhstan,  southern Kazakhstan, and Kokshetaw oblast kenges.    The number of employees of governors of oblasts and rayons  are similar. Whereas the number of employees in the Atyraw,  Zhambyl, and Qaraghandy oblast governments is between 54 and  149, the number is up to 80-83 in Aqmola, Aqtobe, and Semey  oblasts. At present the practice of appointing five-six deputies  per manager has become widespread. They are not distinct from  one other in function. For example, the governors of Moyynqum  Rayon in Zhambyl Oblast and of Aqzhayyq Rayon in western  Kazakhstan Oblast have five deputies each. Numbers of deputies  of the governors of Abay, Shortandy, Zhangatas, Qarataw, and  Zhanga Ozen rayons have reached four. Thereby, you cannot help  but wonder what is left for the governors to do with all of  these deputies?    There are considerable differences between the salaries of  these managers. In this area regulations regarding official  salaries set in Resolution Number 312-XII, ratified on 28 June  of 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakhstan SSR, are not  being observed at all. In the above resolution the right to  solve questions about salaries paid to workers of state  authority and administrative organs are granted to the president  of the Republic, to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and to  the Cabinet of Ministers. Unfortunately, every governor and  chief of a local kenges of people's deputies distorts the  meaning of article seven of the law: "On Local Self-Government"  and confuses what is meant by "wage funds" and "official  salaries." For that reason, the amount paid as wages has become  varied. Thus, the chairman of the rayon kenges of Zhelezinsk  Rayon in Pavlodar Oblast pays his legal advisor wages of 34,000  rubles instead of 28,500, and has established a wage for a  general division chief which is 15,500 rubles too high. Such  cases of excessive pay are also found in rayon and various  village kenges in Semey Oblast. If, however, such generosity  were to honor experienced and knowledgeable cadres and to keep  them on the job this would be fine indeed. Unfortunately,  encouragement of cadres and material incentives are not up to  the needs of the times.    The appearance of improprieties of this sort, during this  time of transition as we go over to a market economy, are not  easy to counter in the Republic budget. Such a sharp increase in  the number of persons working in government organs, if it  continues, may gives rise to considerable budget deficits. This  will have a chilling effect on the distribution of finances to  important sectors of industry and of the people's economy. The  financing which comes from the budget is not so great, but one  should add the cultural and arts sectors which are so needed for  the spiritual life of our people. Remember that, in a time when  prices rise, the daily wages and pensions of some groups are  barely adequate for food. In addition, what is going to be done  about training the cadres who are going to be the tomorrow of  industry and the people's economy, of the arts and sciences, and  who will be tomorrow's workers in the health field. When we take  all of this into consideration, we think it proper that the  Republic budget be carefully measured, that there be no waste,  that it embrace all sectors of our society, and that it be  expended for the most important plans and key objectives. For  this purpose, we must reduce to a single system the staff issue,  where growth today is excessive. To this end, we should, first  and foremost, combine ministries and committees performing  duplicate functions, reduce staffs and the numbers of officials,  and restructure. For example, there would be no loss if we were  to combine the Committee on Youth Affairs with the Ministry of  Tourism, Physical Culture, and Sports; the Ministry for Social  Protection with the Ministry of Labor; and the Ministry of Trade  with the Ministry of External Economic Relations. When this has  been done, their functions would be clearly defined and extra  workers could be discharged. I would make exactly the same  suggestion about the State Committee for Water Reserves and the  Chief Administration for Geodesics and Cartography. No harm  would be done if the first were abolished and a department  established under the Ministry of Agriculture, and if the second  were made an agency under the Ministry of Geology for the  protection of subterranean riches. The staff of the  "Qazaqstanenergo" Company could be reduced by up to half. At  present the strengthening of state control is a priority task.  The task is at present assigned to three similar organizations:  the Office of Control of the Supreme Kenges, the Chief Control  Inspectorate under the President, and the Committee for State  Financial Control under the Cabinet of Ministers. Not only does  the division of the higher control organs create a mutual lack  of coordination between them, but it results in wasted efforts.  For that reason, if we combine them and create a unified State  Control Committee, this would have enormous influence on  productive work with a single aim.    When the ministries and authorities have been reformed  through consolidation, it should become possible to reduce the  number of apparatus workers by up to 50 percent and the staffs  of local state authority and government administration by up to  20 percent. In addition, we must sharply limit and stop the  growth in the number of employees in the central apparatus. To  achieve this ministries and authorities must be prohibited from  expanding staffs on their own volition, and we should restore  [the numbers of] their workers to rates previously set by the  Cabinet of Ministers. At the same time, it would be suitable if  a suggestion were made to the Republic Supreme Kenges regarding  abolition of certain provisions of the law: "On Local Self  Government and Local Kenges of People's Deputies of the Republic  of Kazakhstan." In this connection we must review No. 888  Resolution on Wages ratified in 1992 by the Cabinet of  Ministers. Only if we do this will we be able to arrange  staffing and wages paid to employees into one system. In this  regard we should think a great deal about the amount of  salaries. At a time when our Republic is gradually entering a  social market economic system, there has been a general movement  of specialists from the state into the commercial structures.  The reason for this is the heaven and earth difference between  the salaries of employees for the state sector and those working  for commercial structures. Select cadres, suffering tightened  living circumstances, are forced to think of themselves.  However, without such specialists there is no way whatever that  the Republic state apparatus can solve very major social and  economic problems. Thus, we must take effective measures,  bearing in mind the experiences of countries such as the United  States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, where such workers  were early brought into a state system. In our view,  ratification of a law: "On State Service" by the present session  of the Supreme Kenges would halt the further departure of  specialists from the state apparatus and make it possible to  retain knowledgeable workers. The most important thing is that  the wages of cadres be appropriate to the quality of the jobs  they do. Furthermore, it would be proper to strongly encourage  their initiatives and to use workers according to their  capacities. In this regard, we must not forget the various kinds  of crime and corruption among managerial workers. The influence  of such managers on knowledgeable cadres, thought to know their  jobs very well, is considerable. If such things are allowed to  continue, they will bring about the destruction of the state  apparatus. Just such circumstances were found in the United  States at the end of the last century, in Britain in the 18th  century, and in South Korea in the 1950s of this century. The  experiences of several countries have shown that it is possible  to improve fundamentally the work of state administrative organs  in societies which have a cultural and historical inclination to  corruption. It is sufficient to mention, for example, the proper  reform of the work of tax offices in the Philippines. If we set  the situation to rights, not only refining the state  administrative system but strengthening its influence, the way  out to economic crisis will be easy. We need such resolute  actions these days.    The operations of organs controlling the new market economy  must be streamlined and their duties specified. There are major  tasks [which need performing] such as the following:  guaranteeing the security of the state and protecting the rights  of citizens; regulation in economic terms of the development of  the people's economy and formation of a state budge; creating  and financing investment and structure policies; cadre policy;  intergovernment agreements and carrying out relations with  international organizations. These control organizations must  work in close connection with local organs in areas such as  putting people to work, migration, antimonopoly policy, the tax  system, and control of state property. Only under circumstances  where such problems, brought forward by the times, have been  solved properly will we be able to stabilize the market and the  economy and carry out reform in a well-founded manner.</p>

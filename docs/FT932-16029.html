			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Wellcome attacks Aids study as share price falls A ROW erupted yesterday between the Medical Research Council and Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT, the Aids treatment, after the company attacked the council's decision to publish preliminary data about the medicine's effectiveness. Mr John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, said preliminary data from a trial published by the MRC last week were misleading. He attacked the publication of the information in the medical journal The Lancet before it had been reviewed by other leading specialists. Yesterday's attempt to reassure the market, which included briefings for city analysts, journalists and Aids activists, appeared to backfire as Wellcome's shares fell 23p to 698p. Since last Friday's announcement of the Anglo-French Concorde trial, which claimed that AZT, Wellcome's second best-selling drug, did not delay the onset of Aids in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients, the share price has fallen by 8 per cent. The MRC helped organise the trials. Wellcome told analysts and Aids pressure groups yesterday that further analysis from the trial would show AZT was effective. There was no question that the drug helped patients who developed Aids, it added. AZT had sales of Pounds 131m in the six months to February 1993. The company's claims were refuted by Professor Ian Weller, the Concorde trial's principal UK investigator, who said Wellcome was manipulating the data. Professor Richard Peto, adviser to the Concorde study's clinical trials unit, added: 'People should look at the numbers as presented by the investigators, not as presented by drug companies. If they do that, then it's clear these treatments are not of nearly as much value as originally hoped.' Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research and development, insisted AZT was effective in slowing the onset of Aids. He said there were five studies other than the Concorde trial involving more than 3,000 patients - some lasting two and a half years - that demonstrated death occurred half as often in asymptomatic patients using AZT. 'For the MRC to suggest AZT does not work on the basis of one study and then with only a few weeks of analysis - well I don't know why they're doing it,' he said. Dr Paul Fiddian, head of clinical virology at Wellcome, stressed the Concorde study's data were preliminary and not easy to read. Some trial patients on non-active dummy medicines had swapped during the middle of the trial, he said. Analysis had also been complicated because some patients had rightly been given a new treatment that prevented a pneumonia that was the most common cause of death in Aids patients. Dr Jones called on the MRC to publish the full analysis as soon as possible. Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the leading UK Aids charity, took the MRC's side in the developing dispute with Wellcome. He pointed out that the company had been very closely involved in the design and management of the Concorde trial. 'It seems disingenuous for Wellcome now to criticise the design and data analysis of a trial in which they were integrally involved,' Mr Partridge said. 'We already knew AZT was limited in its effects and this trial has clarified those limitations.' Medical authorities in the US have been more supportive of AZT than in Europe. Mr Mark Alampi, chief operations officer of Project Aids International, in Los Angeles, said the National Institutes of Health 'has been on a continuous campaign since last Friday telling people with HIV not to stop taking AZT'.

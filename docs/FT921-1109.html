			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Chicago set to embrace the gambling trade CHICAGO, the ever-brash and competitive American city, may be about to duel with Las Vegas for the gaming trade. Mayor Richard Daley, abandoning his previous opposition to gambling, has embraced a controversial Dollars 2bn proposal for a city-centre casino and hotel complex. The proposal was made by three of the US gaming industry's leading players: Circus Circus Enterprises, Hilton Hotels and Caesars World. Mr Daley's about-face on gambling came, he said, because of the reality of unemployment. The proposed complex would bring to the city an estimated Dollars 500m a year in tax revenues and create between 15,000 and 45,000 permanent jobs. But many in Chicago oppose such a project because of the taint of corruption that has always accompanied gambling. They feel it would revive the city's former reputation as mecca of Al Capone-style organised crime. The city has never entirely shed that fame and as the home of the US futures trading industry some argue it already has too many games of chance. If Chicago were to legalise gambling and allow the complex to be built, it would be the first major American city to do so. Las Vegas, considered the US gaming capital, was created from a sleepy desert town. Stiff opposition to changing the state's restrictive gambling laws is already shaping up. Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, a Republican, whose support would be needed to pass the legislation, has made plain that he does not think more gambling is an appropriate way to finance government. Illinois currently has riverboat casinos, off-track betting for horse races and a lottery. The three gaming and hotel companies, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, said they would privately finance the project in Chicago. Only one area can readily offer a site of sufficient size for the development. That location would bridge the central business district with the McCormick convention centre, just south of the city.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Chairman of Scottish Nuclear proposes modest increase in use of nuclear power Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned generator, last night proposed only a modest increase in the proportion of the UK's electricity needs met by nuclear power. Mr Hann suggested that the government should state in its forthcoming energy white paper what percentage of the electricity market should be held by each energy source. He recommended that nuclear power should have between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the market. With nuclear energy at present meeting about 20 per cent of the market, Mr Hann is advocating little expansion in nuclear capacity. He says Britain should simply replace the older Magnox stations at the end of their useful lives 'with new and more efficient designs'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Antic: "Belgrade's Lips Remain Sealed"] </F>   [Text] Pristina -- "As president of Kosovo, I gave my word  to the citizens of Kosovo and I am promising that, according to  the results of the 1991 referendum, I will nurture the will of  the Kosovo citizens, expressed at that referendum." This will,  let us recall, was: "An independent and sovereign state of  Kosovo." This was stated, among other things, by Ibrahim Rugova  in the latest issue of ZERI, in response to the question on when  he expected the process of solving issues in Kosovo to start,  that is, when he expected a dialogue between Belgrade and  Pristina to start.    Rugova said that he expected the issue of Kosovo to be dealt  with by the international community immediately after the  conclusion of the Muslim-Croat agreement in Bosnia. For the  first time, he said that, expecting a reaction from the Serbs,  he has proposed that the United States mediate in these talks,  and that, as he said, the presence of the European Union, even  Russia, cannot be ruled out. He said that he had opted for the  Americans because their policies are pragmatic, whereas Europe  is satisfied with a status-quo situation.    Following Rugova's statement, almost all papers in Albanian  language were preoccupied with the "start" of the  Serbian-Albanian dialogue on solving the status of Kosovo.  Analysts, commentators, and Albanian politicians are very  frustrated, however, because "Belgrade's lips remain sealed."</p>

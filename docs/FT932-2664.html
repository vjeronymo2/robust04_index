			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy Zeneca trade A late upsurge in Zeneca shares was ascribed to Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbroking arm of the merchant bank, which told clients that the rights issue 'should definitely be taken up'. Fleming's buy note triggered heavy demand for both classes of Zeneca shares, the most heavily traded issues on the London market yesterday. The Pounds 1.3bn rights issue closes on Monday. Marginally easier during the morning, both classes of Zeneca shares made rapid progress to close sharply higher on the day. The 'old' settled 7 up at 623p, with 12m shares changing hands, while the 'new' nil-paid rights added 5 1/2 at 21 1/2 p on 15m traded. Fleming analyst Mr John Doree said recent weakness in Zeneca shares was due to lack of international interest: 'Overseas interest is near-zero.' But he forecast that domestic institutions will ensure the issue will be taken up. 'Zeneca is on a 35 per cent yield premium to the market and, given the potential to grow the dividend as fast as the market in the long term, the shares look oversold and a short-term buy. Fleming also labelled ICI a 'buy'.</p>

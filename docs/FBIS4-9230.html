			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- (Unofficial,  abridged ROMPRES translation of Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor  Melescanu's speech made at the Crans Montana Forum)    ``The very fact that Romania has the privilege of playing  host to this conference of the Crans Montana Forum, one of the  catalysts of the process of providing new bases to the European  and world order, is a convincing argument that our irreversible  option for democracy, pluralism, the state of law, the  observance of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as  for an economy of free enterprise is acknowledged as such by our  partners in Europe and in the world," said Romanian Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu in his address to the plenary session  on "Security and Cooperation in the Black Sea Region" of the  Crans Montana Forum proceedings opened in Bucharest on 21 April.    ``Recognized in this way is also Romania's characteristic as  a Central-European country close to the Balkans, bordered by the  Danube and the Black Sea, a junction of the connections among  the various zones of the old continent, as well as between  Europe and the regions in its proximity,'' the speaker said.    Highlighting the fundamental option of the Romanian foreign  policy of integration into West-European and Euro-Atlantic  structures, of building good-neighborly relations with the  states with which Romania has common frontiers and with those in  its proximity, the Romanian foreign minister also stressed the  importance of the sub-regional cooperation pursuing the curbing,  as much as possible, "of the tendency of fragmentation of  Central and Eastern Europe, as a characteristic of the evolution  of this zone over the last few years."    ``That is why the countries participating in sub-regional  cooperation ought not to depart from the framework of the  principles and norms consecrated by the CSCE and, the least  desirable is that they promote principles and norms contrary to  the above.    ``This is the philosophy underlying the emergence and  development of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone, a group  participated in by 11 states totalling 322 million inhabitants,  within which the cooperation is preponderantly economic,'' the  Romanian chief diplomat said, adding:    "The natural connection existing between the Mediterranean  Sea and the Black Sea, as well as the fact that the latter is  the shortest way between Europe and Central Asia largely explain  the interest shown by more and more numerous states that do not  have Black Sea coasts in participating in our group's  activities."    The Romanian minister recommended to "those concerned -- be  they government factors, private enterprises, or representatives  of similar groups in Europe or in other continents -- to apply  for detailed information on the rules of procedure and  functioning of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone and on  the projects already under operation or only under  consideration, to the standing secretariat with headquarters in  Istanbul." He hoped that this year already the Black Sea Trade  and Development Bank would open at Salonika and that, in the  future, the current Balkan Center for Small and Medium  Enterprises, existing in Bucharest, might extend its activity  throughout the Black Sea zone.    In concluding his address, Teodor Melescanu said:    ``By its geographic position and its tremendous potential of  raw materials, labor, productive capacities, and outlets, the  Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone is an attractive space of  collaboration.    ``On the other hand, it is just as true that the vast Black  Sea region includes also areas of deep instability and even of  open military conflicts.    ``That is why, the fastest and peaceful settlement of the  conflicts on the east coast of the Black Sea deserves to be  included in the CSCE and UN priorities''</p>

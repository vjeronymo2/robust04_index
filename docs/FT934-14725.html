			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / BAe to shed 1,000 jobs ALMOST 1,000 jobs are being cut by British Aerospace across four plants in England and Scotland, underlining the difficulties the company is having in depressed world markets for aircraft and defence equipment. The loss-making Jetstream turbo-prop section, based in Prestwick, Scotland, will lose 630 jobs while 352 jobs will go at BAe's Royal Ordnance subsidiary. BAe blamed a lack of orders and said although volunteers would be sought, compulsory redundancies were likely. At Prestwick the cuts will involve about 460 staff and 170 sub-contractors out of a total of 2,500 workers. The Royal Ordnance cuts are spread over three sites: 120 out of 150 jobs are to go at Wescott, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and a further 70 out of 600 at Summerfield, near Kidderminster, Hereford and Worcester. Both sites make rocket motors. A plant at Blackburn, Lancashire, which does mechanical and electrical work on military vehicles and armaments, will lose 162 jobs from a total of 375. BAe said that the job losses were the result of 'a lack of orders and a slowing down of Ministry of Defence spending'. It said further job losses were possible unless the Treasury allowed the MoD to proceed with a Pounds 250m ammunition order. At Prestwick, the company says it believes the level of redundancies will be sufficient to restore the plant's competitiveness. It expects the market will turn up in 18 months to two years. But it acknowledged that an alliance with another manufacturer as part of an industry-wide rationalisation could mean further changes at Prestwick, though probably not more job losses. Jetstream blames the need for redundancies on a severe shortage of orders. It is building some aircraft for which it has no orders and wants to scale back production. In June Mr Allan MacDonald, Jetstream's managing director, urged that the 11 worldwide manufacturers of commuter airliners needed to rationalise their output. Since then Jetstream and other companies have been talking about possible alliances but no deals have been reached. Jetstream believes it is well placed for any joint venture because it considers its Prestwick plant is efficient and it has successful aircraft. Prestwick builds the 19-seat Jetstream 31 and the 29-seat Jetstream 41. It also builds the 64-seat Jetstream ATP, whose production was recently transferred from Woodford near Manchester. Programmes to build two other models, the 72-seat Jetstream 71 and a 50-seat Jetstream 51, are to be launched by January. Likely European partners for an alliance include the Franco-Italian consortium ATR and the Spanish company Casa. ATR already builds successful turbo-prop aircraft in the same category as Jetstream's ATP, and Casa is planning an aircraft in that category. BAe did not provide for redundancies at Jetstream in the Pounds 1bn restructuring provision it made earlier this year. It said it was too early to estimate the cost of the redundancies at Prestwick.</p>

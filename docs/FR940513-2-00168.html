			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that plan payments made by a class under its 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Administrative Services Arrangement and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to applicants that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The workpapers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon written request by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``request on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends and distributions, and sales loads of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (9) above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The prospectuses of each class of a Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in that Fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

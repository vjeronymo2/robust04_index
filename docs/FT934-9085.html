			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Names under pressure to accept settlement LLOYD'S OF London may attempt to 'bounce' loss-making Names into accepting an out-of-court settlement to legal disputes at the insurance market, the chairman of the biggest action group of loss makers warned yesterday. Mr Michael Deeny told the annual meeting of the Gooda Walker Action Groupthat Names would soon 'receive a barrage of mail warning you that this is the last offer.' The warning comes amid indications that some Lloyd's agents - who handle the affairs of the Names that support the market - may also oppose Lloyd's plans to ask them to make voluntary contributions to help fund a settlement. The agents, who are targetted in more than two dozen legal actions, will learn today how their contributions are to be calculated. More than 100 agencies could be asked to donate, but the losses of Lloyd's in recent years have stretched available resources of some smaller companies. The managing director of another agency said: 'Many agents will not be in a position to find that sort of money.' At the Gooda meeting Mr Deeny said the 3,000 Gooda Names should press ahead with their legal action rather than accept an inadequate deal. Offers of compensation in the region of 30p in the pound, a figure widely rumoured at the Lloyd's market, were way below levels that 'the committee of this action group could recommend to its membership.' Mr Deeny said: 'Multilateral negotiations of a most complex and demanding nature' were taking place between the leaders of loss making Names, Lloyd's, agents and their insurers but no 'concrete or detailed offer' was on the table. Lloyd's wants to finance a deal through contributions from errors and omissions insurers, which cover Lloyd's agents against awards for negligence, and the Lloyd's central fund. It is understood that E&amp;O insurers might provide Pounds 300m towards a settlement. Lloyd's said two months ago that it would also seek contributions from agents, brokers and accountants. It is understood that the formula on which agents' contributions will be based takes into account three factors: the deductibles (the amount of an insurance claim paid by the buyer) on the agents' errors and omissions insurance policies; the amounts of exposure not insured by these policies; and the exposure of each agent to potential claims. Agency boards will meet next week to examine the implications of the scheme. Annual deductibles are typically between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 500,000 for bigger agents. One agent estimated that between Pounds 25m and Pounds 75m could be raised through such contributions but that the cost might push many smaller agents into insolvency.</p>

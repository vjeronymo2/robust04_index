			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Navistar losses accelerate to Dollars 115m NAVISTAR International, the largest US truck manufacturer, slumped to an after-tax loss of Dollars 115m in the three months to end-July. The deficit compares with a Dollars 31m loss in the same period a year earlier, and brings Navistar's total losses for the first nine months of its financial year to Dollars 182m, compared with a Dollars 98m loss last time. Sales in the third quarter were up from Dollars 861m to Dollars 920m, and in the nine-month period, from Dollars 2.64bn to Dollars 2.74bn. The company reported signs of improvement in the market for heavy trucks, but added that the market for school buses remained weak. Its shares rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 2 on the news. Navistar said the third quarter loss from continuing operations was a more modest Dollars 50m - of which Dollars 24m represented a charge for the previously announced recall of school bus chassis. Discontinued operations comprised a Dollars 65m charge covering the settlement of litigation between the company and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits. Navistar said its retail deliveries of school bus chassis and medium/heavy trucks was numbered 17,600 in the third quarter, a 5 per cent improvement on the previous year. However, this was still below the 7 per cent increase seen by the industry generally.</p>

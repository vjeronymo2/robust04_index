			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Earthmovers take over from explosives: Jimmy Burns sees the 'unarmed struggle' on the Irish border It was the smallest of streams - a burn not more than a foot wide. Yet in the context of Northern Ireland's turbulent politics, it had momentarily achieved near-biblical proportions. The stream, which passes under a country road seven miles from Londonderry, separates north and south Ireland. Early this week the spot was chosen by republicans to demonstrate what they now call the 'unarmed phase of the struggle' for Irish unity. At around 5pm, republicans in cars and vans met local farmers and builders with farming and earth-moving equipment on the north side of the border. The fittest among them began with the help of a bulldozer to move a series of small concrete bollards blocking the road into nearby fields. Then they moved down the road towards the south and tried to move some larger blocks which marked the border. When they failed they laid a temporary road to one side of the blocks so that vehicles could cross the border. The barriers were set up by the security forces during the 1970s to stop terrorists using isolated roads to cross the border. Although occasionally inspected by army patrols, they never became permanent checkpoints. But following last week's ceasefire announcement by the IRA, they have become the target of political action. Sinn Fein officials in Londonderry see the removal of the barriers as part of the demilitarisation process and, more importantly, a symbol of their commitment to Irish unity. They do not accept that removing them without the consent of the security forces is illegal. So far the removal of the barriers has been carried out in an air of celebration rather than confrontation, although tension has never been far beneath the surface. Near the stream, the demonstrators - men, women and children - laughed as the oldest republican present, former Sinn Fein councillor Barney McFadden, cut a makeshift tape of kitchen towelling and declared the border crossing permanently opened. 'Tell me, Patrick, is the grass greener now on the other side?' joked one republican to another as demonstrators stepped from north to south and back again. The security forces were not present. They have been replacing the barriers  -in the early hours of the morning, after the demonstrators have left. Nevertheless the border 'opening' I witnessed had been kept secret until the last minute, and to attend it I had to be accompanied by a Sinn Fein member. The good humour gave way to defiance when some of the demonstrators were intercepted later by a heavily armed Ulster police patrol and subjected to intensive document checks. Neither the barriers nor the checks had 'absolutely any justification,' said Mr Martin McGuinness, Londonderry's most prominent republican figure, who is believed to have played a key role in ensuring the acceptance of the IRA ceasefire. Mr McGuinness himself called for checkpoints to be removed together with the 'other paraphernalia of war' in and around 'one of the most heavily garrisoned cities in the world'. The security presence in the area includes heavily fortified police and army barracks and watchtowers with long-range camera equipment. The republican 'unarmed struggle' is being watched nervously, however, not just by the security forces but by the Protestant community. For a people to whom history often seems like only yesterday, the current campaign of civil action - including picketing police stations in protest at alleged harassment of Catholics by security forces - is reminiscent of the early stages of the conflict. Republican sources insist the IRA ceasefire has been agreed to in a time-frame generous enough to allow for genuine political and constitutional progress to be made in the framework of the current Anglo-Irish peace process. But no republican I talked to in Londonderry would guarantee that military operations had ended for ever. Several insisted the ceasefire would hold as long as the government responded by taking more than just cosmetic steps to demilitarisation in Catholic areas. Their demands range from a withdrawal of army patrols to the gradual introduction in Catholic areas of a reformed and retrained police force, which is still regarded as sectarian. Beyond this, there is the sine qua non of political concession. Down on the Bogside, there is a freshly-painted mural. It shows a British soldier carrying the Union Jack on his back and walking off down a country road - a road clearly signposted to London.</p>

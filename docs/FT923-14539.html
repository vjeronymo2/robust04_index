			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Safeway will drop secrecy about product sales data SAFEWAY, the UK's third biggest grocery chain, is to sell sales data on every product category in its 322 stores as part of an initiative to develop closer relationships with suppliers. The company has formed a joint venture with Nielsen, the market-research group, to collate sales information from the electronic point-of-sale (Epos) equipment in its stores. Safeway claims to be the first of the big grocery chains to scan every sale made in its stores. The information is likely to be eagerly sought by manufacturers of consumer products, because they can use the information to adjust production levels and assess promotions. Until now, most of the big grocery chains have closely guarded their sales data, believing that it could be of value to competitors and that it is, therefore, of considerable commercial sensitivity. Mr David Coles, Safeway's marketing director, said it was an appropriate time to start sharing sales information with suppliers as closer links developed between retailers and manufacturers. The data would provide a 'common language' which could benefit both parties. 'We are looking for ways to develop more of a partnership relationship with our suppliers so that they can manage alongside us, rather than being kept at a distance,' he said. Safeway sells between 15,000 to 20,000 different lines in its stores and has about 6m customers a week. The Safeway/Nielsen service will start reporting sales data by the end of the year. The cost of access to the service has not been finalised, but Mr Coles said the rate would be 'flexible'. Asda results, Page 21</p>

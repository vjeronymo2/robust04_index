The two frontier defense  headquarters each gained a Collective Award of Merit.    Both Yunnan and Guangxi are located on China's southwestern  border, facing a border line as long as nearly 5,000 km.  Lawbreakers both inside and outside the country run rampant in  these areas, engaging in the smuggling and trafficking of guns  and drugs. In the wake of a work conference on struggles against  the smuggling of guns and drugs, which was called by the  Ministry of Public Security in June 1993, the public security  and frontier defense forces in both Yunnan and Guangxi have  carried out special-purpose campaigns against the smuggling of  guns and drugs in an extensive and thoroughgoing way. Officers  and men of the armed police have overcome numerous difficulties,  carried out hard struggles, and attained remarkable results.  According to a briefing, the Yunnan Frontier Defense  Headquarters has cracked a total of 218 gun-smuggling cases and  seized 119 military guns, 3,582 grenades, and 4,605 bullets, and  cleared up 596 drug-trafficking cases and seized 427.477 kg of  heroin and 283.77 kg of opium. The Guangxi Frontier Defense  Headquarters solved a total of 100 gun-smuggling cases and  captured 208 military guns, 148 grenades, and 5,722 bullets, and  cracked 39 drug-trafficking cases and seized 4.849 kg of heroin  and 64.537 kg of opium.</p>

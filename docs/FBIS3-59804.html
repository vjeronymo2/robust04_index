			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raja Mansur Ali in Nicosia: "Rafsanjani: Saudi </F> Arabia Is the Key to the Solution of All Our Problems]    [Text] The Supreme Council for National Security held a  meeting presided over by Rafsanjani shortly before the trip of  the foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati, to the Gulf States  last May. During that meeting, the Iranian president attempted  to circumvent the new Majles and its bloc leaders who had  competed with him for power after they had deceived him by  posing as his allies in his struggle with the extremists who  were led by Mahdi Karubi, former speaker of the previous Majles.  In the presence of all the members of Majles, with the exception  of Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of Majles, Rafsanjani proposed that  Velayati visit all member states of the Gulf Council in order to  improve relations between them and Iran before pilgrimage time  in view of the rumors and instigations, which that period brings  with it.    As soon as Rafsanjani convinced the Council members of the  validity of his viewpoint, it was agreed that the Council would  present a detailed study to the mentor of the revolution, Ali  Khamene'i, in order to win his support and to send Velayati on a  mission, the purpose of which stretches beyond the diplomatic  reasons given at the time, namely the improvement of relations  between the Gulf states and Iran and concern for regional  security.    The study, which was surrounded by great secrecy, referred  quite plainly and clearly to the enormous difficulties facing  the Islamic regime in Iran. The study warned that those  difficulties might lead to an explosive situation in the capital  itself similar to the one that took place in the cities of  Meshed, Shiraz, and Arak last year when the disturbances and  demonstrations were a warning of an imminent danger, which made  the officials aware of the possibility of a confrontation  between the people and the regime.    The study highlighted the economic aspect, which it viewed  as  the strongest factor in influencing the regime and altering its  tendencies and policies, and probably leading to its demise  "unless bold and courageous decisions are taken to restore to  the people its faith in the Government and its Administration as  well as in those in charge of the situation in Iran."    The study allocated a large section to the relations with  the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in light of the important changes and  developments in the region following the second Gulf war. The  study quoted Rafsanjani as saying that there was no way for Iran  to survive and enhance the trust between the people and the  government, and to improve the economic conditions, except  through the improvement of relations with Riyad and said "which  is the key to the solution of all our economic, political, and  even social problems."    But the wishes of Rafsanjani and even Khamene'i soon clashed  with the fundamentalist factions and the Khomeyni issue. In his  will, Khomeyni had indeed left strong words that could create  problems for Rafsanjani, as well as to the mentor of the  revolution, and lead to a fierce outbreak of the internal  situation should they attempt to draw close to Saudi Arabia.  This issue was raised by Ahmad Khomeyni during the meeting of  the Supreme Council for National Security. The study answered  the issue by stressing the need for a Rafsanjani initiative and  for a statement expressing his desire to visit Riyad. As to the  timing of the visit, the study indicated that it should take  place during the Hajj in view of its effects and impact on the  Iranian people and on the Hezbollah party, as well as on other  revolutionary followers of Ayatollah al-Khomeyni.    In fact, Rafsanjani did launch his initiative by sending his  Foreign Minister Velayati in the name of the policy of overture  adopted by the president.    To counter that attempt, the speaker of Majles, Nateq-Nuri,  launched an opposing initiative by holding a meeting he called  with the leaders of the "New Revolutionary Students." During  that meeting he answered the participants' questions regarding  the forthcoming visit of Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia, and he  revealed that Rafsanjani's Gulf visit, as well as that of  Velayati, were planned during the session of the Supreme Council  for National Security and was supported by the mentor of the  revolution. It was obvious that Nateq-Nuri wanted to distance  himself from the responsibility and the implications of  Rafsanjani's visit and its effects on the Iranian people. At the  same time, he wanted to embarrass Rafsanjani, especially at a  time when the latter was overwhelmed by the presidential  elections and the frenetic search for as large a number of  voters as he could get to face the Parliamentary blocs who  wished to curtail his authority and test his ability.  <H5>  The Alliance of the Fundamentalists </H5>   Nuri felt that what he had done so far was not enough. Nor  was he content with instigating the "revolutionary" students and  inciting them to organize demonstrations against Rafsanjani,  accusing him of deviating from the path of the Imam and his  revolutionary approach. In fact, huge demonstrations were  organized and a number of rallies proceeded to march but were  not allowed by Rafsanjani to leave the university campus. But  the organizers of the protest filled the streets and highways  with posters carrying slogans hostile to Rafsanjani's policies.  Both the Majles and Nateq-Nuri went even further. The speaker of  Majles paid a spectacular visit to Qom, the stronghold of the  clerics and the leaders of the Shi'ite governing institution.  There, he held long meetings with Ayatollah Fazel Lankarani  whose influence is taken into consideration, with apprehension,  by both Khamene'i and Rafsanjani, in the configuration of the  balance of power. What Nuri did also, was to open up to  Ayatollah Lanakrani and the other religious leaders, telling  them everything he wanted to say hoping to win their support in  his confrontation with Rafsanjani. Not to be outdone,  Rafsanjani, who was backed by Khamene'i, went to Qumm. However,  his visit was a failure because he failed to win the support of  the Ayatollah there. Moreover, Rafsanjani was harshly criticised  because of the bad economy and its harmful and dangerous effects  on the social conditions. Rafsanjani, as well as other  observers, realized that the hands that were fomenting the  internal instability in Iran, were not necessarily foreign. In  fact, both Nateq-Nuri and Muhammadi Reyshahri, together with  their supporters, could, by opposing the president, upset the  internal configuration of power and harm the foreign relations  of Iran, especially with the Arab Gulf states. It is relevant to  note that all those who view Rafsanjani as their competitor and  as a deviationist dictator, have formed an alliance against him,  an alliance that spans from the far right to the far left on the  Iranian map of political forces. This was obvious by the number  of votes the president received during the presidential  elections, and the parliamentary sessions for the vote of  confidence on the Government, when Rafsanjani received a  nonconfidence vote for his minister of economy and finance, Dr.  Mohsen Nurbakhsh. So Rafsanjani found himself in a "bottleneck,"  and as he did not wish to be burned twice from the same spot, he  threw all his cards in Khamene'i's basket and allied himself  with him, having convinced him of a bitter reality, namely that  all fundamentalists, both the former and the new, did not  believe in Khamene'i's authority. The new fundamentalists, whose  leader in Majles is the speaker of Majles, Nateq-Nuri, even  though they recognize the competence of Khamene'i as a Faqih  [Muslim scholar], they follow the religious teaching of  Ayatollah Azari-Qomi, and the political decisions of Ayatollah  Mahdavi-Kani.    As to the former fundamentalists who are today shunned and  harassed, they are led by the former speaker of Majles, Mehdi  Karrubi. They formed an alliance with the person they had once  defeated and made him lose the position of al-Faqih and the  succession of Khomeyni, namely Ayatollah 'Ali Montazeri, to whom  they secretly paid allegiance.    Rafsanjani and Khamene'i have decided to improve relations  with Saudi Arabia because they are convinced that it constituted  the key to the solution of the problems of Iran, as mentioned in  the study referred to above. As result, Khamene'i forced the  speaker of Majles, Nateq-Nuri, to attend the meeting of the  Supreme Council for National Security held at the time when the  OPEC foreign ministers were meeting in Geneva to study the  dangerous effects of the low prices of oil on the economy and  hence the social situation and the internal stability of Iran.    The meeting of the Supreme Council for National Security,  which met at Rafsanjani's request, concluded its meeting by  reaffirming the recommendations of the previous study of the  Council presented to Khamene'i, namely the need to improve  relations with Riyad and the approval of Rafsanjani's trip to  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and his meeting with the custodian  of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. And  because the first Rafsanjani study won the approval of  Khameni'i, the second study gave Rafsanjani the green light to  contact King Fahd and fulfill his desire to meet with him while  his innermost feeling saying: "Deliver us from the falling oil  prices, God will have mercy upon you."    Some informed Iranian sources said that Rafsanjani, during  his telephone conversation with the Saudi King, discussed the  question of mutual cooperation on the question of oil and  promised to find a solution to the problems between the two  countries, foremost among those problems, were the problems of  Hajj and 'Umra. This pilgrimage problem arose when Rafsanjani's  enemies sent groups of non-Iranians to Saudi Arabia first for  pilgrimage, and later to the other Arab Gulf States. While in  Saudi Arabia, Velayati told King Fahd of Rafsanjani's desire to  meet with him wherever he wishes, either in Tehran or Riyad.  This request was interpreted by the observers as an expression  of Rafsanjani's desire to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The  custodian of the two holy mosques responded by opening his house  to the visitor and by expressing his hope that Rafsanjani would  visit Riyad so as the two could meet in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia.    During Velayati's visit to Saudi Arabia, Rafsanjani made a  declaration intended to enhance his initiative. He said that he  would soon meet the Saudi king and he expressed his wish to  improve Iranian-Arab relations. He went even further and said  that he looked forward to the west and hoped to build strong  relations with all states without exception.    However, Rafsanjani's initiative failed at that time because  Nateq-Nuri and the new fundamentalists took over the Majles by  winning more seats, all of which belonged to the leaders of the  Muslim fundamentalist movements.  <H5>  Rafsanjani's Victory </H5>   The telephone conversation between Rafsanjani and the Saudi  king, which took place under the aegis and support of the mentor  of the revolution, Khamene'i, opened the way to Rafsanjani to  tighten his control and enhance his position vis-a-vis  Nateq-Nuri and the fundamentalists, so Nuri found himself bound  to accept Khamene'i's decision because the speaker of Majles and  all the followers of Mahdavi-Kani and Azari-Qomi wished to  appear as paying allegiance to the authority of the Faqih as  represented by Khamene'i.    On Thursday (30 September) Nateq-Nuri gave a well-prepared  interview to TEHRAN TIMES, the mouthpiece of the new  fundamentalists. In that interview, he said that the telephone  conversation between Rafsanjani and King Fahd took place with  the consent of Khamene'i and at the request of the Supreme  Council for National Security. This reveals the extent of the  importance that Rafsanjani's administration attach to Saudi  Arabia for the solution of the economic problems of Iran.    In an ostentatious show of allegiance to Khamene'i,  Nateq-Nuri felt compelled to assert that both Iran and Saudi  Arabia play a major and important role in stabilizing and  raising the prices of oil within the framework of OPEC. Nuri  went as far as to quote from Rafsanjani's previous study, which  Nuri had then opposed, namely "that if Iran wishes to solve its  problems within OPEC, it has to cooperate with Saudi Arabia."    However, Nateq-Nuri did not wish to accept his fate and that  of his group, so he deliberately mentioned the forthcoming visit  of Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia even though Rafsanjani did not  mention it following his conversation with King Fahd. Nateq-Nuri  added that the telephone conversation between Rafsanjani and  Fahd, as well as "the visits among officials" would help Iran  reach its goal within OPEC.    Rafsanjani had not revealed his forthcoming visit to Saudi  Arabia, which he hoped to undertake without prior announcement.  But the fact that Nateq-Nuri mentioned it, proved that Nuri and  his group were still intent on putting sticks into Rafsanjani's  wheels so as to arouse the fundamentalists against him.    It is apparent that there are wise men and moderates who  work  to transfer Iran from the revolutionary positions and the  proliferation of the centers of power to an area of the state  where a unified decisionmaking system could be established. That  is why Rafsanjani decided, before announcing his latest  initiative, to restrict the freedom of certain extremist  newspapers, which can stir public opinion in Iran against him.  Subsequently, he arrested Abbas 'Abdi, the editor of the paper  SALAM, mouthpiece of the former fundamentalists who had lost  their positions in Majles and had boycotted the government but  who, nevertheless had kept some power and influence in Majles.  Rafsanjani hinted to his supporters in the Judiciary to exert  pressure in various ways on the press. This led all the  newspapers, especially SALAM, to appear "rational" and to tone  down their outspokenness, and, for the first time since the  inception of the Islamic Revolution, to curb down their  criticism of the Iranian-Saudi rapprochement. Moreover, several  newspapers welcomed Rafsanjani's initiative and published the  views of various economic analysts and experts saying that the  agreement reached in Geneva was a historic victory to Tehran,  which could not have been reached without that telephone  conversation and without the coordination displayed during  OPEC's meeting between the two major parties, namely, Iran and  Saudi Arabia. Those analysts who were frightened by Rafsanjani's  stick, expressed optimism that the latest OPEC agreement could  lead to an increase in the prices of oil, which have been  steadily falling. Few of them went even further and called for a  summit conference for OPEC in order to enhance the standing of  the organization "despite the existing political differences,"  among the member states.    It is obvious that the Iranian economy, especially in the  current phase that requires construction and economic reforms,  relies on the income from oil; so the drop in oil prices  constitutes an unfortunate beginning for the launching of the  programs of the Second Five-Year Plan. This in turn is a serious  indicator that would increase inflation, aggravate an already  bad economic situations, and cause the disruption of the  internal social fabric, and eventually, lead to disturbances,  especially in Tehran, where it could threaten the regime and its  projects. All the above-mentioned issues were discussed by the  Supreme Council for National Security before it asked Rafsanjani  to contact King Fahd.</p>

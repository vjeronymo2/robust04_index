			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / People: PEPping up the Trio trust At 45, David Hagan, chartered accountant turned money broker, is still waiting to break into the big league. Having set up Tullett &amp; Tokyo Equities and tried and failed to buy Exco, one of the world's biggest money brokers, he has now re-emerged as full-time chairman of Trio, a small and unsuccessful investment trust. Hagan, who has paid Pounds 225,000 for a 12.5 per cent stake in Trio, has been given the job of trying to inject some life into a trust which was brought to the stock market 16 months ago at 50p per share by Raphael Zorn. It was intended to be a specialist trust appealing to investors with personal equity plans. But the rules were changed; the trust lost its original sense of purpose and is trading at a substantial discount to its Pounds 2m of net assets. English Trust, which has a substantial stake in Trio and is the company's financial adviser, has given Hagan the job of coming up with some new ideas. Hagan, who will be executive chairman, says that he has been given a 'very broad brief'. He refused to speculate on his options, but the company's flexibility would be enhanced if it gave up its investment trust status. In order to ensure that Hagan has 'an adequate interest in the company's future', Hagan will be granted substantial share options subject to shareholder approval. Lord Tryon and Alan Arscott have resigned as directors, and Peter Glossop, Christopher Moore and Christopher Spence remain as directors. Robert Henderson, former chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has stepped down as deputy chairman of CADBURY SCHWEPPES at the age of 74. He has been on the board since 1977 and deputy chairman since 1984. In the course of his career at KB he had been instrumental in the merger of Cadbury and Schweppes back in 1969. The new deputy chairman is 61-year-old Tom Hutchison, on the board since 1986. A director of ICI from 1985 to 1991, he is deputy governor of the Bank of Scotland, and a non-executive director of The Hammerson Group and AMP Asset Management. ***** Clive Stones has been appointed director of economic regulation at YORKSHIRE WATER SERVICES. ***** William Rollason has been appointed finance director of MARLING INDUSTRIES; he joins from Hambros. ***** Keith Clarke, former md of Budgens, has been appointed trading director of SPAR (UK) and SPAR FOOD DISTRIBUTORS. ***** Neil Quinn is appointed md of Apollo Fire Detectors, a subsidiary of HALMA.

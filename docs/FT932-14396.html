			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM prepares to launch Dollars 4.6bn syndicated loan IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, and IBM Credit Corp, its leasing subsidiary, are preparing to launch a Dollars 4.6bn syndicated loan, according to banking sources. The financing, in the form of a revolving credit facility, is being arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston. The company is currently approaching its key relationship banks in the hope of obtaining commitments of around Dollars 500m from each of them. The deal may be launched as early as this week. Officials at IBM refused to confirm the transaction but, according to bankers involved in the deal, IBM itself is setting up a Dollars 3bn line, while IBM Credit Corp, its wholly-owned leasing organisation, has access to a further Dollars 1.6bn. Each portion is understood to consist of 364-day and three-year tranches. A revolving credit is a loan facility which can be repaid and re-borrowed throughout its lifetime. Both IBM and IBM Credit Corp are familiar borrowers in the public markets where they have launched bond issues. However, bankers point out that this loan would be IBM's debut in the syndicated loans market. IBM Credit Corp launched a Dollars 500m, five-year revolving credit in 1986 which was arranged by Salomon Brothers. Last month, Moody's, the international credit rating agency, downgraded IBM's long-term debt as well as that of its financially-supported wholly-owned subsidiaries, IBM Credit, IBM International Finance and IBM Japan, to Single-A1 from Double-A2. The downgrading affected about Dollars 18bn of debt, the agency said. IBM reported a net loss of Dollars 4.97bn for 1992, the biggest annual loss in its history, as sales of mainframe computers dropped sharply in the fourth quarter.</p>

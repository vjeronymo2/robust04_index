			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by defense correspondent Charles Miller] </F>   [Text] The cost of buying Trident ballistic missiles from  the United States is set to soar, MPs [Members of Parliament]  warned today. They urged the Government to complete its  purchase of missiles from U.S. manufacturer Lockheed "as soon as  possible."    Costs could rise by as much as 80 million pounds sterling  this year alone because of the increasing likelihood that the  U.S. will substantially cut its order, pushing up the unit price  of each missile.    The Commons defence committee warned: "We fear that future  rises may far exceed present provision, and consider that MoD  [Ministry of Defense] must be prepared to complete its missile  procurement programme as soon as possible to avoid such cost  penalties."    Britain has purchased 44 missiles to date, and the total is  likely to be around 70. But the committee stressed the  purchases should be completed in much less than the four to six  years suggested by MoD.    In their report on the Trident programme, the MPs also  disclosed that the production and assembly of nuclear warheads  at the Atomic Weapons Establishment [AWE] at Aldermaston and  Burghfield would virtually stop by the year 2000. This follows  the cancellation last year of plans to replace the WE177  free-fall bomb and the end of Trident warhead production.    The committee said a "large and costly" proportion of AWE  facilities would be left idle and the two Berkshire sites would  revert virtually to doing research work. The MPs agreed there  was "no foreseeable need" for further British nuclear tests in  the immediate future. And they urged the MoD to provide  sufficient funds to ensure nuclear expertise and safety could be  maintained without the need for testing.</p>

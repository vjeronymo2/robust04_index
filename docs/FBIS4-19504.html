			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Speroni Sees New Role in League, </F> Old Habits in Others"]    [Text] (ANSA) Milan, April 17 -- A leading Northern League  official, Francesco Speroni, warned here today that, in recent  political negotiations, he had seen his party's putative  government allies of Forza Italia and the National Alliance  using Christian Democrat-style methods he thought were "dead and  buried."    Speroni, who was the League's initial candidate for the  Senate speakership, said he welcomed the election of the  conservative Freedom Front's candidate, Carlo Scognamiglio, but  frowned on how the candidacy had been achieved by the League's  allies.    In particular, he said no one had ever suggested he should  withdraw his name. He also said the choice fell on Scognamiglio  largely thanks to the League, since "even" Forza Italia's leader  Silvio Berlusconi looked kindly on the candidacy of outgoing  speaker, Giovanni Spadolini, who was backed by the progressives.    Speroni told reporters at his home near here that he had  heard it was President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who had vetoed his  candidacy for the Senate. He added that he was standing by his  refusal to take part in the League's delegation for the  government-formation negotiations that expected to get under way  next week. "I'll be sending a deputy," he said.    "Maybe, I've come to the end of a political season in the  League," said Speroni, who is usually ranked as among League  leader Umberto Bossi's closest aides. "I am not a politician  for mediation, but one for opposition or an absolute majority.  I may have to review my role in the League."</p>

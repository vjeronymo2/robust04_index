			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Finland takes first prize for third week Finland provided the best performance of the FT-Actuaries World Indices for the third week running, while Malaysia came a close second as it rose to a record high last week. But both markets appear vulnerable to a temporary setback as some investors take their profits. Mr Peter Lawrence at Kleinwort Benson says Finnish equities cannot continue to climb at their current pace. The HEX index has risen more than 50 per cent from its 5 1/2 -year low since early September, and on the FT-A, Finland advanced 5.9 per cent in local currency terms last week. However, he believes that the factors which have propelled the market higher  -improved fundamentals, a rise in exports as a result of the markka devaluation, and good eight months' results - will allow the market to continue its recovery, albeit at a more sustainable pace. He adds that sentiment is still positive, and that the opening of restricted shares to foreigners at the start of next year should encourage more interest from overseas. Malaysia, up 4.8 per cent in local currency terms last week in the wake of a pleasing budget which predicted GDP growth of 8 per cent next year, has seen a lot of speculative buying, says Mr Michael Franklin, a director at Kim Eng Securities. Retail investors have been heavily buying shares in the Magnum group, on hopes that it will receive approval from Beijing to run a lottery in China's southern Guangdong province. There has been softness in Tenaga Nasional and Malaysia Telekom, which account for more than one-third of the market, but any downturn in the market could be limited to 10 per cent because of the weight of money waiting to be invested in Malaysian equities. South Africa's flat performance on the week in local currency disguises a fall of 6.8 per cent in dollar terms, as the financial rand continues to weaken on fears of another exodus by foreign companies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change     % change                % change in local currency**    sterling** in US Dlrs**           --------------------------------------------------------------            1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of     Start of                                            1992       1992         1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria     -1.56     -0.07   -16.73     -11.13      +3.41       -15.05 Belgium     -0.92     +2.89    -2.44      -2.56     +13.35        -6.88 Denmark     +1.13     +1.56   -32.32     -28.73     -16.08       -31.06 Finland     +5.91    +30.40    -0.68      +7.52      +8.57       -10.80 France      +2.52     +6.91    -2.14      +1.18     +18.43        -2.71 Germany     -0.43     +3.17    -9.23      -8.19      +6.36       -12.63 Ireland     -1.76     -0.25   -22.45     -20.72      -8.10       -24.50 Italy       -2.51     +8.57   -11.61     -11.61      -9.29       -25.48 Netherlands +0.96     +0.95    +1.23      +2.98     +19.45        -1.87 Norway      -2.18     +4.21   -29.93     -19.21      -9.26       -25.46 Spain       +0.46     +2.71   -22.26     -19.24     -16.54       -31.44 Sweden      +2.30     +9.15   -16.64      -7.33      +4.77       -13.93 Switzerland +1.73     +2.85   +11.00     +13.75     +31.07        +7.66 UK          +1.68     +6.66    +5.39      +8.29      +8.29       -11.04 EUROPE      +1.10     +5.28    -1.83      +0.72      +8.83       -10.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia   -0.33     -3.29   -18.09     -16.48      -6.24       -22.98 Hong Kong   +1.08    +10.57   +48.54     +44.80     +77.32       +45.67 Japan       -0.03     -1.47   -30.60     -24.79      -7.02       -23.62 Malaysia    +4.82    +14.50   +27.47     +21.87     +60.39       +31.76 New Zealand +3.33     +0.90   -17.37     -15.31      +1.07       -16.96 Singapore   +3.47     +8.44    -6.69      -9.54      +9.23       -10.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada      -0.72     +3.09    -8.34      -7.01      +4.56       -14.11 USA         -0.14     +3.72    +7.74      +0.51     +22.34        +0.51 Mexico      +1.14    +11.51   +13.18      +8.05     +28.32        +5.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South   Africa    -0.03     -2.80   -16.93     -15.79     -30.64       -43.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX +0.26     +2.76    -7.85      -7.32      +9.27       -10.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on November 6th 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, and County NatWest Securities.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

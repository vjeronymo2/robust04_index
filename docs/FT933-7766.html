			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Indonesian wood group flotation well received THE flotation of Barito Pacific, the Indonesian wood products company, is likely to be at least five times oversubscribed, say brokers backing the issue. They base their estimates on investors' preliminary commitments. Brokers in Jakarta say large funds, including Global Asset Management and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GSIC), have requested substantial stakes. The issue is intended to raise nearly Dollars 300m and would value the company at over Dollars 2.5bn. The company has been dogged by poor publicity since announcing its flotation in July. It has denied allegations that its parent, Barito Pacific Group, is burdened by debt. It also denies that the issue was damaged last month when Salomon Brothers of the US withdrew as lead foreign co-ordinator of the issue, reportedly on the grounds of inadequate financial disclosure by the company. Barito executives say Salomon Bros has since decided to support the issue as a foreign selling agent, although brokers stress no written agreement had been signed. Brokers close to the deal say investor interest has been strongest in Hong Kong and Singapore, and deny a lack of interest in New York, where only 13 potential investors attended the company's 'road show' presentation last month. Brokers say the GSIC, which has refused to comment on its intentions, has requested a stake of at least Dollars 30m. The presence of GSIC would reassure fund managers reluctant to commit funds without evidence of strong foreign backing for the issue.</p>

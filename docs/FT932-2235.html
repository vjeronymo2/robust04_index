			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ratners attracts support AGENCY brokers traded 19.6m shares in the heavily indebted Ratners Group yesterday, making the stock the third most active in Friday's quiet market. Analysts said rumours that the company would soon announce the results of renegotiations for its banking facilities, as well as sales slightly higher, lay behind the activity, which comes ahead of next Monday's new trading account. Ratners, now in its closed period, refused to comment and said any figures that looked likely to surprise the market would be shown to the Stock Exchange. The shares closed up 2 1/4 at 35 3/4 p. The rally follows heavy trading earlier in the month.</p>

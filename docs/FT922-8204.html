			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Central Guaranty clears hurdle in disposal plan CENTRAL Guaranty Trust, the Canadian banking concern and a key company in the troubled Central Capital financial services group, won shareholder approval to sell two thirds of its business, including assets of CDollars 7bn (USDollars 5.80bn) and 97 bank branches. National Bank of Canada plans to buy 48 Central Guaranty branches in Quebec and the eastern provinces, while Canada Trust, controlled by Imasco, would acquire 49 branches in Ontario and western Canada. Each would pick up CDollars 3.5bn assets and matching liabilities. The company is confident of winning regulatory approval from the federal government. Proceeds of the sale will go to shore up Central Guaranty's capital base. The remaining third of the business, in southern Ontario, includes 61 branches and CDollars 5bn assets. If the federal government refuses to approve the deal, the whole of Central Guaranty would be back in play.</p>

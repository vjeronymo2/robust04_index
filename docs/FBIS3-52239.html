			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "On Ties and Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] The agreement between Israeli and the Vatican to  establish political ties, which was signed in Jerusalem on  Thursday [30 December], is most unfortunate since it amounts to  recognition by the Holy See of Israel's sovereignty over the  Holy City. In article 3 of the agreement, Israel, without  mention of Jerusalem, "recognises the Catholic Church's right to  practise its authority." The fact that the negotiations leading  to the accord were conducted in Jerusalem and the agreement  itself was signed in the city can only reinforce that conclusion.    We understand that the Vatican had come under immense  pressure to conclude such an agreement with Israel by constantly  having been reminded of all the atrocities that were committed  against the Jews in Europe over the centuries, with the blessing  of the church on many occasions. True, the Vatican is certainly  not a superpower in the physical sense of the word. Yet, being  the spiritual leader of 1,000 million Catholic faithfuls, the  Pope, in whatever action he takes, serves as a guiding example  for those millions.    It is therefore disappointing to see the Vatican turning a  blind eye to Israel's description of the occupied Arab lands as  'disputed territories." equally disappointing is to witness the  Vatican's deputy foreign minister, Monsignr Claudio Celli, sign  the document of mutual recognition with his Israeli counterpart  Yossi Beilen in Jerusalem.    The Vatican cannot claim, as it did when it signed the  agreement Thursday, a stranger to all temporal conflicts,"  because it is not. In the past decade and during Pope John  Paul's reign, the Vatican was party to almost every single  "temporal conflict" in Europe, Latin America and Africa. It  chose to oppose and fight communism in Eastern Europe. It sided  with the U.S. in fighting the Sandinista government in  Nicaragua. And Pope John Paul himself did not hesitate to scold  his Sudanese hosts last year for the brutal war in south Sudan.    Muslim and Christian Arabs are disheartened therefore to see  the Vatican take a step towards legitimising Israel's occupation  and annexation of the city and the Holy See's backtracking in  commitment pledged to Arabs and Palestinians. This move at this  crucial time will only strengthen the hands of Israel and weaken  the Palestinian cause at a time where every genuine effort  should be exerted to solve the Middle East peace conflict justly  and honourably.</p>

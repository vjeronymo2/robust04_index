			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Reportage by Chen Jun: "The Recent Price Situation and </F> Price Prospects"]    [Excerpt] Since the beginning of this  year, the Chinese economy has continued to grow rapidly, and  inflation-inducing and constraining factors have been growing  simultaneously. The introduction of price reform measures has  been proceeding in a basically smooth manner, but the increase  in the general price level is still much higher than the target.  State set prices have risen in a planned way; state-guided  prices have risen slightly amid general stability; and  market-regulated prices have risen rather substantially. In  terms of the general trend, changes in the price level have a  sector-based character. Final consumption has risen amid general  stability; increases in prices for production materials have an  obvious character of being caused by the adjustment of  industrial structure and product structure, and are in line with  the trend of market demands; and the continued large increases  in prices for services and labor service have objective causes.  The rate of increase in the general retail price level was high  at the beginning of the year, and has risen recently, thereby  demonstrating a trend to increase on a monthly basis.  <H5>  The Current Price Situation </H5>   1. Extensive price decontrol was carried out in 1992, and  since the beginning of this year, plan-governed prices for  things such as grain, coal, petroleum, and steel have been  further decontrolled, while rates for railway freight transport  have been raised.    Under the State Council's unified plan, prices for most  centrally distributed coal were decontrolled at the beginning of  the year; prices for most steel and iron products have been  decontrolled; on 1 April 30 million metric tons of plan-governed  parity-priced crude oil was transferred to use for extraplan  sales; the grain, chemical fertilizer, cotton, wood pulp, raw  materials for detergent imported with centrally held foreign  exchange under plans have changed into agent-set prices, with  prices regulated by the market; prices for things such as  natural gas, metal alloy products, cement, and communication  exchange equipments have been decontrolled; and the fee  standards for some centrally managed services have been  decontrolled. Since 1 July, the per metric ton/km rate for  railway freight transport has been 1.5 fen higher, representing  an increase of approximately 40 percent.    In the first half of the year, prices for a small number of  commodities involving scarce resources and a small number of  monopoly prices were adjusted. Prices for centrally distributed  timber produced by state-owned forest zones were raised; burning  and transport additions to the electricity price were increased;  ceilings were imposed on prices for chemical fertilizer,  farm-use pesticides, and farm-use films; protective minimum  prices were used for grain ordered by the state and for grain to  be stored for special purposes, and so on.    After prices for grain were decontrolled in some regions  last  year, this year such provinces and autonomous regions as  Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jilin, and Xinjiang and such cities  as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, and Kunming have also  decontrolled grain prices. As marked by Beijing Municipality's  decontrolling sales prices for grain on 10 May, the work of  gradually decontrolling sales prices for grain nationwide, which  had started in the second half of 1992, was completed.    Under the influence of the state's price reform measures,  governments of some regions have also further decontrolled  tertiary industry prices, raised housing rents and fares for  urban public transport, and raised or decontrolled prices for  fuels for civilian use.    After the adoption of those measures, the consumer goods  market has experienced some partial fluctuations and there have  been sporadic occurrences of panic buying, but there has been no  large overall impact on market prices.    2. The increase in the general price level is rather  substantial, and prices for production materials and rates for  services have risen too rapidly; increases in market-regulated  prices are an important factor shaping changes in the general  price level.    In the months of January-August of this year, the nationwide  general index of retail prices rose by 8.5 percent, 8.7 percent,  9.1 percent, 10.9 percent, 12.5 percent, 13.9 percent, 14.9  percent, and 15.1 percent respectively over the same periods  last year, constituting an average increase of 11.8 percent for  the months of January-August; the rates of increase in retail  prices in 35 large and medium cities were 12.5 percent, 12.6  percent, 14.2 percent, 13.9 percent, 16.5 percent, 19 percent,  20.8 percent, and 19.9 percent respectively. The nationwide rate  of increase in employee cost-of-living prices was 13.4 percent  for the same period.    As compared with the same period last year, in  January-August  changes in prices for consumer goods, in terms of the average  monthly situation, were basically normal, except for the 26.2  percent increase in grain prices, 11.3 percent increase in  nonstaple food prices, 40 percent increase in fuel prices, and  29 percent increase in prices for building materials. Prices for  industrial consumer goods were basically stable, with some  increases and decreases. In this respect, apparel prices  increased by 5 percent; prices for daily-use goods increased by  5.8 percent; and prices for entertainment goods and mechanical  and electrical products declined by 1.8 percent. After May,  because of the rise in the retail sales tax, prices for most  industrial consumer goods increased. For a time the swap-market  exchange rate was one dollar to 10.8 yuan, representing an  increase of approximately 70 percent over the beginning of the  year. Because of this development, prices for imported  industrial consumer goods increased substantially, and the gold  jewelry price increased by approximately 40 percent, reaching  140 yuan per gram.    Prices for agricultural products have begun to rise again.  Prices for some oils have increased while prices for some others  are stable; the price of rice began rising in early April, but  the price of wheat has remained weak. Prices for coarse cereals  have risen rather substantially; in mid-July the price of corn  was for a time higher than that of wheat on the grain wholesale  market in Zhengzhou.    Rates for paid services have continued to rise rapidly. As  compared with the same period last year, the increase in  January-August was 28.2 percent. Increases in 35 large and  medium cities were even larger. Nanjing saw an increase of 92  percent in June.    Prices for production materials have increased on a  widespread basis. According to the results of the relevant  agencies' monitoring of market prices for 37 major production  materials in 35 large and medium cities, if January this year is  considered the base period, the average rates of increase for  the months of February-September were respectively 6.8 percent,  15 percent, 22.4 percent, 27.6 percent, 33.6 percent, 36.2  percent, 36 percent, and 35.6 percent and the monthly  chain-increase rates were respectively 6.8 percent, 6.0 percent,  5.3 percent, 4.2 percent, 4.1 percent, 2.2 percent, -0.5  percent, and -1.1 percent. As compared with January, 11-20 July,  when the highest rate of increase occurred, saw a 420 percent  increase in the price of heavy oil, a 11 percent increase in the  price of coal, a 120 percent increase in the price of pig iron,  a 21 percent increase in the price of 10 mm steel plates, a 35  percent increase in the price of 1 mm cold-rolled steel sheets,  a 34 percent increase in the price of cement, a 79 percent  increase in the price of raw pine timber, increases of 3.6-5.8  percent in the prices of nonferrous metals, a 45 percent  increase in the price of soda ash, a 8.5 percent increase in  prices for raw materials for plastics, and a 13 percent increase  in the price of gasoline. Since August, prices for most  production materials have been getting stable. By the end of  September the per metric ton producer price for some  construction-use steel products had fallen by approximately  1,000 yuan, resulting in a price of around 3,000 yuan per ton  and the February 1994 futures price of steels had fallen to  2,800 yuan per ton.    Stocks of agricultural production materials have increased.  Chemical fertilizer and farm-use films are selling slowly, but  prices have not declined because of increases in prices for raw  materials; some chemical fertilizer plants have begun to suspend  production. The price of farm-use diesel fuel is high because it  has been difficult to deliver plan-governed supplies. In  January-August, nationwide prices for agricultural production  materials were up by 13.5 percent over the same period last year.    The rates of increase in the regional general price levels  have been gradually getting closer to one another, and the  differences in the rate of increase between the urban and rural  areas and between the coastal and hinterland regions caused by  the differences in the time of price reform are being reduced.  For January-August the general retail price levels for the urban  and rural areas nationwide rose by 14.5 percent and 12.7 percent  respectively, with the increase for the urban areas being  slightly larger than for the rural areas.    This year the general retail price level has risen  substantially, and the main reason is that there have been  substantial cost-push increases in market-regulated prices.  According to estimates, the general retail price level has risen  by 11.8 percent. In this respect, state-set prices rose by  approximately 19 percent; state-guided prices rose by  approximately 1.5 percent; and market-regulated prices rose by  approximately 11 percent. The impact of increases in  market-regulated prices on prices is approximately 3 percentage  points greater than envisioned in the plans made at the  beginning of the year. [passage omitted]</p>

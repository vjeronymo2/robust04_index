			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Positive reaction to rate cut CURRENCY dealers yesterday reacted positively to the Bundesbank's decision to ease money market rates, pushing the dollar close to DM1.65 against the D-Mark and taking pressure off the French franc in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, writes James Blitz. In early trading in Europe, the dollar peaked at DM1.6490 to the D-Mark as the markets assumed that yesterday's 15 basis point cut in money market rates signalled a greater determination by the Bundesbank to ease policy. However, when the US employment figures for December were issued at around lunchtime in London, there was some disappointment. The non-farm payroll rose by 64,000 last month, but dealers had been looking for a rise of more than 100,000. The November figure was also revised downwards. The dollar therefore drifted down again, bottoming out at DM1.6355. It closed in London at DM1.6375, slightly up on the day. The dollar's strength may have been undermined by comments from one of the Bundesbank council's hard-line members, Mr Reimut Jochimsen. In a news agency interview, Mr Jochimsen said that the Bundesbank had taken into account both the slowing economy and the situation on foreign exchange markets when deciding to ease policy on Thursday. But one dealer said that he was concerned by Mr Jochimsen's comment that doubts remained over the efforts of the Bonn government to reduce the budget deficit. The Bundesbank council member said that changes in the composition of the Bonn government might cause delays in reaching agreement. And there are strong suggestions that the Bundesbank will only ease policy again once the outcome of the budget talks - and the 1993 wage round - become clear. Thursday's small, if significant, cut in rates was enough to take pressure off the French franc yesterday. the currency rallied as high as FFr3.3950 in early trading, but later fell back to close at FFr3.402. Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank, has always taken the view that the franc will avoid a devaluation. But he warned yesterday that there may be new assaults on the currency before the fate of the ERM is finally resolved for this year. 'You have to be cautious,' he said, 'because a 15 basis point cut has not changed the underlying structure of interest rates. The market is right to think that German rate cuts will now be accelerated but wrong to think that they will happen immediately.'</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Inmarsat to form global network Inmarsat, the London-based international mobile satellite communications organisation, will this week launch an affiliate company to build a global personal mobile satellite telecommunications system. The company, one of several ventures seeking to construct a personal mobile satellite network, aims to raise Dollars 1bn in equity from Inmarsat's 75 members by the end of the year to fund the first stage of development and construction. The network is intended to be operational by 2000. It will require 12 intermediate-orbit satellites, terrestrial tracking stations, and commercial partnerships with manufacturers and service providers. The total cost is estimated at Dollars 2.6bn. In addition to the Dollars 1bn of initial equity, the new company will be seeking a further Dollars 400m from strategic partners among satellite and handset manufacturers. No public flotation is planned. Mr Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director-general, said the project was 'bold and ambitious', aiming to service a 'significant niche' opening up in the mobile communications market. Customers for the new network would include international business travellers and local operators wanting to supply telecoms services to areas without adequate infrastructure. The most advanced of Inmarsat's rivals are Iridium and Globalstar, both of which claim to have raised significant investment sums. Iridium's Dollars 3.4bn project was conceived by Motorola, the US-based electronics group; the Dollars 1.8bn Globalstar project is being developed by Loral, the US defence group, and Qualcomm. Although the design of their networks - including the level at which the satellites orbit - varies, the three operators are aiming to provide similar services. With development at an early stage, analysts are cautious as to the prospects of all three operators surviving until launch. Inmarsat uses five operational satellites to provide services to 40,000 customers, most of them in its specialist maritime and aeronautical markets. It views personal mobile communications as a critical growth market. Iridium will be based on a constellation of 66 small 'Leo' satellites. Handsets for all the networks will be dual-mode, allowing calls to be made on local cellular networks where available. A year ago, Motorola raised Dollars 800m from an international consortium, including Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint of the US, Bell Canada and 18 Japanese companies including Sony and Mitsubishi as a first stage towards financing Iridium. More recently, a group of Indian financial institutions agreed to invest Dollars 32m in Iridium, and Comsat, the US satellite operator, is understood to be discussing investing Dollars 70m to acquire a stake in the project.

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: Chasing Moby Dick - Theatre The history of trying to turn novels into plays is not a happy one. Off-hand I can think of only a few successful examples. Two of them are from novels by Henry James. A third is Nicholas Nickelby. So anyone who approaches the dramatisation of Moby Dick should do so with caution. True, it might make an opera. It is, after all, by the same author  -Herman Melville - who nearly 40 years later wrote Billy Budd, which was picked up by Benjamin Britten. And it seems only yesterday that Cameron Mackintosh sought to turn Moby Dick into an eccentric musical. The problem is not only that a large part of the book is an encyclopaedia of whaling and all that goes with it. It is also that the novel is full of symbolism. Captain Ahab may be chasing a whale, but at the same time he is having a battle royal with himself about his motivation. The book also contains a good deal about 19th century capitalism and notions of democracy. Since the symbolism exists on several levels, it is quite hard to translate it to the stage. The Royal Shakespeare Company, playing at its small theatre in Stratford, The Other Place, has gone for the physical approach, so much so that the opening had to be postponed for a week because the leading actor, David Calder as Ahab, strained his back in rehearsal. The production, directed by Gerry Mulgrew, is stunning to watch. Storms, masts, swinging from the ropes are all there, even at one stage the distinct impression of a harpoon being thrown directly into the audience. Set design is by Karen Tennent and, in the way of using every available device, no-one could ask for more. But is it a play? Here there must be doubts. You may say that it does not matter much that we learn very little about whaling, though information has always seemed to me a fascinating part of the book. More important is the lack of characterisation. One of the most interesting figures in the book is Queequeg. In this production, apart from one scene where he climbs out of a coffin, he is just another member of the crew. Calder's Ahab, played with a fine impression of a white-socked wooden leg, looks as if he is capable of being a commanding presence, but in practice seldom is. There is never much expectation that he has any chance of overcoming the whale. The staging is stacked against him. Part of the fault lies in the dialogue adapted by the (in this case) slightly unfortunately named Rod Wooden. Melville relied heavily on the novelist's powers of description and narrative. A good play depends on spoken drama. Here, too much of it is flat. The actions speak louder than the words, which may be a good motto for a general or even a politician, but is an odd basis for a theatrical production. There is an awful lot of action about in our big theatres at present. See, for example, the Royal National Theatre's production of Machinal, which suffers from the same faults as the RSC's Moby Dick.

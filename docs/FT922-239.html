			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Observer: Sneaking out Anyone who has ever turned on a television set in America this year must know who Dan and Dave are and what they put on their feet. Indeed so ubiquitous and intrusive had been Reebok's multi-million dollar campaign promoting the expected Olympic tussle between US decathletes, Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson, that there seemed to be a case for changing the rules at Barcelona - for example, by insisting that all runners wear hobnailed boots or go barefoot. Remarkably these subversive dreams have been suddenly realised. O'Brien  - unbelievably since he probably is the best decathlete in the world - failed to qualify for the US Olympic team last weekend. NBC television, which paid a small fortune for the rights to televise the Olympics, covered the event as if it were a national, rather than a personal, tragedy. Reebok, on the other hand, quickly substituted Dan and Dave on the air with an older commercial, promoting two sportsmen who go by the name of 'rocket'. But it must be wondering if it has lost its marketing touch. For, at the same time as Dan was flunking his pole vault, Roger 'Rocket' Clemens, the wonderful Boston baseball pitcher, was being hit all over the ball park in his worst performance of the year.</p>

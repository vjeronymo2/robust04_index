			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> L.A. PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER SOCIETY AT GINDI  </P> <P> The handsomely constructed program offered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic  Chamber Music Society at Gindi Auditorium on Monday was an occasion for taking  pleasure in the music itself, without the distracting presence of big-name  performers and the high expectations -- and frequently, disappointments -- they  engender.  </P> <P> It was an evening to savor Poulenc, Faure and, to a lesser extent, Prokofiev.  </P> <P> Oboist David Weiss, bassoonist David Breidenthal and pianist Alpha Hockett  Walker set the tone by flicking out Poulenc's 1926 Trio in a neatly balanced  reading, responsive to the composer's wit and unconcerned with whether his  lyric statements are sentimental or parodies of sentimentality. A big tune is a  big tune, and they projected the whopper in the middle movement with becoming  breadth.  </P> <P> Faure's C-minor Piano Quartet ended the evening on a different Gallic note,  surging, sighing and singing rapturously in the hands of pianist Armen  Guzelimian -- as stylish and forceful a chamber pianist as this part of the  world offers -- and an exceptionally polished Philharmonic string ensemble  consisting of violinist Mitchell Newman, violist Evan Wilson and cellist Barry  Gold.  </P> <P> The concert's problems were concentrated at its midsection, in Prokofiev's  duskily gorgeous String Quartet in B minor.  </P> <P> Led with slapdash brilliance, at breakneck tempos by violinist Mischa  Lefkowitz, the composer's chamber masterpiece was rudely cuffed about in its  first movement and came unglued in the second.  </P> <P> Second violinist Yun Tang was able to sustain the frenetic pace without damage  to her sweet, firm tone and violist Ralph Fielding stayed the course with honor  largely intact. But cellist Stephen Custer buckled under the strain, while  Lefkowitz proved his own as well as the ensemble's most potent adversary,  forcing his tone mercilessly and playing havoc with intonation.  </P> <P> The ensemble did settle down to a coherent account of the slow, exquisitely sad  finale. But a third of Prokofiev's quartet isn't enough.HERBERT GLASS  </P></p>

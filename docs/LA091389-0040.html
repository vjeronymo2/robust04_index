			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron has cautioned Israeli soldiers battling the  Palestinian uprising against the use of excessive force, a military spokesman  said in Jerusalem. Lt. Gen. Shomron said the army faces an exceptionally  complex and sensitive mission in the occupied areas but that soldiers should  exercise self-control and avoid unreasonable measures. He cited examples of the  latter as beating prisoners in custody or interfering with ambulances  evacuating Arab wounded. "You should avoid as much as possible hitting a man on  his head or other sensitive body parts," he added. He said that force may be  used to disperse violent protests and to make arrests.  </P></p>

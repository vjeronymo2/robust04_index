			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORDINANCE AIMED AT BUILDERS DROPPED  </P> <P> The Avalon City Council has voted down a proposal to require builders of new  commercial projects to provide housing for half of their workers.  </P> <P> The 3-2 vote reversed an earlier decision by the council to adopt the ordinance  when it was introduced two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The ordinance would have required new commercial developments with 10 or more  employees to provide housing for 50% of those employees during the peak  Catalina Island tourist season in August.  </P> <P> During a public hearing last week, however, residents and council members  expressed concern about the wording of the ordinance and argued that it did not  set housing requirements for existing businesses that may expand.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Sometimes, a Mars bar just isn't enough - London LIKE those British walkers stranded in the Caucasus, the stock market has been getting by this week on a handful of Mars bars and a bit of melted snow. Not surprisingly, it has failed to put on weight in the process: the FT-SE 100 index closed yesterday at 2824.4, up only 2.6. The Mars bars were the week's tasty economic statistics; the melting snow came with indications that customer attitudes to price rises were thawing. The most important economic figures were Wednesday's statistics for manufacturing output in February, which showed a 1.2 per cent rise over the previous month. The rise - the third successive monthly increase - took manufacturing output to its highest level for 18 months. Other equally tasty indicators were a sharp improvement in business expectations of sales in the current quarter, recorded in a survey of 2,000 companies by Dun &amp; Bradstreet; and a healthy rise in air traffic in March. Estate agents reported good business over the Easter weekend, traditionally the start of the year's house-hunting season. Customers' softer attitude to price rises showed up in announcements from basic materials companies. British Steel announced its second round of price increases this year, after price rises implemented in recent weeks were accepted by customers. And RMC and Blue Circle said they planned to raise prices for building materials such as sand, gravel and concrete. These signs provided welcome confirmation of the recovery the stock market has been expecting since sterling left the ERM seven months ago this week. They were greeted as appetising mouthfuls: the FT-SE 100 index jumped 25 points on Tuesday, the day the Dun &amp; Bradstreet numbers were announced, and British Steel gained 16 per cent on the week, to close at 94 3/4 p. But the market is still looking for the more lasting sustenance that will allow it to move from the trading range in which it has been trapped since January. Perhaps it has been looking in the wrong place. That is the implicit message of the equity analysts at SG Warburg Securities, who point to an apparent irrationality in the way investors have been treating different sectors. The chart shows the best performing sector of the past seven months, Contracting and Construction, which has outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index by 45 per cent since Britain left the ERM. Some of the individual stocks in the sector have doubled. The Warburg analysts point out, though, that there is as yet no evidence of construction activity recovering. Any revival in housebuilding, they say, is likely to be swamped by further falls elsewhere. 'This must raise questions about the scale of the rally in the construction sector since last autumn,' they add. Other sectors where there is more substantial evidence of economic improvement have yet to show the same stock market performance. The big gainers in terms of manufacturing output, according to Wednesday's figures, have been the pharmaceuticals and computer industries. Capital equipment producers have also done well: investment goods output was 2.6 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1993 than in the preceding three months, and 4.1 per cent higher than a year ago. In stock market terms, though, there is little sign of companies in these sectors significantly outperforming their peers. Indeed, the pharmaceuticals companies continue to be the market's dogs, as evidenced by Glaxo's 3.3 per cent fall in heavy volume on Tuesday merely because US fund manager told a New York magazine that he disliked the stock. The Warburg analysts put down these anomalies to investors' recent obsession with high-yielding shares, an enthusiasm which they view as misplaced, since there is little dividend growth to come from such companies in the foreseeable future. 'At best many of the sectors and stocks which have led performance tables recently are perhaps best regarded as 'fixed interest' securities in yield terms,' they say, rather sniffily. The comparison with bonds is an interesting one, since it goes some way to explain what has happened since September. The stock market slid last summer after its post-election rally because it had started to fear that sterling's ERM membership would prove a Doomsday machine for British industry. Devaluation dismantled the machine. High-yielding shares, the ones closest to the machine's jaws, benefited most. 'Fixed-interest' securities they may be; but in bond market terms they had just received a significantly upgraded rating. Their subsequent share-price performance reflects that fact. Still, seven months is a long time in stock market terms; by now you might have expected investors to have moved on, to be looking for those specific sectors that stand to do well from the pattern of this particular recovery. Instead, the market still seems to be looking backward. It has an excuse. The awful effects of the past three years are still showing up in company figures: Forte cut its dividend this week for the first time in two decades, reporting pre-tax profits after exceptionals for the year to January 31 of Pounds 164m, propped up by the Pounds 275m sale of its Gardner Merchant contract catering business. And Queens Moat Houses, still suspended, dropped out of the FT-SE Mid 250 index. The change produces a one-off reduction in the index of 10 1/2 points  -a reminder that, even though the stock may eventually come back to the market at a higher figure, some Pounds 439m of shareholders' wealth is up in the air. Queens Moat is still trying to make its figures add up; its shareholders are on the accountant's version of a walking tour of the Caucasus.</p>

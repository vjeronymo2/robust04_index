This will be the highest "advisory" organ serving the Political  Bureau, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and  the State Military Commission when they formulate policies and  handle important issues at home and abroad; it will be led by  the Political Bureau and be directly responsible to the  Political Bureau, the State Council, and the CPC Central  Military Commission.  <H3>  Wan Li and Gu Mu Suggest Establishing a "Staff Headquarters"  of the Party, Government, and Army </H3>   News from Zhongnanhai: A central-level "staff headquarters"  of the party, government, and army is imminent.    It will be the highest "advisory" organ serving the  Political  Bureau, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, the State  Council, the CPC Central Military Commission, and the State  Military Commission when they formulate policies and handle  important issues at home and abroad.    According to information, the idea of establishing such a  consultative organ was first proposed to Deng Xiaoping by Wan Li  and Gu Mu after the Eighth National People's Congress. At that  time, thought was given to inviting some retired party,  government, and army officials to join the organ. Deng Xiaoping  thought it was a good idea to establish such an organ but did  not agree with the idea of inviting retired persons to join it.  He raised five points: First, the organ should play a role in  assisting work and proposing strategies; second, it must be led  by the Political Bureau; third, members should be strong and  experienced and they must include some comrades from the  Political Bureau Standing Committee and the Central Military  Commission; fourth, no old and retired persons should join it  because it must not have the nature of the Central Advisory  Commission; and fifth, the work and functions of the organ are  to be completely internal.  <H3>  "CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office" To  Consist of One Office and Six Groups </H3>   In the middle of August, the Political Bureau discussed the  membership composition and work nature of the planned "CPC  Central Committee Policy Consultation Office" (another  suggestion was that it should be called the "Policy Leadership  Office). It was decided that the office should be located  within the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and that 80 senior  and middle-ranking cadres should be transferred from the CPC  Central Committee; the State Council ministries, commissions,  and offices; and the CPC Central Military Commission to  participate in the work. Thereafter, the Political Bureau  thought that the organ should not be too clumsy and in principle  they should all hold the posts concurrently and no duties or  titles will be created for them. It was initially decided that  the idea should lead to the establishment of one office and six  groups.    One office: The CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation  Office.    Six Groups: First -- party affairs work group; second --  economic construction work group; third -- social work group;  fourth -- national defense work group; fifth -- international  relations work group; and sixth -- planning work group.  <H3>  Fifteen Incumbent Senior Party, Government, and Army  Personnel Will Participate in the Work </H3>   Since 15 November, active work has been done to prepare for  this organ. According to information, 15 incumbent senior  party, government, and army personnel are participating in the  work, including Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, Zou Jiahua, Zhang Zhen, Yu  Yongbo, Wang Ruilin, Tao Siju, Ceng Qinghong, and Qi Huaiyuan.  Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, Zou Jiahua, and Zhang Zhen will  participate in the work of the office.    It has been alleged that during the period of the Third  Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin once disclosed the message that,  after discussions and studies by the Political Bureau, it has  been initially decided that a CPC Central Committee Policy  Consultation Office will be established, led by the Political  Bureau; the office will be directly responsible to the Political  Bureau, the State Council, and the CPC Central Military  Commission.    At the senior level, some people think that such a move will  cause things to overlap and make the already redundant central  organ even more redundant. Some people express support for the  establishment of this "general staff headquarters," saying that  it can play a liaison role between the party, government, and  army, and offer plans and strategies on the macrofoundation  incorporating the party, government, and army, to assist the  central leadership in formulating policies and handling  important issues at home and abroad.</p>

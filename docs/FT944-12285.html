			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Spy scapegoats The Senate intelligence committee's denunciation yesterday of Mr James Woolsey, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, was predictable - and, predictably, a little unfair. He stands accused of insufficient punishment of those responsible for Aldrich Ames, the Soviet mole, whose eight years' spying for Moscow wreaked havoc in the CIA's network of foreign agents. The Ames case did not happen on Mr Woolsey's watch, and it is the sort of nightmare experience which has visited all intelligence agencies, including the British, over the years. But these days scapegoats are expected and demanded. What the report does correctly highlight is a mindset in the CIA inherited from the past, which is much less relevant to the post-cold war world. It also raises reasonable questions about the role of intelligence agencies these days. A wholesale revolution in attitudes may be asking too much, but change there must be: in accountability, in methods, in targets, and in psychology. Throughout the cold war, western intelligence agencies were focused above all on the threat from their east bloc rivals, the KGB, and its even more efficient offspring such as the East German spy network. Spying on each other was a mutually self-justifying operation which almost certainly led both sides to exaggerate the threat from the other. The track record of the CIA and the rest of the western agencies in failing to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union indicates just how much they suffered from self-delusion. It must be said that whereas the failures of the intelligence community are depressingly obvious - the CIA's track record in Haiti is only the latest example - its successes can by definition not be trumpeted from the rooftops. Just to cite one example, the Lancaster House constitutional conference which brought peace and independence to Zimbabwe would almost certainly have been much less successful without the efficient eavesdropping of British spies. Today's threats are far less predictable than they were in the cosy cold war years. Proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is perhaps the greatest single threat; forecasting of highly destabilising border wars and civil wars is another big task for the intelligence fraternity. The pursuit of international terrorists and drug traffickers is a role which could well be shared with more conventional police agencies. These are all tasks which certainly require a continuing intelligence capacity. But the relatively dispersed nature of the threats means that agencies like the CIA can and should become much more accountable in their work. Much of it is after all based on thorough and intelligent analysis of available information, not bribing and bugging. And the more such agencies learn a psychology of openness and accountability, the less opportunity there will be for the likes of Aldrich Ames to betray them.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Union offers Lufthansa pay cut GERMANY'S DAG white-collar trade union turned traditional negotiating tactics on their head at the weekend with an offer to accept longer working hours and less pay for its high-flying members. The surprise initiative, revealed yesterday, came at Sunday's preliminary pay talks for the 60,000 employees of Lufthansa, the loss-making state airline, which will shortly announce a cost-cutting programme expected to include up to 10,000 job losses. DAG, which earlier this year backed the oTV union in Germany's longest public-sector strike since the 1970s, said its aim was to help restore Lufthansa's fortunes. The union's proposal, made after a hard-fought 1992 pay round between unions and employees in all sectors of industry, is the first suggestion that appeals for wage restraint from the government, Bundesbank and economists may have had some impact. However, Lufthansa is a special case. Many companies are in difficulties, but few can match the national carrier's DM542m (Pounds 192m) loss in the first half of this year, or its expected 12-month deficit of well over DM1bn. If directors, management and other non-union employees followed the DAG lead, the company could save DM500m a year, the union claimed. Lufthansa, caught unprepared, said only that the offer 'could be an important contribution to the package of measures being prepared by the board'. All proposals would be considered at the formal pay talks for the airline's workforce starting on August 26. The more militant and bigger oTV union said it saw no reason to change pay standards. It was wrong to put all the blame for Lufthansa's crisis on wages and staffing levels, officials said yesterday. Union leaders have already been given copies of the plan, which spells out the need for drastic economies. Lufthansa officials claim personnel costs are 30 per cent higher than at British Airways, and administrative staff have increased 47 per cent since 1986. Details of the DAG offer were not available yesterday, but they included 'adjustments' to overtime pay rates, and the sacrifice this year of the '13th month's pay' Christmas bonus. In return, the union said employees of the airline's internal flight subsidiary, Lufthansa Express, and its other undertakings should be paid and employed on the same terms as workers in the parent group. The star of Mr Walter Momper, who shot to international prominence as mayor of Berlin during Germany's unification celebrations, dived below the horizon yesterday morning. 'The man with the red scarf' resigned as chairman of the city-state's Social Democrat party after a short, sharp clash over his new job as general manager of Ellinghaus, a building and property company with ambitions in the east.</p>

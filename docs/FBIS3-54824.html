"Under a plan submitted by the Russian counterpart, nuclear  fuel should be removed from Paldiski by June 30 this year," Mark  Sinisoo said.    Russia has thus far followed the timetable of dismantling  nuclear equipment, Sinisoo added. At the end of last year,  Russia sent equipment and materials for dismantling nuclear  devices to Estonia and another wagon is due to arrive in January.    "Following removal of nuclear fuel, Paldiski does not need  Russian military presence and the so-called military dismantling  should be decided at Estonian-Russian negotiations," Sinisoo  said while adding that Paldiski must be integrated into Estonia.

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Labour will keep personal equity plans THE LABOUR party has given an explicit commitment that it will not abolish personal equity plans if it wins the election. Peps allow individuals to shelter a limited amount of equity investments from capital gains tax and income tax. Mr Chris Smith, a Labour treasury spokesman, told the Financial Times: 'We believe Peps do have a role to play within the savings and investment market. 'We don't necessarily share the present government's view that they are the best thing since sliced bread, but nonetheless they have their uses, and we don't have any intention of sweeping them away.' Another Labour spokesman said: 'We have no plans to abolish Peps or substantially change the way in which they operate.' Labour has maintained the option of abolishing Peps since they were introduced without making any direct commitment. It had always said, however, that tax reliefs on existing Peps would be honoured and that no changes would be made retrospectively. However, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokesman, told a trade newspaper last year 'we would not continue the tax relief to Peps'. She now supports the policy suggested by Mr Smith. Mr Smith has signalled the evolution in Labour's attitude in recent interviews and has told fund managers involved in marketing Peps that he did not want to abolish them. Peps, introduced by the then chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson in his 1986 Budget, have been available since January 1987. The maximum investment in a standard Pep in any one tax year is Pounds 6,000, and an additional Pounds 3,000 can be put into a Pep which holds shares in only one company. A maximum of Pounds 3,000 of the Pep allowance can be held in unit and investment trusts. Mr Smith remains critical of how Peps operate, because they act as a strong incentive for direct equity investment. He said: 'What we might wish to consider, and this obviously depends on the economic circumstances at the time, is bringing up other forms of savings to match the kind of benefits that Peps have at the moment.' He said this could be similar to the extended Pep or 'XPep' advocated by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. These could include cash deposits, bonds or collective funds. By the end of the 1990-91 tax year, 1.47m plans had been taken out, in which Pounds 3.88bn had been invested since 1987. Heavy demand this year, fuelled by the widespread belief that Labour would abolish Peps, is expected to lead to a strong increase over the Pounds 1.6bn invested in them in 1990-91.</p>

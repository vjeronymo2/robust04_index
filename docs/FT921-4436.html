			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trustees appointed to Nadir estate Bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, have gone a step further with the appointment of trustees to his estate. The Official Receivers Office has appointed Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, to take control of his assets. He will shortly take over the estate formally. Den Norske Bank petitioned for proceedings against Mr Nadir last November in respect of a loan for which he had stood guarantee of Pounds 1.5m. Other creditors include the Inland Revenue and four securities houses which have claims against Mr Nadir arising from his purchases of large amounts of Polly Peck shares in the final weeks before the company went into administration in October 1990. Touche Ross, administrators to Polly Peck, have also served a Mareva injunction on Mr Nadir claiming the repayment of Pounds 378m of funds allegedly belonging to the company. Mr Nadir's assets include some Mediterranean property on which there are secured creditors, and his interests in a number of companies, which have been not given a value.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Iraq fires on four American aircraft IRAQI anti-aircraft guns yesterday fired on four US aircraft patrolling in the United Nations air exclusion zone over Kurdistan, writes George Graham from Washington. Pentagon officials said the F-16 fighters had dropped bombs on the Iraqi anti-aircraft battery and returned to their base in Turkey without damage. The Iraqi news agency reported an Iraqi soldier was wounded. Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, said the US remained committed to enforcing both the northern no-fly zone declared by the UN in 1991 to protect the Kurds from Iraqi hostilities and the similar southern zone intended to protect the mainly Shi'ite marsh Arabs. The clash is the first involving the US since the day of President Bill Clinton's inauguration on January 20, when US planes bombed an Iraqi radar considered to be threatening a French Mirage aircraft.</p>

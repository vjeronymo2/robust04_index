In the meeting, the president referred to the common  cultural  and historic bonds between Iran and China and described the  further expansion of joint cooperation between the two countries  for strengthening peace and stability in the world, particularly  in the Asian continent, as important. He said: Playing a more  active role on international scenes and confronting foreign  powers' interference in Asia requires further planning,  cooperation, and exchange of views among regional countries,  particularly the two big countries of Iran and China.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said the lack of a serious  confrontation against the political and economic problems of the  world today are caused by the illusive perceptions in power  domination and the creation of new power blocs in the world. He  said: The threat against the territorial integrity of an  independent country such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the heart of  Europe, and the continuation of the occupation of the  Palestinian territory by the usurper Israel, which each day  opens a new page of aggression and massacre of Muslims in its  shameful book of history and prevails its anti-peace nature, as  well as many problems that exist in the countries of Central  Asia and regional countries, mean that Asian countries and the  Third World -- which have a mighty power in terms of political  and economic and manpower resources -- must no longer allow the  domination seeking powers to interfere under the pretext of  mediation to solve regional problems and disputes; they should  themselves take the initiative.    The president also stressed the need for further cooperation  between Iranian and Chinese experts to explore ways to further  deepen the two countries' relations.    China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister conveyed  the best greetings of the Chinese Government and people to the  Iranian Government and people. He said: Both Iran and China  are among the ancient and civilized countries who are connected  together by deep historial roots.    He added: After the the Islamic revolution in Iran, the two  countries had common political viewpoints on many international  issues. As a result, the trend of the expansion of bilateral  relations has accelerated in many fields, especially in economic  and commercial fields.    Mr. Qian said it is necessary for the developing countries  to  confront the domineering ambitions of world arrogance. For this  reason, he said, China is determined to further expand its  cooperation with countries such as Iran.    China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister stressed  the necessity of strengthening stability and tranquillity in  Central Asian countries for the sake of the economic and social  reconstruction of those countries. He said: China supports the  expansion of the national economies of those countries, and also  favors closer cooperation with Iran for solving regional issues,  including among the neighboring countries.</p>

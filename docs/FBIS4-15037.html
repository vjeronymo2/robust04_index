			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program  Network in Ukrainian at 1200 GMT on 5 April carries in its  "Nezalezhnist" [Independence] program a 40-minute live interview  with Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, conducted  by Serhiy Omelchuk.    Omelchuk first asks about relations between Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk and Plyushch, which lately seem to  have become "somewhat strained." He says: "Mr. Kravchuk  recently said: Ivan Stepanovych and I do not disagree in  principle. Do you share this opinion of the president?"    Plyushch replies: "First of all, I would sincerely like to  say that I completely share this opinion and believe that not  only do we not disagree in principle, but Leonid Makarovych and  I have virtually never had any strategic differences about who  we are and where we are going. Leonid Makarovych and I have had  tactical differences."    Answering a question on forecasts of the run-off  parliamentary election outcome, Plyushch says: "I would like to  say, you know that this is no longer a forecast but almost  reality. It was a forecast when I met European and world  representatives who came to observe our elections. I then said  I was convinced that elections would take place in the majority  of constituencies. I am happy -- I did not expect it and I am  also pleasantly surprised -- that elections took place in all  450 constituencies." He goes on: "It is now my deep conviction  -- which was also demonstrated by the experience of the 34  constituencies where the elections were held on 2-3 April, when  29 out of 34 constituencies did elect their people's deputies --  this is why I have every ground to believe that a viable Supreme  Council of Ukraine will have been elected (?some time) by 10  April."    Having praised the political wisdom of the people of  Ukraine,  Plyushch reiterates that the election will produce a capable  team coming to the newly-elected legislature.    Asked how soon he thinks that the new parliament will be  convened, Plyushch replies that, after the final run-offs on 10  April, he expects the results to be known on 12-13 April. He  continues: "According to the law, the Central Electoral  Commission has 10 days to verify the validity and legitimacy of  elections. Thus, ideally, we will have the final results by 20  April. Then someone, probably the Supreme Council Presidium,  which will meet on 12 April, has to make a decision on the  convocation of a new session, the first session of the  newly-elected Supreme Council. The law says it should take place  within two months of the election. Imagine, two months from 10  April is 10 June. I think it would be proper to act in  accordance with the situation in society. This situation, I  believe, requires the soonest possible convocation of the first  session of the new parliament, and I think a decision will be  made to convene it within a fortnight."    Considering the number of public holidays in early May, May  Day, Orthodox Easter,and Victory Day, he suggests that the new  parliament session should start around 12-15 May.    Omelchuk then asks what the parliament speaker believes the  future status of the Ukrainian Republic will be -- presidential,  parliamentary, or a mixed one -- and where he feels the  parliament's preference lies.    Plyushch replies: "As a citizen and a deputy of the new  parliament, but not more than that, I believe our Republic so  far has been neither presidential, parliamentary, nor a mixed  one. It has been too jumbled up. I don't want you to think I  am blaming the Supreme Council, the president, the presidium or  anyone else. This is the way that society has been. I think we  did the right thing to introduce the presidency, and the fact  that Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk was elected the first popular  president was the best option, but then the president had to  take over executive power and establish order. The law on local  self-government that was adopted made it difficult because it  did not allow him to directly control the regions. That's why  the president wanted to set up vertical structures to implement  legislation, and we passed the law on presidential  representatives. Some would say it was redundant, but I don't  think so."    Discussing further the problems of the power structure,  Plyushch points out that, although necessary at the time,  presidential representatives ran into conflict with the law on  regional self-government and interfered with the powers of local  councils. "We need a clear-cut system of executive and  representative power in the regions, from the village to the  oblast, before we deal with the Republic." To that effect, he  says, the Supreme Council has passed three laws, on the  formation of local bodies of power and self- government, on the  status of local council deputies, and on local council  elections. "What is taking place is a political reform through  which the people, from the village to Kiev, will receive full  power. The Republic's legislature plus local executive bodies  will provide the people with full power. As for the president,  he is already popularly elected."    Omelchuk then asks: "Some politicians believe that it is  expedient to hold the election of the president of Ukraine after  the new constitution of Ukraine is adopted. What is your  opinion?"    Plyushch replies: "Well, first, there is nothing new about  this view, you know. There is a variety of opinions, you know.  Some believe that the fundamental law -- the Constitution --  should be adopted first and then other laws should be adopted.  This is the (?lawyers') opinion. There is another one  affirming that it cannot be done.    "I say that it is good that there are opinions. We,  however, have worked on all these opinions jointly with the  president. You known that we have been working as cochairmen of  the constitutional commission for two years. For the last two  years now, we have been working as cochairmen and have been  trying to do everything to bring about the Constitution as soon  as possible. We submitted it for consideration in its first  reading, however, and received 70,000 comments and proposals.  How could we not discuss them? By the time we had systemized  them, the Constitution looked entirely different. We published  it for consideration in its second reading. Already we have  received over 10,000 comments and proposals on the latest  version that was published.    "That is why one cannot be in a hurry with the constitution  and I believe that this Supreme Council's deputies did the right  thing in that they initiated and worked up the draft and passed  it to the next (?Supreme Council). That is, our constitution  will already have been worked on by the Supreme Councils of two  convocations. Otherwise, had it been adopted by that Supreme  Council, people would have said it was adopted by the  procommunist Supreme Council. Now, this will be a Supreme  Council elected in the independent, democratic Ukraine and this  Supreme Council will see whether it is expedient to present  separate provisions in the constitution to a referendum. This  will be decided by the Supreme Council.    "In other words, I am not a supporter of those linking the  presidential election with the new Constitution."    The focus of the interview then switches to the economy. On  the devaluation of the population's savings, Plyushch states:  "Once we are delimiting functions, one should clearly realize  that this devaluation was caused by the situation, rather than  by the Supreme Council. I could not even say this was done by  the government. Regardless of who did this, however, this is  sheer robbery of the population of Ukraine by the power  structures and by the existing situation." He continues: "The  government must exclude from privatization and estimate that  part of state property and means of production which are subject  to privatization, so as to sell them and pay some money into  people's savings accounts and index-link their deposits so that  they will correspond with the purchasing power of the value of  the money that was in their savings accounts on 1 January 1992  when we became a state."    Asked to say when the people's living standards are likely  to  improve tangibly, Plyushch responds: "I believe that the people  will see an improvement in their economic well-being as the  national economy rises, while the national economy is impossible  to run without introducing national currency and regulating the  financial and credit system."    He adds: "I believe the new Supreme Council will need a  maximum of one month to form a new government and it will take  the new government until the second half of this year to look  round and present its stabilization program and a program which  would provide for the introduction of our own currency. It is  then that stabilization will be perceptible."    Omelchuk's next questions concern the situation in Ukraine's  southern and eastern regions, following plebiscites in Crimea,  Donetsk, and Lugansk on their status in Ukraine. Asked to  comment on the legislative confrontation between Kiev and  Crimea, Plyushch says: "Nobody can blame the Russian-speaking  population in Crimea who came to live there and who now say that  economic integration with Russia is the only way, and nobody can  blame the 30 percent of Ukrainian speakers in Northern Crimea.  President Boris Yeltsin and a Supreme Council delegation signed  an interstate agreement on 16 November 1992, and a trilateral  statement has been signed by presidents Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and  Clinton recognizing the states' existing borders without any  territorial claims. At the interstate level, Crimea is not an  issue. It is an issue in Crimea itself, and among certain  political forces in Russia. I believe that this issue will be  resolved in Ukraine's favor only when Ukraine's national economy  will be more helpful to Crimea's economy." Efforts have already  been made to assist Crimea with the spring sowing campaign.    Plyushch continues: "The Crimean population can see it for  themselves: If they do join Russia tomorrow, then what? Russia  has its own problems. Even the famous ZIL, the Likhachev  automobile plants, closed down yesterday. Will it come and open  a plant in Crimea? Only Meshkov can think so, because he is  promised financial aid from certain chauvinist forces if he  rules the right way. We'll see in a year what kind of aid he  gets. I would be only pleased if some kind of aid comes to  Crimea from Russia, at least in the way of oil.    "How can we make Crimea comply with the law? Well, if  someone does not comply with the law, than legal measures have  to be taken. If the president of Ukraine has issued a decree and  this decree is not obeyed, then the president's next step should  contain measures against the one who did not obey."    Commenting on the issue of dual citizenship and two state  languages, debated in east Ukraine, Plyushch says that a state  cannot have two emblems, two citizenships and two languages.  "This would only contribute to confrontation between our  regions. If we continue with these referendums, then we will  end up with one emblem in west Ukraine, another emblem in  Lugansk, and what will the state emblem be in Kiev? Something  else?    "People need a good life. If we had a good life, I am deeply  convinced, there would be no questions about the language, the  emblems, and the citizenship. We have failed to provide this  kind of life, and people feel uncertain."    Asked about the prospect of Ukraine joining the ruble zone  in the CIS, Plyushch replies: "There will be no ruble zone ever  again. Forget it. There are not enough rubles to go around in  Russia. They promised to cook up a ruble zone for Belarus, six  months have passed, and nothing has happening. If Belarus is  part of the Russian banking system, Belarus will be a branch of  the Russian Central Bank, but I don't think Belarus will agree  to this. Maybe only certain forces in Belarus, but not the  country on the whole, because that would be the end of a nation.    "But if you mean the single economic space, we never left  it.  Ukraine, thank God, already has a surplus of butter, meat, and  other products. Why not sell them to Russia or Uzbekistan?  They have to be paid for, but neither Ukraine nor Russia has  the means to pay. And that's a different matter altogether."    In conclusion, Ivan Plyushch thanks Ukrainians for voting in  the first round of elections and urges them to come to the polls  to elect the rest of the parliament on 10 April for the sake of  reform and stabilization.</p>

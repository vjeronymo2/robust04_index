			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina asserted that the nearly $1 billion debt Cuba  has with Argentina "is not a tabled issue," but that Fidel  Castro's administration "does not have the necessary money to  repay it."    After meeting with Senate bloc leaders on 13 April, Robaina  said: "In our view, the fact that the debt issue has not been  tabled means that we will assess all possibilities and  mechanisms so as to include some items like medicines and  agroindustrial input."    Robaina was received after the meeting by President Carlos  Menem at the Olivos presidential residence. The Cuban foreign  minister noted that his trip to Argentina "mainly seeks to  explain the investment opportunities Cuba offers." To this  effect, he expected to hold talks with local business people  from different sectors.    The diplomat -- who headed the Cuban Communist Youth General  Secretariat in the 80's and is now considered one of Fidel  Castro's "dauphins" [delfines] -- said the opening of the  country to foreign capital "is part of the situation Cuba is  going through, which can be labeled difficult."    He stated that this economic opening drive also applies to  the political sphere. Regarding this, he said: "Cuba is  willing to take any subject to the negotiating table as long as  it does not affect its independence and sovereignty."    "Opening does not mean going backward in education, health  care, science, or sports because these are achievements that we  are not prepared to negotiate," he remarked.    Robaina explained: "The concept of a normal political  opening in any country that lives under normal conditions cannot  be applied in the case of Cuba, since it continues to be a  besieged stronghold and cannot afford to lose its unity."    Commenting on the possibilities of a meeting between  Presidents Carlos Menem and Fidel Castro at the next  Ibero-American summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, in May, Robaina said it will depend on the heads of  state's respective agendas.    "There are no concrete plans for a meeting, but we keep an  open mind about it and the practical possibilities of holding  such a meeting will depend on the meeting date and on Menem's  and Castro's respective agendas in Cartagena," he pointed out.    With regard to trade relations between both countries, the  Cuban foreign minister said: "There are many opportunities and  our efforts are geared to areas like tourism, medical and  paramedical services, biotechnology, and agriculture.  Nevertheless, we have not yet discussed any project in  particular."    Robaina stated: "Cuba has opened the country to foreign  investment as part of a huge package of measures that are under  way. This is precisely what we intend to explain to Argentine  entrepreneurs. In this lies the fundamental objective of our  visit."</p>

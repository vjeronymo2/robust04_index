			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINDING YOUR OWN COMFORT ZONE IN ONE GEM OF A COUNTRY  </P> <P> Botswana is a peaceful country of 1.2 million people, most of whom live along  the eastern border with South Africa.  </P> <P> If all you saw was the 1980 South African movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy," you  might think of this country as primitive and backward. Most of Botswana is  blanketed by the Kalahari Desert, where bushmen still hunt with arrows as they  have for centuries.  </P> <P> But Botswana also has one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, mainly  because it provides 25% of the world's gem diamonds.  </P> <P> My Okavango excursion was the highlight of a 12-day loop through southern  Africa. It began in Harare, Zimbabwe. We traveled south to Francistown,  Botswana, northeast to Nata and west to Maun. After the canoe voyage we headed  northeast to Chobe National Park and on to Victoria Falls.  </P> <P> This trip was the rough way to see the Okavango Delta, and it's not for  everyone. There are many more comfortable ways to go. Whether you fly to Maun  and stay in a luxury camp or drive in a Land-Rover and camp out, you won't  likely be disappointed once you get to the delta.  </P> <P> Getting There: If you're driving, you need a four-wheel-drive vehicle; the  190-mile stretch from Nata, which is halfway between Francistown and Maun, is  made of a chalky gravel. Coming from Zimbabwe, as I was, Francistown is the  first major town, about 58 miles southwest of the Zimbabwe border.  </P> <P> A good stop-off point is Nata Lodge (Private Bag 10, Francistown) six miles  south of Nata. The lodge has good accommodations and a nice restaurant. I  stayed in the campground behind the lodge for five pula (about $2.50). Thatched  huts and tented rooms also are available. Tented rooms cost slightly more than  the campground; the huts are 60 pula ($30) a night.  </P> <P> If you're flying to Maun you will likely have to go through Gabarone, the  capital of Botswana. Carriers serving the area include Air Botswana, British  Airways, Zambia Airways, Air Zimbabwe and South African Airways.  </P> <P> Safari Options: Once you reach Maun there are basically two ways to see the  delta: the mobile or the fly-in safaris. I took a mobile safari. We took our  own camping gear and provisions.  </P> <P> Island Safari Lodge (P.O. Box 116, Maun, Botswana 300) charges 40 pula a day  for a three-person canoe and 95 pula for a return motorboat trip into the  delta. We stayed in the Island Safari campground for five pula, but Island  Safaris also offers lodging (47.50 pula per person double, 80 pula per person  single), a restaurant (dinner is 18 pula), a bar, a swimming pool and a little  movie theater.  </P> <P> Other operators in Maun are Crocodile Camp (Box 46) and the Okavango River  Lodge (Box 32, Maun). It's also possible to hire your own poler and mokoro out  of Maun.  </P> <P> The fly-in safaris offer a more comfortable way to see the delta. These  companies fly you from Maun to an exclusive, semi-permanent camp, treat you  like royalty and take you out on daylong canoe trips. Amenities include  thatched or tented lodging with comfortable beds, mosquito netting, lighting,  bathrooms and showers (with hot water), plus a restaurant, bar and movie  theater. Meals and laundry service are often included.  </P> <P> Gametrackers International (1000 E. Broadway, Glendale 91205, toll-free (800)  252-0493) offers an eight-day package through northern Botswana, including a  stop at Victoria Falls, for $2,725 (low season, March 1 through June 30) or  $2,925 (high season, July 1 through Dec. 31).  </P> <P> Desert and Delta Safaris Ltd. (16179 E. Whittier Blvd., Whittier, Calif. 90603,  (213) 947-5100) offers an eight-night itinerary for $2,274.65 per person, with  a minimum of four people. A six-night itinerary costs $1,537.05 per person  (minimum of four).  </P> <P> Ker Downey Selby (13201 Northwest Freeway, Suite 800, Houston, Tex. 77040,  (800) 231-6352) offers a nine-day trip for $1,952. The company also does fancy  mobile safaris for $660 a day for two people, or $460 a day per person.  </P> <P> Okavango Tours &amp; Safaris (P.O. Box 39, Maun) operates Delta Camp, an  exclusive camp with everything provided, and Oddball's, something in between a  fly-in and a mobile safari. Oddball's flies you into a semi-permanent camp on  the delta (110 pula for return), but you must take your own food and camping  gear (7.50 pula a night for camping). For 30 pulas a day you can also hire a  mokoro through Oddball's.  </P> <P> When to Go: I took my trip in May, a good time to see the delta but perhaps not  the best time to see animals. The delta was in full flood, and it was  beautiful. The end of the dry season, September and October, is peak  animal-viewing season, but also peak tourist season. It's a good idea to make  reservations well ahead.  </P> <P> Health: Malaria is the main concern. Consult a physician and begin taking  anti-malaria medication one week before entering the area. Take mosquito  repellent and netting. Make sure to keep all of your tent flaps closed until  you go to sleep for the night.  </P> <P> Tsetse flies are in the delta, but they usually aren't a problem, mainly  because of spraying to reduce their population. There are insect repellents  that are effective against the flies.  </P> <P> If you drink water straight from the delta, you should boil or filter it.  </P> <P> What to Take: If you're camping, you need to take all of your gear. Most fly-in  operators will supply everything. You should also take sun block, sunglasses, a  hat and neutral-colored clothing (to avoid frightening the animals), plus  binoculars, a good camera with a telephoto lens, and film.  </P> <P> Miscellaneous: Last July 1 Botswana raised fees for non-residents at its  national parks from 5 pula to 30 pula a day, and as much as 50 pula a day for  organized tours.  </P> <P> If you're visiting the Okavango Delta it would be a shame not to also visit  Chobe National Park. In addition, Victoria Falls is across the border in  Zimbabwe, and in Zambia, and should not be missed.  </P> <P> A good source of invaluable information for traveling on the cheap around  Africa is "Africa on a Shoestring" by Geoff Crowther (Lonely Planet, $24.95).  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Botswana, contact the Botswana Embassy, 4301  Connecticut Ave. N.W., Suite 404, Washington, D.C. 20008, (202) 244-4990.

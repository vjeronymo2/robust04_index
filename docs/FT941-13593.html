			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: To appease is to lose in Bosnia Sir, May I congratulate you on 'Troops out, weapons in' (January 21), your latest courageous editorial on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since the start of the war, European (and notably British) policy towards Bosnia has been based on the argument that only a negotiated settlement between the rival parties can put an end to the conflict, and that military intervention and/or an end to the arms embargo against the Bosnian government would merely increase the suffering. Your editorial points out clearly why this argument is flawed. It is flawed because in the absence of an effective military lever there is no incentive for the Serb and Croat nationalists to negotiate in good faith. European policy has been nothing more than a justification for appeasement: a strategy which time and again history has taught does not succeed. It is time for a fundamental rethink of western strategy. An equitable outcome can only be achieved if the arms embargo is lifted, and if the Bosnian government is given full diplomatic support. At least then it will have the chance to fight for the survival of its people on a reasonably level playing field. The tragedy is that western governments could have taken these bolder steps nearly two years ago. Had they done so, 200,000 deaths might have been averted.

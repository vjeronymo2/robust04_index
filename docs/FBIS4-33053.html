			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alicia Aguilar] </F>   [Text] Eleven regional industrial and three sectorial  chambers have agreed to declare a total emergency and initiate  progressive, "increasingly vigorous" actions to make commercial  banks aware of the urgent need to restructure and refinance the  Small- and Medium-Scale Industry's [Pymi] debt.    The actions are sponsored by the chambers of Caracas and the  States of Miranda, Anzoategui, Aragua, Barinas, Carabobo,  Merida, Nueva Esparta, Tachira, and Trujillo, as well as the  industrial chambers of the footwear, manufacturing, and plastics  industries, whose registered enterprises suffer acute production  stagnation, loss of investment, and decapitalization problems.    For this purpose, the chambers are backed by Corpoindustria,  an organization that announced its willingness to present in the  Congress an Emergency Refinancing Bill to take the sector out of  the stagnation it suffers.    According to a report by the VeneConsultants firm for  Conindustria, the industry's profits have been lower than the  amounts paid in interest rates. The problems thus resulted in  some prompt, radical positions, which urge protection for the  financial system while the production system is on the verge of  collapse.    During a recent meeting of a group of important industrial  chambers and associations, the financial assistance provided by  FOGADE [Guarantee Fund for the Protection of Bank Deposits] to  "compensate for the irregular handling of the depositors' money"  was seriously questioned. Some of the strong expressions heard  went like this: "While we had to compete for exports, the banks  got financial assistance." "While the doors of financing are  closed for us, banks are benefited by the Zero Coupon." "We  cannot obtain dollars, but the banks can obtain them  exclusively."    The industrialists reported that Banking Association  President Jose Bouza Izquierdo's pledge that compulsive  collection would not be affected is not being made good. This is  the case for the footwear industry, whose representative  organizations, Cavenic and Anpmicals, say the indebtedness index  in the sector tripled in the past few months, thus increasing  the final cost of the finished product, whose price increases  "without receiving any bank assistance. Quite the contrary, they  are the recipients of stronger and more pressing actions from  the banks."    According to Deputy Development Minister Warner Corrales  Leal, the government is also concerned with the problem. He said  the Executive Branch is waiting for "the banks to demonstrate  the same expeditiousness in solving these problems." Frankly, he  said, the ministry would like to receive from the banks clearer  signals that they are indeed concerned and that they are doing  everything possible, just as the government is doing.    The ministry's criticism is shared by Corpoindustria, where  the problem is seen to become more complex with the rise in the  price of the dollar because already raw material suppliers are  quoting prices in foreign currency and shortening payment terms.    Manuel Gallegos, Corpoindustria acting president, has  reported that FIV [Venezuelan Investment Fund] is considering  negotiating a $100-million loan with Citybank, a loan which will  make it possible for Corpoindustria to refinance part of Pymi's  debt with this organization, which amounts to 7 billion  bolivares, of which 1.7 billion bolivares are overdue. Also, a  joint action by Corpoindustria, Foncrel, Sogamoi, and Banco  Industrial de Venezuela is being prepared to create a bloc for  financing and industrial support.</p>

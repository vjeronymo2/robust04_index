			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Management: Trainers on the interactive battlefield - Tim Dickson looks at forays into viewer participation by two video-based training companies You've read the book and seen the video; now try the CD-i. That is the current pitch from both Melrose Film Productions and Video Arts, two of the best-known video-based training companies in the UK. Both have re-issued 10 of their existing training film titles in the more flexible and enhanced CD-i format. The move represents a new opportunity for corporate, educational and public-sector training managers, as well as marking the training industry's first main skirmish on the multimedia battlefield. Enthusiasts say that CD-i (which stands for compact disc interactive) offers the same sort of advantages over ordinary VHS videotape that audio compact discs (CDs) have enjoyed over traditional audio tape. CD-i players deliver a better picture than a conventional video recorder, while users of training films are able to 'hop' from episode to episode or participate in a series of interactive exercises added to the original scripts. CD-i technology was pioneered by Philips three years ago but until recently its main application has been in computer games. The breakthrough for Melrose and Video Arts only came earlier this year with the development of a cartridge that could, for the first time, deliver full-screen, full-motion video pictures at a reasonable price. CD-i is distinct from interactive video technology, which was marketed in the 1980s. IV not only suffered from poor picture quality but required users to invest up to Pounds 5,000 in a separate workstation. In an effort to kick-start the new CD-i management training market, Melrose has offered a free player, which attaches to a TV set, to customers who buy either of the first two programs being reissued in CD-i form (Motivating The Team and Keeping Customers Cool) before the end of July. The Pounds 995 price tag compares with Pounds 870 for the Melrose videos in their original linear form. The offer is identical to Video Arts': its new CD-i range includes established hits such as Meetings, Bloody Meetings and The Dreaded Appraisal. According to Richard Roxburgh, Melrose chief executive: 'In a year or two we think it (CD-i) will be as familiar in the workplace as the VHS video player is now. It is like having your own personal trainer on disc, and it will be enormously attractive as the move to open learning gathers pace.' The Melrose products are designed to be used either as self-study tools (with questions, a choice of answers and feedback), or by trainers who want to stimulate discussion in a group. The Video Arts titles, by contrast - also enhanced to drive home key learning points and to encourage users to apply the issues to their own organisation - are suitable only for groups. 'We see CD-i as an excellent means of just-in-time training,' says Video Arts' Tina Tietjen. 'An important part of the re-design is that the instructions are on the screen and you don't have to be a very expert trainer to follow them. In these days of delayering, many training managers have gone and the emphasis is on line managers themselves to make their teams more effective.' The big question mark is whether CD-i will triumph over CD-Rom technology, which can now deliver the pictures and sound through a personal computer. At the moment this is a more costly option but while the price is certain to fall, Melrose's Roxburgh points out that the PC 'is only a one-to-one experience'. He also believes that while the PC can be commonly found in the home, the chances are that CD-i will soon be built into new compact disc players.</p>

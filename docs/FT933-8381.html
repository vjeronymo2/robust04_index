			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Aluminium fence goes up around Europe: Kenneth Gooding considers the response of continental producers to rising exports from the CIS Like many Russians, Mr Igor Prokopov can become emotional at times. And he gets noticeably cross when anyone suggests that the Commonwealth of Independent States is entirely responsible for bringing the western aluminium industry to its knees. There has been an unprecedented surge in CIS aluminium exports, which European producers say has depressed the price to a point where their industry is on the verge of collapse. But Mr Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy, holding company for the CIS industry, points out that aluminium is a world commodity and there is only one market - a world market. The CIS is an important member of that market and the rest of the industry will have to adjust to that. Japan once was a big aluminium producer, he recalls, but now makes virtually none. The Japanese were forced out in the early 1980s because their costs were too high, particularly their energy costs. Nobody blamed the CIS producers for that, so why blame them now? Mr Prokopov says most CIS smelters use low-cost hydro-electric power, as do smelters in Latin America and Canada. It is not their fault if smelters in central Europe have to buy relatively expensive energy, making them high-cost producers. Mr Prokopov becomes particularly agitated at suggestions that the CIS is dumping aluminium in the west. How can this be, he asks, when all official CIS contracts are linked to the world price set by the London Metal Exchange and most of the export is handled by reputable western trading companies? His spirited defence cuts little ice with the European Commission, which last week imposed restrictions on CIS aluminium imports, insisting that only 60,000 tonnes may be imported between now and the end of November - about half of what might otherwise have been expected. Mr Prokopov says this makes no sense. Putting a fence between Europe and the CIS will not work - the metal is a global commodity that will simply enter the world market elsewhere. The restrictions make even less political sense when the world's industrialised countries are dismantling trade barriers and attempting to help the CIS transform to a market economy. Western analysts suggest that the CIS produced about 2.7m tonnes of aluminium last year, down from 2.9m tonnes in 1991. It exported about 1m tonnes, of which nearly 600,000 tonnes went to other parts of Europe. At the end of the 1980s the former Soviet Union was exporting only 200,000 tonnes, of which 124,000 tonnes went to western Europe. Even though chaotic conditions in the CIS cut demand for aluminium from 2.6m to 1.8m tonnes last year, there were still shortages of the metal. The fish canning industries in Russia and the Ukraine complain that there is not enough available. Among other things, the metal is also used for canning caviar, one of the few Russian products that has instant appeal in overseas markets. Aluminium has that same appeal. Russia and some other parts of the CIS can produce top-quality aluminium - much of it used to go into military and aerospace equipment - which is readily convertible into dollars. Smelter managers prefer to export to earn dollars instead of being paid by domestic customers in rapidly depreciating roubles. Their smelters are not just making metal - they provide the sole support for whole communities, including schools and hospitals. Dollars earned provide food, medicine and school books, not just raw materials and smelter equipment. Concern Aluminiy estimates that between Dollars 250m and Dollars 300m (Pounds 201m) a year raised from aluminium exports is spent by the industry in the EC. Nevertheless, the Commission has responded to pleas for protection from European producers who claim that CIS imports have depressed aluminium prices to their lowest-ever level in real terms and to a point where some smelters are not earning enough to cover cash production costs. The European industry has been forced to make expensive production cuts  - 80 per cent of the 1.1m tonnes of western capacity cut so far is in Europe. Part of the Commission's explanation for its action was: 'Aluminium produced in CIS states enjoys the huge advantage of artificially low energy prices and environmental standards that are far less strict than those in western countries.' Nobody disputes that environmental standards in CIS smelters are appalling. If Russia's own regulations were imposed, all its smelters would close down. A team from the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) discovered that conditions were so poor in some Russian smelters that a worker's average life expectancy was only 47 years. The European industry wonders if it makes any sense to close relatively modern smelters in the west to allow the CIS monsters to continue operating. As for costs, the Russians claim they produce aluminium at about Dollars 500 a tonne. But energy costs are heavily subsidised and labour rates range from one US cent to two cents a lb - less than those in most developing countries. Industry consultant Mr Anthony Bird estimates that, aided by these 'astonishingly low' input prices, CIS smelters in mid-1992 were producing aluminium for about 25 US cents a lb - well below the 53.6 cents average at smelters in the rest of the world. But by the year 2000 only one or two smelters would still be competitive if the CIS continued to move towards a market economy. The western industry says it cannot wait that long for relief. However, it is split about what action should be taken. Until last week US producers were not asking for protection - but said the EC action might force them to do so. Mr Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, in June tried to head off restrictions by the EC: he announced that Alcoa, even though it had some of the world's lowest-cost smelters, would cut its output by 25 per cent at the cost of 750 jobs. He also called on governments to find 'a mechanism to deal with the economic consequences of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.' The EC, too, is seeking a multilateral solution. It is willing to assist in the modernisation of CIS smelters and wants to encourage the regeneration of CIS domestic demand for aluminium. The western industry has already taken some tentative steps in this direction. But, by imposing restrictions, the Commission obviously hopes to grab the attention of Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, so that, in spite of all his other problems, he will move those besetting the aluminium industry nearer the top of his agenda.</p>

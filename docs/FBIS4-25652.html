			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province  will open more markets and build a better investment  environment, so as to make it a more attractive area for  overseas businessmen.    Addressing a seminar on the provincial economy and foreign  investment environment, Lu Ruihua, vice-governor of the  province, said that Guangdong had used a total of 33.54 billion  U.S. dollars of overseas investments by May this year. The  funds helped the province achieve an annual growth of 13.8  percent in its gross domestic product over the past decade.    As the province enjoys excellent conditions in both domestic  and international environment, it plans to achieve the targets  in China's modernization drive in 20 years. During this period,  Guangdong will need at least 190 billion U.S. dollars in  overseas investment.    To get this, the vice-governor said, Guangdong Province is  ready to open its primary industries, secondary industries and  service industries to overseas investment, except for some  special fields.    Overseas investors are welcome to solely own or hold the  larger share in stock-holding enterprises, apart from some  infrastructure industries in which continued state monopoly is  necessary, he said.    The province is particularly interested in capital  investment  from multinational business giants as well as small and  medium-sized businesses. Industrial investment, bank loans and  low-interest loans are all welcomed, he said.    Opening its market, the vice governor said, means to attract  more overseas funds and introduce high technology. The higher  the technology proportion, the more it will open its market.    The province will also allow overseas investors to purchase  shares of local firms. But, assets appraisal and property  ownership must be clarified before shares are sold and before  permission is given to trade the stocks in the market, he said.  In attracting overseas investment, the vice-governor said,  Guangdong Province will do its utmost to protect the lawful  rights of foreign investors and allow them to make profits.  However, he also emphasized that supervision of the  overseas-funded enterprises must be intensified as well in light  of the growing number of labor conflicts.    Guangdong Province is ready to bring in regulations to  protect the lawful rights and interests of both employers and  employees. National policies and international common practice  will be applied in the supervision of overseas-funded  enterprises so as to make effective use of foreign investment  and make Guangdong a more appealing place for overseas investors.</p>

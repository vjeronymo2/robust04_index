			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong SFC selects lawyer as chairman Mr Anthony Neoh, QC, is to succeed Mr Robert Nottle as chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission when Mr Nottle retires at the end of this year, the Hong Kong government said yesterday. Mr Neoh is a member of the governing council of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and well acquainted with securities markets in both Hong Kong and China. He was unobtainable for comment yesterday. He was one of the advisers to China on how to list mainland state companies on the Hong Kong exchange. In spite of teething problems, the listing of these companies has been an acknowledged success. Through this listing process Mr Neoh, 48, came into contact with senior officials in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen and he has established good relations with them. He is a respected authority on securities law and has advised China's central government on the drafting of China's securities and company law. He is also an adviser to the Shenzhen municipal government. Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said Mr Neoh had made significant contributions to the development of Hong Kong's stock market over the past few years. 'I am confident that he will bring in invaluable expertise and give new impetus to the SFC in the years ahead,' he said. Mr Neoh will take up his position at the beginning of February next year. His contract expires on June 30 1997 - the day before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule - but, if he wishes to continue, the high regard with which he is held in China ought to secure him another term. Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said there had been 66 applications for the SFC chairmanship in addition to candidates head-hunted by a search firm. Mr Neoh was the selection committee's unanimous choice, he said.</p>

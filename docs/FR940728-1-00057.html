This proposal would codify the agency's historical practice of treating as used, any slot held but not actually operated on Thanksgiving Day, the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, and the period from December 24 through January 2. The proposed revision would permit carriers and commuters to choose which flights to operate at any of the High Density Rule airports during certain days of the winter holiday season without jeopardizing the status of the slots under the ``use of lose'' requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on this regulation may be mailed in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Docket No. 27834, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Or delivered in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Rules Docket, room 915, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments may be examined in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Patricia R.

The regulation limits the number of IFR operations at each airport, by hour or half hour (by half hour at O'Hare), during certain hours of the day. It provides for the allocation to carriers of operational authority, or a ``slot'' for each instrument flight rule (IFR) landing or takeoff during a specific 30- or 60-minute period. The restrictions were lifted at Newark in the early 1970's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would exempt certain holidays from being included in the bimonthly calculations for slot use. Traditionally, air carriers and commuters reduce their scheduled operations on the following holidays: Thanksgiving Day, the Friday following Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. Since December 1986, commuter slot-operators have been allowed to temporarily discontinue use of slots for Thanksgiving Day, the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, and the period from December 24 through the first Saturday in January of the new year. This policy was extended to air carrier operators for the 1993 holiday season. There is no reason to expect this agency's historical practice to change and it should be expressly codified in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed change in the rule would not result in any additional flights or capacity at the four High Density Traffic Airports. This proposal also would be in the public interest because it would permit air carriers and commuters to choose which flights to operate during the winter holiday season without jeopardizing the status of the slots under the ``use or lose'' requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action,'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this proposed rule to amend part 93 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) are shown below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The proposal would permit the non-operation of certain flights by carriers and commuters operating at any of the High Density Rule airports during certain days of the winter holiday season. But the air carrier could still count those flights toward its slot usage requirement. It would permit an air carrier that could not cover its variable operating costs to not operate those flights and to still meet the slot usage requirements for those particular days. The potential benefits would be primarily cost savings to the airlines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The proposed rule would not result in any added costs to the affected air carriers. Fewer landings at the airports affected by this rulemaking could result in reduced airport revenues derived from landing fees. The FAA seeks comments on this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

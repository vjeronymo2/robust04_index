			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CDU presidential candidate Roman Herzog by </F> Michael Jach and Ulrich Reitz; place and date not given: "`I  Love the German People'"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [FOCUS] What is your  definition of patriotism?    [Herzog] I will put it in very simple terms: I love the  German people -- with their many good sides and great mistakes.  For me the state is a tool created by man to solve certain  problems. I find it less easy to identify myself with the state  than with the people. For me the state is only one part of  society -- a subsystem, to use a term from political science.  [passage omitted]    [FOCUS] You are in favor of dual citizenship. Would it be  more consistent to introduce the ius soli [citizenship  determined by place of birth] in Germany, according to which  anybody born here would be German?    [Herzog] I do not want to comment on the ius soli here.  Dual citizenship has to remain the exception for me,  particularly in the following cases: second-or third-generation  foreigners who were born here and live here are hardly any  different from Germans. They have to be offered German  citizenship. If accepting German citizenship were impossible  because their country of origin would not release them from  their inherited nationality, then one should at least consider  the possibility of giving them a German passport as a second  passport. Those who do not want to become Germans should be  conceded a generous amount of time to make a decision. If they  decide against German citizenship, we should tell them: We  expect you to return to the country that you obviously regard as  your home country. This is the same situation that Germans and  Poles faced when they emigrated to the United States. [passage  omitted]    [FOCUS] One of the major debates of our time is about  Europe. Is the European nation state a desirable vision?    [Herzog] No, because I do not see such a state for the rest  of my life or for the lifetime of my children. I do not think  that nation states, whose sovereignty has long since  disintegrated into thin air anyway, will disappear completely.  I do, however, regard it as possible that a stronger feeling of  belonging together will emerge in the European countries, not  least as a result of the challenges that our European culture is  facing from countries that do not share our way of coexistence.  Islam, for example, is challenging us to justify our own  lifestyle anew.    [FOCUS] So European patriotism, too?    [Herzog] If you want: yes.</p>

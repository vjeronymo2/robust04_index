			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Book Review: Monopoly seeks platonic relationship PRIVATISATION, PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND THE REGULATION OF NATURAL MONOPOLY By C D Foster Blackwell, Pounds 40, 458 pages How does one find individuals who can be trusted to regulate important parts of the economy? Such individuals have discretionary powers over many basic goods and services, so only the select and most enlightened can do the job. This question - which deliberately echos Plato's description of the qualities required for a perfect ruler - is raised by Sir Christopher Foster in his book on economic regulation. Like Plato, he is torn between acknowledging that regulation is sometimes necessary, and realising that power has a tendency to corrupt. Unlike Plato, his field of interest is not society as a whole, but those parts of the economy that gravitate towards monopoly if left to their own devices. Sir Christopher, who has been an economics professor, civil servant and businessman and is currently advising the UK government on the privatisation of British Rail, rejects the idea that governments can pursue a policy of benign neglect once they have privatised 'natural monopoly' industries such as telecommunications, gas, railways, airports and electricity. But he is exercised by the fact that any regulatory system is vulnerable to being subverted. Such subversion - known in the jargon as regulatory capture - can occur if the regulator is turned into a tool of either the industry concerned or politicians. The book is an extended treatise on how regulatory systems have been consistently captured, and how the only antidote is a strong system of regulation independent from vested interests. This prescription may seem as idealistic as many of Plato's. But Sir Christopher argues that, through a mixture of luck and foresight, the system introduced in Britain to accompany the privatisation of utilities is a good approximation to what is required. It is based on a series of independent regulatory bodies - Oftel, Ofgas, Ofwat, Offer - headed by strong individuals with considerable discretionary powers. But the book is not an apologia for the British status quo. Sir Christopher is concerned that regulators are still vulnerable to pressure from both politicians and industry - a topical concern, given Sir James McKinnon's decision this week to step down early as director-general of gas regulator Ofgas, and the recent drubbing politicians have given Mr Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity regulator Offer, for failing to protect miners' jobs. The book is also a timely contribution to the debate on how regulatory systems should be designed, as yet more countries privatise utilities and the UK embarks on its next privatisation wave with BR and maybe the Post Office. Though not an easy read and sometimes repetitive, it is rich in insights. Particularly appealing is its broad historical sweep, which traces the development of economic regulation in Britain and the US. The chapter on Gladstone's attempt to regulate railways in the 1840s shows how the complex economic issues manifest today have been present from the start. It also reveals how the railway barons were able to mobilise immense lobbying power - at one point, 132 MPs were railway directors - to emasculate his bill. Further chapters explain how this early failure to control railway monopolies led to such a public outcry, albeit after a time lag of nearly half a century, that excessive controls were imposed. These, in turn, nearly bankrupted the industry and paved the way for nationalisation. The US experience with economic regulation, though less traumatic, does not provide a model because it is too legalistic, according to Sir Christopher. It is not simply that it is costly. The court-like procedures also enable a monopoly to use its greater resources and control of information to tie its regulator in knots. These failures lead Sir Christopher to defend the current British model and propose various measures to shore up the regulators' independence. Some concern the vital but neglected subject of information. Monopolies not only dominate their industries. They also control the detailed financial information about how their industries work, putting them in a privileged position compared with regulators, potential rivals and consumers. Though regulators can ask for some information, the book argues that monopolies are adept at playing games: dragging their heels, or flooding regulators with irrelevant data. Sir Christopher advocates stronger powers for regulators to extract information and then publish it. This is partly to help potential rivals enter a monopolised industry and partly because he favours 'sunshine' regulation - exposing monopoly abuses to the glare of publicity. Sunshine regulation was pioneered by Charles Francis Adams, a 19th century Boston patrician, who waged a successful campaign against railway barons through pamphleteering and journalism. Mr Alfred Kahn, taking a similar approach, told his staff at the US Civil Aeronautics Board: 'If you can't explain what you are doing to people in simple English, you are probably doing something wrong.' The new breed of British regulator has developed its own version of sunshine regulation. Sir James McKinnon, in particular, has been a master of the strongly worded statement to the press - a practice Sir Christopher applauds, since it helps regulators build up public support, which in turn should act as a bulwark against interference with their independence. Much of Sir Christopher's argument for independent regulators is persuasive. But it ultimately rests - as did Plato's - on enlightened individuals filling the top posts. For, as Sir Christopher acknowledges, if bad regulators were to be in charge, it might after all be better if they were shackled by a cage of law.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> FRANCIS OVERCOMES DRAWBACKS  </P> <P> "You really don't know what you have until you lose it," Connie Francis told  her audience at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim on Saturday, referring to the  years when she lost her voice after a traumatic 1974 rape and other personal  tragedies. She has been actively singing again since 1981, and her 100-minute  performance showed that the 52-year-old vocalist is making the most of her  gift.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the sound mix was atrocious, with her voice run through a shrill  electronic reverb. Her rhythm section and the hired pit band often seemed  hopelessly out of sync, and an amateurishly produced film montage of her career  further distracted from her singing. These drawbacks overwhelmed the first half  of Francis' show, which featured her chirpy, barely rocking hits of the late  '50s and early '60s, such as "Stupid Cupid" and "Where the Boys Are."  </P> <P> The second half -- thankfully minus the movie screens -- allowed the quality  and emotion of her voice to shine through. She drew on her heritage for an  Italian-language tune and the emotion-drenched "For Mama," while "Malaguena"  soared with melismatic, Moorish vocal touches. Her pain-edged voice dug deeply  into a Judy Garland medley, and Francis even claimed a piece of the Sinatra  signature tune "My Way," earning two standing ovations. JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

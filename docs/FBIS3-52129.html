			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Tripoli by Ahmad al-Siyufi] </F>   [Text] Libyan Foreign Minister [title as published] 'Umar  al-Muntasir has emphasized that Libya has nothing to do,  directly or indirectly, with the abduction of Libyan  oppositionist Mansur al-Kikhya. He added: We are certain that  the Egyptian authorities will discover the facts and identify  those behind this crime. According to al-Muntasir, the purpose  of this crime is to drive a wedge between Egypt and Libya and  spoil the relations between the two countries, particularly  since several parties have an interest in clouding the  atmosphere.    Al-Muntasir's remarks came in response to a question by  AL-SHA'B concerning the mystery surrounding al-Kikhya's  disappearance during a news conference held at the Libyan  Foreign Ministry yesterday.    In an exclusive statement to AL-SHA'B, Egyptian ambassador  to  Libya Lieutenant General Mustafa al-Shadhili has noted that he  completely rules out Libya's involvement in this issue. He  added that he is almost certain that Libya has nothing to do  with this issue, as the investigations will show.    Libyan sources have stressed that Libya is not connected to  the incident for the following reasons:    1. Al-Kikhya is practicing politics and does not carry arms.  Were the principle of abduction to be used, which is rejected,  it would be more worthwhile to use it against those who carry  and train with arms.    2. Al-Kikhya's position on the Lockerbie case was in line  with the Libyan stance. Al-Kikhya denied Libya's responsibility  for blowing up the U.S. aircraft.    3. Various attempts are being made by some Western states to  spoil Egyptian-Libyan relations.    4. The incident comes at a time when the Western charges  against Libya in connection with the Lockerbie issue have  started to collapse. Thus, something new had to be found to  strike at Libya.</p>

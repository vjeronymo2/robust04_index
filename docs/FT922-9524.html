			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (14): Wine goes upmarket - The country's last cottage industry IN THE mid-1980s Swiss winemakers awoke from a slumber worthy of Rip van Winkle to find the world utterly changed. Shifting consumer tastes and a domestic wine glut are forcing the country's last remaining cottage industry to become more efficient, professional and outward-looking. As a consequence, thousands of small vineyard owners are expected to bow out over the next few years. Traditionally, Switzerland has produced eminently quaffable but unremarkable wines with little staying power. About 60 per cent of its production, 140m litres last year, is white wine, mostly from the Chasselas grape. The dominant red grapes are Pinot Noir, Gamay and Merlot. Cushioned by high government subsidies and tight restrictions on competing imports, especially for white wine, Swiss growers had little need to worry about quality in what was essentially a captive market. For white wine, domestic production meets nine-tenths of consumption, against about one-third for red wine. Winemakers had little interest in exporting abroad and no incentive to do so. Things changed abruptly 10 years ago when a string of bumper harvests from 1982 created Switzerland's very own wine lake, one big Valais winery went to the wall, and the federal government was forced to implement a costly surplus disposal programme. In 1986, the mountain canton of Valais, Switzerland's main wine-producing area, became the first to impose stringent measures to rein back production and boost wine quality by restricting the quantity of grapes left to grow on the vines. Switzerland's first 'Appellation d'Origine Controlee' (AOC), wine conforming to strict quality standards, was introduced in 1987, also in the Valais. The Swiss parliament is currently discussing a draft federal decree that will restrain production and improve wine quality nationwide. At the beginning of this year the government scrapped import quotas for bulk deliveries of red wine, and it plans further liberalisation of wine imports in the light of the international trade talks under way in Geneva. Earlier government proposals to regulate wine production were thrown out by voters two years ago on the grounds that they did not go far enough to eliminate barriers to imports. The draft decree also classifies wines into three quality groups (with 'appellation d'origine', 'indication de provenance' and 'vins ordinaires'). This, too, is a big break with the past. In the Valais, for instance, most small growers sold their grapes to big wine distributors to be bottled simply under the generic names of Fendant (Chasselas), Johannisberg (Sylvaner) or Dole (Pinot Noir and Gamay). The effects on the structure of the Swiss wine industry will be far-reaching. Mr Francois Cordonnier, president of the Valais Federation of wine growers, thinks the number of vineyard keepers in the canton could shrink from 22,000 to just 4,000 over the next decade. One in five working adults has a vineyard, often no bigger than a tennis court, and 90 per cent of holdings are worked part-time. Equally revolutionary, the Swiss are turning their minds to markets abroad, and not just for offloading the odd surplus. Switzerland now exports under 2m bottles of wine a year, a tiny 1 per cent of production which the Association of Swiss Wine Exporters in Lausanne would like to see boosted to 5 or even 10 per cent in the longer term. The problem with exporting more, as Swiss growers concede, is that Switzerland has few distinctive wines, and even fewer distinguished ones, to entice sophisticated overseas palates. Yet with production costs in Switzerland two to four times those elsewhere in Europe, Swiss winemakers have little choice but to follow their compatriots in watchmaking, machine tools and other export industries in moving resolutely upmarket. The industry is split on how best to do this. Some growers in French-speaking Switzerland, which produces 80 per cent of the country's wine, propose abandoning the ubiquitous Chasselas grape in favour of more reliable varieties such as Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. Others say the Chasselas gives Swiss wine its distinctiveness and advocate research to improve the grape's wine-making qualities. Mr Christophe Von Ritter, secretary-general of the wine exporters' association, thinks prospects are good for wines made from some of Switzerland's unique indigenous grape varieties, which could sell not only on quality but also on curiosity value. But, despite the association's best endeavours, exporting is likely to remain a marginal pastime for growers while subsidies and protection continue to provide easier rewards in the domestic market.</p>

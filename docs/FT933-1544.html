			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps boost Tibbett 69% to Pounds 11.4m THE ACQUISITION of Silcock Express last November helped Tibbett &amp; Britten, the warehousing, transportation and distribution services group, to lift pre-tax profits by 69 per cent, from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 11.4m, in the half year to June 26. Silcock, a car distribution company, contributed Pounds 4m to group operating profits of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 6.41m), and Pounds 52.6m to total turnover, which rose 74 per cent to Pounds 176.9m (Pounds 101.6m). Earnings per share were ahead 42 per cent to 17.5p (12.3p). The interim dividend is lifted 22 per cent to 4.5p (3.7p). Mr John Harvey, chairman, said that Silcock had made 'a seamless entry' into the group. At the same time the rest of the group had continued to show strong organic growth of Pounds 18m, or 24 per cent of the increase in turnover. He described the trading environment as 'still very difficult, particularly in the automotive sector.' The group profit margin eased from 6.6 per cent to 6.4 per cent. The group now operates in five sectors - clothing and textiles, personal products, food, non-food, and motors. Of these, the non-food division, whose clients include B&amp;Q and IBM, was the strongest. The clothing and textiles division continued to be hit by recession. About 80 per cent of the group's business is contracted. Two contracts - one for Asda (turnover Pounds 6m) and one for Whitbread (turnover Pounds 12m) will end in the next six months. Mr Harvey said there was no customer dissatisfaction in either case. The international division reported an operating profit of Pounds 200,000 after a previous loss of Pounds 300,000. The acquisition last year of SA Warehousing Services in South Africa added Pounds 10m to the division's turnover, helping it to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 2.9m). Net assets at June 26 were Pounds 74.8m (Pounds 51.4m), and gearing is now at zero (14 per cent). COMMENT The maiden contribution of Silcock Express has transformed the first-half results in spite of the 17 per cent fall in western European car registrations in the period. Silcock now accounts for 30 per cent of group turnover, with the other UK businesses at 60 per cent and the international division at 10 per cent. The fact that Marks and Spencer, which generated 60 per cent of turnover when the company was floated in 1986, now accounts for less than 11 per cent is a good illustration of how much Tibbett has grown and diversified. In addition, it is making strategic moves overseas. The only real negative news is the loss in the next six months of two contracts. Perhaps this was behind yesterday's 15p fall in the shares to 715p. Even so, forecast full-year profits of Pounds 24m to Pounds 25m give a p/e of more than 19. High, but the shares are worth holding for the benefits that could follow an upturn in the motor and clothing sectors.</p>

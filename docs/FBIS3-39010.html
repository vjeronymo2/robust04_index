			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Abandoning `Megalomania </F> Reminiscent of Emperor William'"]    [Text] Did the candidate for chancellor of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] announce a change at the  security meeting in Munich -- as the late Herbert Wehner did at  the Bundestag on 30 June 1960 when he offered the Adenauer  government the "greatest possible extent of cooperation" in  foreign policy? In the presence of leading strategists of the  Western world in Munich, Rudolf Scharping stated that there are  "no serious differences" in foreign policy between the SPD and  the Kohl government.    Is this a turning point? Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG: "It was no turning point. I only wanted to clarify  what the resolutions of our party congresses really mean. On  this basis, an SPD government would be fully capable of action  in foreign policy. Its program covers everything the United  Nations did in the past few years -- and what it will want and  be able to do in the future." In other words, this means that  the SPD would be able to support the peace missions in which the  multination association in New York might ask the SPD to  participate. This would not be more than "blue helmets plus" --  that is, "monitoring of peace," "blockades" like those in the  Adriatic, "humanitarian missions" like the one in Bosnia and  Somalia, and the military protection of such tasks.    What will happen if the United Nations wants more? The  candidate believes that the United Nations is no world  government that can order the states to march. Every government  must make its own decisions. Still, Erwin Horn, a longtime  member of the Defense Committee and an SPD member, believes that  Scharping adopted a "different and new tone" at the Munich  conference. As the "classical party of internationalism," the  SPD cannot "simply stand aside forever." Scharping has realized  that. Horn added: "We must abandon the megalomania reminiscent  of Emperor William, that we always want to be different from the  others."    Yet the "changes" hinted by the party chairman have  certainly  also been triggered by expected major decisions by the  Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, which have already cast their  shadow at this point. Karsten Voigt, foreign policy spokesman  of the Bundestag group, put it this way: "It is to be expected  that Karlsruhe will declare the full spectrum of UN measures as  legally possible. The Constitutional Court has signaled to all  three parties that it will basically settle all pending issues  in a positive way in the early summer: The purely humanitarian  mission in Somalia, participation in the blockade in the  Adriatic Sea (an operation initiated by the Western European  Union), and the AWACS mission over Bosnia (NATO mission on  behalf of the United Nations, that includes a combat  operation)." Thus, an amendment to the constitution will not be  required but only parliamentary approval with a simple majority.    Scharping could live very well with such a ruling, and he  could even go further than the party has allowed him so far.  Both the blockade in the Adriatic Sea against the Serbs and the  flights of the NATO fire control system (AWACS) are basically  combat missions of which the leftists in the party do not  approve. One of Scharping's foreign-policy aides stated: "If  this is the way Karlsruhe will decide, resistance within the SPD  will collapse. This is the return to a tradition that accords  great significance to a clear orientation toward the West in its  foreign policy," he added.    What is even more, the party's doctrinarian wing would be  silenced for the time being in the mammoth election year 1994,  and the candidate could fully concentrate on his bid for power.  In addition, no one in the West would have to be afraid of an  election victory of the SPD for foreign policy reasons, as Horst  Teltschik, Kohl's former security adviser, stated ironically at  the security conference in Munich.    A victory of the "Atlantic-minded" -- of those who both  reject the special European relationship with France and  unilateral measures vis-a-vis the East -- is emerging within the  SPD. In fact, the new harmony between the SPD and the United  States no longer requires special efforts. The United States no  longer insists on a choice between nuclear rearmament and  special detente vis-a-vis Moscow and East Berlin. The entire  West is now united in the difficult balancing act to integrate  and contain Russian power. Affection is easy to give if it does  not require a price.</p>

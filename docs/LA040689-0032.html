			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL TRACK;  </P> <P> BIRMINGHAM WINS BEHIND SPRINTER BURT  </P> <P> After being disqualified for a false start in the 100 meters, Rodney Burt of  Birmingham High ran with a vengeance in the longer sprints to lead the host  Braves to a 79-38 victory over Van Nuys in a Mid-Valley League meet Wednesday.  </P> <P> Burt, fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships, followed his  100 mishap with a 49.3-second victory in the 400 and won the 200 with a  personal best of 22.0.  </P> <P> Teammates Brian Gastelum and Steve Weinberger also turned in personal bests.  </P> <P> Gastelum won the 800 in 2 minutes and Weinberger was victorious in the long  jump (20 feet, 8 1/4 inches) and triple jump (41-5 3/4).  </P> <P> The victory clinched at least a tie for the Braves' second consecutive  dual-meet title. Birmingham (6-0) -- which won the Mid-Valley League title last  season -- can clinch the crown outright with a victory over Reseda (5-1) on  April 21.  </P> <P> The Birmingham girls' team also remained undefeated, winning 78-31.  </P> <P> Montoya Johnson won the 100 (13.1), 200 (27.8) and 400 (1:04.0) for the Braves  and Tina Means won four events for Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Means, third in the high jump in last year's City championships, won her  specialty at 5 feet, and took the 100-meter low hurdles (16.6), the 300 low  hurdles (48.6) and the long jump (15-5).  </P> <P> In other meets:  </P> <P> San Fernando 66, Cleveland 60 -- Tim Bowen won the 100 meters in 11.0 and the  200 in 22.5 for the host Cavaliers (3-3), but San Fernando's depth prevailed in  the North Valley League meet.  </P> <P> The victory guaranteed the Tigers at least a share of the league title. They  can win it outright with a victory over Granada Hills (1-6) on April 21.  </P> <P> Keary Johns led San Fernando (5-1) with a 15.1 victory in the 110-meter high  hurdles.  </P> <P> Reseda 64 1/2, Monroe 62 1/2 -- Without hurdler Mario Armijo who didn't compete  for disciplinary reasons, the Vikings lacked the firepower to match up with  Reseda in the Mid-Valley League meet at Monroe.  </P> <P> Despite Armijo's absence, Monroe (4-2) won seven of 10 running events, but  Reseda took four of the five field events to win the meet. Derril White led  Monroe with victories in the 100 meters (11.0) and the long jump (21-1). Aaron  Brumfield won the high jump (5-10) and triple jump (40-5) for Reseda (5-1).  </P> <P> Kennedy 59, Granada Hills -- Kim Montgomery set a school record in the 400  (59.8) and the Highlanders' 400 relay team (49.6) did likewise, but Kennedy won  the North Valley League girls' meet at Granada Hills.  </P> <P> The win improved Kennedy's record to 6-0 and guaranteed the Golden Cougars at  least a share of their 12th consecutive dual-meet title. Kennedy can clinch the  title against winless Cleveland on April 21.  </P> <P> Kennedy's Kathy McClain won the 100-meter low hurdles (16.7) and the 300 low  hurdles (48.7).  </P></p>

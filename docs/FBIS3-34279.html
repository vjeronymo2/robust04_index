We received a report 10 minutes ago that  Israeli warplanes are raiding the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights after  intensive reconnaissance sorties throughout the night and into  the morning over al-Nabatiyah, Iqlim al-Tuffah, western  al-Biqa', al-Luwayzah, Jarju', and the central sector.    We received a report two hours ago that the Israeli  bombardment of villages in the south intensified and continued  until 1300, targeting the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights, Jarju', 'Ayn  Bu Siwar, and Arab Salim. At about 1330, Israeli warplanes flew  intensively at low altitude over Iqlim al-Tuffah and  al-Nabatiyah, staging mock raids. The Lebanese Army confronted  the aircraft with anti-aircraft guns. Iqlim al-Tuffah areas and  al-Luwayzah came under artillery barrage at 1100 from the South  Lebanese Army [SLA] and Israeli positions in al-Zaffatah.  Resistance men fired at the sources.    Israeli aircraft reconnoitered the region up to east Sidon  and al-Nabatiyah, breaking the sound barrier. Israeli warplanes  flew low over western al-Biqa' at about 1100, again breaking the  sound barrier over al-Nabatiyah.    The resistance men this morning attacked an SLA position in  Sujud with rockets and mortar and clashes ensued in which all  types of weapons were used.    At 1350 today, Israeli warplanes raided the Iqlim al-Tuffah  heights, concentrating on al-Luwayzah, for the second time today.    Just in from the south, Israeli military aircraft are flying  low over the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights and Lebanese Army ground  anti- aircraft guns are confronting them. The resistance fired  surface- to-air Strella missiles at the Israeli aircraft,  causing panic in the region and making the people believe the  Israeli aircraft had launched a new raid.</p>

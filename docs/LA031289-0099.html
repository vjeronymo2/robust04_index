			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LENDL AND EDBERG STRUGGLE TO WINS IN ARIZONA TOURNAMENT SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Top-seeded Ivan Lendl and second-seeded Stefan Edberg scored difficult  semifinal victories Saturday and will meet in today's final of the $415,000  Eagle tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Lendl, the top-ranked men's player in the world, eliminated fifth-seeded Emilio  Sanchez, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, in a 2-hour 21-minute match that ended in twilight.  </P> <P> In an earlier match on the outdoor hardcourts of the Scottsdale Princess Hotel,  Edberg struggled to beat unseeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 6-7, 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> Edberg, the 1988 Wimbledon champion currently ranked fourth in the world, got  his powerful serve working midway through the 1-hour 52-minute match.  </P> <P> "It took a while before I finally came through," Edberg said after playing just  his fifth match since suffering a back injury at the Australian Open in late  January. "The back was no problem. I was serving well all day. Mansdorf played  well the first two sets. I broke him twice in the last set, and when I broke  him to go up 3-2, I knew I had him. He mentally got tired after that."  </P> <P> Mansdorf, 23, seemed in control until Edberg broke him for the first time in  the final game of the second set.  </P></p>

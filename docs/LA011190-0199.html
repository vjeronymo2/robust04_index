			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALCOMP SELLS SUBSIDIARY TO BOOST JAPAN MARKET SHARE  </P> <P> CalComp Inc. said Wednesday it has sold a majority interest in its Japanese  marketing subsidiary to two major Japanese corporations in order to increase  sales of its computer graphics products in that country.  </P> <P> William P. Conlin, CalComp president, said in an interview that the sale of 56%  of Nippon CalComp to Nippon Steel Corp. and Sumitomo Corp. was the only way  ensure that the company would gain access to the entire Japanese marketplace.  </P> <P> "We've been satisfied with the growth rate of our subsidiary in Japan, which  has been around 20% to 25% a year for the past few years," Conlin said.  </P> <P> Conlin said CalComp doesn't do as well in the Japanese market as it does in  other international markets.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of strong local competition in Japan, which is not true  elsewhere, and in Japan you just don't get total access to the market if you  are not a Japanese (owned) company. We wanted to have a subsidiary that was  Japanese."  </P> <P> The subsidiary, now called NS CalComp, had less than 5% of the estimated  $750-million annual market for computer graphics equipment in Japan, Conlin  said, while CalComp, with about $450 million in sales last year, has about 10%  of the U.S. market.  </P> <P> CalComp, a Lockheed Corp. subsidiary, will realize a $20-million gain from the  sale. Nippon Steel bought 51% of the marketing while Sumitomo's trading company  subsidiary bought a 5% interest.  </P> <P> NS CalComp will market, service and support CalComp's plotters, digitizers and  graphic display products, which are used in a wide range of computer-aided  design, presentation graphics and graphic arts applications.  </P> <P> As part of the joint venture, new products designed specifically for the  Japanese market will be developed jointly by CalComp and Nippon Steel's  Electronics &amp; Information Systems Division, Conlin said.  </P></p>

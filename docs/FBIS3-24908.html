			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Botha] </F>   [Text] Pretoria must become the capital of the Afrikaner  homeland so that laws for whites can apply there, but, until  then, the Afrikaner people will be subjected to the current  laws, said Mr. Paul Fouche, leader of the Conservative Party  [CP] caucus in the Pretoria City Council during a CP meeting on  Tuesday [2 February] night in Pretoria.    The whites have an inalienable right to retain Pretoria for  the Afrikaner/Boer homeland. There is no way that Pretoria will  become a part state. The Afrikaner people are being called on  to engage in actions directed at drastic, nonviolent resistance  so that they can really choke the negotiation forum until the  Afrikaner homeland is in place. He is appealing to the  Afrikaner people to trust their leaders and not to lose hope.    The white man, and in particular the Boer/Afrikaner, is  facing the biggest crisis of his history. The future of  Pretoria and the country is not in anybody else's hands, but in  those of the whites. That is why they have to prevent the  takeover of Pretoria by an ANC [African National Congress]  civics regime.    The new transitional Constitution holds drastic results in  store for the country at the local level. The only option that  the transitional council can implement regarding Pretoria is the  50/50 system with mixed city councils. The communists and  Antichrist will then rule the city.    Fouche said the whites are no longer affected by this  horror.  The Boer/Afrikaner has to awaken other whites by communicating  to them the seriousness of the situation.    The new Constitution has so many loopholes that it could be  possible to avert a tragedy. The negotiation forum must make  the Constitution and its conditions enforceable in Pretoria and  decide on the number of members the new metropolitan city  council will have to consist of.    The 17 CP city council members do not recognize the present  forum in Pretoria as it has been established prematurely, and  the transitional Constitution at local level is not as yet  operative. The forum has no legal capabilities and its decisions  are unacceptable.    The Conservative Party's arm in local government is the  Transvaal Municipal Association which has succeeded in getting  all city councils from group eight down to retain their status  quo during the pre-interim period. It did not only get it right  for the CP-controlled city councils, but also for 94 percent of  all city councils in South Africa.    The National Party councilors were keen to jump on this  wagon  and were relieved to be able to retain their autonomy. A  National Party-controlled city council, such as Beaufort West,  has asked Fouche to explain this part of the Constitution to  them because they want to be governed by whites.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 10 (AFP) -- The United Nations warned  Sunday it would order more air strikes against Serb forces  around the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde if necessary.    Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali "would like to make it  very clear that he will not hesitate to use airpower again to  protect UN-designated safe areas," said UN spokeswoman Therese  Gastaut. Gorazde is one of six such areas in Bosnia.    Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes attacked Serb positions near  Gorazde Sunday, officials in Washington and Brussels said.    The air raids were ordered by the top UN official in the  former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, in consultation with  Butrus-Ghali to protect eight UN observers in the Gorazde  enclave, Gastaut said.    U.S. F-16 warplanes carried out two sorties, at 1625 GMT and  1629 GMT, she said. She characterized the attacks as "close air  support" rather than air strikes in the traditional sense  because the objective was to protect the observers and other UN  staff in Gorazde.    On Saturday Butrus-Ghali instructed the UN force in Bosnia  to  use all means necessary to force the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw  to positions they held before their Gorazde offensive began in  late March.</p>

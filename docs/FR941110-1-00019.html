			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> New Jersey, using emissions from the EPA-approved MOBILE4.1 model, demonstrated attainment of the carbon monoxide standard with the EPA-approved CAL3QHC air quality dispersion model. New Jersey took emission reductions credit from an enhanced inspection and maintenance program, oxygenated fuels, and the federal motor vehicle control program (vehicle turnover) as control measures to attain the standard. The following is a summary of the methods and modeling techniques New Jersey used in its attainment demonstration. A more detailed explanation of this modeling is contained in the Technical Support Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To begin the modeling process, New Jersey first selected then ranked the ``worst case'' intersections that the New Jersey Department of Transportation, working in conjunction with the county and local governments, had identified. Next, New Jersey chose a background concentration and an ambient temperature for use in the CAL3QHC intersection model. Once all the parameters were selected, the modeling was performed and maximum future carbon monoxide concentrations were predicted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey ranked the ``worst case'' intersections with a technique other than that prescribed by the EPA guidance, ``Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections.'' This guidance specifies that such rankings use Level Of Service (LOS) calculations which measure the operating conditions in the intersection and how those conditions affect traffic flow and delay. As such, LOS is a measure of the combined traffic volume, signal timing, and related congestion and delay. New Jersey did not have LOS data in its database, and the time and cost of collecting this data prohibited the use of this method. Instead, New Jersey used traffic volume information and a survey conducted by the New Jersey Department of Transportation which examined the geometry of various intersections. Since this traffic volume information is closely related to delay, it is a valid alternative method for ranking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey then used the EPA default background carbon monoxide value of 3.5 ppm for a central business district from the ``Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections.'' This background was used in place of EPA's Urban Airshed Model (UAM) or RAM model. Given the lack of reliable gridded traffic information, the UAM or RAM model would have no advantage over the default value in this instance. Further, the default value was shown to be conservative when compared with background values for the entire New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey, using the above parameters along with additional traffic and air quality data inputs required by the CAL3QHC intersection model, then performed an air quality modeling analysis on the 25 ``worst case'' intersections. This analysis demonstrated that all of the modeled intersections will attain the 8-hour carbon monoxide standard of 9 ppm. The highest value obtained was 8.0 ppm, which is 11% below the 8-hour carbon monoxide standard. Since air quality at the most congested intersections was determined to be below the standard, New Jersey has demonstrated that the entire area will be in attainment for carbon monoxide by December 31, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey used appropriate modeling techniques and modeling inputs in this demonstration, however one of the control measures used to demonstrate attainment, the enhanced inspection and maintenance program, submitted on November 15, 1993 has not been fully adopted in accordance with State requirements. In addition, New Jersey has publicly declared its intention to make a revised submittal at a later date. Therefore, EPA is proposing to disapprove the attainment demonstration because it is dependent on an unadopted program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL 2 WILL CARRY UCLA, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT GAMES  </P> <P> Channel 2, KCBS, will televise UCLA's and Loyola Marymount's first-round NCAA  tournament basketball games live on Friday.  </P> <P> UCLA's game against Alabama Birmingham in the East Regional at Atlanta will be  shown at 4 p.m., and Loyola Marymount's game against New Mexico State in the  West Regional at Long Beach will be televised at 8:30.  </P> <P> The NCAA has a blackout policy, so there could be a problem with the Loyola  game if it isn't sold out 24 hours in advance. But the game is expected to sell  out.  </P> <P> The rest of the nation will get the Loyola game on CBS at 11:30 p.m., which  means it will be live in the East. The announcers will be Greg Gumbel and Quinn  Buckner.  </P> <P> Channel 2 is picking up the UCLA telecast from NCAA Productions. Announcers had  not been assigned Monday.  </P> <P> Jay Strong, Channel 2's director of programming, said Hank Gathers' death is  not the reason KCBS decided to show Loyola live.  </P> <P> "We probably would have done it anyway," Strong said. "We are Los Angeles'  college basketball station, and we have obligations to the fans here."  </P> <P> Strong said Channel 2 scrapped the halftime show of Sunday's delayed telecast  of the Pacific 10 tournament championship game between UCLA and Arizona to get  the NCAA tournament pairings announcement on live.  </P> <P> Interestingly, UCLA's 16-point loss to Arizona got a higher Nielsen rating than  the pairings show, 4.0 to 3.0.  </P> <P> ESPN has announced it will televise 11 first-round games live, six on Thursday  and five on Friday. Two of Thursday's telecasts will not be complete games.  </P> <P> ESPN's schedule:  </P> <P> THURSDAY: 9 a.m. -- Clemson-BYU; 11:30 -- La Salle-Southern Mississippi; 1:30  p.m. -- Louisville-Idaho; 4 -- LSU-Villanova; 6 -- Princeton-Arkansas (second  half); 7 -- Indiana-California (in progress).  </P> <P> FRIDAY: 9 a.m. -- Duke-Richmond; 11:30 -- Temple-St. John's; 2 p.m. --  Alabama-Colorado State; 4 -- Georgia-Texas; 6:30 -- Notre Dame-Virginia.  </P></p>

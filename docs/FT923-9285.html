			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Molson dips 2% with slump in hardware side MOLSON Companies, the diversified Canadian brewer, saw earnings dip by 2 per cent in the latest quarter as slightly higher beer and cleaning services profits were offset by the continuing slump in the hardware distribution business. Net earnings fell to CDollars 38.4m (USDollars 32.4m), or 66 cents a share, in the three months to June 30, the first quarter of the company's fiscal year. Earnings a year earlier were CDollars 39.3m, or 71 cents a share. Revenues for the period climbed to CDollars 799m from CDollars 762m. Molson Breweries, Molson's joint venture with Foster's Brewing of Australia, managed a 3 per cent rise in operating profits, despite a shrinking overall beer market. Molson's market share slipped to 50.3 per cent from 51.8 per cent a year earlier. Diversey Corporation, the international cleaning services subsidiary, lifted profits by 10 per cent, thanks largely to gains in the UK and Germany. But sales in North America were soft and margins were eroded by stiff competition. Beaver Lumber's profit fell by 16 per cent, reflecting the unexpectedly protracted recession in Canada. Molson said it expected the business recovery to gain momentum later this year, but at a 'moderate rate'.</p>

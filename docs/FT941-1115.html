			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar wobbles Dollar and sterling woes continued on the foreign exchanges yesterday, but the two currencies managed to recover from earlier lows, writes Philip Gawith. Both were victim to the bearish sentiment sweeping through financial markets. Analysts said there was no cogent explanation for the current malaise where markets seemed determined to squeeze a bearish message out of unrelated events. Perhaps the worst case of jitters was in the sterling futures market where there was a very heavy sell-off in the morning. The June contract fell to a low of 94.55, effectively discounting a 20 basis points increase in three month money by mid-year. Prices later recovered and the June contract settled seven points lower at 94.66. The December contract was also seven points down at 94.18 after touching a low of 93.97, implying base rates of over 6 per cent. The performance of sterling provided a good measure of the confusion. While futures were plunging, discounting a significant tightening of rates, sterling was falling at an equally impressive rate. The UK currency touched a low of DM2.4880 against the D-Mark before recovering to finish in London at DM2.4978, slightly above Thursday's close of DM2.4971. It finished slightly higher against the dollar at Dollars 1.4975 from Dollars 1.493. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers, said sterling's weakness related to the general weakness of UK asset markets. He said the UK had a much poorer inflation record than countries like the US and Germany, so 'it is natural that there would be a bigger risk premium on UK assets at this point.' Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said sterling was weak because the market was drawing an analogy between the UK and the US, saying UK rates would also have to move up. Most observers believe the market is too pessimistic about UK rates, with a further 25 basis points cut a possibility, though it may have to wait for the summer. In the discount market the Bank of England offered late assistance of Pounds 240m after forecasting a Pounds 1.05bn shortage. Earlier it had put Pounds 718m liquidity into the market. The dollar recovered from a five month low of DM1.6595 to finish in London at DM1.668, down from Thursday's DM1.6726. Mr Holtham argued that with higher US rates already discounted, the only thing that can help the dollar is people changing their mind about Germany - believing that German rates will go lower. Mr Persaud said the market needed a more decisive signal about the future outlook for rates than the weekly trimmings of the repo rate. The D-Mark was firm in Europe yesterday, continuing to benefit from dollar weakness, and selling in the bond markets. It was up against the French franc at FFr3.426 from FFr3.424 on Thursday. It was weaker against the lira which recovered from a low of L997.05 to end at L988.8, compared to L993.2 on Thursday. Trading was nervous ahead of this weekend's election.</p>

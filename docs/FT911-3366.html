			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: In search of martyrdom - Cinema THE DOORS (18) Odeon Marble Arch WHITE PALACE (18) Plaza QUICK CHANGE (15) Cannons West End SCENES FROM A MALL (15) Cannons West End WINGS OF FAME (15) Curzon Phoenix 'If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear as it is, infinite.' It was astute of William Blake, a film critic before his time, to associate the notion 'doors' with the notion 'infinite.' Oliver Stone's film The Doors seems infinite, though it lasts a mere 141 minutes. Yet it shows not the remotest perception of what was 'infinite' in the Blake-ian sense about The Doors' music. Even I, a non-rockomane, recognise in Jim Morrison's broody-thunderous songs a power born of some pyromaniac vision in the soul. Stone's vision is the same as the one he brought to Platoon and Born On The Fourth Of July. Well-upholstered hyperbole drives on the story, with a few tinny morals attached like cans to a wedding car. Drug-prone composer-vocalist Morrison, though played and sung with spitting-image similitude by Val Kilmer, is presented as a messiah in search of martyrdom. Society is out to get him, but who in this film is 'him'? No human being dwells inside the mad eyes and the marijuana'd wisecracks. ('I don't remember being born,' he tells a reporter, 'it must have been during one of my blackouts'). This Morrison was a bio-pic legend even before he was born. The whole film starts with the assumption of immortality then tries to climb higher into Rock Era inspirationalism. Socking on through concert after concert (mixing real and staged footage), traversing ever dottier sexual skirmishes with girlfriend Meg Ryan or groupie Kathleen Quinlan ('Have you ever tried drinking blood?'), the story's ascent is interrupted only by the odd dutiful attempt to 'explain' Morrison. He may have been traumatised as a child by the sight of a roadside accident (cue surreally bleached flashback). Or he may have been a free soul spurred to revolt by society's moral pressures or the Vietnam war or . . . What the hell. Suffice it that he is a genius and the film is two hours of designer idolatry. Stone's Steadicam powers on through rock stadiums and hotel corridors, tracking after its hero like a mad lepidopterist chasing a butterfly. Occasionally the headlong chase yields a glimpse of some Elysian possibility. The film could have been a pop-world mockumentary in the style of This Is Spinal Tap, but its funny lines are strictly unintentional. ('I had enough of this shit with Janis,' screams a studio manager at a misbehaving Morrison). It could have confined itself to what it does best: re-constructing the concerts via fact and fiction. Stone comes into his barnstorming own here: the thousands of extras are whipped into a plausible frenzy, as the air crackles to 'Come on, baby, light my fire' or 'This is the end.' At these moments Morrison-fever means something. Elsewhere in The Doors it means only Hollywood's latest bid to be with it by jumping on a bandwagon that vanished 20 years ago. White Palace starts out as a steamy slice of erotic life only to end up a soggy May-December romance. Max (James Spader) is an effete Yuppie adman who is emotionally scarred by the accidental death of his wife. He seems destined for a life of tortured celibacy until he meets Nora (Susan Sarandon), a brassy hamburger waitress 16 years his senior. Against all the odds, the two fall madly in love, bonded not only by intense sexual desire but also by shared tragedy - Nora lost her teenage son to drugs. Their first few dates see them proceeding all the way from the sofa to the waterbed, with Nora using her considerable skills and experience to draw Max out of his cocoon of impotent self-pity. So fa so good. In these opening scenes director Lius Mandoki elicits the film's erotic tension with a steady, stylish hand. Spader's unctuous self-containment, reminiscent of his fine performance in sex, lies and videotape, is perfect for his character, while Sarandon is eminently believable as a woman determined to keep middle age at bay by sheer sensual will. Unfortunately, their energy flags about a half-hour into the film, transforming it into a quirky love story far less engrossing than the initial pyrotechnics promised. There's a squabble over a vacuum cleaner, an embarrassing visit by Nora's clairvoyant sister (Eileen Brennan), and the inevitable confrontation when Max brings his older, declasse girl home to meet family and friends. Sarandon is much less convincing making impassioned pleas for the working class to Spader's smug relations than she is showing him the sensual ropes. After all this soppy domesticity, it comes as little surprise that heir final reconciliation is sealed with a chaste, public kiss, in which eroticism is joked about rather than explored. It also comes as little surprise that Bill Murray plays a robber in Quick Change. There can be few more apt roles for one of modern cinema's most adept scene stealers. In fact, everything about this light, engaging comedy suits Murray perfectly, lending him a perfect vehicle for his wry asides and deadpan double-takes. He plays an ambitious thief who, with the help of a clown suit, a sexy girlfriend (Geena Davis) and a doltish sidekick (Randy Quaid), pulls off what just might be the perfect bank heist. Unfortunately, the one thing that he doesn't take into account is making his getaway through New York City, portrayed here as a thoroughly moronic inferno. Maniacal bus drivers, lovelorn Mafia wiseguys and urban jousters conspire to turn a simple trip to Kennedy Airport into a tortuous adventure. Murray deadpans his way through it all with consummate skill, particularly in the opening scenes when he takes over the bank. Despite attempts at broadening his character with hints of a traumatic Vietnam past and a romantic entanglement with Davis, he never stops being Bill Murray, even when hidden behind a fright wig and white face. Everybody else - including New York - plays off him with varying degrees of success. His fans will not be disappointed. Fans of the triumvirate headlining Scenes from a Mall - Paul Mazursky, Woody Allen and Bette Midler - will be less satisfied. Everything is in place here for a wonderful comedy, with the veteran satirist Mazursky directing Allen and Midler as a successful Beverly Hills couple (she's a best-selling author of psychobabble, he's a sports lawyer) publicly feuding their way through their 16th wedding anniversary. The movie is strangely flat, however, despite an occasionally trenchant script by the director and Roger L. Simon. The problem, surprisingly, is with the leads, who suffer from a disappointing lack of chemistry. When mixed, these two potent and precious elements fizzle out rather than ignite. Allen bravely plays against his usual screen persona, sporting a pony tail and singing the praises of Los Angeles, but is never altogether convincing. Nor is Midler, whose frenetic mastery is only sometimes glimpsed, such as when she publicly pelts her wayward husband with sushi. For the most part, she's as subdued and aimless as the picture itself. It's a shame that Wings of Fame isn't a bit more subdued. In it, Peter O'Toole plays a pompous actor who is gunned down by a deranged fan (Colin Firth). When the assassin perishes as well, their spirits are barged to the netherworld, depicted here as a posh island hotel inhabited by famously dead souls. It is a last resort of sumptuous comfort and profound ennui - Hemingway shoots clay pigeons, Einstein saws away at his fiddle, even Lassie makes an appearance, lurking in the bushes. All wait in dread of the moment when their earthly fame runs out and they will be consigned to the much less cozy mists of oblivion. Despite the overblown symbolism of hooded boatmen, cadaverous bellhops and blindfolded archers, writer/director Otakar Votocek has a simple point to make - in a godless world, fame is the only form of immortality going. He would have fared far better to ease up on the skewered allegory and focus on the complex relationship between O'Toole and Firth, who both labour heroically to salvage the film from its pretensions. O'Toole is characteristically dissolute and charming, maintaining his legendary poise even in a film that sends him to Hell and back.</p>

Every company applying for a loan from the IECF  must submit, together with the loan application document, a copy  of the report on the feasibility study on the project concerned,  a copy of the economic returns analysis report, and a report on  the company's capital flow.    2. To keep the authorities informed of the spending of  the loan extended by the IECF, every borrower is to forward in a  timely manner a report on the spending of the loan extended by  the IECF and a relevant financial statement to both MOFERT and  the Ministry of Finance.    3. In compliance with the current interest rate for  bank loans, the annual interest rate for loans extended by the  IECF is to be readjusted as of 1 April 1989 to 4 percent per  annum for loans in Renminbi and 5 percent per annum for loans in  U.S. dollars. Loans granted before 1 April 1989 also will have  their interest rates readjusted to the above annual rates  effective 1 July 1989.    4. In the case of any debtor failing to repay the loan  as scheduled for any special reason, it is to apply to MOFERT  for late repayment one month before the loan is due. MOFERT can  approve the application for late repayment, provided the  application is found, on examination, to be justified. However,  in this case, the interest is to instead be charged on the loan  according to the annual rates fixed by the Bank of China and the  Construction Bank of China. Should the reasons given to support  the late repayment application be found unjustified, no late  repayment will be allowed, and the interest rate for the loan  will be readjusted to the annual interest rates fixed by the  Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China effective on  the due date of the loan. In addition, an extra 20 percent  financial service fee will be charged to the debtor.    [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade    Ministry of Finance    20 April 1989</p>

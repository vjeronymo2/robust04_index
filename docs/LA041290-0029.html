			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN CHARGED WITH FRAUD THAT COST MIGRANTS $4,000  </P> <P> An Oceanside man was charged Wednesday with felony grand theft after he  allegedly persuaded a small group of migrant workers to turn over nearly $4,000  to him in exchange for lucrative airline jobs that did not exist.  </P> <P> Four felony counts were filed against Jesus Garcia Arroya, 37, who authorities  said convinced a group of migrants they would be hired for well-paying  maintenance and welding positions at USAir if they paid him in cash for union  dues and training fees.  </P> <P> "I've never heard of anything exactly like this," said district attorney's  spokeswoman Linda Miller, adding that migrants are more typically robbed of  cash rather than made the victims of con artists.  </P> <P> Authorities believe that, last December and January, Arroya met at least six  North County migrants through mutual acquaintances, saying he was employed by  USAir and would receive a bonus for signing up new workers.  </P> <P> Arroya allegedly collected nearly $4,000 in phony union dues and advance  payments for job training courses.  </P> <P> The purported scheme began unraveling when two of the migrants appeared March 5  at USAir's offices in San Diego and "stated they were reporting for work,"  Miller said.  </P> <P> She said the migrants showed the airline supervisors what the migrants thought  were employee cards, but what were actually plastic-covered baggage tags made  to look like official identification.  </P> <P> USAir officials contacted the district attorney's office, which began an  investigation that led to Arroya's arrest in Oceanside on Monday. He was taken  into custody without incident by a district attorney's investigator, and was  being held Wednesday in County Jail at Vista in lieu of $20,000 bail.  </P> <P> Miller said Arroya is presumed to be in this country legally, as are his  alleged victims.  </P> <P> "Con men think migrants won't come forward to the authorities," she said. "They  think they can get away with it. It's shameful."  </P> <P> She said the district attorney's office is investigating whether other migrants  might have been victimized.  </P></p>

After the announcement from Washington, sources in the  shipping industry, which is widely considered to be a barometer  of international trade, said big orders from U.S. buyers may not  start coming in before the U.S. government works out final  clarification regarding tariffs on Vietnamese-made goods.    However, some local firms maintaining production lines in  Vietnam which had been indirectly exporting Vietnamese-made  goods to the United States by relabeling them in third countries  will see their costs significantly reduced as a result of the  U.S. policy shift.    International shipping lines are getting ready to handle an  increasing amount of business from transfers of Vietnamese cargo  to U.S.-bound ships.    "We expect a lot of exports (to the U.S.) now," said one  official at Evergreen Marine Corp's Taipei office." "This is  good news for the shipping industry."    The lifting of the embargo "will certainly pioneer a lot of  good opportunities in the shipping industry for all merchants,"  he said. According to the Evergreen official, firms in Vietman  wanting to ship to U.S. ports will be able to do so right away  because Evergreen already operates feeder services from Haiphong  to Kaohsiung and from Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) to Singapore,  where cargos can now be easily transferred to U.S.-bound ships.    "The service was already there, so we can transfer to  U.S.-bound ships immediately," he said. Most other international  shippers also have similar Vietnam services, with the notable  exception being U.S.-owned lines, which are expected to get new  routes to Vietnamese ports going as soon as possible.    The potential for increased exports between Vietnam and the  United States "is very big," the Evergreen official said. "Just  like it has been in the mainland."    However, conditions at poorly maintained port facilities in  Vietnam are far from ideal and it may take some time before  necessary improvements can be made to them, he noted.    Another official working at a major foreign shipping  carrier's Taipei office said he doesn't expect a sudden rush in  U.S.-Vietnam shipping "because it will still take some time" for  U.S. companies to work out deals with Vietnamese exporters and  sign contracts.    Authorities in the United States still need to make some  important decisions regarding tariffs on imported goods from  Vietnam, he said, so American importers will probably wait to  see if Vietnam gets the United States' most-favored-nation trade  status or other special trade privileges before making any large  orders.    It could take about nine months to one year before-direct  U.S.-Vietnam trade really starts to develop, he said.    Meanwhile, "trade between Vietnam and its Asian neighbors is  already flourishing" so the lifting of the embargo probably  won't have much of an effect on outbound shipments there, at  least for the short term, he said.    However, American shippers which now can book loads in  Vietnam might experience an increase in inter-Asian business, he  said.    According to ROC [Republic of China] government estimates,  Taiwan is Vietnam's No. 1 source of foreign investment capital,  with more than US$1.5 billion invested to date, mostly in  low-end, labor-intensive production lines based in the southern  part of the country.    Many of these investments were made by local entrepreneurs  in  the hopes that the U.S. would soon lift its embargo against its  former war-time enemy.</p>

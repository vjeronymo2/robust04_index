			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / BT's video-on-demands cheme clears hurdle: Special permit not needed for film-by-phone move BRITISH TELECOM yesterday cleared an important regulatory hurdle on the way to launching a multi-billion-pound video-on-demand service down its telephone lines. The Independent Television Commission said that, after discussions with Oftel, the telecommunications industry watchdog, and the Department of Trade and Industry, it did not think BT would need a special local delivery licence under broadcasting legislation. The ambitious plan to deliver feature films and other television programmes to consumers' screens in 23m UK homes through the telephone network would have been stopped by the need to have such a licence. An application would probably have been refused by the ITC for areas where cable networks were already being built. The plans, which go before BT's board in October for agreement in principle, envisage using telephone lines to call up a menu of films electronically on the television screen and order and watch a chosen film for a fee. BT has demonstrated the technology to several media companies including Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, and London Weekend Television. Apart from delivering pictures of video recorder quality, BT says orthodox telephone lines can simultaneously cope with a telephone call and the data involved in managing the system. The ITC said it was telling all parties involved that it did not think a service that consisted of transmitting individual programmes to one household at a time in response to a request needed a local delivery licence. But the commission added that close consideration of the 1990 Broadcasting Act had not remov-ed all legal uncertainty and the issue may yet have to be resolved in the courts. A final ITC view would also depend on proposals made in a detailed application. The ITC's view on the licensing requirements of video-on- demand would not prevent either the Department of Public Prosecutions or third parties such as cable television companies taking action in the courts. But it does clear the way for the BT board to decide whether video-on-demand represents a significant business opportunity.</p>

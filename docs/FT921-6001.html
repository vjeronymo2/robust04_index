			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / How to Spend It: Lovely big Macs to go - The Macdonalds' distinctive and lightweight rainwear THERE ARE those who will never be persuaded that a gentlemen wears anything but a Burberry or an Aquascutum when rain is threatening. But there are others who have learned that raincoats come in many shapes and forms, and that those made by Cocoon have something special to offer. The Cocoon range was started by William and Malla Macdonald a few years ago and its chief claim to fame was the original fabric - made from a mixture of 60 per cent cotton and 40 per cent nylon. It is light, strong and it breathes. It is almost totally water-repellent, partly because of the special weave and partly because it is impregnated with a silicone proofing agent. The fabric has a lovely, slightly crinkly texture and seems to take colour exceptionally well. And on top of all that it can be washed in a washing machine. There is now another Cocoon fabric, this time a mixture of 60 per cent cotton and 40 per cent Tactel, which is also light but is softer and more supple. It is coated with a permanent resin finish. The original fabric seems almost uncrushable, which makes the raincoats perfect for travelling - you roll them up and pack them in the pouch they come in and off you go. When it rains the coat emerges looking as good as ever it did. The Macdonalds have wisely gone for a particular niche in the market - neither safely classic nor ultra-trendy, Cocoon products have that air of always being vaguely fashionable. The range is small - some strong basic shapes, homing in on roomy styles that shrug over sweaters or jackets. Each can be ordered with optional detachable hoods and matching large tammies or sou'westers, lined with Viyella. All the coats can be ordered with a Viyella lining that is fastened with snaps. With the lining the coats are warm enough for all except the very coldest weather. The colours are lovely - dark chocolate brown, bright red, light and dark khaki, black, navy blue. All coats are made to order, so they fit properly and you get exactly the shape you want, in the colour you have chosen, with the lining you want. Prices are around the Pounds 150 to Pounds 200 mark and the coats are made for both men and women. Potential customers can visit the showroom and workshop on the banks of Loch Lomond at Alexandria, Scotland, or there is a shop at 28 Victoria Street, Edinburgh and another at 142 Campden Hill Road, Holland Park, London W8 7AS. If you cannot visit the shops you can order by mail from Cocoon, Macdonald Originals, Lomond Industrial Estate, Alexandria, Dumbartonshire, Scotland G83 OTL. Tel: 0389-55511.</p>

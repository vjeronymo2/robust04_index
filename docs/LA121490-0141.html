			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE COLD WAR;  </P> <P> SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL EXAMINES THE LATEST STAGE OF U.S. POLITICS  </P> <P> What if they ended a war and nobody noticed?  </P> <P> Herein lies the premise of political analyst Sidney Blumenthal's chronicle of  the 1988 presidential campaign, which he says was lived "as if the Cold War  were raging and Stalin alive."  </P> <P> Yet, despite the war being declared over -- by "Cold Warrior" Ronald Reagan  five months before the election -- George Bush and Michael Dukakis waged  campaigns that focused on national security.  </P> <P> To Blumenthal, that was a huge mistake. He thinks "the public was ready for  some risk" and was already seeing tried-and-true politics as "old and  outmoded."  </P> <P> In his new book, "Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War,"  Blumenthal, 42, examines what he believes is the failure of Bush and Dukakis to  acknowledge a new world stage with different players. He says they desperately  clung to irrelevant issues.  </P> <P> The book's jacket design -- juxtaposed photographs of a campaigning Bush at a  flag factory in New Jersey and a campaigning Dukakis in flak suit and helmet  aboard an M1 tank at a factory in Michigan -- pretty much sums up Blumenthal's  jaundiced view of U.S. politics-as-usual while one of the great revolutions in  history was under way in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The presidential campaign was largely a contest to prove which man was "100%  American," he says. "Pledging Allegiance" refers to Bush's castigation of  Dukakis for not supporting mandatory pledges by public school children.  </P> <P> Blumenthal, in a recent interview, assessed Bush as a politician for whom the  Nixon presidency was a model. Bush won, he contends, largely "by arousing fear  about the future." This was the same tough-on-crime, tough-on-communism stance  that has served Republicans well since the end of World War II, Blumenthal  says.  </P> <P> Bush condemned Dukakis for being a card-carrying member of the ACLU and hit  hard on Dukakis' stance on crime.  </P> <P> It is ironic, Blumenthal contends, that it was Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to  power in the Soviet Union -- once dubbed by Ronald Reagan the "evil empire" --  that rescued Reagan's presidency from the shadow of the Iran-Contra scandal,  providing it with "a bravura last act." It also made it possible for Bush to be  elected, he says.  </P> <P> And the Democrats -- who had planned a campaign based on Reagan's incompetence,  and a need for change -- found themselves dealing with a voting public that was  getting a change; Bush, who didn't really believe that the Cold War was ending,  was now the candidate of peace. Dukakis did not grasp the implications,  Blumenthal says, and "the floor underneath him began to disappear."  </P> <P> Bush, he believes, was a "very lucky" man, suddenly able "to present himself as  the foreign-policy wise man," says Blumenthal, a senior editor at New Republic  magazine and a former Washington Post writer. During the campaign he wrote  speeches for a cable TV series for Jack Tanner, a fictional presidential  candidate invented by Blumenthal and his friend Garry Trudeau, creator of the  "Doonesbury" comic strip.  </P> <P> Blumenthal is not kind in his assessment of most of the real-life presidential  hopefuls:  </P> <P> * Dukakis was "a man for all vacuums . . . the candidate for the age of safe  sex -- stable and steady, no peaks or valleys . . . the avoidance of  intellectual risk became his strategic imperative."  </P> <P> * Jack Kemp "seemed like Sinclair Lewis' 'Babbitt' reincarnated as a financial  newsletter author."  </P> <P> * Pat Robertson was bloated with "pretensions."  </P> <P> * Jesse Jackson was a self-serving publicity-seeker with a need always to  "dominate the stage," who ultimately did blacks a disservice.  </P> <P> In 1986, Harper &amp; Row (now HarperCollins) approached Blumenthal about  writing a kind of "The Making of the President, 1988" book, in a format  popularized by author Theodore H. White. But Blumenthal was not enthusiastic.  "I thought the genre had been played out," he said, adding that he "already had  a sense the Cold War was ending" and that was the real book.  </P> <P> Two years earlier, his friend Sergey Plekhanov, deputy director of Moscow's  Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada Studies, had told him about "this person  named Gorbachev" and his program for the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Three weeks after the 1988 campaign, Blumenthal went to Moscow, accepting a  standing invitation from Plekhanov to visit the institute, which Blumenthal  describes as a place where "the Americanologists study us in the way our  Kremlinologists study them."  </P> <P> His book opens with a scene at the institute, which is housed in a mansion that  was once the home of a czarist aristocrat. There, Soviet analysts "chuckled  over the foibles of Gary Hart and Dan Quayle, shook their heads over Michael  Dukakis' haplessness and expressed a cynical appreciation for George Bush's  cynicism. . . . "  </P> <P> He found that they were consumed by the end of the Cold War and they were  astonished at how U.S. political figures were ignoring it.  </P> <P> During the campaign, dialogue on a post-Cold War world "would have been  extremely helpful for the country," Blumenthal believes. As it is, he observes,  the chief legacy of the Dukakis campaign was a belief that "you must always  respond to negative campaigns."  </P> <P> Despite the mediocrity of Campaign '88 -- a race that Blumenthal sees as  symptomatic of a "morbid" system -- he does not believe that TV sound bites and  paid political strategists necessarily dictate empty, humdrum politics.  </P> <P> Blumenthal says it is hard to extract clear messages from the recent elections  because they were held in the shadow of the Gulf crisis. Although the  "throw-the-rascals-out" revolt that had been predicted did not take place, he  believes "the public clearly is struggling with itself . . . it wants some  change that it can't define."  </P> <P> What's going on, he thinks, is that Americans are trying to deal with  unsettling realities -- a middle class in trouble, a public education system in  a mess, recession, a government paralyzed by social problems, the savings and  loan scandal, worsening racial conflict.  </P> <P> Of Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, Blumenthal says he "caught the mood of Californians  -- status quo, plus. People want everything to stay the same, yet suddenly get  better without anything changing. All benefits, no risks."  </P> <P> Late 1990 is an "eerie interregnum," Blumenthal says, post-Cold War but  pre-change.  </P> <P> Change is inevitable, he says, because "sooner or later someone is going to  connect the condition of the middle class to the status of America in the  world." As the U.S. industrial base is demolished, as the nation's insolvency  no longer permits it to make itself felt in the world as it once was, he says,  the squeeze is on the middle class.  </P> <P> He himself is from a middle-class family -- his father was a salesman in  Chicago -- and he grew up believing that, in America, "anything was possible."  Today, he says, "this sense of the American century is gone with the wind and  the middle class is angry and confused and sometimes resentful, just as America  is."  </P> <P> Blumenthal, who is currently writing a book about Secretary of State James  Baker -- "one of the most important figures in American politics since Nixon"  -- insists "I am not a radical pessimist." The problem, he says, is "absence of  leadership. What we need is a Roosevelt, a Disraeli, someone who understands  politics deeply."  </P></p>

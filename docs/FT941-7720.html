			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Deere increases to Dollars 87m on strong US demand Deere &amp; Co, the US agriculture and construction equipment manufacturer, said strong North American demand boosted first-quarter income to Dollars 87m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, reversing a year-ago loss before accounting charges of Dollars 36.9m, or 48 cents. Sales in the quarter jumped 21 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.4bn in last year's first quarter. The strong sales enabled Deere's plants to remain open on full schedules during the quarter, increasing production tonnage 25 per cent on last year's depressed first quarter. The company's shares jumped Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 82 1/2 . Deere's equipment businesses had been expected to benefit from rising farm income, low interest rates, and a modest economic recovery that has stimulated new home construction. However, the earnings improvement was far better than forecast. Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said that he expected Deere's 1994 worldwide production tonnage to rise about 13 per cent over 1993 output. Most of the production increase will be in Deere's North American equipment operations. He added that overseas sales of Deere products continued to be relatively weak, but the company was outperforming the industry. 'First-quarter North American retail sales provide a strong base for operations during the remainder of the year,' Mr Becherer said. Despite weather-related shortfalls of corn and soya-bean production, US farm net cash income is forecast to have achieved record levels in 1993. In Europe, Mr Becherer said 1994 farm equipment sales were predicted to be no worse than in 1993. During the first quarter, Deere's worldwide farm equipment sales jumped 29 per cent to Dollars 887m and sales of industrial and construction equipment rose 33 per cent to Dollars 308m. Lawn care equipment sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 212m.</p>

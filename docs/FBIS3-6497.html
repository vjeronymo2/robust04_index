Appearing on the NBC television network that day, Director  Woolsey pointed out North Korea, which recently refused a  full-scale inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  as being such a state, along with Iran, Iraq, and Libya.    He stressed that these two points, including the export of  terrorism, will possibly impose a serious threat to us, and  therefore, these points should be dealt with at top priority.    Director Woolsey again revealed "the fact that North Korea  has extracted plutonium capable of manufacturing at least more  than one nuclear weapon is the view of the majority of U.S.  intelligence authorities." He said that "there is a possibility  that North Korea will threaten peace in Northeast Asia and that  North Korea is a state which proliferates weapons, thus posing a  serious problem."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Minsk, May 31, RIA -- The actions of Vyacheslav  Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers, in signing a  treaty on merging the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus,  contain no corpus delicti.    This is the conclusion formed by the republican prosecutor's  office which examined, at the request of some political parties  in opposition to the government, whether some articles of the  treaty correspond to the Constitution of Belarus.    Nikolay Kupriyanov, head of the supervisory department of  the  prosecutor's office, explained that certain clauses of the  treaty, in particular one on transforming the national bank into  a subsidiary of the Russian Central Bank, contradict the  republic's fundamental law, which grants the national bank the  rights and duties of the country's sole issuing centre.    But, in Kupriyanov's view, actually Kebich did not sign this  clause, because Stanislav Bogdanevich, the chairman of the  National Bank, had previously refused to initial it.    So there is no reason to charge the prime minister before  the  entry of the treaty into force.    The charge against Kebich was lifted today -- the day his  candidacy was entered in the list of presidential candidates as  no. 1, a RIA correspondent was told in the Central Electoral  Commission.</p>

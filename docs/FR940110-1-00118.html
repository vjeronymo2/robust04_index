In addition, the FHWA is proposing minor technical changes in an effort to keep the FMCSRs current. The removal of obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices is one of the first actions taken by the FHWA following the Agency's Zero Base Regulatory Review public outreach sessions. The deletion of these regulations should result in the reduction of the paperwork burden on the industry without any reduction in safety benefits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before March 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;32, room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

To remain effective, regulations must reflect trends in State regulatory practices as well as technical and operational changes in the motor carrier industry. The motor carrier safety regulations were initially promulgated and enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1937. In 1967 the Department of Transportation (DOT) was created by the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, (Pub. L. 89&hyph;670, 80 Stat. 931) and the regulatory and enforcement authority for motor carrier safety was transferred to the DOT. Today this authority is vested in the FHWA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the years, the FMCSRs have been modified incrementally, usually by addition of new provisions and often because of congressional mandates. Some sections, however, no longer correspond to current practices in the motor carrier industry, and others have been superseded by State or local initiatives. In September 1992, the Federal Highway Administration began a comprehensive multi-year effort to re-create a body of safety rules and regulations that are (1) understandable, (2) enforceable, (3) capable of being implemented by industry, and above all, (4) consistent with highway safety. The effort has been termed ``Zero Base Regulatory Review.'' The review will not edit the current regulations, but will start with the basic questions of who, what, and how do we regulate and what is essential to improve motor carrier safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concurrent with the Zero Base effort, the FHWA participated in a governmentwide review of regulations designed to identify regulations that were no longer required or unnecessarily hindered economic growth. The FHWA's proposed deletions were incorporated into an NPRM published by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) on May 20, 1992 (57 FR 21362). On December 22, 1992, the OST published a final rule but declined to take final action on the FHWA proposals. 57 FR 60725. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket comments submitted in response to the May 20 NPRM, and other comments received in conjunction with the FHWA's Zero Base review effort, were evaluated by the FHWA in preparing the current NPRM. The FHWA has identified several requirements that are obsolete or redundant, i.e., which are repeated by State law or covered in another part of the FMCSRs or which could be reissued as non-regulatory guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Criteria Used for Regulation Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The objectives of the FHWA's regulatory review were to (1) eliminate requirements not needed to carry out the regulatory program; (2) ensure that rules are clear and succinct; (3) reduce lengthy and excessively detailed regulations whenever possible; (4) eliminate redundancy; (5) eliminate excessive reporting requirements; and (6) reduce or eliminate paperwork burdens wherever possible, without compromising safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section-by-Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> Part 391_Qualifications of Drivers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The primary function of part 391 is to ensure that operators of CMVs meet minimum physical standards and possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities to operate CMVs safely. The FHWA has reviewed the regulations in part 391 and has determined that all requirements pertaining to the written examination and record of violations are unnecessary, for the reasons set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Technology: Getting ideas to market Companies that race ahead on innovation do not always win in the market-place. Some fail miserably. This harsh message was spelled out by John Kay, professor of economics at the London Business School, at a seminar yesterday in London. 'Firms are failing to understand that technological innovation has to be used in conjunction with other factors.' Kay, also chairman of the London Economics consultancy, said the most innovative companies were not always those able to make a commercial success out of their technological achievements. Nor were technological advances enough to combat competition from low-wage countries. At the seminar, organised by the Economic and Social Research Council, he noted that by most criteria, Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals company, was the most successful British company of the past decade. However, 'its success is based not on the originality of its innovation, which is modest, but on the effectiveness with which it exploited this. There is a lesson there for all British companies.' European companies generally are worse at making a success out of innovation than those in the Japan and the US, he reckoned. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has an impressive technological record but a poor financial one. Kay said managing innovation could be costly and uncertain; some innovations might be technically successful but not profitable. Also, many companies do not know how to prevent technology 'running away' with their organisation or how to integrate it effectively (as with financial service concerns). Kay warned, too, that the rewards of innovation are hard to collect, since financial returns must be defended from competitors, suppliers, customers and groups within the company itself. The weakness of innovations is that they can often be copied easily.</p>

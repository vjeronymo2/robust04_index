			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market 'near a turning point' THE PROSPECTS for the cocoa industry, beset by years of low prices and over-production, are finally improving, according to speakers at the International Conference on Cocoa Economy in Bali. 'We appear to be near a turning point with low prices depressing production and stimulating consumption,' Mr S. Wateridge, Director of Research at ED &amp; F. Man, the UK commodity trading house, told the conference yesterday. Cocoa analysts note cocoa's world market price has risen more than 25 per cent in three months to more than Pounds 950 a tonne and Mr Wateridge predicted a further rise to Pounds 1,400 within 18 months. 'The production increases of the mid-1980s are no longer apparent, with the exception of Indonesia,' said Mr Wateridge. 'Consumption has expanded rapidly despite economic collapse in the former Soviet Union and recession in western Europe and the USA.' World production is forecast at 2.34m tonnes this year, up from the 1.8m tonnes average of 1984-86. While world consumption in 1993 is forecast at 2.44m tonnes, it only rose above production levels a few years ago after seven years of surpluses. Delegates were split on how the industry's changing fortunes would affect the proposed long-term production agreement discussed by producing nations last July in Geneva. Following the Geneva meeting the International Cocoa Organisation began a four-and-a-half year timetable to sell its stocks of 230,000 tonnes. Most delegates agreed greater co-operation between producing nations was required if prices rises were to be sustained beyond Pounds 1,400, historically not a high price in real terms for cocoa. The proposed agreement, however, has not yet been endorsed by Indonesia and Malaysia, both major producers. Indonesia's production surged from just 7,000 tonnes in 1980 to 180,000 tonnes last year and is forecast to double again by the end of the decade. Some Indonesian delegates say a production agreement is not in their interests and is unnecessary given the recent improvement in prices and consumption. While congratulating Indonesia on its record of growth, delegates also had words of caution. Mr Anthony Lass, Head of Agricultural Affairs at Cadbury, the UK confectionery company, said Indonesia must become 'quality conscious as well' or its cocoa would continue to sell at a discount to the world market. Mr Wateridge warned that the extent of future price rises 'depends critically on Indonesia'. Unless Indonesia curbed production growth it was 'likely to put a very low ceiling on the next up-turn in world prices'. Cocoa producers must come to terms with tough new regulations among consuming countries such as the US governing import quality, a senior US trader told the conference, reports Reuter. Mr Johann Scheu, president of the Cocoa Merchants' Association of America, said new or newly-implemented regulations governing packaging, use of pesticides and storage conditions were hurting both producer and supplier. 'These changing attitudes of the public, and hence of government, are making life difficult for the cocoa trading and processing community,' he warned. The US leads the world in imposing tough import restrictions on commodities such as cocoa. Cocoa from three of the world's major exporters, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil, face compulsory fumigation at the point of import, raising costs for importers who pass it on in the form of lower bids.</p>

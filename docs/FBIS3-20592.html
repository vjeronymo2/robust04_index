			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wen Wei (7186 3555): "Speak Up for the Peasants"] </F>   [Text] Easing the peasants' burden has been an important  part of rural work since last year.    Subsequent to the introduction of the State Council's  "Provision on Managing the Peasants' Share of Expenses and  Services," the abolition of 37 fund gathering, foundation, and  fee collection programs was announced on 20 June. It was an  important new measure, but in its actual implementation, are the  localities doing what they please?  <H3>  Deceiving Those Above and Below -- Jacking Up the Per Capita  Net Income </H3>   When a county in the western part of the central Shaanxi  plains reported its per capita net income last year, the county  statistics bureau compiled the figures submitted by the towns  and townships and let the leader in charge of the bureau review  the numbers before submitting them to the city. When the manager  saw that the per capita net income was only 570 yuan, he thought  it was far too low and immediately met with several deputy  county heads to reach a consensus: "We have worked hard for the  last year, and we have so little to show for. It won't do." In  fact these people only had their own promotions in mind. The  county chief who was in charge of agriculture summoned the head  of the statistics bureau to the county government office and  eventually changed the per capita net income to 590 yuan, and  the number was then sent to the city. The city statistics bureau  noticed that the per capita income of the people in a village in  the mountains in a certain town was only 176 yuan. They worried  that it might drag down the whole city's per capita income, and  so the manager immediately called up the county statistics  bureau which got in touch with the town statistician who said  that the number had been reported by the town. The county  statistics bureau later took it upon itself to change the per  capita income to 340 yuan. The whole county's per capita net  income was raised by 20 yuan, and based on the rule that the  peasant's burden may not exceed 5 percent of the per capita  income of the previous year, the county was taking away 1 yuan  from every peasant. The county claimed that the peasant's share  was only a little more than 4 percent, but in fact it was 9  percent.    Relevant data show that counties tempering with the per  capita net income figures is a nationwide practice; it is only a  matter of how far each would go.  <H5>  Rural Electricity Prices Turn Somersaults </H5>   Walk around any village and mention electricity price and  you  will see how angry the peasant can get. They are very unhappy  with the "electric tiger." Study shows that electricity prices  differ among the 21 towns and townships and 250 villages in one  county, and none is complying the current state-set price. Some  charge more than three times the state-set rate; their receipts  come in all shapes, colors, and forms.    From data provided by the electricity department, one learns  that electricity rate for lighting is a three-tier system: low,  normal, and peak rates which translate to 0.129 yuan per degree,  0.257 yuan per degree, and 0.386 yuan per degree respectively.  Motive electricity generally cost 0.207 yuan per degree. When I  checked the receipts of the 312 electricity customers I visited  in the county, I found most were standard invoices used in the  cities and a few were town- and village-level invoices; some  were blank slips.    The Chen family in Group 3 of Miganqiao Village in a certain  township owns an electric oven (with two-phase motor.) When the  electrician collects the bill, he adds the amount of electricity  consumed by the oven to the bill. That household's monthly  electric bill comes to an average of 50 yuan. The Sunjiabao  Village in a certain township makes its own electric bills and  charges as much as 0.70 yuan per degree, which shocks most  people. Two villages in another town issues blank slips and  charges 0.30 all the way up to 0.60 yuan per degree. Some  peasant families have to make do with oil lamps.    Some village group cadres pay little or nothing for  electricity. This has become a common practice. This is because  village-level cadres can hire and fire electricians at will.  Those who obey the village cadres, who do special favors for the  cadres' families, and who do not charge the cadres will get the  jobs, and so the electricians collaborate and add the cadres'  household electric bills onto the other villagers' bills and  even raise the charges as they please to let the cadres reap a  profit.  <H5>  Improper Apportionment Still Runs Rampant </H5>   Today, when the leading cadres go out, they want to show  off.  They want fancy cars, the best-selling cars. They get money by  hook or by crook so that they can buy cars. They use bank loans  to buy cars; they spend official administrative funds on cars.  Despite specific regulations handed down by the State Council  regarding the grades of cars they can buy, everybody, regardless  of rank, is buying a Santana.    A certain township has a new "Beijing" jeep. In June of this  year [as published], it appropriated 20,000 from each  township-affiliated enterprise, and without getting permission  from the purchase-control office, bought a Santana. A few days  later, the county financial bureau sent someone down to  investigate. The township leader wined and dined him and paid a  fine. An illegal car was thus legalized. The year's jeep is to  be used by the county leaders when they go to the villages, and  the new Santana is for use when they go to town.    Today, the township party committee secretary reportedly is  rewarded for the clever apportionment and is put to work in high  places by the county leadership.    Appropriating money from township enterprises in fact is  adding to the peasants' burdens.  <H5>  Some Thoughts on Easing the Burden </H5>   Since the 1980's, the Party Central Committee and the State  Council have paid special attention to the issue of the  peasants' burden. They have always made protecting the peasants'  interests the most important starting point of their rural work.  They have promulgated a series of policies and measures which  have played a definite role in easing the peasants' burden. But  why is the cancer of heavy burden still here? The problem lies  in the fact that some localities and departments are  half-hearted in carrying out the policies; they move and then  stop, and they distort the policies, or they just go through the  motion of carrying out the policies.    One of the keys to reducing the peasants' burden lies in the  hands of the leading departments at all levels, because many  projects that add to the peasants' burden originate from these  departments. If they do not have a sound and clear understanding  of the problem of the peasants' heavy burden, if they do not  begin to take effective measures, it will be difficult to solve  the problem. To reduce the peasants' burden, there must be a set  of laws and regulations which would severely punish those who  impose heavy burdens on the peasants, so that the party's rural  policy can be implemented smoothly and without obstacle. To ease  the peasants' burden, all sides must work together and lend  their support. Speeding up rural economic development and  increasing the peasants' income are also necessary conditions  for easing the peasants' burden.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters objected to the requirement for legal opinions as to the worldwide enforceability of Mortgages because, generally, no lawyer is able to give an opinion on the law with respect to any jurisdiction other than that in which the lawyer is admitted to practice. Furthermore, it was stated that there are some jurisdictions where Mortgages cannot be enforced as a practical matter. The commenters noted that this requirement adds an additional cost to a transaction that needs to be financially competitive with non-U.S. financing alternatives. Several commenters stated that in-house counsel should be permitted to render opinions and that such practice is commercially acceptable. One commenter noted that the focus should be on the country in which the Vessel is registered and the country where the owner has its principal place of business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter argued that the Secretary should be authorized to accept various types of collateral ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> land, buildings, equipment) or a collateral package ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a combination of first and second Mortgages, assignments, etc.) for Title XI financing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questioned whether it would be practical for the Secretary to promulgate a standard mortgage for each country, because there are so many differences from country to country. Another commenter suggested that there are some countries where the Secretary may not, by law, be a mortgagee and proposed that the regulation be amended to permit the Secretary to appoint or designate an authorized and eligible mortgagee to act on the Secretary's behalf. The comment does not cite any examples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: The regulations provide that ``Under normal circumstances, a Guarantee shall not be endorsed on any Obligation until the Secretary receives satisfactory evidence of a security interest in one or more Vessels .&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' See section 298.31(a). The existing regulations also specifically provide that ``In the case where a Mortgage or a security interest on the financed assets may not be available or enforceable, the Secretary shall require alternative forms of security.'' Therefore, the existing regulations provide flexibility to accept collateral other than ship Mortgages and in unusual circumstances, for example, where a Mortgage is not available in a foreign jurisdiction for a delivered Vessel, MARAD could accept another type of security interest. No amendment to the regulation is necessary in this connection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hallmark of a ship Mortgage is that, once foreclosed upon in admiralty court in an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in rem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> proceeding, the admiralty order transferring possession free and clear of all liens is valid against the whole world. The reference in section (a) was to this type of ``worldwide enforceability.'' Understandably, there are countries which do not afford this comity and international recognition of judgments, particularly those countries which do not have admiralty courts. Taking into account the objections raised to the term ``worldwide enforceability'' and the potentially burdensome legal costs entailed in such an opinion, MARAD has amended this provision to require an enforceability opinion only (1) As to the country in which the vessel is documented, (2) the United States, and (3), in the case of dedicated service (over specified trade routes), the country or countries involved in this service, or if those destinations are too numerous in MARAD's opinion, then only in the Vessel's primary port of operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After much deliberation, MARAD has decided not to accept the suggestion that legal opinions be issued by in-house counsel. It has long been a MARAD precondition for the issuance of a Guarantee that an applicant retain outside, independent legal counsel, who are acceptable to MARAD, to issue such a legal opinion to MARAD. Counsel are required to opine, among other things, that the documents comprising the guaranteed transaction have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered and constitute the valid, legally binding, and enforceable obligations of the Obligor and other Related Parties. We note that other government agencies, most notably the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export-Import Bank, when engaged in similar commercial transactions, require that the applicants pay for an attorney to advise the agency in addition to any that they may employ for themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the argument that the Secretary should be authorized to accept various types of collateral, including land and equipment, second mortgages, assignments, etc., MARAD notes that section 298.31(c) already states that if it is determined that a Mortgage on a financed Vessel or AST/MST is not sufficient, then the Secretary ``may require additional collateral, such as mortgage(s) on other .&blank;.&blank;. assets, special escrow funds, pledges of stock, charters, contracts, notes, letters of credit, accounts receivable, assignments, and guarantees.'' No amendment to the rule is necessary to preserve this discretion, which the Secretary has consistently exercised over the life of the Title XI program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the query whether it would be practical for MARAD to promulgate a standard Mortgage for each country, it should be stated that MARAD has no intention of proposing a standard foreign mortgage. MARAD may, however, over time compile a list of jurisdictions that have satisfactory mortgage laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, with respect to jurisdictions where the Secretary may not, as a matter of law, be a mortgagee, MARAD will not issue a loan Guarantee, unless some other acceptable form of security can be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

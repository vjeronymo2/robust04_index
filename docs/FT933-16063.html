			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Japanese car decision annulled - European Court The European Court of First Instance last week annulled a decision of the European Commission not to pursue five complaints relating to the sale of Japanese cars in France. The Court said, in making its decision, the Commission had committed legal errors in its appreciation of EC competition rules. In the 1980s certain Japanese car importers had agreed with the French government to limit their sales in France to 3 per cent of the French market and 15 per cent of the Martinique market. In exchange for this voluntary restraint, the French agreed the importers should have exclusive access to these quotas. Complaints were lodged by five other importers, alleging the agreement was in breach of EC competition rules. Six years after the first complaint was lodged, the Commission said it would not pursue the complaints because the agreement was an integral part of French policy on the importation of Japanese cars. The Commission added that the importers had had no margin for manoeuvre at the time they entered into the agreement, and that the application of EC competition rules would not give the complainants a remedy in the sense of access to the quota of imported Japanese cars. The Court said that, in cases such as this where the Commission had a power of appraisal, that power had to be exercised with the greatest respect for procedural guarantees, such as the obligation to examine with care and impartiality the particular elements of the relevant case. The Court said that documentary evidence showed that the importers covered by the agreement had agreed among themselves to divide up the quota. The Commission had seen that documentary evidence before it reached its decision not to pursue the complaints. The agreement to divide the quotas was an agreement which fell within the scope of Rome treaty competition rules. The Court said there was no evidence the partition of the market had been forced on the importers by the French as the Commission had said. The Commission had committed an error of appraisal in concluding the importers had no margin of manoeuvre with regard to the agreement. It also ruled that it was the agreement to partition the market, rather than the specific national rules, which was responsible for the lack of access to the market. Applying EC competition rules to the agreement could well have given the complainants access to the market. T-7/92: SA Asia Motor France and others v Commission, CFI 2CH, June 29 1993. Interim measures refused in banana case An application from Germany for interim measures to exclude it temporarily from the new common organisation in the market for bananas was refused by the European Court last week. Germany argued that, by setting quotas for bananas from dollar countries while allowing duty-free access to the Community for bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, the rules of the common organisation were unlawful. Germany said they breached EC competition and agriculture rules, the principle of non-discrimination and the Gatt rules. The Court said these arguments were not completely unjustified. Germany also argued it should be excluded from the rules, as otherwise it would suffer irreparable harm: as the volume of bananas dropped, the price would rise. This would have a significant effect not only on individual consumers but also on people and firms connected with the banana trade. The Court said that, in the event that the quota proved insufficient for Germany's needs, there were provisions in the common organisation to remedy such a problem. Given this, and arguments put on behalf of France, Spain, Portugal and the UK that the exemption of Germany from the regime would lead to intolerable consequences for the ACP producer countries which could lead to social unrest, the Court ruled that Germany's application should be refused.

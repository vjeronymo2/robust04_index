			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NEW PRINCIPAL HAS 'GOOD VIBES' ABOUT MORNINGSIDE  </P> <P> Mallory L. Matthews, an assistant principal at Inglewood High School, has been  named to replace Morningside High School Principal Art Murray, who was forced  out of his job earlier this month by district administrators who held him  responsible for the troubled first semester at the school.  </P> <P> Matthews was described by district officials as an experienced administrator  with firm goals for transforming Morningside. He was Morningside's assistant  principal from 1981-85 before going to Inglewood High.  </P> <P> "He's a listener," district spokesman Maurice Wiley said. "He seems to display  a genuine concern for improvement of the district. His strengths are in  community activities and parent involvement."  </P> <P> Morningside ranks in the bottom 5% in statewide achievement tests and was the  subject of student protests last month over poor instruction, campus conditions  and safety. Matthews gave district officials a two-page strategy for improving  the school that covers maintenance, community relations, school morale and  accountability of school personnel.  </P> <P> "It's not as bad as I expected it to be" based on newspaper accounts and talk  among residents and staff, Matthews said Wednesday morning as he began his  second day on the job. "I got good vibes after the first day. I look forward to  the challenge."  </P> <P> Matthews' improvement strategy called for daily removal of graffiti, a monthly  newsletter for parents, programs to involve more parents in the school and  periodic monitoring by administrators of all teachers. Other plans include an  award program to honor superior students, a detention program for students who  are late or truant, and meetings with the press to publicize the school.  </P> <P> "He came in with an organized plan and he has a tremendous amount of  experience," board member Zyra McCloud said. "He's really paid his dues."  </P> <P> Matthews, who lives near the Morningside campus, received a master's degree in  education from Pepperdine University. In addition to his two assistant  principal posts, Matthews has served as Inglewood's coordinator of adult  education and as a summer school principal. He entered the district in 1980 as  an adult education instructor. He will be paid $55,440.  </P> <P> McCloud said she conducted an informal survey of 30 of Morningside's 40  teachers, who preferred that Murray be retained, although they rated Matthews  as their choice to replace him.  </P> <P> Murray, who came to Inglewood Unified School District last fall from a school  outside Bakersfield, was transferred last week to a special administrative post  created for him in district headquarters after only six months as Morningside  principal. He will be paid $62,016 in his new post, the same salary he received  as principal.  </P> <P> Murray reported to work Friday at his new job but has called in sick so far  this week. In a brief telephone interview Wednesday, he said he was dealt with  unfairly.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter who they send in there," he said from his home in Delano.  "If they don't provide the support and assistance, things won't fly. If they  don't provide the funds to clean up the campus, you're going to have the same  kinds of problems."  </P></p>

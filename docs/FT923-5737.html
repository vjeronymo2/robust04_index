			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Fragile success of the Gatt THE GENERAL Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is not the catchiest of titles. European Community subsidies to oilseeds, Canadian restrictions on imports of ice-cream and US customs user fees are not the most newsworthy of disputes. No wonder the Gatt, though among the most successful, is neither the best known nor the best loved of international economic institutions. Unfortunately, it is loved too little by those whose love it needs most and may, as a result, cease to be successful too. Many, particularly in the US, will pour scorn on the notion that the 'general agreement to talk and talk' has ever been successful. Such American denigration is surprising since the Gatt is largely a US creation. It is also misguided. The Gatt has achieved all its founders could have reasonably hoped. The nature of that success - and the dangers to its survival - are brought out in the report on Gatt activities in 1991 published this morning. The foremost success is simply the growth of world trade, which has continued to increase faster than world output in virtually every year. The growth of world merchandise trade, to reach Dollars 3.5bn in 1991, reflects 45 years of trade liberalisation, most of it achieved in the seven previous rounds of multilateral liberalisation within the Gatt. The international monetary system agreed at Bretton Woods has gone the way of the dodo, but the Gatt has continued to exist, sometimes disregarded and often denigrated, because it is an inter-governmental contract that governments have known they need. Powerful reason Ever more countries know they need it. Eleven countries have joined the Gatt since the start of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations alone. More want to join. The Gatt is becoming a universal trade organisation for a very powerful reason. Its underlying principles - trade liberalisation and the regulation of trade by internationally agreed rules - are now almost universally accepted. The report gives a startling sign of this acceptance: since the start of the Uruguay Round 63 countries have liberalised their trade policies unilaterally. This represents little less than a revolution in global economic policy. It is one the major trading powers long sought, but to which they now seem indifferent. If the major powers are to play their part in the global move to the market, it must be through the Uruguay Round. Here too, notes Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director-general, there have been successes. Normally, he notes, initial objectives are whittled away in the course of negotiations. Not so this time, he says. Disputes settlement Important achievements were already made in the mid-term review in 1988: new surveillance procedures, for example, including a national trade policy review mechanism, as well as a streamlined disputes settlement procedure. More is still to come. The Draft Final Act of December 1991 offered benefits fully in keeping with the initial objectives: integration of textiles into the Gatt; improved rules on emergency protection; a proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation; what Mr Dunkel calls 'probably the most comprehensive intellectual property agreement ever'; the draft General Agreement on Trade in Services; a good chance to lower tariffs by one-third, along with substantial reductions in many high tariff peaks; and, not least, proposals for liberalisation of trade in agriculture. It is on the rock of agriculture that the ship is foundering. All those hopes and all the successes - from the ones piled up before the Uruguay Round began to those embodied in its draft conclusions - hang in the balance, as the US and the EC haggle over whether, and how, to reduce the billions of dollars they waste on their farmers. As Mr Dunkel rightly remarks: 'The keys to a final conclusion are held in a very few hands. It is now up to them to provide the momentum for us to finalise the multilateral negotiations.' The leading industrial countries alone act as if the fate of the institution they created and of the negotiations they started matters little. They know better. Posterity may well condemn failure to complete the round this autumn as the most important lost economic opportunity for a generation.</p>

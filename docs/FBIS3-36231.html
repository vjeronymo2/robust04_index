			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov under the "Former Soviet Union" </F> rubric: "Azerbaijan: Self-Imposed News Blackout"]    [Text] Baku -- The situation regarding Russian newspapers  in Azerbaijan is blighting the lives of tens of thousands of  subscribers. For the fourth month running they have not  received LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, ARUMENTY I  FAKTY, and PRAVDA -- these publications were printed in Baku  until recently. The Azerbmetbuatyayymy Production Association  makes no secret of who is to blame for this scandal: The  Azerbaijan Printing House, which is failing to meet its  contractual obligations, is the prime culprit.    It has its own excuses: The Moscow publishing houses do not  always settle their debts on time and the Moscow plants  producing printing plates are not delivering their goods. There  are also problems concerning newsprint.    At the same time, the republic's National Bank has not yet  transferred to the publishing houses of Russia and other CIS  countries 120 million rubles' worth of subscription fees paid by  Azerbaijanis for foreign newspapers and magazines in 1994. The  delivery of Russian newspapers in Azerbaijan is therefore  altogether problematic.    Against the background of all this, the statement by the  official authorities that the republic is experiencing a news  blackout is bizarre, to say the least. You get the impression  that all the obstacles to the distribution of Russian newspapers  in Azerbaijan are artificially created.    The most surprising thing is the lack of realism shown by  the  Moscow editorial offices. On top of their disappointed  expectations, subscribers are also suffering financial losses,  as nobody is minded to return them their subscription fees. In  similar situations the Moscow publishing houses have arranged  for their publications to be delivered by post. Readers may  have received them late, but they have received them. And what  is going to happen to the delivery of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the number of subscribers to which has shot  up in Azerbaijan?    Here, in addition to applying penalties for breach of  contract, the Russian newspaper publishing houses could adopt a  different means of financing the printing and distribution of  publications in the republic.</p>

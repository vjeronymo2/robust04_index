			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar tumbles on job figures THE dollar fell two pfennigs as exceptionally bad US jobs data finally closed the door on any hopes of a US economic recovery in the near future, writes Peggy Hollinger. The statistics showed that non-farm payrolls had fallen by 91,000 in January. Although the range of forecasts had been unusually wide, the average expectation had been for a rise in non-farm payrolls of about 40,000. 'No matter which way you slice them, they are still weak,' said HongKong Bank economist Dr Mark Austin. 'The dollar could be moving back to the levels at which it started the year.' That could be as low as DM1.50, he added. Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer with Sumitomo Bank, said the figures became grimmer, the closer they were examined. 'The average working week went down,' he said. 'That means factories were cutting back (jobs) and working less.' The dollar fell against most currencies, with the D-Mark winning the most support. The US currency broke through strong support at DM1.57 with apparently no trouble after the announcement. In London, the dollar closed at DM1.5595, down from the previous day's close of DM1.5795. Against the yen, it fell from Y125.70 to Y125.20 and weakened against sterling from Dollars 1.8165 to Dollars 1.8380. Speculation surrounded the next rate move in the US, with many traders arguing that the case for a short-term cut had been strengthened by the figures. However, some disagreed that a cut would actually happen. 'I think Mr Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) knew how bad the figures were going to be,' said Mr Feeny. 'The Fed is now in a watch and wait mode.' Nevertheless, the market was betting heavily on a cut in the Fed funds rate of 4 per cent some time next week. The Canadian dollar, which has been weakening in recent weeks, took a heavy blow from the declining dollar, falling as low as CDollars 1.1767. However, aggressive intervention from the Bank of Canada pushed the currency up to CDollars 1.1852. While the market was coming down with a bump over the US economy, the D-Mark was enjoying a late - albeit modest - lift within the exchange rate mechanism. Bundesbank President Mr Helmut Schlesinger's comments that the 6.4 per cent pay settlement with steelworkers would be disastrous if used as a benchmark gave virtually unnecessary support to the D-Mark. Against the pound, the D-Mark firmed from DM2.8700 to DM2.8675. Sterling remains firmly at the bottom of the grid, although it took some comfort from the weakened peseta. The Spanish currency closed at 63.00/02 per D-Mark, compared with the previous close of 62.99.</p>

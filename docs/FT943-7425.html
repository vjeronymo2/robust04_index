			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: VW aims to double Polo sales with updated range Volkswagen, the leading European carmaker, is aiming to almost double sales of its VW Polo small car in western Europe with the launch of an updated range developed with an investment of DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn). Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, said the group was aiming to increase sales to 350,000 in 1995 from 189,000 last year. The launch of the new generation Polo is a vital step for the VW group, which is seeking to recover from record losses suffered last year and to arrest the erosion of its market share in west Europe. Mr Piech said that the improvement in western European new car demand in the first six months had faltered in July, when VW new orders had fallen back to the same level as last year. VW had a strong order book from the second quarter, which would cushion its production in the autumn, but he warned that its financial performance could be harmed if the renewed weakness in demand carried on through the second half of the year. Last week he forecast that the VW group would break even for the full year following a DM1.94bn net loss in 1993. The new generation Polo, which was unveiled in Paris yesterday and which will go on sale in most west European countries in the late autumn, will be built at VW's plants at Pamplona in northern Spain and at its main plant at Wolfsburg in northern Germany. VW has fallen far behind its main rivals in the west European small car market with its outdated current Polo, which was first launched in 1981, and is still dangerously dependent on its Golf/Vento small family car range. The Polo languished in sixth place last year in the small car segment of the west European market with sales of only 189,000; behind the Ford Fiesta (444,000), the Renault Clio (425,000), the Fiat Uno (352,000), the Opel Corsa (346,000) and the Peugeot 106 (268,000). The small car sector is gaining in importance and accounts for around 29 per cent of all new car sales in western Europe. VW urgently needs a competitive car in this market, where both General Motors of the US (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) and Fiat of Italy have launched strong rivals in the shape of the Fiat Punto and the new generation Opel/Vauxhall Corsa. Mr Piech conceded that the group had waited too long to replace the current 13-year-old Polo and said that VW was aiming to cut its model life cycles to six years.</p>

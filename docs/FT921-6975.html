			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Banks' veto dooms planned share register venture A PROPOSED joint venture between UK banks to handle some aspects of share registration appeared to have collapsed last night as two leading clearers rejected the idea. A bank that promoted the idea, National Westminster, claims it would lead to lower costs for listed companies and make share ownership simpler for private individuals. The proposal, for a central bureau in the City to hold details of private investors' shareholdings, would involve company registrars pooling their existing services. To work, it needs the support of at least the three biggest registrars. However, yesterday both Lloyds and Barclays, which together control about 50 per cent of the registration market, rejected the idea. In a statement, Lloyds said it had written to the Stock Exchange, which has formally floated the idea, declining to take it further. The exchange had been seeking support for a Pounds 250,000 feasibility study, to be undertaken by the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte management consultancy. Lloyds rejected the idea vigorously, saying it had 'serious reservations' about the proposals. The bank - the largest of the UK's registrars - said it already had advanced computer systems and did not need to involve itself in a joint venture. It also disputed claims that a central bureau would improve the service or reduce costs for investors and listed companies. 'We believe joint ventures are inherently inefficient and anti-competitive,' it said. Barclays also cast doubt on the desirability of a joint venture, given unsuccessful attempts at such arrangements in the City in the past. It said that the idea, though it had attractions, had come too late in the development of Taurus, the exchange's planned paperless settlement system. Mr John Lamb, the NatWest assistant general manager who had promoted the idea, said: 'Obviously it is disappointing if the two banks appear not to be keen on investigating the idea.' He added that the exchange and ProShare, the new association to promote wider share ownership, supported the idea, but accepted that without the support of Barclays and Lloyds it had little chance of success. If developed, a bureau would hold most shareholder details centrally, leading to greater economies of scale and hence lower fees for companies, according to the scheme's supporters. Private investors would also be able to receive a single, consolidated statement of all their shareholdings.</p>

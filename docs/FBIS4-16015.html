			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy </F> Trubetskoy and others from the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature]    [Text] The incident in which Ukrainian special force took a  group of Black Sea Fleet ships under control in Odessa need not  be blown out of proportion. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergei Krylov told Interfax Tuesday that neither Russia nor  Ukraine wanted it.    It his view, things have to be sorted out. "We must find out  who is guilty and of what and not allow the incident to grow in  scale," Krylov said.    He said that he had been in Kiev Monday where he had met  fairly well-informed Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and Defense  Ministry officials. He said it was difficult to make out a  clear picture of what had happened. In his words, some its  aspects were incomprehensible and unpleasant and some people  involved in it were reportedly drunk and that nobody had  authorized them to do what they did.    Krylov thought that the incident happened between various  branches of the Navy and had to be resolved by them. He  recalled that the fleet was under joint command of two  presidents. The original cause of the conflict was that some  navigational instruments were moved from one Ukrainian port to  another. They were to remain the property of the same navy,  Krylov believed. The whole story was probably the fault of  sailors who have now to settle the conflict, he said.    Krylov thought that Ukraine was least of all interested in  perpetuating the incident when its new parliament had not even  started work. Such incidents would inflame the Ukrainian  radicals and this would destabilize the situation, Krylov  thought. He believed that there were numerous hotheads in  Russia, too. In his view, there was no need to add to tensions.    He did not agree that the Russo-Ukrainian relations were  increasingly deadlocked. He believed that both Russians and  Ukrainians had a fairly clear idea of what they wanted from each  other but their good intentions were not easy to materialize.  Domestic factors had a significant role to play in this.  Because Ukraine's new parliament had not even been convened,  the executive branch was to some extent inactive, Krylov said.    Krylov thought that such incidents would inflame Ukrainian  radicals and could further destabilize the situation.    He emphasized that Russia regarded the Crimea as part of  Ukraine but did not shut the door on economic and cultural links  with the Crimea.</p>

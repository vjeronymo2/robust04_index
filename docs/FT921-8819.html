			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter: A management elephant trap Sir, Mr Akio Morita is better at making Walkmans (or should that be Walkmen?) than avoiding elephant traps ('Sony chief says accountants should not lead industry', February 7). The one he has fallen into concerns the different requirements for leadership and success in British and Japanese manufacturing companies. Britain's commercial history is different from his in Japan. The success of competing manufacturing industries within different cultures therefore rests on a number of different factors, such as training, long-term investment, planning, working practices, automation, age of infrastructure, philosophy of industrial life and, of course, the quality of those leading the business. If those currently leading many of the most successful businesses in the UK are chartered accountants, this is surely attributable to the fact that, historically, chartered accountants were the only fully trained business professionals in this country. It has not been the practice of enough UK companies to train their engineers and technologists in the broader range of skills received to lead their companies, although there is evidence that that is now changing. Meanwhile, Bibby, British Steel, GKN, Glaxo, Racal and Arjo Wiggins Appleton are just a few of the major UK manufacturing businesses of world class with chartered accountants leading their boards.

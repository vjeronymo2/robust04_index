			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul, the  nation-selling Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique held a so-called  key commanders meeting of the puppet Air Force on 17 May to  conspire a war plot for northward invasion.    At this meeting, the puppets took measures to strengthen the  Air Force's combat-ready posture while talking about the need to  make every preparation for regular war, mentioning threats by  someone else.    Crying over the fictitious nuclear issue of the North, the  U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are frenzied in war  provocation maneuvers for a northward invasion by using the  issue as a pretext.    The recent conspiracy plainly shows the true nature of the  puppet clique that seeks to provoke a war, playing into U.S.  hands [mijeui changdane chumul chumyonso chonjaeng tobarui killo  naedannun].</p>

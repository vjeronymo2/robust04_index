			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / BNL sends special team to Argentina ITALY's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the state-owned bank whose branch in Atlanta made billions of dollars of clandestine loans that helped to fund Iraq's military build-up, has sent a special team of executives to Argentina in the wake of suspected irregularities that could involve a loss by BNL of as much as Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m). Separately, US investigators from Congress and government agencies have told the Financial Times that they are also looking at BNL's Argentine operation, partly to see whether any of the bank's funds in Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, were used to help finance the nuclear-capable Condor 2 missile project undertaken by Iraq. The BNL affair has focused so far on the bank's Atlanta branch. It is the first time there has been any suggestion of a possible link with its operation in Buenos Aries. Between 1987 and 1989, letters of credit handled by BNL Atlanta provided funds for the Condor missile and other Iraqi weapons projects. In Rome yesterday, the bank said it was unaware of any links between BNL's operations in Atlanta and Buenos Aires. In Buenos Aires, meanwhile, a magistrate yesterday asked his Rome counterparts to help him investigate relations between the Italian foreign ministry and several Italian companies that did business in Argentina. One of the companies took part in the Condor 2 missile project and benefited from Iraqi loans made by BNL Atlanta. Among the BNL executives despatched to Argentina are some of the people who were sent by BNL in 1989 to the US to investigate the Atlanta case. The Atlanta trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL manager indicted in connection with the Iraqi scandal, is expected to begin in September. Mr Davide Croff, a senior BNL executive in Rome, said the present focus for the team sent to Buenos Aires is on the restructuring and management of the branch network and related insurance businesses. The BNL network includes 88 branches in Argentina acquired in 1987 and once owned by Banco Ambrosiano, the bank that crashed in 1982 in a scandal involving the Vatican bank. The precise nature of the suspected irregularities in Argentina has not been disclosed but Mr Croff said the work in Buenos Aires included the parent company in the US making a BNL capital injection to cover potential losses which he could not quantify and which he said he preferred to describe as 'restructuring costs'. He added that the Rome bank had no evidence of possible links between funds from BNL Argentina and com-panies that worked on Iraq's Condor 2 missile project.</p>

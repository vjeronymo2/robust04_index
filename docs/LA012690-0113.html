			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> PILOTS TO EXPERIMENT ON QUIETER TAKEOFFS  </P> <P> Pilots at Fullerton Municipal Airport plan to test several takeoff procedures  Saturday to discover quieter ways to gain altitude over nearby homes.  </P> <P> "We want to do noise tests on various aircraft to find out if in fact they can  be flown quieter and still be flown safely," said Bob McNutt, president of the  Fullerton Airport Pilots Assn.  </P> <P> The association will use a sophisticated sound-monitoring device to analyze the  airplane noise to compare different takeoff procedures, McNutt said.  </P> <P> The pilots association, in conjunction with the airport staff, will conduct the  tests from noon to 2 p.m. using several models of the Beechcraft Bonanza, the  noisiest airplane in use at the airport.  </P> <P> McNutt said he hopes the tests will not only show pilots quieter ways to get  off the ground but also show Buena Park residents and officials that the pilots  are trying to be better neighbors.  </P> <P> "In the last six months, we've come under fire quite heavily from Buena Park,"  he said, referring to a recent crash at the airport.  </P> <P> Roland Elder, director of the airport, will participate in the tests by flying  his own Bonanza.  </P> <P> "Many pilots, and I include myself in that, are probably not as noise-  sensitive as we can be," Elder said. "We hope to work with pilots to show them  that there are some ways to minimize noise of the aircraft and still maximize  (takeoff) performance." TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

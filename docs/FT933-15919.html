			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Onex plans to reduce its share stake in US car parts maker ONEX, a diversified management company controlled by Toronto financier Mr Gerald Schwartz, plans to reduce its holding in Automotive Industries, a leading North American car interior parts producer, from 35 to 20 per cent. Automotive has filed a financing package with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the offer of 2m new common shares and the sale of 2.6m existing shares, including 1.25m held by Onex. The issue is being made solely in the US. Onex said it expected to receive about CDollars 40m (USDollars 31.2m) for its 1.25m Automotive shares and record a gain of about CDollars 30m. It would retain 20 per cent of Automotive after the new share issue. Onex has most of its assets in the US, including subsidiaries in airline catering, food service equipment, automotive and construction equipment. Its latest investment was in a US wire producer earlier this year, while it plans to sell its interest in a Canadian courier to Canada Post. Its asset sale was control of Beatrice Foods in the US in 1991 for CDollars 475m.</p>

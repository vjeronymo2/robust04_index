			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/37: "Declaration on Bosnia"] </F>   [Text] The European Union [EU] condemns the continuing  Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde in violation of UN Security  Council resolutions and calls for an immediate and unconditional  cease-fire in and around Gorazde and the pullback of Bosnian  Serb forces which threaten the security of Gorazde.    This will enable the deployment of UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Force] forces to the town to take place.    All detained United Nations' personnel should be released  straight away and be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement in  accordance with United Nations' resolutions. The humanitarian  effort, the passage of which through Bosnian Serb-held territory  is currently suspended, should be given unimpeded access to the  people of Gorazde and more widely in Bosnia including to  Sarajevo.    The European Union invites the state members of the European  Union which are members of the Security Council to support the  adoption without delay of a binding resolution in support of  these objectives.    The European Union expresses its full support for the  efforts  of the special representative of the UN Secretary General and  UNPROFOR commanders and confirms its support for Atlantic  Alliance forces in their underpinning of United Nations action.    It also pays tribute to the committed work of UNHCR and  other  volunteer agencies, which include many EU citizens, which  continue their humanitarian mission despite the appalling  difficulties that they face on the ground. The European Union  calls upon those nations which have promised additional forces  to the United Nations to ensure that they arrive in Bosnia  quickly.    A cease-fire in and around Gorazde is the first essential  and  the European Union calls upon the Bosnian Serbs to honour their  word in the negotiations chaired by the United Nations. This  should be followed quickly by a general cease-fire throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina. A general cease-fire would be a prelude to  negotiations for a political settlement involving the whole of  Bosnia.    To this end the ministers also call for an intensified  diplomatic effort by the international community, involving the  United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia  to ensure the convergence of their initiatives and to bring  about talks between the parties at an early date based on the  European Union plan and taking into account the Washington  accord and the talks on the Krajinas.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> VETO EXPECTED AS ASSEMBLY PASSES BILL REQUIRING MOTORCYCLIST HELMETS  </P> <P> A bill that would require motorcyclists to wear helmets passed the Assembly  today and was sent to an almost certain veto by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> After final passage of the bill on a 41-20 vote, Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd  (D-Carson), author of the bill, said he was finished with the issue after nine  years of working on it and would let another legislator carry it next year.  </P> <P> "The extreme conservatives in the Legislature, the movie people and the Hell's  Angels seem to be quite a combination," a frustrated Floyd said of the factions  that mobilized against it over the years.  </P> <P> In his veto message last year, Deukmejian said he believed that mature riders  should be free to choose for themselves whether to wear a helmet, although he  favored a law requiring motorcyclists under 21 to wear helmets. He reiterated  that position at a news conference Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- The cancellation of the  planned meeting of Slovak and Hungarian premiers should not  obscure the atmosphere ruling between the two countries, which  has recently been improved, Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan  said at a press conference today.    "According to us, the premiers' meeting should produce some  positive result, not only improve the atmosphere. The meeting  did not promise it, and therefore was not feasible," Kukan said.    The meeting was canceled after Budapest had rejected  Slovakia's demand that a joint communique on the inviolability  of the Slovak-Hungarian border be released after the talks.    It is inappropriate to dramatise the situation and "get  scared", Kukan said. "I think we will find other ways of  further strengthening the improving atmosphere," he added.    Nevertheless, he said he did not suppose he would meet with  his Hungarian counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, before the Hungarian  elections to be held in May.    Asked if he did not consider the opening of a new border  crossing between the two countries, Kukan said that concessions  and accommodating attitudes were necessary on both sides.    Referring to another case of omission of Slovakia as an  applicant for membership of NATO and the European Union by  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, this time during his visit to  Budapest, Kukan said that in the nearest future he would meet  with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, to discuss the issue.    Kukan also confirmed he would meet with Austrian Foreign  Minister Alois Mock, who was to attend Saturday's [23 April]  conference of the Christian Trade Unions in Casta-Papiernicka  near Bratislava. It will be an introductory meeting focusing on  bilateral relations, he said.</p>

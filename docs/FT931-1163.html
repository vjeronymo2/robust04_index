			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British Alcan cuts losses as reorganisation costs fall ANOTHER 1,100 jobs were lost at British Alcan Aluminium and capital investment was cut savagely last year as the group struggled to cope with the worst aluminium industry conditions in living memory. The pre-tax loss was reduced from Pounds 45.6m to Pounds 15.9m after charging sharply lower reorganisation and plant closure costs of Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 29.6m). British Alcan, a subsidiary of Alcan of Canada, generated a positive cash flow, which enabled debt to be reduced from Pounds 192.3m to Pounds 184.1m. Cost reduction measures had provided more than Pounds 40m of annual savings and productivity gains, said Mr Douglas Ritchie, chairman. However, the outlook for 1993 was 'difficult for the whole of the aluminium industry, including British Alcan. Measures to return to profitability are having success, but it is difficult to see a return to the profit levels experienced in 1987 and 1988 without a significant upturn in economic activity and aluminium prices.' The workforce fell from 9,511 to 8,324 last year. When the group was formed in 1982 by a merger of British Aluminium and Alcan Aluminium it employed 14,000. Turnover rose to Pounds 756m (Pounds 731m) while aluminium sales volumes were up by 15 per cent to 333,400 tonnes. Export sales advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 275m.</p>

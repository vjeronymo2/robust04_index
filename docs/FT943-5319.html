			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Sport: Actions speak louder . . . Last month the finest sprint filly in Britain, Lochsong, finished last at York, in a race she was odds-on favourite to win. Her distraught connections blamed her performance on the fact that, before the race, she had been obliged to take part in a parade, at which her febrile temperament had protested. She had twisted and yearned away from her jockey, and nearly injured herself in the process. She had galloped to the stalls with terrified ferocity and, all in all, she had exhausted herself before the race had even begun. This had happened to Lochsong before, and exemption from the parade had therefore been requested for the York race. Afterwards, the authorities conceded that in future such a request would be considered more favourably. They did, however, make at the same time a defence of the parade, which was that it allows the whole of the race-going public full view of the horses and, as such, plays a part in race procedure. More precisely, what it does is to create a spectacle, by presenting the competitors to their audience. It gives them to us, the watching world, rather than leaving them within their own sphere - that of the sport in which they are competing. I thought of Lochsong and her reluctance to parade for us when I read, last week, that Ellery Hanley had been appointed the new coach of the Great Britain rugby league team. Hanley has been the greatest player of his generation but he has, throughout the years of his supremacy, refused any dealings with the media. He has captained Wigan and Great Britain to several notable successes and then, at the end of the match, as the reporters began to cluster for their quotes, he has mysteriously evaporated. Apparently this is not the thing to do. The consensus within the media - and possibly outside of it - is that a captain's duties do not end when the match is over. He has thereafter to explain, to sell the game, to give it to its audience, despite the fact that they have just had it; in refusing to do all this, Hanley was dodging his responsibilities. Yes, he could rouse his team to glorious heights, but that was not good enough if he would not tell us how he had done it, if he would not share it with us. This demand that sportsmen be talkers, as well as players, is inspired by the same principle that expects horses to be show animals as well as racers. One can understand this principle, but it isn't, ultimately, all that sensible. For example, it demands that Lochsong take part in a parade, despite the fact that, if she does so she will no longer be the great horse that the public wants to see on parade. Surely it would be better to see her simply run to her full abilities? Therein lies her true self, just as Ellery Hanley's lies on the pitch and not behind a microphone. Yet the notion persists that sporting personalities must, come what may, give themselves to their public, off, as well as on, their fields of combat. No matter that Lochsong's nerves cannot cope with it, nor that Hanley had experiences with the press that made him not want to cope with it. Their sporting excellence is not enough. We must have the whole of them - or what passes for the whole of them. It has even been suggested that Lochsong - Lochsong, with her magical turn of foot] - is a flawed horse because of her delicate temperament. Certainly it was suggested that Hanley's extreme taciturnity would preclude his appointment as Great Britain team coach. With regard to this, it might be easier to understand the demand that sportsmen speak to us, give to us, if they were saying or giving anything of value; but the way in which most interviews are conducted makes that unlikely. Some 99 per cent of them have no point. The truth is that interviewing sportsmen is ridiculously hard. What they do is supremely defiant of analysis; their genius is instinctive, surprising and momentary, and they themselves are scarcely in a position to understand it. It would take an interviewer as persistent and sensitive as John Freeman to unearth their emotions and motivations with any degree of success. But no such luck  -we must have instead 'how did you feel after scoring that goal?' (terrible); 'how disappointed are you about losing that race?' (not at all, I'm delighted); and 'did you enjoy performing in front of your home crowd?' (no, I'd rather be in Papua New Guinea). Are we really losing something so precious if a sportsman refuses to answer such questions? I know that the media helps to create a celebrity and that, in return, the celebrity should help to create the media. But the fact is that some of them do it better than others, and it is hard to see why sporting personalities who prefer to let their actions speak, or parade, for them should be forced to do otherwise.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Granada backed in franchise row THE INDEPENDENT Television Commission has rejected charges that Granada TV is in breach of the conditions of its broadcasting licence, a claim made last month by Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary. Ms Clwyd alleged that Granada was reneging on promises made in its franchise application that it would make 20 prestige drama and film productions. She further accused the company of putting profits before quality. Granada TV issued a vigorous rebuttal of the allegations, which the ITC has totally supported. In its ruling yesterday the ITC, the commercial network's supervisory authority, said: 'There is no evidence that the licence conditions will not be met.' The ITC pointed out that while there has been a 'significant number changes in board membership', 10 of the 17 senior staff members named in Granada's successful fran-chise bid are still with the company. Ms Clwyd said that Granada's Liverpool news operation - a key element of its commitment to regional programming - had been closed down, which the ITC said was incorrect. The ruling added: 'The ITC will continue to monitor the performance of all its licensees against their licence conditions.' It 'totally refutes' Ms Clwyd's 'unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations that the ITC is failing in its regulatory duties'. Ms Clwyd intends raising the matter again in the House of Commons on Monday. Mr Charles Allen, Granada's chief executive, welcomed the ITC's ruling, adding that Granada's commitment 'to the highest quality regional and network programmes continues stronger than ever before'. The ITC signalled yesterday that it is closely monitoring developments at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. Yorkshire took over Tyne Tees in 1992. The ITC is concerned that the merged company will abide by ITC requirements to continue regional broadcasting in the former Tyne Tees region. The pornographic satellite television channel Red Hot Television, formerly titled Red Hot Dutch, is to be banned in the UK, the government said yesterday.</p>

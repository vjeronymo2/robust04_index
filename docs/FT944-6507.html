			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Leopold Joseph at Pounds 1.09m Leopold Joseph Holdings, the merchant bank, turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.09m for the six months to September 30, against the background of a volatile financial environment. Mr Robin Herbert, chairman, cautioned about the future. He predicted a 'satisfactory' result for the year, but did not at this stage, expect an improvement on last year's Pounds 2.35m, 'unless financial market conditions became much easier'. Operating income for the six months was Pounds 4.32m and earnings per share came to 14.7p. The interim dividend has been raised to 3.4p (3.25p). The figures were prepared in accordance with new accounting rules for banks and because of the different reporting basis, no comparatives are available.</p>

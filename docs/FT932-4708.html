			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Victory tasks for Gonzalez MR FELIPE Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, has clinched a feat that Britain's Margaret Thatcher failed to achieve and Germany's Helmut Kohl has not yet pulled off. By an unexpectedly clear margin, he has won a fourth term as leader of one of Europe's main industrialised democracies. Additionally, by stemming the tide of losses by Europe's left-wing parties, Mr Gonzalez has made himself the chief standard-bearer for what is left of European social democracy. The role brings both burdens and benefits. In opting for four more years under Mr Gonzalez, but removing his previous absolute majority, the Spanish electorate has shown him less than full-hearted confidence. Voters displayed considerable scepticism about Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party, weakened above all by corruption allegations. But this seems to have been outweighed by still greater doubts over the prospect of rule by the inexperienced conservative challenger, Mr Jose Maria Aznar. The prime minister has the opportunity to turn victory to the cause of placing Spain more firmly in the mainstream of European integration. But he will need to show a sense of realism and urgency that in recent years has often eluded him. The voters clearly expect changes in the Socialist party, which has dispensed an unhealthy degree of influence over the state apparatus. Even more urgently, a new approach is required in economic policy. After registering an average of 4 per cent growth in gross domestic product between 1985 and 1991, Spain is now mired in the European recession, with a 21.7 per cent unemployment rate and a current account deficit around 4 per cent of GDP. Supply-side economic reforms have been promised as often as they have failed to materialise. Straitened economic circumstances impose new necessities. Mr Gonzalez should strive to make them virtues. He needs to bring in steps both to improve the flexibility of the country's notoriously rigid labour markets, and to restructure inefficient public sector industry. Measures to promote job creation must be combined with renewed efforts to hold down inflation and maintain the improvement in Spanish competitiveness gained in three peseta devaluations since September. Spain's inflation rate, 1.2 percentage points above the EC average, is still too high. The loss of the Socialists' absolute majority may help Mr Gonzalez rally the consensus needed for unpopular solutions. Mr Gonzalez for the first time will have to come to terms with minority parties. This raises the need for delicate compromise. But, in areas such as breaking up centralised wage bargaining, this may enable the prime minister to wriggle free from his party's shackles. Mr Gonzalez faces an uphill task, but it is a fight worth conducting. On Sunday's evidence, the Spanish people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He now needs to show he has the mettle for the struggle.</p>

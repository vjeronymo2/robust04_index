			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Dramatic hot potatoes in Berlin - This year for the first time the Theatre Festival has opened to a united Germany THE NATIONAL Theatre, One; Glasgow Citz, Three, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Nil. Imagine an annual scoreboard like this and you get a sense of the fevered response to Germany's Booker Prize of the stage, the 'Theatertreffen' ('Theatre Meeting'), in which the 12 'top' German-speaking productions of the season are elected by jury and invited to Berlin for a festival jamboree. Who's in, who's out, which theatre has squeezed most productions into the flurried three weeks (May 1-20) of full houses, roaring crowds and smoky seminars about the future of drama? For the first time in its 28-year history, the Festival opened last week in a united city, focussing the familiar annual post-mortems on Berlin's bid for cultural dominance as part of the fight to become the new German capital. Only one of the nine-critic jury comes from Berlin - Dieter Kranz from the east - yet cultural centrism has already taken root. An unprecedented six of the Festival's dozen offerings are home-grown, though the jury - unpaid and unloved - scrutinised some 400 new productions across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Outside Berlin, directors like the Vienna Burgtheater's Claus Peymann huff about attempts to manufacture Berlin as 'metropolis of the theatre', while Festival director Torsten Mass is adamant: 'Since unification Berlin is the theatre capital of Germany'. The hot potatoes this year are two works which turn on the nature of the unified state, by Germany's best known living dramatists, Heiner Muller and Botho Strauss. Teutonic heavyweights both, they are political allegories whose painful topicality makes them recommended viewing for anyone trying to fathom the divided background of the new Germany. At the Deutsches Theater in the east of the city, Heiner Muller directs a mammoth uncut Hamlet with his own contemporary postscript Hamletmachine added on to make a seven-hour-plus show. 'We thought about what was topical and really only found Hamlet to be so', says Muller. Erich Wonder's set dramatises the shock of a literally changing climate - ice blocks melt and drip into a pool of water - and Ulrich Muhe plays Hamlet as helpless individual caught between two epochs. His 'To be or not to be' fumes with dashed hopes, guilty impotence in a corrupt world, the certain knowledge of crimes committed in an unaccountable past. Horatio (Jorg-Michael Korbl) scrutinises the audience for fellow-travellers, and the murdered king crosses the stage to the commentary from Stalin's funeral. The ghost, says Muller 'is at once Stalin and the Deutsche Bank, the ghost of communism and the phantom of an anti-social market economy'. His Hamletmachine heralds the repression of the new order: Hamlet rises from the deathfield and declares Denmark a prison - for which a better prison system must be invented. Muller has an Ophelia in flames; Botho Strauss's Schlusschor (Final Chorus)  -in Dieter Dorn's production from the Munich Kammerspiele, has the German national eagle released from the zoo by a woman who wants to copulate with it, then destroys it because it is impotent. But where Muller turns drama to up-to-the-minute metaphor, Strauss's theatre topples into symbol-heavy indulgence. Strauss was writing the play when the Wall came down and was then inspired by Bernstein conducting Beethoven's Ninth in the uniting Berlin. The symphony chants through the work along with Bach, folk songs and a stereotyped portrayal of shabbily dressed 'Ossies'. Following a shriek of 'Germany's disappeared', a mirror (self-revelation) and a camera (preserver of the historical moment) dominate the early acts before the wretched bird proves so unserviceable in the final 'chorus'. I shall return next week to two exceptional Festival Shakespeare productions, the Schaubuhne's Winter's Tale and Timon of Athens from Bochum, which also dally with contemporary metaphor but are much more besides. Shakespeare, with three plays, tops the Festival bill; with Ibsen, Schiller, Chekhov, the selection is representative of the strong classical bias of theatres across Germany. The two quirkiest choices come from Berlin. My schedule excluded the Schiller Theater's Tales from Grimm, a one-man show by the Big Daddy of the Berlin theatre, Bernhard Minetti, which opened on his 86th birthday. But I did catch the Schaubuhne's Mothers and Sons, translated from the Spanish, about two Mummy's boys which comedians Udo Samel and Gerd Wameling (the Winter's Tale's clown) play as absurdist duet. The piece is the interview between bank manager Krugger and 30-year-old Juan D who lives with his mother and is applying for his first job, as the bank's night watchman. But the bank doesn't come into it: through asides, farcical gestures, crawls across partners' desks, hypochondriac fits, they argue about maternal cooking, toy trains, tastes in women - hypothetical, as neither has ever talked to one other than Mother. Obsessions are mirrored by surrealist events - a frog crosses the plush carpet and is wordlessly squashed, a thunderstorm breaks out within the office - which Tomeo suggests are no odder than corporate life: daily electronic renderings of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik before the 5pm announcement wishing all employees a happy evening with their families, for example. Berlin audiences have poured into this off-beat critique of work and the adult world since it opened. Such eccentricities are as much part of the Berlin culture as doughnuts and drunks and gallows humour and gruff greetings. But will they last? Midseason, the Schaubuhne's budget was cut by DM2.4m, aborting new productions and throwing the future of west Berlin's most famous theatre into doubt. And as the festival opened last week, the four directors of the west's super-tech Schiller Theater, the biggest theatre complex in Germany, threatened to resign over financial problems. In the east, Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater stands in preserved fin-de-siecle splendour in the run-down Friedrichstrasse. Outside, the Mercedes and BMWs parked along with the Trabbies suggest that the stage is one of the few places where East and West Berliners are looking one another in the face. Eighty per cent of Deutsches Theater audiences now come from the west, and directors like Thomas Langhoff, the intendant elect, have emphasised the political role of the Berlin theatres in this respect. But Langhoff is also refusing to take up his post until adequate funding is agreed: Deutsches Theater subsidies are currently DM12m against the Schiller Theater's DM36-40m a year. Another row bubbles away over the resignation of Manfred Wekwerth, intendant of Brecht's Berliner Ensemble, ordered by Berlin's Senator for Culture, Ulrich Roloff-Momin. Wekwerth was a member of the repressive SED Central Committee which had curtailed artistic freedom in the city; he had also worked with Brecht in the 1950s. Last week, Roloff-Momin was discussing the rights to the plays with Brecht's heirs; should they now withhold them, Brecht, staple diet of the Berliner Ensemble, will be suddenly off the repertoire. And trouble also in the east for Heiner Muller's Akademie der Kunste, which is to close at the end of the year. As Andrew Clark reported on these pages about German musical life after reunification, so it is for drama. Too many good theatres now offer too much at too high state subsidies. There will be cuts all round and some of Berlin's most historic stages may not survive. The offerings from Berlin in the Festival this year are of the finest quality, but behind the scenes, the joke is to read 'To be or not to be' as a dilemma off rather than onstage, while Langhoff, waiting to sign his contract, is said to have recast The Sorcerer's Apprentrice as his favourite villain - a bungling wizard in Bonn.</p>

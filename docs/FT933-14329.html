			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Israeli ban on PLO links under review ONE of Israel's greatest taboos - a ban on direct contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation - is under serious review. Since Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government came to power last year unofficial contacts between Israelis and the Tunis-based PLO, long castigated as terrorists bent on the destruction of the Jewish state, have mushroomed. There is an increasing number of senior Israeli politicians who now believe a durable peace with Palestinians will not be possible without face-to-face talks with the PLO. 'If you are going to talk business you had better talk with the boss,' said Mr Benny Temkin, an MP from the Meretz party, Mr Rabin's most important coalition partner. ' Despite government statements this week denying that officials have recently met the PLO, the belief that there is a secret dialogue refuses to go away. The respected daily Haaretz newspaper said yesterday a senior Arabic-speaking Labour party official had had five or six meetings with PLO officials including Mr Nabil Shaath and Mr Bassam Abu Sharif in Egypt and the US. Haaretz said that after each meeting Mr Rabin was briefed in writing. Mr Gad Ben-Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, denied the contacts again yesterday but, whatever the truth, it is clear there is a growing body of opinion in favour of direct dialogue with the PLO. In January, the government repealed a law banning contact between individual Israelis and PLO officials. Several MPs have since held public meetings with PLO officials and one radical Labour MP Ms Yael Dayan met Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, in Tunis. Meretz, which has 12 MPs in the 120-strong Knesset and four cabinet posts, is publicly committed to direct contacts with the organisation. Mr Temkin said the coalition agreement allows Meretz to raise the issue and 'we are doing it now.' At least one Labour party minister, Mr Uzi Baram, has also come out in favour of direct talks and a Labour MP claimed last week a further seven Labour party ministers privately supported the idea, which, if true, would mean an 11-7 majority in the cabinet. Furthermore, critics of the government say Mr Rabin's acceptance of the inclusion in the Palestinian peace delegation of Mr Faisal Husseini, who is close to Mr Arafat, was a tacit acceptance of a PLO role. The issue has become more critical as the peace talks have faltered, especially over whether east Jerusalem should be included in the interim phase of Palestinian self-rule. Other issues critical to a peace deal, such as territorial concessions on the occupied West Bank and security guarantees, need PLO involvement, say experts. However, an official change of policy will have to overcome two considerable obstacles. The first, according to Mr Ben-Ari, is that 'Arafat personally is viewed as a vicious, anti-Semitic demon and a symbol of so many things Israelis despise.' Opening a dialogue would be politically dangerous and play into the hands of the right-wing opposition Likud party. The second is that the Israeli government believes that a formal inclusion of the PLO in the peace process will lead the talks away from the interim phase of self-rule and towards the much more sensitive issue of an independent Palestinian state. Most observers believe that any change in government policy will be gradual. But they say that progress on the peace talks will be difficult if not impossible without the PLO's official involvement in some shape.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter said today he and his wife will visit the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Republic of  Korea (ROK) next week, according to a report reaching here from  Atlanta.    During the visits, he hopes to discuss "some of the  important  issues of the day with leaders in the area," Carter said in a  statement.    "As is the case with other international issues since  leaving  the White House, I have attempted to stay adequately briefed on  the Korean situation," he said.    Carter noted that the initiative for his visit has been from  Korea, not from Washington. "I will have no official status  relating to the U.S. Government," he added.</p>

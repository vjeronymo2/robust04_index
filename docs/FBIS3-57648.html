			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy article: "Constitutional Court </F> Constituted as Previously Gives President First Warning"]    [Text] On Tuesday [25 January] the Constitutional Court  Judges' Collegium discussed the question of restoring Judge  Valeriy Zorkin's powers, which had been suspended previously  because of the court chairman's active participation in  political activity.    Following those of his colleague Luchin, although unlike him  not resorting to a hunger strike, Zorkin's rights as a  constitutional judge were restored. The decision was made at a  closed meeting of the judges by seven votes to three.    Thus the Constitutional Court, which under the well-known  presidential edicts was, as it were, put into suspended  animation at least until the new constitution came into force,  has woken up like a long-dormant volcano. Its first decision  was an emphatic reminder of the existence in the Russian state  of another pole of political opinion, which was merely  temporarily pushed into the background by the elections to the  Federal Assembly and their rather surprising results.    In the fall, after Boris Yeltsin issued Edict No. 1400, the  Constitutional Court was possibly too hasty in taking the view  that this edict was to be categorically rejected as  anticonstitutional. This in turn played a part in escalating the  confrontation between the branches of power, and probably to a  certain extent provoked the White House into attempting to  resolve the conflict by force. During this period a draft  document terminating the Constitutional Court judges' powers in  one form or another was discussed in presidential circles.  However, having given preference to democratic elections and to  putting the constitutional draft to a referendum rather than  introducing temporary direct presidential rule, Yeltsin was  unable within the framework of this logic to contemplate the  abolition of the Constitutional Court in addition to the  elimination of Soviet power.    For their part the judges made a compromise, effectively  declaring their decision on Edict No. 1400 erroneous and, like  wise chess players, offering the figure of ex-Chairman Zorkin  "as a sacrifice."    As a result of this gambit the Constitutional Court judges  gained not only a necessary breathing space but also very strong  positions regarding the new constitution. Under it the  Constitutional Court, in particular, decides cases concerning  whether both federal laws passed by the Federal Assembly and  normative presidential edicts and government decrees conform to  the Constitution, and also interprets the Constitution.    It follows from the Constitution's transitional provisions  that all 13 Constitutional Court judges, elected under the old  procedure for protecting the old constitution, in their former  capacity and without any losses "move" with their lifelong  powers to a new "constitutional field" (to use the ex-chairman's  favorite expression). Another six judges, who must be appointed  by the Federation Council after being proposed by the president,  will have to be co-opted onto the collegium in addition to the  13 existing judges. Possible candidates are already being  proposed in political and legal circles. Understandably, both  organs of power involved in the appointments will try to fill  the six vacant posts with people on whom they can rely in the  future. But the Constitutional Court judges, without waiting to  be "diluted" in this way, are hurrying to take measures to  secure their own independence.    Internal questions concerning the Constitutional Court's  life are affected only in form by the decision to restore  Zorkin's powers in connection with his cessation of active  involvement in politics, which impedes the exercise of a judge's  functions, and by the similar decision regarding Luchin not long  before this. Essentially the judges, anticipating the question  which they have not yet been asked aloud by the organs of the  legislative, executive, and presidential branches, have declared  that they are once again ready to adopt an active political  position in the existing balance between the branches.    All the indications are that this position will be an  extremely inconvenient one for the president, which is evident  from the fact that Zorkin, to whom Yeltsin has a widely known  "political allergy" (mutual), has had his powers restored, and  this is especially so in the absence of Vitruk, an acting  chairman most loyal to Yeltsin.    The Constitutional Court's decision can be regarded both as  a  reaction to the defeat of the presidential team (or of the teams  acceptable to him) in the 12 December elections and as a symptom  of the weakening of Yeltsin's positions regarding other poles of  political opinion, including the government.    The Constitutional Court, while no longer cunning in the  sense that it says it will keep completely aloof from the  country's political life, is again becoming an important and  effective factor (like an ambuscade force) in Russian politics.  At the moment it is difficult to say whether this will help to  improve it. Maybe it would be no bad thing if the  Constitutional Court did not start repeating its previous  mistakes and lapsing into its own power ambitions but served as  an effective brake, henceforth cautioning Russian politicians  against excessively sudden movements and going too far.</p>

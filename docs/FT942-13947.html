			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CBI must flex muscles on pay Sir, So, we have come to the moment of truth. Can the UK's flexible labour market maintain downward pressure on the rate of increase in average earnings when underlying inflation is low, output is growing and the demand for labour rising? The upward revision of January's figure for average earnings to 3.5 per cent and news of a similar level for the 12 months to February ('Wages data spark fears', April 21) caused the Confederation of British Industry to state the obvious - 'we need to keep a firm hold on pay'. But the CBI must ask itself one simple question: are individual firms strong enough - by themselves in the context of a flexible labour market - to keep increases in average earnings at internationally competitive levels? Although the recession has led to widespread dispersion in pay settlements, the current data suggest that it will not be long before sustained recovery feeds into a 'going rate' for pay. Fifteen years of labour market flexibility have not destroyed the 'going rate': nor will another 15. In fact, the time has come for the CBI - and the very largest companies in this country - to flex their muscles and co-ordinate their pay settlements. In so doing, they can maintain their own international competitiveness during the recovery, and the international competitiveness of the UK economy as a whole, as well.

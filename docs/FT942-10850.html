			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Big wages mask big risks / A look at the pitfalls and rewards which could await foreign construction workers in Germany 'Bricklayers wanted for contracts in Germany; excellent rates offered; immediate start' Advertisements in British national newspapers continue to lure construction workers with the promise of high wages on German building sites. The advertisement above was one of more than half a dozen job offers which appeared on a single day last week in Britain's Sun newspaper. Some British builders unable to find work in the UK have made money working in Germany. For others the dream of finding a job abroad has become a nightmare as they have been left destitute and cheated by unscrupulous labour agencies and employers. The UK Building Employers Confederation issued a report last week highlighting the plight of stranded and destitute construction workers in Germany. In one month this year British consulates in Germany made arrangements to ship home 150 construction workers in distress according to the foreign office. These were only the workers who could find relatives and friends who would pay for their fares home. Many had replied to advertisements from labour agencies with telephone numbers in Belgian and Dutch towns, such as Nijmegen and Arnhem close to the German border. Most of these would be illegal in Germany under the country's strict labour laws, according to the British Building Employers Confederation. Interviews rarely took place in offices but in public places such as bars. One London construction worker found it strange when he was interviewed in an otherwise empty building. He later realised the furniture was only temporary. Mrs Elizabeth Bridge, the confederation's director of taxation, toured London building sites to question workers recently returned from Germany. She became concerned after workers requested information on how to reclaim German tax paid on wages. They had been duped into accepting lower wages on the false grounds that UK authorities would repay the tax. One scaffolder who answered an advertisement in the Sun paid his own way to a hotel in Frankfurt on the promise of a job in Dresden. He waited three days with about 50 other workers but his potential employer never arrived. The scaffolder was left with a Pounds 400 bill and the agents could not be traced. A 19-year-old construction worker replied to an advertisement in the London Evening Standard placed by a Belgian agency. He was taken to a car park development in Germany where he spent four weeks grinding the surface of bricks. He was not supplied with a mask as required under German and British safety laws. After three weeks he had been advanced only Pounds 30. When he complained at the end of the fourth week he was dismissed. Another worker with experience but no formal qualifications was persuaded by an agency to accept a job in eastern Germany. When he arrived the contractor refused to engage him. He was left without job and money. To enable German employers to avoid paying national insurance, British construction workers must hold an E101 certificate from the UK government exempting them from making social security payments in the 'host country'. British rules allowing workers to qualify for E101 certificates were tightened last month to apply to only those 'who are normally self-employed in the UK'. This is unlikely to stem cross-border work as more than two-thirds of UK construction workers are estimated to be registered as self employed. One agency advertising for bricklayers in a British newspaper offered to arrange E101 certificates. According to the British confederation, builders planning to work in Germany should check whether agencies are bona fide offices and offers of work should be in writing and checked in advance. Workers also should check whether they are required to register as living in Germany. If the answer is negative they should not go as they will be working outside the law and will have no protection, said the confederation. Most important of all, workers should leave enough money for return fares with a reliable friend or family as British consulates do not provide money for fares home.</p>

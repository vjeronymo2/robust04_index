			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] On 7 June, Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso  stated that there are currently 121 people, including men,  women, and children, inside the Belgian Embassy. This  information was relayed to the Foreign Ministry by the Belgian  diplomats in Havana. Regarding this event, Alfonso stated that  the Cuban Government as well as the Belgian Government are in  complete agreement regarding key principles in connection with  this situation. He added that no negotiations per se are being  conducted except talks on how to implement commonly accepted  principles, and that everyone understands that this is an  illegal action which has nothing to do with international laws.    On the other hand, Alfonso pointed out that for the Belgian  Government, which subscribes to a traditional policy, diplomatic  asylum does not exist, in the sense that it is not recognized  because this is a purely Latin American tradition.    [Alfonso] "Everyone agrees, Cuba and Belgium, that this is  no  way to circumvent the normal requirements for emigrating from  Cuba. The Cuban Government has reiterated several highly  important issues. Cuba recognizes the inviolability of the  Belgian Embassy in Havana. Cuba has international obligations  that commit Cuba, on one hand, to ensure that that inviolability  is not impaired. Once violated, however, the Cuban authorities  have of course historically abstained -- you might remember, for  example, the case of the Peruvian Embassy -- from taking any  action to further impair the inviolability of that embassy that  has been violated. This must be stressed to the people who  entered it illegally, not by Cuban authorities.    "The Cuban Government reiterates that this method of  forcibly  gaining entrance to an embassy cannot be a way to circumvent the  normal emigration procedures available to every Cuban citizen."    Alfonso also announced that the Cuban Government has  extended  the necessary resources, if required by the Belgian Embassy, in  terms of health services. Regarding food needs, several  possibilities have been proposed to solve the crisis that the  Embassy is currently facing, with the cooperation of other  embassies from the European Union. The Cuban Red Cross, a  nongovernmental organization, has stated that this type of event  is beyond their field of operations. The government had already  extended the public health services that every Cuban citizen is  entitled to, hwever.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that the Cuban  Government has stated and reiterated that independent of the  illegal character of the event, reprisals will not be taken  against these people once they leave the Embassy. He added that  if any of them has any prior charges pending with Cuban justice,  a completely different issue, they will not be considered an  aggravating element in the illegal entry to the Embassy.    [Alfonso] "Everyone knows that independent of the basic  illegality of this action, other illegalities have been  committed. In other words, even if someone should see this as a  diplomatic asylum issue, it is a fact that activities of a  political nature from inside the Embassy are not permissible.  Communiques have been released and disseminated in a completely  startling manner to the media. You know that only authorized  personnel enter and leave that Embassy. We know that political  communiques drafted inside the Embassy have been disseminated  abroad after these people entered the Embassy."    Miguel Alfonso added that currently, two Belgian diplomats  are in Havana to help Embassy personnel, given the altogether  abnormal situation that has ensued, and that talks continue  between the Belgian Foreign Ministry and Embassy and the Cuban  Foreign Ministry.</p>

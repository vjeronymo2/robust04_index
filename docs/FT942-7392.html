			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Bond and equity prices hit by concern over European rates Bond and equity prices across Europe fell heavily yesterday as markets reached the unwelcome conclusion that a 20-month run of falling interest rates had come to an end. Prices fell sharply after the Bundesbank called off a planned auction of four-year notes because of insufficient demand from bond market traders, which followed warnings from the bank that further cuts in interest rates were not planned. At the same time, apprehension returned that the US Federal Reserve might continue to tighten credit policy, despite having lifted its key interest rates only last week. In the UK, the FT-SE 100 Index plummeted in the afternoon as investors flinched at the prospect of upward pressure on interest rates. It closed 68.4 points, or 2.21 per cent lower, at a 1994 low of 3,020.7. The CAC-40 index in Paris fell 48.91, or 2.3 per cent, to 2,084.41, while Frankfurt continued to pay for the recent relative strength of the market. The Dax index fell 39.95, or 1.8 per cent, to 2,158.77. Wall Street ignored the unsettled mood in Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracked US bond prices throughout the session finished up 10.13 at 3,755.3 after a Treasury auction of new five-year notes was completed successfully. The downturn in Europe was touched off by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, who had suggested on Monday that German interest rates might be left unchanged. Market concerns over this statement were exacerbated yesterday by a relatively small reduction in money rates at the bank's weekly securities repurchase auction, used to inject short-term liquidity into money markets. The mood soured even more when the Bundesbank called off a planned auction of four-year notes because of insufficient demand from bond market traders, disappointed by the outcome of the repurchase auction. 'What happened today is an absolute embarrassment for the Bundesbank and it has behaved in an amateurish way,' said one analyst in Frankfurt. In his view, there had been enough demand in the market but the Bundesbank was not willing to raise funds at the current high yields. Prices for the June contract of the German government bond future on Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, fell during trading to the year's low of 93.3 but recovered slightly later to 93.54, down 0.7 of a point on the day. The policy-making council of the Bundesbank is due to meet today for its fortnightly discussion of monetary policy but the market does not expect the central bank to announce a change in official interest rates. UK government bonds traded near the year's lows, reaching 103 1/2 in late trading, down  15/16 . Gilts were also depressed by a higher-than-expected price realised at the Bank of England's auction of the government's first convertible gilt since 1987. In London, pressure on equity prices came from the stock index futures market where the June contract on the FT-SE 100 fell below 3,000 to a hefty discount against the stock market. A computer-driven sell-off in stock index futures appeared to originate from a US securities house. UK market strategists expressed highly bearish views at the close, pointing out that the equity market chart forecasters see little support for shares above the Footsie 2,550 level. There was little response in London to the announcement that US durable goods orders for April showed a gain of only 0.1 per cent, suggesting less pressure for another rise in US interest rates. The dollar also came under pressure yesterday, prompted by the weaker-than-expected durable goods orders, closing in London at DM1.6447 against the D-Mark, a pfennig down on the intra-day high of DM1.6545. Concern over the signs of a change of official stance on German rates increased after a Bundesbank council member warned of the 'inflation potential' of the continued growth of German M3 money supply.

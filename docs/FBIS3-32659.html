			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Feb (NA) -- The UCR [Radical Civic  Union] platform for the 10 April election of Constituent  Assembly members emphasizes watering down the presidential  system, enhancing the legislative branch's role, and the  judiciary's independence.    It also highlights the need to strengthen the federal system  of government, change the status of Buenos Aires City, and  broaden the framework of citizens' rights and guarantees.    The text was approved during the UCR National Convention  that  was in session until early this morning at the Asturian Center  in Vicente Lopez. The text makes it clear that "in full  exercise of the plenary's authority," it drafted the UCR  platform "pursuant to the provisions of the party's national  by-laws."    The platform's most salient points concerning the system of  checks and balances include the establishment of the post of  cabinet chief, shortening the president's and vice president's  terms of office to four years, the direct election of the  president and vice president through a first round and a runoff,  and regulating the president's power to issue decrees in cases  of emergency or need.    It further endorses the direct election of three senators  for  each constituency as of 1995, streamlining the process of  enacting laws, and Congress' power to decide on federal  intervention and strengthening its role as a check on the  executive branch.    With a view to buttressing the country's legal security and  the judiciary's independence, the UCR tract demands that a  Council for Magistrates be established for the appointment of  federal judges and Supreme Court justices -- whose nomination  will have to be confirmed by the Senate by a two-third majority  of those present at the session -- and trial by jury as a  procedure to remove low-level judges from office.    Moreover, it calls for strengthening the federal system of  government and municipal autonomy through the redefinition of  financial relations between the federal and provincial  governments, which will include setting up a revenue-sharing  plan and giving provinces the power to administer their own  resources without any interference from the federal government.    It also states that the federal plan should entail the  possibility of signing international agreements that do not  tamper with the federal government's authority, stipulating a  deadline for a federal intervention, and acknowledging the  principle of municipal authority.    The UCR platform also underscores the importance of changing  the status of Buenos Aires City by acknowledging its autonomy  and its special rights concerning legislation and jurisdiction.  It proposes setting up a constituent assembly for Buenos Aires  City in order to organize its institutions.    With regard to citizens' rights and guarantees, the platform  provides for the incorporation of semi-direct democracy  mechanisms like the right to petition and nonbinding referendums  or plebiscites.    It further provides for the express upholding of habeas  corpus; constitutional guarantees for the protection of civil  rights; the defense of user and consumer rights against  constraining practices, monopolistic attempts, or undue  privileges; and constitutional acknowledgement of political  parties.    Finally, the tract stresses the need to have a qualified  majority to modify the system of elections and political  parties, as well as the laying down of rules that guarantee the  defense of democracy.</p>

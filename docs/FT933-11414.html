			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Subsidiaries help to lift Mexican conglomerate GRUPO Carso, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, reported an 11.8 per cent increase in profits to 668m new pesos (Dollars 214m) in the first half, after improved performance at industrial subsidiaries, Nacobre, Cigatam, Condumex, and Aluminio. The company owns a controlling stake in Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly, which last week reported a 12.9 per cent increase in second-quarter profits. Telmex contributed a third of Carso's net profits. Carso recorded a 42 per cent increase in sales to 4,701m pesos, but this was due to consolidation of results at subsidiaries and an increased stake in Frisco, the mining concern. Underlying sales fell, as the company cut unprofitable lines at Condumex and Nacobre, according to Baring Research in Mexico City. The rationalisation boosted margins and helped push up operating profits to 819m pesos in the first half, a 71.3 increase. Profits were given a strong lift by the improved performance of Cigatam, the cigarette company, which according to Carso has gained market share at the expense of its rival, La Moderna. Frisco told the Mexican stock market that it had re-opened the silver mine Real de Angeles, which had been closed earlier in the year due to low silver prices. Real de Angeles produced 8.1m troy ounces of silver last year, 1.8 per cent of world output.</p>

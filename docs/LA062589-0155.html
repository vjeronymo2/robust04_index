			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET CONGRESS SEEKS REFORM CONSTITUTION  </P> <P> In a manifesto for further reform, the new Soviet national assembly on Saturday  outlined a legislative program aimed at accelerating the pace of the Soviet  Union's political, economic and social changes and broadening their scope.  </P> <P> The Congress of People's Deputies, summing up its first session, called for the  drafting of a new constitution, incorporating the dramatic political reforms of  the past two years and providing greater protection of individual rights and  clearer limits on the authority of the government and the ruling Communist  Party.  </P> <P> Key measures include immediate constitutional amendments that "recognize the  inalienable rights of the individual to life, freedom, inviolability and  security," a complete judicial reform with the establishment of an independent  court system within a year and the adoption of basic laws on freedom of  religious belief, of the press and of association.  </P> <P> The congress, noting that the country remains in a deep economic crisis, also  demanded a faster pace of economic reform, with decisive steps to move from  nearly total state ownership and central planning to a mixed economy operating  on the market principles of supply and demand with a strong role for individual  entrepreneurs and cooperatives.  </P> <P> And in an effort to resolve the country's increasingly acute ethnic conflicts,  the congress proposed development of a federal structure that would give the 15  constituent Soviet republics real political and economic authority as well as  measures that will restore the rights of minorities, such as the Crimean  Tatars, Volga Germans and Meskhetian Turks, who were deported from their homes  decades ago to remote regions by dictator Josef Stalin.  </P> <P> The deputies called upon the Supreme Soviet, which is now a permanent national  legislature, to take urgent action to solve the severe shortages of food and  consumer goods, to expand the construction of new housing, to improve education  and health care and to raise old-age pensions and payments to families with  incomes below the poverty line.  </P> <P> They propose further cuts in the country's defense budget to finance some of  the increased spending as well as greater utilization of the space program in  economic development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adopted June 9  </P> <P> The resolution, adopted by the new congress at the end of its two-week session  June 9 but not published until Saturday, provides the Soviet Union's basic  domestic and foreign policy guidelines -- the first time that a national  assembly here has laid down such a framework for the government.  </P> <P> The proposals will be put before the 542-member Supreme Soviet, which was  elected from among the congress' 2,250 deputies to function as a full-time  legislature, when it reconvenes in Moscow on Monday.  </P> <P> Among the items on the agenda will be the confirmation of Premier Nikolai I.  Ryzhkov's Cabinet. Several nominees, already rejected by commissions that have  been examining their qualifications and questioning them about government  policies, will face a serious struggle.  </P> <P> Although the reforms begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are now in their  fifth year, "the country has not yet emerged from its crisis," the resolution  said, noting that in some respects the problems have grown even more acute.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Evolving With Difficulty'  </P> <P> Perestroika, or restructuring, as the reforms are known, "is evolving with  difficulty and in a contradictory way, and the state of affairs in the country  remains complex and strained," the resolution said, according to the official  Tass news agency.  </P> <P> The deputies said that "cumbersome managerial machinery" is blocking the most  basic economic reforms and "is curbing the initiative of the masses." Problems  such as a psychological dependence on orders from above, equal pay for everyone  and a social shortsightedness are also hampering the reforms, according to the  resolution.  </P> <P> Their solution to these problems is to press ahead with the reforms while  trying to minimize the inevitable difficulties.  </P> <P> Calling for a "further deepening of the economic reform," the congress  instructed both the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet to work out a  program centered on the "stage-by-stage transition" to a "socialist market,"  where supply and demand will supplant the state's allocation of resources and  where private and cooperative firms will compete with state enterprises on the  same basis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Republics to Take the Lead  </P> <P> The first legislative steps should be taken in the coming year, the congress  said, with the adoption of laws guaranteeing the rights of such new  enterprises, authorizing the leasing of state-owned property to private  entrepreneurs wanting to operate their own businesses, shifting state  enterprises from a system of "profits delivery" to taxation and permitting  constituent republics, starting with Estonia and Lithuania, to take the lead in  developing such mixed economies.  </P> <P> Other elements of the economic reform package, certain to prove controversial,  include the development of a capital market to manage investments; a program to  convert much more of the defense industry to civilian production; a  liberalization of foreign trade; the reduction of exports of oil, gas and other  raw materials with the expansion of exports of manufactured goods, and making  the ruble, the Soviet currency, convertible on international markets on a  gradual basis.  </P> <P> In foreign policy, the deputies called for "ensuring the country's security  first of all by political means, the elimination of nuclear weapons through  negotiation and the exclusion of the use of force or threat of force to attain  any political, economic or other goals."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreign Policy Cited  </P> <P> They also called for reforms in the way that Soviet foreign policy is made so  that there is "a reliable procedure capable of fully precluding undemocratic  and secret foreign policy decision-making in the future."  </P> <P> In urging a further improvement in relations with the United States, the  deputies said that the Soviet Union must increase its efforts to "bring an end  to the arms race."  </P> <P> CHANGE IN HUNGARY Reformer is named Communist Party chairman.

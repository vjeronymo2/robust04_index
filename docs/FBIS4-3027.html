			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A  ministerial meeting of GATT ended here today with the adoption  of the world's biggest trade deal designed to frame a better  global economic order.    The deal, or the "Marrakesh declaration," which formally  endorses the Uruguay-round trade accords reached last December,  was signed by ministers from more than 120 industrial and  developing countries.    The deal provides for a 40-percent cut in the world's  tariffs, a move which will add some 200 billion U.S. dollars to  the global income every year in the next decade.    The declaration officially approved the creation of a World  Trade Organization (WTO) to replace GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) in theory from January 1, 1995, marking "a  new era of global economic cooperation" and in response to the  widespread wish for "a fairer and more open multilateral trade  system."    It said that the developing countries have played "a  remarkably active role" in the Uruguay round, "a historic step  towards a more balanced and integrated global trade partnership."    China signed the Uruguay-round accords and an agreement on  the WTO, which will pave the way for its re-entry into GATT and  for its WTO membership.    The less developed countries should enjoy "more favorable  treatment," the declaration stressed, pledging continued support  to them in trade and investment.    It said that the WTO, the new world trade watchdog, will  increase aid "substantially" to developing countries.    In the declaration, the ministers hailed the conclusion of  the Uruguay-round trade talks as a historic achievement, which  will boost "trade, investment, employment and incomes all over  the world."    They also put emphasis on environmental issues and  sustainable development.    The ministerial meeting in the Moroccan oasis city started  Tuesday and was attended by 124 nations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] An annual meeting of the World Trade Forum has  started in Davos. Approximately 800 businessmen and politicians  from over 80 countries all over the world are taking part in  this politico-economic summit. A three-day visit will be  divided into three topics. The participants will first assess  the situation in the international economy at the beginning of  1994 and establish the priority spheres of action.    A Slovene delegation, led by Prime Minister Dr. Janez  Drnovsek is also attending the Word Trade Forum. Suzana Kos  reports:    [Begin recording] [Kos] [passage omitted] Slovene Prime  Minister Janez Drnovsek, who is attending the World Economic  Forum in Davos this year, too, and will meet with important  financiers and politicians here, held talks with the GATT  director general this morning:    [Drnovsek] With Mr. Sutherland we have had a very thorough  debate about all issues that are still open in the negotiations  between Slovenia and GATT. We have established that, recently  the negotiations have been continuing successfully and  intensively, that some open issues remain, especially regarding  the protection of agriculture and the service industry, but that  there are realistic chances for the resolution of these  problems. Despite a tight schedule, Slovenia could still become  one of the founding members of GATT, on the condition that this  organization be formed, that is to say, starts working at the  beginning of 1995.    [Kos] As Dr. Drnovsek also said, the talks also concerned  Slovenia's latest proposal for the new system of protection in  agriculture. Mr. Sutherland promised his assistance here so  that the answer to our proposal would be such that Slovenia  could accept.    This afternoon, the Slovene prime minister will also talk  with the new president of the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development, which has promised us assistance in  reconstruction and the development of our infrastructure.

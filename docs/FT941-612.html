			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann offers Vox shares to Disney Bertelsmann, the German media group, is hopeful of selling Walt Disney a 49 per cent stake in Germany's Vox television channel, which will go into liquidation on April 1 unless the holding can be sold. 'The main negotiations are being conducted solely with Disney,' said Mr Manfred Harnischfeger, a spokesman for Bertelsmann, adding that a decision has to be reached by Friday. Vox went on air in January 1993 with more than 300 employees, but its mix of films, current affairs and news made no inroads on viewing figures and for months the future of the Cologne-based channel has hung in the balance. A collapse of Vox would be a blow for Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest media groups, which holds a 24.9 per cent stake in the venture. The failure of Vox would also be the first set-back for Mr Mark Wossner, Bertelsmann's chief executive and until now regarded as one of Germany's most successful businessmen. If the Disney deal goes ahead, the remaining 26.1 per cent would be held on trust for future disposal. Under broadcasting laws, Bertelsmann is unable to raise its stake in Vox because it already owns significant stakes in the highly-successful RTL channel and in Premiere, Germany's first pay-TV channel. Vox shareholders are estimated to have lost about DM360m (Dollars 204.5m) in 1993 and stand to lose a total of DM630m if the channel goes into liquidation.</p>

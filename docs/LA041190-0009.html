			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> HUNGARIAN PATRIOTISM CARRIED CONSERVATIVES TO VICTORY;  </P> <P> ELECTION: PRIDE AND NOSTALGIA WON OVER VOTERS. BUT THE RULING FORUM STILL FACES  A STRONG LEFTIST OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT.  </P> <P> The politics of national pride that carried Joszef Antall and his Hungarian  Democratic Forum to victory reflect a conservative sweep across Eastern Europe  as Moscow's former satellites realign themselves toward the West.  </P> <P> But the center-right Forum's success in striking an anti-leftist chord in an  electorate long suppressed by socialism may prove difficult to duplicate among  the strong liberal and leftist opposition it will face in Parliament.  </P> <P> Hungarian Radio announced Tuesday that the nation's first democratically  elected legislature will convene May 7 or 8 to swear in the next prime  minister, widely expected to be Antall, and a new Cabinet to replace the  Socialist caretakers who won less than 10% of the vote.  </P> <P> The Communist parties that had dominated Eastern Europe since the end of World  War II suffered similarly in elections in Poland last year and in East Germany  last month, showing a pronounced desire among the newly liberated to break with  the ideology of the left. Conservative parties are also expected to do well in  Romania and Czechoslovakia when free elections are held there later this  spring.  </P> <P> Hungarians were swept by the rightist tide, but their reasons for choosing the  Forum and its even more conservative allies differ somewhat from those in other  states recently cut loose from the Kremlin's tether.  </P> <P> The Hungarian conservatives won favor by stirring up nostalgia for the agrarian  past and feelings of national pride that were stifled under communism.  </P> <P> They enjoyed their strongest support in rural regions, especially in the  eastern part of the country, where promises of land reform and a return to  "Christian democracy" appealed to voters.  </P> <P> Blue-collar workers also preferred the party led by Antall, a stern but  fatherly figure who advocates a measured reform pace that may prevent or delay  mass unemployment.  </P> <P> Among Hungarian intellectuals and professionals, however, the Forum raises  concern about a rise of nationalism that could touch off further ethnic  conflicts abroad like the mid-March clashes with Romanians in Transylvania that  killed at least eight and injured hundreds.  </P> <P> Antall told a cheering crowd Monday that his government will champion the  causes of 15 million Hungarians, referring to the ethnic minorities in  neighboring countries as well as the 10.5 million who live in Hungary.  </P> <P> Leaders from both the Forum and the Free Democrats, who finished a distant  second in the vote, have promised to bury the campaign hatchet and work  together for the good of a democratic Hungary.  </P> <P> "All those passions and feelings of injury and hurt and insult will belong to  the past, and those who have come out as winners can behave moderately from  their victorious position," Antall told reporters.  </P> <P> Despite the best of intentions, the parties have emerged from a hotly contested  and often negative election battle with wounds and grudges that may need more  than words to heal.  </P> <P> Free Democratic opponents charged that Forum candidates engaged in a smear  campaign against them which they said took on an anti-Semitic tone at times.  </P> <P> Several election posters depicting Free Democratic leader Janos Kis and other  Jewish candidates were defaced with swastikas, and deputy Forum leader Istvan  Csurka was accused of making openly anti-Semitic remarks during campaign  appearances.  </P> <P> Antall and other Forum leaders have denied that any anti-Jewish sentiment  permeates their party.  </P> <P> Preliminary election results show the Forum with 165 seats and its likely  coalition partners, the Independent Smallholders Party and the Christian  Democrats, with 43 and 21 mandates respectively. That gives the  coalition-in-the-making a comfortable majority in the 386-member Parliament.  </P> <P> (The release of official final results will be delayed by voting irregularities  in several districts, Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Electoral  Committee, told reporters Tuesday. An announcement of final results had been  expected by Tuesday. Nemeth said they would be released later, but did not say  when. He said the irregularities would be investigated.)  </P> <P> The conservative alliance that Antall said Tuesday would take at least a couple  of weeks to iron out will face a sizable, if fragmented, opposition force.  </P> <P> The left-leaning Alliance of Free Democrats will have 92 deputies, their allied  youth group Fidesz 21 and the Socialists 33.  </P> <P> Antall's party advocates a slow but sure pace of reform to bring about a market  economy without inflicting too many hardships on the nation already suffering  20% annual inflation and rising unemployment.  </P> <P> Antall, 58, rose from virtual obscurity to head Hungary's new political  vanguard on the strength of his role in talks last year between the Socialist  government and opposition groups, which ushered in the peaceful transition to  democracy.  </P> <P> He was courted by the Small-holders and the Christian Democrats for their party  leaderships, but chose to head the Forum's election drive because he said it  best combined Hungarian patriotism, economic liberalism and Christian values.  </P> <P> The Smallholders, whose support is vital to the Forum's effort to control  Parliament, appear eager to play a role in government. Party leaders said they  expect to be given the Agriculture Ministry among its Cabinet assignments, to  make good on a campaign promise of land reform.  </P> <P> "We can only meet these promises if we take part in the government,"  Smallholders campaign manager Joszef Torgyan told reporters.  </P> <P> Antall said the two parties basically agreed on land policy but that details of  the plan were among the issues that would take a few weeks to resolve in  coalition talks.  </P> <P> The Smallholders have proposed restoration of private property according to  1947 land registers, but the Forum and other parties have deemed their idea  unworkable.  </P></p>

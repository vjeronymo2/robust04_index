			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: P&amp;O P&amp;O is showing the first fruits of maintaining its heavy investment programme through the recession. Shareholders worried that the management had unwisely splashed out on new cruisers and container ships will have been pleasantly surprised by yesterday's 52 per cent increase in underlying profits. Group return on capital, which should reach 16 per cent this year, is still nothing to crow about. But returns will rise as the economic recovery continues. Most P&amp;O businesses have high fixed costs, so profitability is strongly geared to the level of demand. P&amp;O is not merely a recovery story. The cruiser and container operations are well-positioned in growing global markets. Not only are there more rich old people in the world, looking to take cruises; younger families are increasingly taking holidays by sea too. Equally, the container division should benefit if international trade is boosted by the recent Gatt agreement. The main concern is still the impact that Eurotunnel will have on P&amp;O's cross-channel ferry business. But even here, prospects look less worrying. If the cross-channel passenger market continues to grow by anything like the 17 per cent seen so far this year, Eurotunnel's capacity could be accommodated without a full-scale price war.</p>

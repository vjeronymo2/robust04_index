			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions that provided for exceptions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual audit requirements for institutions and third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers have been deleted in these final regulations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed audit exceptions in this section have been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section has been revised to require that all institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have performed an annual compliance audit of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of its Title IV, HEA programs; and to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all third-party servicers have an annual compliance audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed of every aspect of the servicer's administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs of each institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with which the servicer has a contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested amending &sect;668.23(c)(8) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish deadlines for the submission of audit reports, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than allowing the Inspector General to specify these deadlines in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the audit guides. Several commenters questioned whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inspector General has the authority to establish this requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without regulations. Another commenter suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations contain a provision that would require institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the deadlines specified in the audit guide, but stipulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that under no circumstances would the institution be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit its audit report earlier than four months following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration of the audit period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon review of the commenters' concerns, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary agrees that because these regulations require that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit report must be submitted in a timely manner, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations should provide institutions and third-party servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the specific dates for submission of audit reports. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that a period of 120 days from the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's or servicer's fiscal year provides an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or servicer with a sufficient period of time to have an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed and to submit the audit report to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations have been revised to state that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or third-party servicer must submit its audit within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 120 days of the end of its fiscal year. An institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that has an audit performed under the Single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Audit Act must submit the audit report in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadlines specified in that act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters were opposed to the provision that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary could require a third-party servicer to release the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of an audit to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, nationally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized accrediting agencies, and State Postsecondary Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entities on the grounds that these entities are not affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer's actions and release of information in the audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report could unnecessarily damage a third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reputation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced entities are not affected by a third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. The Secretary believes that by providing information-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sharing among the appropriate authorized entities that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary relies on to help provide oversight of Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participants, that the Secretary is responding to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional intent. A third-party servicer acts as an agent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution and is responsible for administering a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's participation. As such, the various entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in program oversight will have a genuine need for access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to records of, or information about, the servicer. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore considers that the audit results of third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers must be included in the information available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate oversight bodies monitoring institutional compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Title IV, HEA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is revising paragraph (c)(4) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section to include the Secretary of Veteran Affairs in the list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of entities that the Secretary may require an institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer to provide the results of an audit to.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter felt that an audit guide specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for third-party servicers was necessary to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of this section. Another commenter was of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinion that the period covered by a third-party servicer's first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit should not start until after audit guidance is available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Department of Education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Education's Office of Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General is working on developing audit guides applicable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance audits performed of institutions and third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers. The Secretary expects that these guides will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available before the initial audit period covered by an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed of a third-party servicer begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the requirement for an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain records on a student's placement if the institution has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a placement service used by the student, four commenters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that application of this requirement to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions for all types of student employment placement might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be overreaching and could result in institutions electing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminate their student employment service rather than comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with burdensome recordkeeping requirements. Commenters pointed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out that at some large institutions, student employment centers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> often act as clearinghouses for posting jobs and professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> career opportunities, but frequently lacked the resources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track actual placement. Most often, employment information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made available to students and that information is simply removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from posting once the employer indicates the position has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filled. Commenters maintained that a formal follow-up process on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student employment is not generally systematic and obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate documentation would discourage institutions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing to provide this service to students. Two commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended removing this requirement from the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three other commenters suggested that the Department of Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revise this provision of the regulations so that it would apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to institutions that are otherwise required to track student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment as a condition of Title IV, HEA program eligibility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertains only to those students for which the institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise maintain employment records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

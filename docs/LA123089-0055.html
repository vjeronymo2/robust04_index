			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REMAPPING SUIT WILL GO TO TRIAL, ANTONOVICH  SAYS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Friday that he expects a  voting rights suit filed by Latino activists against the county to go to trial  next week, but he did not rule out a settlement once the trial begins.  </P> <P> The conservative Republican made his statement after a taping of KCBS'  "Newsmakers," where he and Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles)  predicted that reapportionment will be a dominant political topic of the coming  decade.  </P> <P> Antonovich's opposition to a pretrial settlement in the redistricting suit,  along with similar sentiments expressed by fellow Republicans Pete Schabarum  and Deane Dana, would appear to rule out a compromise before the trial begins  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The three supervisors compose the board's conservative majority, although Dana  broke ranks before turning down a counterproposal by the Mexican American Legal  Defense and Educational Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the case.  </P> <P> Antonovich said he would oppose any settlement that would force the county to  pay legal fees to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has joined MALDEF  in its suit.  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: PWA appeals against court ruling PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, is appealing against last week's Ontario court decision refusing to declare the Gemini computerised reservations system insolvent. PWA had sought the insolvency ruling as part of its survival strategy. American Airlines plans to make a CDollars 246m (USDollars 195m) equity infusion into Canadian, but insists that Canadian switch from Gemini to its own Sabre reservation system. Canadian and rival Air Canada, together with another small US airline, own Gemini. The court found that PWA was trying to get out of the partnership in order to complete its deal with American. PWA denied the insolvency suit was related to the American link-up, but would not reveal the basis for its appeal. Mr Hollis Harris, chairman of Air Canada, said a merger with Canadian was still the best solution to the problems of the Canadian airline industry. It would create one large Canadian international airline capable of competing globally, he said. If the Canadian-American airlines link were approved by Ottawa, he added, Air Canada would become 'as weak as Canadian is today'. SHL Systemhouse, a fast-growing international computer systems integrator formerly linked with BCE of Canada, will manage Canada Post's data processing and telecommunications operations in a contract worth more than CDollars 500m. Last year, Systemhouse signed a Dollars 550m out-sourcing contract with Mexico's finance ministry. Since BCE sold its 21 per cent holding in January, Systemhouse has moved aggressively into international outsourcing. Its stock is widely held in North America and it is expanding its European operations. Systemhouse is now profitable, and Mr John Oltman, president, forecasts annual revenues would reach CDollars 3bn in several years, up from CDollars 738m in the fiscal year ended August 31 1992. E. M. Warburg Pincus, the New York investment bank, invested CDollars 40m in Systemhouse in a private placement in February. Power Financial, the financial services arm of Montreal financier Mr Paul Desmarais's Power Corp of Canada, reported a rise in 1992 net profits to CDollars 184.9m, or CDollars 2.90 a share, up from CDollars 159.7m, or CDollars 1.77, in 1991. Contributions from subsidiaries were slightly lower because of a restructuring charge by Great-West Life. The share of earnings of the European affiliate, Pargesa Holding, was CDollars 34.3m, against CDollars 22.7m last time. Pargesa is jointly controlled with Albert Frere of Belgium. Cambior, the gold and base metals producer, has raised CDollars 84m of new equity by selling 6m units at CDollars 14 per unit to an underwriting group led by RBC Dominion Securities. Each unit comprises one Cambior common share and one-half a share purchase warrant. One full warrant entitles the holder to buy one Cambior share at CDollars 15.50 per share until June 30 1995.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Jordanian MPs are pardoned by Hussein JORDAN's King Hussein yesterday freed two parliamentarians sentenced this week to 20 years' hard labour for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the government, as part of a general amnesty for 140 political and criminal prisoners. Mr Lieth Shbeilat and Mr Ya'aqub Qarrash, along with two merchants from Amman, were found guilty by the State Security Court on Tuesday after one of Jordan's most controversial political trials. The amnesty also includes several members of Hamas, a militant Islamic group, imprisoned last year for possession of weapons, along with a number of Palestinians belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine held recently on similar charges. In a public announcement on television King Hussein explained that he was willing to give the prisoners a chance to go back to the 'path of righteousness,' saying he believed they had repented the harm they had caused the country. Dr Abdul Latif Arabiyat, speaker of the elected lower house of parliament, welcomed the pardon, saying: 'We are in a transitional stage between the law of this military court and the King's way. . . this act shows that our democratic march is very strong. . . the (MPs') slate has been wiped clean.' Sources close to the king explained that the pardon was a humanitarian gesture in advance of his 57th birthday on Saturday, rather than a rejection of the military court proceedings which had aroused some concern in Jordan both for the manner of its conduct and the verdict against the MPs. Several hundred demonstrators urged King Hussein to intervene personally during the trial, and Jordan's monarch told the FT last month that he had been keeping a 'close eye' on the affair. The pardon is likely to help calm fears that the government was faltering in its moves towards broadening democracy and should forestall any potential backlash against the court's initial sentence.</p>

Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov is expected to  head it.    The new structural body is to be created on the basis of the  State committee on the Federation and nationalities and the  unification of several other structures.    The sources indicated that the present State committee on  the  Federation would be withdrawn from the influence of the Party of  Russian Unity and Concord [PRUC] headed by the vice premier and  leader of the state committee Sergey Shakhray.    Ramazan Abdulatipov, another prominent functionary of the  PRUC, works as deputy chairman of the State committee on the  Federation. PRUC member Aleksandr Kotenkov heads one of the  major structural branches of the committee.</p>

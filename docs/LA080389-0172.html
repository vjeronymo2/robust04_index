			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG TITLES AND BIG MONEY;  </P> <P> TOP-RANKED DOUBLES PLAYER HAS SINGLE-MINDED DETERMINATION TO WIN  </P> <P> Jim Pugh, the world's top-ranked doubles player, sat in the living room of his  parents' Palos Verdes Estate home. He constantly glanced at the tennis court in  the back yard, the one he practices on when he's in town.  </P> <P> Lately though, he's been globe-trotting, winning big tennis titles and big  money. And now he's relaxing after winning a mixed doubles title at Wimbledon  and a singles championship in Rhode Island.  </P> <P> For those who knew Pugh as an adolescent, his success may be somewhat  surprising, because he wasn't a star at Palos Verdes High or even at UCLA. He  left UCLA after two mediocre seasons for a professional career that was a  initially struggle.  </P> <P> But Pugh, 25, did show flashes of stardom early in his career. When he was 13  he defeated Jimmy Arias in the finals of the prestigious Orange Bowl  Tournament, and was one of the nation's top-ranked juniors.  </P> <P> "That year he lost only one set and that was to Arias," said John Hillebrand,  who coached Pugh from the time he was 10 until he was 23. "When I met him he  was a champion 10-year old, hitting flat-top spin and slice. When he played in  the 12s, no one could handle his topspin and he was very consistent. He really  dominated that year."  </P> <P> But Pugh's successful junior career took a dive after that. At Palos Verdes and  at UCLA he was a gangly, 6-foot-4 kid with a nagging shoulder injury and a lot  of developing to do.  </P> <P> "There were times," Pugh said, "when I really wondered if I would still be  good. I wondered if I still had it."  </P> <P> Tendinitis in his right shoulder forced him to play his senior year at Palos  Verdes left handed. The injury affected his performance at UCLA where he was  excluded from the singles lineup as a freshman but played No. 3 doubles.  </P> <P> As a sophomore in 1984, he reached the finals of the Pacific-10 tournament in  Ojai and earned the No. 3 singles spot late in the season. UCLA won the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. title that year, but Pugh contributed little  because he pulled a stomach muscle shortly before the Georgia tournament.  </P> <P> "He was real solid and he had very solid ground strokes," said UCLA tennis  Coach Glenn Bassett, who has led the Bruins to seven NCAA titles in 24 years.  "But when he was here he was a little bit like a giraffe. He was real thin. Now  he's filled out and he's a lot stronger."  </P> <P> So is Pugh's game, which is considered unorthodox because he uses a two-handed  forehand as well as a two-handed backhand. As a youth he says several coaches  attempted to correct it, but he refused.  </P> <P> "I could have changed it when I was younger," Pugh said, "but it works. I've  always been pretty coordinated with both hands. I guess it started when I was 4  and my dad first took me out to play. The racket was pretty heavy, so I had to  hold it with both hands."  </P> <P> The unusual style of play has proven successful for Pugh who's ranked 59th in  the world in singles. It's helped him win four mixed doubles grand slam titles  and a singles championship.  </P> <P> Earlier this month at Wimbledon he and Czechoslovakian partner Jana Novotna won  the mixed doubles title by defeating Australians Jenny Byrne and Mark Kratzmann  in three sets. Pugh and Novotna also won this year's Australian Open title and  last year they won both the Australian and U.S. Open mixed doubles titles.  </P> <P> "At the 1988 Australian Open," Pugh said, "I didn't have a mixed doubles  partner and I just went up to the women's association desk and they referred me  to (Novotna). So far so good."  </P> <P> Things have also gone well with Rick Leach, a former USC standout, who teamed  up with Pugh in January of last year. The former college rivals reached the  men's doubles finals at Wimbledon. With the exception of a quarterfinal,  five-set match, they cruised through all their rounds in straight sets. In the  finals they lost to Australian John Fitzgerald and Swede Anders Jarryd.  </P> <P> "I really don't know what happened," Pugh said shaking his head. "We had won  most of our matches fairly comfortably, but we just couldn't pull that one out.  It was still great to make it that far."  </P> <P> His doubles victories were exciting, but Pugh says the highlight of his trip to  England was beating John McEnroe at the Wirral Invitational right before  Wimbledon. He defeated the world's fifth-ranked player in two tie-breaker sets  and received congratulatory fan mail at Wimbledon for his accomplishment. "It  was kind of nice to get mail from people I didn't even know," Pugh said. It's  just that in England they love to hate McEnroe. I'd say that was my best  singles win ever."  </P> <P> McEnroe got even at Wimbledon, defeating Pugh in the third round and proceeding  to the semifinals where he lost to Stefan Edberg.  </P> <P> "He was very determined," Pugh said. "He really wanted to beat me. But when I  beat him I played out of my head. I couldn't miss."  </P> <P> And that's what Pugh did in his next tournament, less than a day after his  Wimbledon mixed doubles triumph. He headed for Newport, R.I., and won his first  professional singles title.  </P> <P> Though exhausted because of the time change and lengthy plane ride, Pugh beat  sixth-seeded Peter Lundgren in the final of the Volvo-Hall of Fame  Championships as an unseeded player.  </P> <P> He's still surprised at his performance in Newport. In fact, he thought he  might not make it to his first-round match because Wimbledon mixed doubles ran  a day late because of a rain delay.  </P> <P> "I still don't know if it's sunk in yet," Pugh said of the victory. "I didn't  get there until 4 a.m. because I had to play mixed on Monday and I was  jet-lagged out. I thought I'd probably lose in the first round."  </P> <P> That sounds a lot like the Jim Pugh who doubted his ability 10 years ago. Only  now he has the physique and refined skills to prove that he does. That's why  he's taking a break and kicking back in Hawaii this week instead of worrying  about the U.S. Open next month.  </P></p>

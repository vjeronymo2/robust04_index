			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / How To Spend It: Art for the sake of your living room / Dallying with Dali Salvador Dali, probably the world's best-known Surrealist artist, has always been a controversial figure but on one thing everyone seems agreed - that he was an extraordinarily creative and original spirit. Although he started his career as a painter after he was expelled from the Surrealist group, for turning to a more academic style of painting, he began to use his rich imagination on theatrical sets, shop interiors, wildly kitsch jewellery and some voluptuously curved furniture. His richest period for creating objects was in the 1930s, when he found himself in Paris, surrounded by friends involved in exploring ways of applying their artistic imaginations to works other than paintings. He began to work with Schiaparelli and Chanel and with Jean-Michel Frank, a furniture maker and decorator of great standing in Paris at the time. The Bracelli Lamp, which David Gill will be showing and selling, came out of his association with Jean-Michel Frank and was adopted by Dali for his house at Port Lligat. Although most of these pieces were designed in the 1930s they never went into proper production. David Gill, whose shop-cum-gallery in Fulham Road, south west London, is always an enterprising source of decorative and fine arts, has brought seven pieces to this country for the first time. They are all now in current production, each being carefully made, d'apres dessin, with the co-operation of the Dali foundation in Spain. They are obviously of practical use, but it is probably unwise to treat them in the way one normally does furniture or household artefacts - they are really Dali objects and the prices reflect that. Lamps start at Pounds 600 but the more exotic pieces, such as the three-legged Leda chair, are in the thousands. The Dali exhibition is small, just seven pieces of furniture, and is on at David Gill Decorative Fine Arts, 60 Fulham Road, London SW3 6HH, until May 14. Pieces from the range can be ordered at any time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura on Tuesday [8 March] urged top government  bureaucrats to make further efforts to work out deregulation  steps, the pillar of market-opening measures to be announced  later this month.    Takemura called in vice ministers in charge of trade,  agriculture and construction to the prime minister's official  residence and made the request, government officials said.    It is unprecedented that the chief cabinet spokesman gave  such instructions directly to top bureaucrats of the government  ministries and agencies, the officials added.    In a related development, the second round of talks between  ministers concerned with external economic affairs will be held  on Thursday rather than Wednesday as originally scheduled,  government sources said.    The ministers will discuss measures to further open Japanese  markets to foreign products as part of the nation's voluntary  efforts to reduce its huge trade surplus.</p>

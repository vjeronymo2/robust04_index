Zhu Senlin said: The  first-phase project of the Daya Bay nuclear power station has  been completed; the second nuclear power station possibly may  comprise four generating units. In addition, a third nuclear  power station possibly will be built in Yangjiang, which will  comprise four to six generating units. The Daya Bay and  Yangjiang nuclear power stations will have an installed capacity  of almost 10 million kilowatts.    Zhu Senlin also explicitly explained the safety of the Daya  Bay nuclear power station -- a question asked by a Hong Kong  reporter. He said: There is a full set of emergency measures  within the radius of five to 50 km of the Daya Bay nuclear power  station. These measures are quite perfect and everyone may rest  assured.</p>

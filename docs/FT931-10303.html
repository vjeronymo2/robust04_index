			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: Expensive interest policy Sir, In Japan we have an old proverb, stemming from our close ties with China: 'Nothing is more expensive than that which seems free.' This is particularly true when it comes to cutting interest rates. Far from being a 'free' policy - ie quick, painless and without expense to a cash-strapped government - it is, in fact, a very expensive one. But its true costs are hidden. First, it has a dramatic effect on the value of the pound abroad. Last year, one pound was worth Y260. Now it trades at only Y180. Seen from Japanese eyes, everything in Britain from toothpaste to houses has lost one-third of its value. Britain Inc must be the biggest bargain of 1993. Second, a freely devaluing currency, unsupported by interest rates, imports inflation, making foreign goods more expensive to buy. Third, interest rate cuts act as a form of subsidy to British industry. Company debt repayments are lowered, easing the pressure on debt-ridden businesses. But it is dangerous to rely on monetary policy. It is an easy option for a government that otherwise lacks a comprehensive economic policy. But it is a political cop-out. It is paid for in the end by ordinary consumers and future unnecessarily high interest rates. The devaluing of a nation's currency gnaws at the heart of a country's self-respect and dignity. The decline of sterling has, like your monarchy, been a source of great sadness both in Britain and abroad.

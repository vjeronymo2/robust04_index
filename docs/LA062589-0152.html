			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WON'T SELL COAST LAND  </P> <P> Though a number of South Bay individuals and organizations have plans for 53  acres of undeveloped coast land owned by Los Angeles County along the Rancho  Palos Verdes-San Pedro border, the county has shelved plans to dispose of the  property.  </P> <P> The county bought the land in the early 1970s for a park that was never  developed.  </P> <P> The flurry of interest by environmentalists in recent weeks came after the  county Regional Planning Commission acted on a finding by the county Department  of Parks and Recreation that the land is no longer needed. It said that sale of  the land in Rancho Palos Verdes, on a bluff overlooking the ocean, would not  conflict with the county general plan.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that the department began the process of declaring it  surplus by asking for an appraisal, chief park planner Jim Park said last week  that there has been no decision on what to do with the land. He called the  commission action premature and said the county's options are to let the  property remain open space, to develop a park or sell the land.  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy, a nonprofit group wishing to  acquire land for public use, said it wants to work with Rancho Palos Verdes to  preserve the land as an undeveloped area. Rancho Palos Verdes resident Kay Bara  has proposed that the four peninsula cities jointly buy the land.  </P> <P> Park said that earlier, the Sierra Club advocated keeping the land as open  space and that inquiries about buying it have come from San Pedro mobile home  residents who want to develop their own mobile home park. Orange County  developer Barry Hon also has expressed interest in buying it for homes, a hotel  and golf course.  </P></p>

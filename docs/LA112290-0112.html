			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DETECTIVE SAYS WORTHY CONTACTED PORTLAND ESCORT SERVICE LAST SEASON  </P> <P> James Worthy contacted an escort service on a Laker trip to Portland last  season, a Portland detective said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Det. David Simpson said Worthy called Allstar Models and Escorts last Feb. 6,  requesting an escort.  </P> <P> The escort service was under investigation at the time.  </P> <P> Simpson said that the caller left a phone number, corresponding to that of the  Marriott Hotel where the team was staying, and a room number corresponding to  the one in which Worthy was registered.  </P> <P> Simpson said no action was taken against Worthy.  </P> <P> "There wasn't any reason to," Simpson said from Portland. "We had our case made  already."  </P> <P> Valerie Walton, proprietress of the company, has been found guilty on six  counts of promoting prostitution, a felony in Oregon. She has not yet been  sentenced. Her sister, Marla, an employee, pleaded guilty to one count and was  put on probation.  </P> <P> Worthy was arrested last week in Houston on a charge of soliciting prostitution  from an escort company. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Houston  Tuesday. MARK HEISLER  </P></p>

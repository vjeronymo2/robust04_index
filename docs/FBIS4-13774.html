			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly today began discussion on the  political developments in the NWFP [Northwest Frontier Province]  suspending all other business on the agenda. The motion to this  effect was moved by the law minister, Syed Iqbal Haider.  Initiating the debate, the leader of the opposition, Mr. Nawaz  Sharif, was critical of the government's action and announced  that the opposition will boycott the proceedings of the house  till the measures taken in the NWFP are withdrawn and a special  committee of the house headed by an opposition member is set up  to investigate into the Mehran Bank scandal. He then led a  walkout by the members of the opposition.    Taking part in the debate, the law minister, Syed Iqbal  Haider, explained in detail the circumstance that led to the  present situation in the NWFP. He said steps taken in the  provinces have been necessitated to protect and strengthen the  democratic process, rule of law, and the Constitution. The  basic issue in the NWFP is who enjoys majority. Only the  majority has the right to rule the province. The law minister  said the PDF [People's Democratic Front] emerged as the largest  parliamentary alliance in the NWFP assembly following the  October 1993 elections. [Former NWFP Chief Minister] Pir Sabir  Shah, the law minister pointed out, formed the government in the  province by purchase of loyalties, but could not satisfy the  members who supported him. The PDF and independent members  moved a vote of no-confidence against the chief minister in  February when he lost the confidence of the majority. The law  minister said tabling of the no-confidence motion was a  constitutional step, but Mr. Sabir Shah did not face the motion  in a democratic and constitutional manner. Syed Iqbal Haider  said the order of the governor asking the chief minister to  obtain a vote of confidence was perfectly within the ambit of  the Constitution. It should have been implemented in a  democratic way.    The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said with the  election of the new leaders of the house in the NWFP assembly,  sense of stability has surfaced in Pakistan's politics. The new  leader of the house was elected following the delivery of  verdict on the same issue by the Supreme Court and, therefore,  the process contains no ambiguity, she said, adding the process  has paved the way for strengthening democratic institutions and  bringing about stability in the country. Talking to newsmen in  Islamabad today, the prime minister said the opposition has  reacted to the development in the NWFP by walking out from the  provincial assembly. She said this is one of the methods of  registering protests and it is the right of the opposition to  protest, but we feel the rule of majorities is an important  principle in parliamentary form of government.    When her attention was drawn toward the opposition's demand  for constituting a house committee on the affairs of Mehran Bank  with its chairman from the opposition benches, the prime  minister said the nation has witnessed massive loot from Taj  Company, investment companies, cooperatives, corporations, and  Mehran Bank scandal. She said we are not dealing with the  matter on individual basis. We have authorized the State bank  to plug all financial irregularities whether they are committed  by politicians or by other citizens.</p>

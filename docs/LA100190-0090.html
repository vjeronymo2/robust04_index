			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES  </P> <P> Fortunately, Quills Are Out  </P> <P> Nowadays, recycled paper is no longer enough.  </P> <P> Environmentally correct printed matter comes with the news that it's made with  Earth-friendly, soy-based inks.  </P> <P> The new inks substitute oil from cheap, renewable soybeans for up to 80% of  traditional petrochemical-based printing oils, which can release harmful vapors  as they evaporate.  </P> <P> The American Newspaper Publishers Assn. first developed the new inks for  newspapers in 1985, after the second worldwide oil crunch.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times has used soy ink for color printing since it was  introduced in 1987.  </P> <P> Now there are versions for non-newspaper print jobs.  </P> <P> "I think I was the first small publication to use it," says Debra Lynn Dadd,  editor and publisher of The Earthwise Consumer, a Forest Knolls, Calif.-based  newsletter she started a year ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Progress, Sobriety Take a Toll  </P> <P> Saturday night was the very last last call at Corky's Restaurant.  </P> <P> That's when the once-popular newspaper bar and grill closed. Located on  Eleventh Street downtown across from the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner  building, Corky's was the place to find Herald editors and scribes after hours  -- and sometimes during hours as well. Many was the time that a phone call  would roust journalists from a corner booth to cover a breaking story. Corky's  number was written on every wall of the newsroom.  </P> <P> Corky's fate was sealed last November when the Herald closed after years of  declining circulation and advertising.  </P> <P> Corky's owner for the last five years, Betty Fukuchi, said she plans to take a  vacation and think about opening another bar, perhaps near a newspaper. "I like  newspaper people," she said.  </P> <P> Newspaper bars are a dying breed, and not just because many major papers have  closed in the last decade. Philadelphia's Pen &amp; Pencil Club, which expired  in February, was a victim of another trend: sobriety.  </P> <P> As a writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer was quoted as saying on closing day,  "Journalists don't drink anymore."  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Dial or Not to Dial . . .  </P> <P> Calling all thespians. Or, more accurately, desperate thespians can try calling  1-900-454-3266, a new casting hot line started by a couple of Los Angeles  entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> Jeff Apple and David Brein, former film and TV executives, launched  Casting/Crew InfoLine for actors and actresses to hear listings from casting  agents. Until now, that kind of information was available only from trade  magazines or eavesdropping on brunch conversations at Patrick's Roadhouse.  </P> <P> Calls are 95 cents a minute but, mindful that struggling actors and actresses  are usually impecunious, unlimited calls are available for $79.95 a month.  </P></p>

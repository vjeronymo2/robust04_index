			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 May (MENA)--In a news conference today  Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League assistant secretary  general for political affairs, stated that the primary mission  of the Arab League delegation, currently in Sanaa, is to deliver  a message to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih from Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. He explained  that the message deals with ideas and views that might help end  the fighting in the country and start a dialogue among the  Yemeni leaders.    He added that the Arab League delegation to Yemen, headed by  Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab League assistant secretary  general for military affairs, made an arduous trip from Cairo to  Jeddah, overland to Najran and then on to Sanaa. This, he  pointed out, illustrates the Arab League's efforts to halt the  fighting, end the bloodshed, and preserve Yemeni unity.    He said the Arab League has made persistent efforts to solve  the Yemeni crisis, the latest being an emergency Arab League  Council meeting which issued a three-point resolution to follow  up on the crisis. The first point stresses that the fighting  will ruin the achievements that the Yemeni people made over many  years and will cause suffering for future Yemeni generations.  The second point calls for a dialogue that will maintain Yemeni  national unity. The third point calls for keeping the Arab  League emergency meeting in session until the crisis is resolved.    Ambassador 'Imran thanked Egypt for initiating the emergency  meeting and the Saudi Government for welcoming the arrival of an  Arab League delegation and facilitating its travel to Sanaa.    'Imran said the delegation is authorized by the Arab League  secretary general and the Arab League Council to make all  necessary contacts, basically with the Yemeni Government in  Sanaa, to reach a cease-fire in the country.    He added that the delegation will not be restricted and will  have full powers to decide which parties it will make contacts  with in order to reach a cease-fire and arrange a dialogue. He  said the delegation is in constant contact with the Arab League  secretary general for consultation on any new developments.    Asked about the failure of a previous Arab League mission to  Yemen, 'Imran noted that there are always chances of success or  failure but the efforts must not stop. He said: We cannot  watch fire ravaging part of the Arab homeland without  intervening.    He asserted that the mission of the Arab League delegation  is  not limited to fact finding but will try to arrange a cease-fire  and to persuade the Yemeni leaders to begin a dialogue. He  pointed out that the Arab League is not drawing up a solution  but is asking the Yemeni leaders to begin a dialogue and reach  an agreement.    He continued: If the Pledge and Accord Document can serve  this purpose, that is good, but if it needs to be amended, then  the matter will be left to the Yemeni leaders. They must find a  solution based on domestic circumstances.    Asked about the reported Yemeni rejection of Arab mediation,  the Arab League secretary general for political affairs said the  Arab League is directly responsible for pan-Arab security, this  responsibility being a matter of destiny to it. He added that  the Arab League Council, in issuing its recent resolution,  expressed a unanimous view of the threats to pan-Arab security.    The Arab League secretary general for political affairs  expressed hopes that the delegation will succeed in halting the  fighting and maintaining Yemeni unity.</p>

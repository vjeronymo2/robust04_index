Weckbach-Mara report: "Vietnamese Smuggled to Germany </F> -- Government Also Cashes In"]    [Text] Gangs of Vietnamese smugglers are illegally  smuggling asylum-seekers to Germany with the support of their  government. According to information obtained by BILD AM  SONNTAG, this is stated in alarming reports by police and  intelligence services, which are available to the Federal  Government.    According to these reports, the state tourism administration  (Vietnam National Administration of Tourism) gets about $6,500  for each Vietnamese, who is smuggled into Germany via Moscow,  Prague, and the relatively unguarded border. So far, police  authorities have registered 100 such smuggling organizations.    To prepare the operations -- the reports say -- Hoang D. Tao  of the Vietnamese Economics Ministry and Tran T. Ngi of the  Vietnam National Administration of Tourism were in Germany.  Obviously, they arranged with the Embassy in Bonn that  practically any desired document be issued for asylum-seekers in  Germany "for a fee." They learned what is needed from  Vietnamese asylum-seekers, whom they questioned in reception  camps.    According to information obtained by BILD AM SONNTAG, the  Vietnamese Labor Ministry is officially propagating a policy for  the export of Vietnamese workers -- in the hope of getting  foreign currency for the state coffers. Bernd Schmidbauer  (Christian Democratic Union), the coordinators of the  intelligence services in the chancellor's office, told BILD AM  SONNTAG concerning the police findings: "We have to take these  reports very seriously and we will do everything to prevent a  new wave of smuggling operations."</p>

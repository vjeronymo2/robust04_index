			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUT-OF-DATE DIVERSIONS  </P> <P> Forty years ago, the Central Valley Project began delivering water to  irrigation districts in the San Joaquin Valley from the new dams and reservoirs  the federal Bureau of Reclamation operated on rivers flowing down the west  slope of the Sierra Nevada. No one gave much thought then to the environmental  effects the diversions would have over the years to water quality, soil  conditions and fish and wildlife habitat. Today, the effects are obvious,  especially within the context of the massive water transfers achieved by the  expanded Central Valley Project along with the state Water Project.  </P> <P> But even with the benefit of hindsight, the Bureau of Reclamation and its  parent, the Department of the Interior, are intent on recommitting the water to  the very same sort of diversion for another 40 years as if it had learned  nothing about the environment in the past four decades. At the direction of  Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the bureau has begun to issue new 40-year  contracts for the sale of the same amounts of water to the same districts  without conducting a formal environmental impact assessment.  </P> <P> The Lujan action is becoming increasingly unpopular, even within the Bush  Administration. The secretary should stop the process and acknowledge that an  environmental impact study is both reasonable and necessary under the law. The  Environmental Protection Agency already has called for such a study. And now  the White House Council on Environmental Quality has, too.  </P> <P> The council's statement reached the logical conclusion that to commit such a  vast amount of water -- roughly 1.5 million acre-feet annually, nearly twice as  much as the entire city of Los Angeles consumes -- for another 40 years indeed  does constitute a major federal action. That is the test for requiring the  full, formal environmental study.  </P> <P> Lujan claims that federal law requires him to renew the contracts. But there is  not necessarily a conflict between contract renewal and conducting the study.  An environmental impact study outlines a number of alternate actions, assesses  the potential environmental damage from each one, selects a favored course of  action and proposes mitigation for any harmful effects. Mitigation might be  stricter conservation measures or a shorter renewal term.  </P> <P> The Council on Environmental Quality cannot overturn Lujan's action. The  council basically serves as a referee when there is an environmental dispute  between two federal agencies. But its opinion used to carry considerable weight  with the White House and in Congress. There already is legislation in the House  to bar the Bureau of Reclamation from executing any more contracts during the  next year pending an environmental study. And a federal court in Sacramento has  said any renewals will be subject to his final decision on whether an  environmental impact statement is required.  </P> <P> Lujan could simplify the whole matter by rescinding his earlier order and  conducting the study. A word from the White House that this is the right thing  to do might help him make up his mind.  </P></p>

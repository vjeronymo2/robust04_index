			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Investing angels give better help - In A Nutshell 'Business angels,' private investors of equity capital in small businesses, frequently help the companies in which they have invested over a broader range of activities than professional venture capitalists. This is one of the findings of a new study* of the non-financial contribution of professional and 'amateur' investors carried out by the University of Southampton. Both angels and venture capitalists help to monitor financial and operating performance and act as a sounding board for management, but private investors also made important contributions to business strategy and to product and market development. *The Roles of Investors in Entrepreneurial Companies.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Welsh companies at risk as mail strike continues MANY SMALL companies in south Wales are on the verge of closure and bankruptcy as a result of the eight-day Royal Mail dispute in Cardiff, which has led to well over 1m letters being undelivered. 'Some businesses are at a virtual standstill,' said Mr Graham Hall, chief executive of the Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry, last night. 'Cash flow is affected, they are not getting orders or cheques in their post and in some cases legal action will be brought by suppliers outside south Wales who are unaware that their letters are being held up by the strike.' Mr Hall said that the chamber was trying to press the Post Office and the Union of Communication Workers to end the strike. 'Businesses outside the area are not aware of the dispute and are still sending letters to Cardiff companies and do not realise why they are not getting any response.' He warned that courier services and transport companies were 'extremely busy' as a result of the strike and the sale of fax machines was soaring. 'When the dispute is over companies will not all revert to using the post,' he said. Further talks are to be held today to try to end the strike, over new work rosters. After a four-hour meeting yesterday, a union executive said that negotiations had 'reached a critical stage' and called on the management to honour an agreement to apply new fixed rosters 'in the fairest possible way'. The 900 striking workers will be ballotted on a peace formula when one emerges. But prolonged talks between the Post Office and union national officials have so far failed to secure agreement.</p>

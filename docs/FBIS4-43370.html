			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guenter Stauch: "Crash To Be Feared"] </F>   [Text] In the opinion of Luftwaffe Inspector General  Hans-Joerg Kuebart, optimism and confidence have always been the  real characteristics of the Luftwaffe.    The flying corps will have to stand the test in this respect  in the future. The red pencil is still its main opponent  following the end of the East-West conflict.    The "historic low" of the defense budget (Kuebart) of just  under 48 billion German marks affects the 83,400 soldiers of the  Luftwaffe most. Although, according to an internal paper of the  Luftwaffe leadership, its "weight and importance are  continuously increasing, in view of future national and  international tasks," an austerity course is announced on all  fronts: By the end of the year, almost 300 aircraft -- about  two-thirds of the total stock -- will be mothballed or scrapped,  more than 30,000 military and 5,900 civilian permanent posts  will be cut, and 71 bases will be closed.    As Kuebart suggested menacingly, in the long run this cannot  "be without consequences for the morale of the corps, the  operation of the armed forces, and their operational  capability." The savings are already a real drain on the  resources, Luftwaffe generals complain. Because of Waigel's  savings plan, Ruehe's fighter pilots operate the control stick  for barely 180 hours per year -- this is NATO standard. A  spokesman of the crews said: "The situation is becoming awful."  In the opinion of the German Bundeswehr Association, the flying  units have arrived at a critical stage because of the drastic  cuts. "If further austerity measures in the field of training  and exercises of jet crews are invoked, crashes are to be  feared."    The Luftwaffe inspector, who at least demands safe planning  from the politicians -- "going beyond one day" -- sounds the  alarm increasingly often. Kuebart, who will retire from his  office in the autumn, leaves a flying corps that is shaken by  violent turbulence behind. However, without it, nothing works  in the Bundeswehr. As a matter of course, the blue-uniformed  soldiers do their duty in Falconara, Djibouti, Phnom Penh,  Bahrain, or Belet Huen. For decades, Bundeswehr pilots have  jetted around the world to help people.    In the opinion of some NATO alliance partners who are  calling  for a greater commitment, including combat missions, this is not  nearly enough. For example, the Luftwaffe is to contribute at  least a dozen combat aircraft squadrons to the international  crisis-reaction forces who help allies in trouble. This is a  major cost factor, particularly since their soldiers and  equipment always have to be combat-ready, speedily transferable,  and highly professional.    Moreover, the modification of the Patriot antiaircraft  missiles to combat ballistic missiles -- currently the only  realistic threat -- is on the Luftwaffe's list of wishes. The  decades-old Hawk antiaircraft missiles have to be replaced by a  new tactical air defense system -- which costs billions.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 2 TOP LAWNDALE OFFICIALS CHARGED;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY MANAGER AND PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR ARE ACCUSED OF  MISHANDLING THE ASBESTOS IN 3 BUILDINGS THEY RAZED.  </P> <P> Misdemeanor charges were filed this week against two top Lawndale city  officials who have been under investigation since November for their roles in  the improper demolition of three city-owned buildings that contained asbestos  panels.  </P> <P> Lawndale City Manager James Arnold and Public Works Director James Sanders each  were charged with five counts of illegally disposing of hazardous waste and 12  counts of failing to comply with state and federal regulations regarding the  handling of asbestos in connection with the demolition last June of the  buildings, at the former city yard.  </P> <P> "They knew there was asbestos in the buildings, and they failed to take  necessary precautions," Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Patchett said Monday. "They  are in positions of responsibility and authority. They should obey the law, and  they failed to do so."  </P> <P> Lawndale City Atty. David Aleshire defended the city officials Tuesday, saying  the incident "just doesn't seem like a criminal case." He said that until Jan.  1, 1990, the South Coast Air Quality Management District did not have  regulations covering the type of asbestos tiles and panels found in the houses.  </P> <P> Patchett, however, strongly disputed that, saying the panels posed a health  risk and should have been handled in accordance with state guidelines.  </P> <P> Arnold called the charges "massive overkill" on Wednesday, but said he wanted  to speak with his attorney before commenting further on the case. Sanders did  not return calls to City Hall this week. Both are to be arraigned June 20 in  South Bay Municipal Court. If they are found guilty of willfully ignoring the  regulations, Patchett said, he would recommend they be fined $5,000 and serve  at least 90 days in jail.  </P> <P> At the time of the demolition, Sanders was praised by some city officials for  having mounted a bulldozer himself to raze the buildings after a contractor  asked to postpone the work. Neighbors soon complained that the bulldozing by  Sanders and a city crew left their houses covered with dust. When they learned  that the demolished houses had contained asbestos, they lodged a formal  complaint with the Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> Paula Cone, then assistant city manager, who lived in one of the houses in 1968  when it belonged to an in-law, told investigators that she twice warned Arnold  and Sanders that the buildings contained asbestos, Patchett said. But they  ignored her, he said.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office began investigating the case in November after  the AQMD cited the city for failing to comply with district requirements for  the safe disposal of asbestos, a once-popular form of insulation that is now  known to cause cancer and other lung ailments, Patchett said.  </P> <P> Although he had planned to file felony charges in April, Patchett said, he was  told to speak with another asbestos expert before proceeding with the case to  determine whether misdemeanor charges would be more appropriate.  </P> <P> According to state health and safety codes and AQMD regulations, panels  containing more than 1% of asbestos must be handled in accordance with strict  guidelines to ensure that asbestos fibers aren't released into the environment.  Chemical tests on two samples of siding taken from the demolished houses at  167th Street and Osage Avenue concluded that one contained 4% asbestos and the  other contained 20%, Patchett said.  </P> <P> The guidelines require that prior notification be given to the AQMD whenever a  structure containing asbestos is to be demolished, that asbestos-containing  material be kept wet to reduce the amount of dust released into the air, and  that workers place the waste in sealed containers.  </P> <P> Patchett said Sanders, who personally participated in the demolition of the  buildings, and Arnold, who is his immediate supervisor, violated all three  regulations. Although it is not known whether any neighbors were exposed to  enough asbestos dust to suffer health problems, Patchett said, "from what we  hear from the residents, we do feel there was a considerable amount of dust and  particles in the air."  </P> <P> The three buildings, which were private homes when they were bought by the city  in 1968, were used to store tractor tires, Christmas decorations and inoperable  city vehicles. In 1989, several years after Lawndale opened a new city yard on  Manhattan Beach Boulevard, city officials decided to raze the buildings at the  old yard to put in a city park.  </P> <P> Although the city had hired a contractor specializing in asbestos removal to  demolish another city-owned house on Burin Avenue the year before, no such  steps were taken with respect to the three buildings in the former city yard,  Patchett said.  </P> <P> Instead, the city hired a contractor to tear down the buildings without  mentioning that they contained asbestos, he said. When workers for Kirtland  &amp; Sons Demolition arrived at the houses to start the job, however, they  discovered the electricity was still on and they asked to reschedule, Mark  Kirtland told an investigator in papers filed with the court.  </P> <P> Angry at the delay, Sanders fired Kirtland from the job, rented a bulldozer,  rolled up his sleeves and proceeded to do the job with city workers from June  22 to June 26, Patchett said.  </P> <P> Aleshire said he believed Sanders was anxious to get the job done because  "people were yelling and screaming about doing this project, and I think (city  officials) felt a lot of pressure to get the projects done. Perhaps in the rush  there was a lack of appreciation for what the regulations were, but the  question is, 'Is what they were doing criminal in nature?' "  </P> <P> Sanders said he discovered the houses contained asbestos during his first day  on the job and that he "determined it was not dangerous and had city employees,  equipped with old clothes and paper masks, remove the broken pieces of asbestos  and store it in 55-gallon drums," according to court papers.  </P> <P> A private environmental consultant who tested the materials for the city a  month later concluded that the 200 square feet of panels found in the homes  contained a kind of "nonfriable" asbestos, a technical term that means it  cannot be easily broken into fibers. The asbestos panels had not contaminated  the surrounding air or soil and "the area does not pose a health hazard," the  private laboratory report concluded.  </P> <P> But Patchett said that those tests were useless because they were conducted a  month after the buildings were demolished and that it is clear from neighbors'  complaints that some asbestos dust was released into the air.  </P></p>

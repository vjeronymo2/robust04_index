			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A WILL AND A FRAY IN THE COMICAL 'SO LONG'  </P> <P> Aunt Pearl is laid out in a casket in the family living room, where  occasionally one of the gathering mourners lifts the coffin lid with airy  detachment and peers at her with curiosity and relief.  </P> <P> It's a wonderful, droll touch, setting the comical tone for the West Coast  premiere of Sandra Deer's "So Long on Lonely Street" at International City  Theatre in Long Beach. Deer has ripened the hoary tradition of the  reading-of-the-will drama with dripping Southern Gothic excess -- in this case  greed, incest and dark family secrets.  </P> <P> The zany unraveling of Aunt Pearl's will among the members of an acrimonious  Southern clan on what's left of an antebellum estate in Georgia is staged with  marvelous aplomb by Shashin Desai. A strong cast, headed by Ron Boussom and  Holgie Forrester as a hilariously avaricious couple, delivers an energy so  bright that even the play's looming flaw is forgivable.  </P> <P> That misstep, in a play that opened in Atlanta four years ago (followed by a  seven-week run on Broadway in 1986), concerns a twin brother and sister incest  theme brazenly played for poignancy. In the context of a romp, that's courting  lunacy. But David Head and Ann Walker portray the latent lovers with such  sublime discretion, and the events surrounding them are so risible, that you  hardly mind this egregious tribute to Gothic romance.  </P> <P> The play is something like "Little Foxes" meets "Daddy's Dyin' -- Who's Got the  Will?" complete with a whiff of Faulkner's Snopes family and an aging, imposing  housekeeper who has reason to throw her weight around (a salty performance by  Patricia Belcher).  </P> <P> Boussom and Forrester are terrific. He plays a blustering yahoo who wants to  turn the family estate into a mall called Beulahland for Christian merchants,  and she's his hugely pregnant Southern princess in frilly laces, gliding about  looking like a tethered balloon. This pair has so totally absorbed technique  that their acting is aerodynamic.  </P> <P> When the goldilocked Forrester overhears that the black housekeeper almost  certainly comes from the same lineage that spawned her righteous husband, her  instinctive reaction is the production's most uproarious moment.  </P> <P> The cast is ably balanced by Head's bemused, fading soap opera actor and  Walker's cynical poet, who derides the family roots. Michael Sollenberger lends  solid support as the lawyer handling the will with stolid decorum.  </P> <P> This family whirligig, in an atmosphere redolent of delicate neglect, unspools  in a vaguely raggedy, staircased living room and front porch set designed with  an imaginative whoop by Don Gruber.  </P> <P> From a certain angle, you can catch old Aunt Pearl in the coffin. Paulie  Jenkins' tonal lighting, Deborah Slate's costumes, Chuck Estes' original music  and Mario Mariotta's rain and lightning effect catch a manse under zany siege.  </P> <P>  At 4901 E. Carson St. (near the northeast corner of Long Beach City College),  Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., through June 11.  Tickets: $10. (213) 420-4128.  </P></p>

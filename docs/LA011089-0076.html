			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DETROIT USES DEFENSE TO END MONTREAL'S 9-GAME STREAK  </P> <P> The Detroit Red Wings emphasized defense to end the Montreal Canadiens' 9-game  winning streak Monday night.  </P> <P> Dave Barr's goal early in the third period turned out to be the game-winner as  Montreal was held to just 6 shots over the final 30 minutes 18 seconds and  lost, 3-2, at Detroit.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen the forwards come back like that in a while," said Detroit  defenseman Lee Norwood, who was a key to the strong defensive effort in front  of goalkeeper Greg Stefan. "When we do it that way, there's not many that do it  better."  </P> <P> Montreal entered the game with a 15-1-3 record in its last 19 games.  </P> <P> "Everybody puts in a little more to beat us to try to get themselves going,"  Montreal Coach Pat Burns said. "This should get the Red Wings going."  </P> <P> New Jersey 5, New York Rangers 4 -- Jim Korn, who will begin serving a  suspension next week, scored 2 goals and Joe Cirella knocked in the game-winner  as the Devils beat the Rangers at New York.  </P> <P> Cirella's goal at 10:46 of the third period -- after Korn had tied the game in  the second -- gave the Devils their third straight victory and ended New York's  7-game unbeaten streak.  </P> <P> Toronto 3, Vancouver 0 -- Ed Olczyk scored 2 goals and goalkeeper Allan Bester  made 32 saves as the Maple Leafs shut out the Canucks at Toronto.  </P></p>

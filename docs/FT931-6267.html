			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Comalco returns to the black COMALCO, the Australian aluminium manufacturer, yesterday reported net profits of ADollars 42.5m (USDollars 29.54m) after abnormal items for the year to December, compared with losses of ADollars 72.2m in the previous year. However, net profits before abnormal items increased by a more modest ADollars 18m to ADollars 39.6m, largely as a result of a lower tax bill. The group warned that it expected 'difficult' conditions to continue in the current year. Comalco said the bottom-line result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 2.9m following a detailed review of asset values. The 1991 result included an abnormal loss of ADollars 93.7m caused by a ADollars 200m provision against asset values offset by a transfer of ADollars 106.3m from the group superannuation fund. Mr Nick Stump, chief executive, said sales volumes had been reduced by difficult trading conditions. However, the impact was offset by a more competitive exchange rate, which helped sales increase to ADollars 2.1bn from ADollars 2bn. Comalco said an improved result from Commonwealth Aluminium, a US subsidiary, was largely offset by lower aluminium and alumina prices. Aluminium prices averaged Dollars US1,279 a tonne, compared with USDollars 1,333 in 1991. The group said prices had averaged Dollars US1,227 this year. 'No major improvements in price and demand are likely to occur before 1994, but the longer-term outlook is sound as demand grows in the Asian economies and there is increased use of aluminium worldwide by the packaging and automobile industries,' Comalco said. The directors raised the final dividend to 3 cents, fully franked, from 2 cents in 1991, making a total dividend of 5 cents, compared with 4 cents. Comalco is 67 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian resources group, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK.</p>

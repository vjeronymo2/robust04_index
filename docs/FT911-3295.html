			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium at lowest level for four years ALUMINIUM'S PRICE fell to Dollars 1,384 a tonne at one stage yesterday, the lowest level for three-month metal since the London Metal Exchange introduced its high-grade aluminium contract in 1987. The price recovered slightly later in the day but some analysts suggested it would go on falling until substantial output cuts are made by the industry, which is still producing at close to full capacity. However, Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group, said: 'Producers obviously feel better times are just around the corner and might be willing to operate at full blast for another three or four months yet on the assumption that stocks will be eaten up when demand picks up.' He estimated that between 10 and 15 per cent of western aluminium smelting capacity is operating at a loss. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggested the price could go on falling to Dollars 1,250 a tonne unless there were production cuts. 'But there are costs involved in shutting down production and no producer wants to be the first to do so.' Both analysts pointed out that many producers now had energy supply contracts linked to the price of aluminium and that this enabled them to keep going despite weak demand. Yesterday's price fall was apparently triggered by the release late on Tuesday of US statistics showing falling durable goods orders in March. Aluminium for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,357 a tonne, down Dollars 21 a tonne from Tuesday's close, while three-month metal was at Dollars 1.388.50, also down Dollars 21.</p>

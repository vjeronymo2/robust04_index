			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSES CLEARS THE FIRST HURDLE TOWARD MAKING BOBSLED TEAM  </P> <P> Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, topped  a list of a dozen athletes selected Thursday to compete on the U.S. Bobsled  National Team for the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> Team selections were based on a nationwide, six-item fitness test conducted in  July and a week-long series of push training clinics that concluded Sept. 16.  </P> <P> Athletes were judged on their performances on a simulated track.  </P> <P> "The push track is the best means of testing athletes before putting them on  ice," said Tony Carlino, head coach for USA Bobsled.  </P> <P> The also team includes: Brian Shimer, Naples, Fla.; Chuck Leonowicz, Clifton  Park, N.Y.; James Womack, Brunswick, Ga.; Jeff Woodard, Schenectady, N.Y.;  Bryan Leturgez, Cedar Lake, Ind.; Chris Conrad, San Juan Capistrano; Carey  Winslett, San Antonio; Todd Snevely, Burnt Hills, N.Y.; Peter Blount, Orlando,  Fla.; Chris Green, Plymouth, Pa., and Greg Harrell, Laurel, Md.  </P> <P> Olympic trials have not yet been formally announced, but U.S. bobsled officials  said they hope to select a team by next March.  </P> <P> Raider receiver Willie Gault was in the running for a spot on the team. He  scored high on fitness tests but was not selected because his football schedule  conflicts with that of the bobsledders.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> MARKET SLUMPS IN LATE TRADING; DOW DIPS 3.47  </P> <P> The stock market posted a small loss Wednesday, bogging down after a  short-lived run toward record highs.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks, up about 10 points at its best  afternoon level, finished the day with a 3.47 loss at 2,929.95. The index  reached its closing peak of 2,935.19 on June 4.  </P> <P> Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New  York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 722 up, 786 down and 499 unchanged.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that retail sales fell 0.7%  in May, registering a sharper decline than most analysts had expected.  </P> <P> That evidence of continued softness in business activity helped push interest  rates lower in the credit markets.  </P> <P> But stock traders didn't show such clear-cut enthusiasm over the news. Analysts  said investors were a little unsettled by signs that consumer spending was  slipping at a time when economic growth appears to be sluggish at best.  </P> <P> Auto issues were fractionally lower after early-June figures for domestic car  sales came in below expectations. General Motors lost 1/4 to 50, Ford Motor  fell 1/4 to 46 3/8, and Chrysler dropped 3/8 to 15 7/8.  </P> <P> It was a disastrous day for S&amp;L and bank stocks. S&amp;L stocks plunged  after HomeFed's announcement that problem loans rose in May. HomeFed tumbled 8  1/4 to 25. Great Western Financial slumped 1 5/8 to 18 7/8, H. F. Ahmanson  dropped 1 to 21 1/4, CalFed slumped 1 7/8 to 19 1/2 and Golden West Financial  was down 1 7/8 at 31 3/8.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo lost 2 3/8 to 81 5/8 after Moody's downgraded the company's debt.  Security Pacific, also downgraded, lost 3/4 to 40 3/8.  </P> <P> Over-the-counter stocks bucked the overall down market trend. The NASDAQ  composite index rose 2.30 points to 468.86, as investors continued to hunt  among smaller stocks. Some Southland-based OTC stocks that helped lead the  advance included K-Swiss, up 1 1/4 to 24 3/4; Syncor, up 1/4 to 9 3/8; CIMCO,  up 1/2 to 13, and Amgen, up 1 1/2 to 74.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 158.91 million shares, up slightly from 157.10 million  shares traded Tuesday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks were mildly firmer at the close in thin trading, breaking a  three-day losing streak. The Nikkei 225-share index rose 49.46 points to close  at 32,371.77.  </P> <P> Shares surged to a six-month high on the London Stock Exchange. The Financial  Times 100-share index closed 34.7 points higher at 2,405.4.  </P> <P> In Frankfurt, West Germany, shares ended 0.7% lower after a volatile session.  The 30-share DAX index ended at 1,787.39, down 12.97 points.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Rise on Retail Sales News  </P> <P> Bond prices, which have been flat the last few sessions, gained ground after  the release of a government report showing unexpectedly weak retail sales in  May.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 27/32 point, or $8.44 per $1,000 face  amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.38% from 8.45%  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 15%, up from 8.188% on Tuesday. The figure often  fluctuates wildly on Wednesday when banks must report their reserves to federal  authorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Slumps in Domestic Trading  </P> <P> The dollar ended weaker against most major currencies after a mixed performance  overseas, while the soaring British pound continued to take center stage.  </P> <P> Currency dealers blamed the dollar's decline largely on technical factors, with  traders selling the dollar to buy the West German mark and Swiss franc.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, high interest rates and growing expectation that Britain will join  the European Monetary System later this year continued to shore up sterling.  </P> <P> The pound rose to a nearly four-month high against the dollar, dealers said. It  traded at $1.7070 in London, up from $1.7020 on Tuesday, and at $1.7115 in New  York, up from $1.7035.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Gold Futures Are Continuing to Slide  </P> <P> Gold futures prices flirted with $350 an ounce, dropping to within 50 cents of  that psychologically important level before rebounding to $352, the lowest  daily settlement on New York's Commodity Exchange in nearly four years.  </P> <P> Gold futures settled $3.70 to $4.90 lower, with the contract for delivery in  June down $3.70 at $352 an ounce, the lowest settlement of a Comex gold  contract since July 30, 1986.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D10  </P></p>

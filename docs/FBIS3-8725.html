After  visiting London, Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Pale, the Russian  diplomat arrived in Belgrade with a view to finding a  comprehensive solution to the Bosnian conflict. Here is a  report by Slobodan Jankovic:    [Begin Jankovic recording] The Milosevic-Churkin meting  lasted one hour. In a brief statement to journalists  afterwards, Yeltsin's special envoy assessed the talks as  interesting. Opinions were exchanged on many aspects of the  crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Anyway, these  talks were not planned for making important decisions, Vitaliy  Churkin said among other things and noted that other contacts  were also necessary before he could speak about any progress.    President Milosevic's attitude was flexible as regards the  Muslim-Croatian federation, Churkin said and added that he  personally was encouraged by the fact that the agreement on the  federation could lead to a final peace solution. Churkin did  not want to give a specific answer to the question as to what  proposals he had brought to Belgrade, defending this discretion  with the simple explanation that deliberations were still  involved that were part of a permanent process. He said that,  already in the afternoon, he was again leaving for Zagreb to  continue his mission there. In reply to a journalist's question  as to what would happen if the Serbian side refused to join the  federation, Vitaliy Churkin said that refusal was not what the  Serbian side had in mind when contemplating this idea. He  reiterated that it was the turn of the Bosnian Serbs' to decide  what they would do. They need time to study the agreement  carefully, Churkin said and stressed that he believed that  everything would proceed in the direction of incorporating and  not rejecting the idea on confederation.

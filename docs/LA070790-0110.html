			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN MAY, AT LEAST, A KEY FED PANEL OPPOSED RATE CUTS  </P> <P> Federal Reserve policy-makers concluded in their May meeting that inflation  posed too great a danger to allow interest rates to decline, minutes of the  meeting released Friday show.  </P> <P> The 8-week-old records were made available amid signs that the policy-makers  had decided at their most recent gathering on Monday and Tuesday to shift their  policy and stand ready to nudge interest rates lower if the economy weakens  further.  </P> <P> Unidentified government officials were quoted by the Wall Street Journal on  Friday as saying they believed that the directive adopted earlier this week  allows a relaxation of the tight credit policy if additional signs of economic  sluggishness emerge.  </P> <P> Analysts were split over whether the June employment report released Friday by  the Labor Department provided such evidence. The unemployment rate slipped to  5.2% from 5.3%, but non-farm job growth was a weaker-than-expected 40,000.  </P> <P> In May, members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-1 to maintain the  existing credit policy and directed central bank officials to be equally ready  to raise or lower rates, depending on developments on inflation and economic  growth.  </P> <P> Members agreed that "current information on business conditions pointed on  balance to relatively moderate but sustained economic expansion." At the same  time, the members "generally agreed that the prospects for significant  reductions in inflation pressures during the quarters immediately ahead were  not promising."  </P> <P> Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a prominent  advocate of a tough anti-inflation policy, voted against the directive. He  argued for a tighter credit policy "to help assure that progress would be made  toward a reduced rate of inflation."  </P> <P> Hoskins said tighter credit would "enhance the credibility and effectiveness of  monetary policy in countering the persisting strength of inflationary  pressures," according to the minutes.  </P> <P> Other members, who were not identified, went along with the directive but said  "the need to contain and ultimately to reduce inflation might well require a  firming of policy at some point."  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve has been fighting inflation with higher interest rates  since early 1988. In mid-1989 it began nudging rates down amid concern the  economy might topple into a recession.  </P> <P> However, since late December, the Fed has held steady.  </P></p>

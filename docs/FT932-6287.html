			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (13): A useful lesson in happy endings - Profile of Scotland THE job of Robert Crawford, head of Locate in Scotland, is to attract inward investment. But for three months until the end of February this year most of his time was spent trying to prevent some of it seeping out. The problem that confronted him was the threat posed to Digital's plant in Ayr, south-west Scotland, by the US parent company's need to retrench in the face of losses. Digital had to decide whether to close its plant at Galway in Ireland or shut down Ayr. In the end Digital decided to maintain the Ayr plant, which was producing its new Alpha personal computer, and shed 780 jobs at Galway, though a further 350 employees there were retained. Some 980 jobs at Ayr were saved. It was a happy ending after a very tense few weeks for Mr Crawford and Locate in Scotland. For him it underlined several lessons in the present state of the inward investment market. First, countries which benefit strongly from inward investment by multinationals have to face the threat posed by corporate rationalisation. Even if companies are doing well, they may still need fewer plants in EC countries because of economies due to standardisation of products in the single European market and the easing of inter-country barriers. Even if plants do not close they are often employing fewer people. Second, it reminded him that 'you've got to retain what you've got and grow what you've got. You could spend a lot of time chasing after new investments, while existing investors are leaving your patch.' The statistics for inward investment (investment from other countries) and for relocation (movement from the rest of the UK) are now being totted up for the year to the end of March 1993. Mr Crawford gives no sneak previews but says: 'I have been very pleased. Things are going quite well.' But he is not necessarily claiming that 1992/93 was a better year than 1991/92. The fact is that both inward investment and relocation into Scotland have gone off the boil since the late 1980s. In 1989/90 Scotland attracted 64 projects with a total of 12,300 jobs planned, involving investment worth Pounds 853m. In 1991/92 some 59 projects were announced, with 6,000 jobs planned and a total of Pounds 381m to be invested. Japan, Mr Crawford points out, has been 'quiescent' as an inward investor because of its recession, though the new town of Livingston recently won an air-conditioning equipment factory by Mitsubishi Electric, which already has three plants in Scotland. A number of other medium-sized investments have been decided in the electronics sector, mostly by US companies, while Escom, the fast growing German personal computer maker, is a relatively rare European entrant. The importance of existing companies was underlined a few days ago when International Business Machines at Greenock confirmed it was giving Mimtec, a Scottish assembler, a big contract to assemble its PCs. The deal will lead to the building of a 300,000 square foot factory employing 300 people at Gourock. Mr Crawford says that Locate in Scotland needs to keep in touch with existing investors to be able to anticipate their parent companies' next moves and get Scotland on to the short list of locations before a project has even been decided on. Locate in Scotland is also looking for new industries to encourage, to move away from heavy dependence on the electronics sector, which employs about 45,000 people. One idea is to build on the particular strengths of Scottish universities in the field of opto-electronics. Although there are a number of Scottish-based companies in the field, the industry is dominated by Japan. If Japan were to internationalise its industry Scotland should be put high on its list of possible locations. The recession in the UK has slowed down the flow of relocations from the south of England. In 1990/91 the number of jobs announced as being relocated into Scotland from the rest of UK was 5,200; the following year it was 1,400. Yet there is still a trickle. Elonex, the London-based personal computer company, is setting up an assembly plant at Cumbernauld through its associate Cordata. At the high value end of the market Cray Systems has opened a software centre at South Queensferry near Edinburgh. It will be noted that many of the towns mentioned in this article as receiving new projects are new towns. Scotland still has its five new towns  -East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Irvine - unlike England where they have been wound up. But winding up is on its way in Scotland. The Scottish new towns have been crucial to the development of the high-tech economy which Scotland has aimed at in the past two decades and receive about half all Scottish inward investment. High-tech companies from the US and Japan, accustomed to modern plants in modern locations, usually prefer to go to new towns. This is not necessarily because of the grants - Glenrothes, for example, is not in an assisted area - but because of the assistance which new town development corporations supply in providing readily available premises at concessionary rents and giving a general helping hand. But East Kilbride and Glenrothes are to be wound up at the end of 1995; Cumbernauld in 1996, Livingston in 1998 and Irvine in 1999. What will happen to them and the assistance they give incoming companies? Much of their industrial property is to be sold to the private sector. The Scottish Office initially floated the idea of the development corporation staffs staging management buy-outs and forming 'local development companies', purchasing many of the commercial assets of their towns. But that ran into Treasury objections that the MBO teams would not offer the best price available. The Scottish Office then said, just before the general election, that MBO teams might be allowed only the development land and part-finished estates, a much less appetising prospect. It also wants at least some of the new town corporations' operations to be taken over by the local enterprise companies or LECs, which are part of the Scottish Enterprise network. Mr Crawford says: 'The new towns were very good colleagues to Locate in Scotland. The LECs will to some measure replace them.' But although Mr David Millan, chief executive of Cumbernauld Development Corporation, is reasonably positive about the proposed new arrangements and says 'the intention is that we will see a seamless transition', other new town officials are fearful that much of what they supply will not be provided after wind-up. The LECs, they point out, would have less money available and will have other priorities.</p>

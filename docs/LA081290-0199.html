			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER PREMIUMS FOR WOOD ROOFS  </P> <P> Regarding renewed discussions about wood roofs "Fires Fan Wood-Roof Debate"  (Aug. 5):  </P> <P> I'm from West Texas, where there is nothing to burn in wildfires; however, the  type of roof is taken care of there, fairly and equitably, by the fire  insurance companies.  </P> <P> Those wanting wood roofs must pay higher premiums, sometimes prohibitively  high.  </P> <P> Why wouldn't this work in California? Consider the burden lifted from city and  county officials who must deal with special wood interests. It also appears  that in California persons with fire-resistant roofs are forced to subsidize  the wood-roof owners by paying higher premiums.  </P> <P> WALTER R.

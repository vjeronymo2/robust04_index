			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary under the "Quotation" rubric] </F>   [Text] "...The staff should be seriously purged, led by  Kvasov, they have gone and enrolled so many that it will take a  long time yet to sort it out...."    The mention of Vladimir Kvasov, the government chief of  staff, in direct connection with the problem of corruption is  one of the sensational statements Yeltsin made during his recent  press conference. There have been many rumors, being  increasingly confirmed, about the influence Kvasov has gained in  the power structures. Correspondingly, his now inevitable fall  could reshape the pattern of connections between members of the  staff and affect the moods of those holding a number of high  positions. True, it is not clear if all this may lead to  official or closed proceedings, as it is not clear from the  statement what Kvasov is guilty of: making incompetent  decisions that gave a free hand to corrupt officials, or  deliberately conniving with them.    It is also tempting to explain the president's statement in  terms of the desire to keep Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin "under  control." However, the presidential initiative was clearly  agreed with the premier: A conflict between Chernomyrdin and  Kvasov who was trying to play his own cards and to gradually  take the staff from under the premier's influence had long been  brewing. Besides, Yeltsin vigorously denied rumors of  Chernomyrdin's probable resignation, stating: "I'm not going to  surrender Chernomyrdin." Still questions remain. First, the  president used the same phrase about Gaydar well-nigh on the eve  of the latter's quitting as premier. Second, it is not clear who  Chernomyrdin should have been "surrendered" to. Unlike Gaydar,  whose head was demanded on all sides, Viktor Stepanovich's  position is firm, so the natural question is who is out to "get"  him?</p>

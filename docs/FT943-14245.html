			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Observer: Yodelling at the moon Craving another international organisation is understandable; going after two more may be thought a trifle greedy. Not only does Geneva want to play host to son of Gatt - the new World Trade Organisation - now it wants to become the world's environment capital as well. The Swiss parliament has voted SFr75m to transform the old seat of the League of Nations into a 'House of the Environment'. The Palais Wilson, on the shores of Lake Geneva, is intended to be home for the European arm of the United Nations Environment Programme - which has its headquarters in Nairobi - as well as a number of other environmental non-governmental organisations. Behind the cash is the Swiss hope that the UN can be persuaded to keep in Geneva the secretariats dealing with biodiversity, climate change, desertification, toxic waste and endangered species. But it has a fight on its hands. Bonn is fighting tooth and nail to get the WTO. Yesterday Switzerland upped the ante, saying as part of its WTO bid package it would allow Islamic diplomats - for all international bodies - to register two wives, against the current practice of permitting just the one. Geneva's hopes of remaining a centre for international affairs have recently taken a bashing; it's lost the UN Commission for Sustainable Development and much of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs to New York. Perhaps it should content itself with the WTO and have done with it.</p>

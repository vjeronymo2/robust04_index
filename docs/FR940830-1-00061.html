			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ex-situ oil/water separation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time this feasibility study was conducted (early  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993), approximately a year and a half remained before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration of the national capacity variance for the F037/F038  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes. Citgo planned that the cleanout would be finished and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all the sludge removed would be landfilled in a subtitle C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit meeting the minimum technology requirements, as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;268.5(h)(2), before the national capacity variance expired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They constructed a treatment system which is designed to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESHAP waste limit for benzene and controls air emissions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated waste also must meet certain landfill acceptance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria. In particular, this treatment system meets the LDR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level for benzene and also achieves oil recovery, partial removal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of volatile organics, and dewatering and stabilization of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludge which meets LDR standards for nickel and chromium (the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated metals in F037/F038 wastes); however, the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system would not meet the LDR treatment standards for most of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semivolatile organics. Wastewater from the system is redisposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> back into the Surge Pond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Citgo hired a contractor to perform the removal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of the Surge Pond sludge. The conditions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract stated that the clean-up must be completed before June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30, 1994. However, due to technical difficulties with scale-up,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dewatering performance, and the automatic control system for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor recovery system, the progress of the clean-up was seriously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delayed. In early 1994, it became clear to Citgo that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean-up would not be finished before the expiration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national capacity variance and that they would need a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatability variance from the LDRs in order to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposing of the residuals from their existing sludge treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Waste Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the most significant distinguishing characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this waste is its tremendous quantity. The feasibility study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in early 1993 estimated that the total volume of sludge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Surge Pond was 770,000 cubic yards, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total mass as 745,000 tons with a 30% solids content (230,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tons dry solids). However, Citgo indicated in its petition that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it now appears that these quantities were underestimated by as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much as 25%, which would mean that the original mass of sludge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was about 993,000 tons. Citgo indicated that approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 625,000 tons of sludge would remain in the pond after June 30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, the date that the national capacity variance for this waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expired. This is the quantity of waste that will be affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed variance. Approximately 427,000 tons of solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual will be generated by the treatment of the waste in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surge Pond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sampling and analysis of the sludge was performed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Citgo's feasibility study and again for this variance petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concentrations of hazardous constituents in untreated sludge are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summarized in table A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Description of On-site Treatment System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The treatment system Citgo is using consists of air sparging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in tanks to remove benzene (other volatiles do not appear to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed effectively) followed by sludge dewatering. Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from some of the unit processes (shaker system, air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sparging tanks, and chemical mix tanks) are routed to a vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system which consists of scrubbers for removal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrogen sulfide and a portable thermal oxidizer for destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of volatile organics. The dewatered sludge is then mixed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lime or flyash for purposes of stabilization of metals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing structural integrity to meet the landfill acceptance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria. The stabilized sludge is land disposed at Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waste Management's Subtitle C landfill in Carlyss, Louisiana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The liquid phase goes to tanks functioning as oil-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separators for recovery of oil; approximately 18% of the oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in the sludge is recovered. The aqueous discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (wastewater) from the separators is discharged back into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surge Pond; overflow from the Surge Pond discharges into the old  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations that the sludge treatment system must satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the NPDES permit limits for discharge of all site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters, air emission limits, the benzene NESHAP limit (10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ppm), and structural criteria for acceptance at the landfill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment performance data is presented in table B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

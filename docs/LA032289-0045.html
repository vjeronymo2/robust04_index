			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIALS CRITICIZED;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DEFENDS TV EXPERIMENT  </P> <P> Students at Gahr High School wonder what all the fuss is about.  </P> <P> Every school-day morning since March 6, students at the Cerritos high school  have been watching a new teen-oriented TV news broadcast called Channel One,  produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn. Each 12-minute program,  being aired on an experimental basis in classrooms at six high schools  throughout the United States, includes two minutes of commercials for jeans,  chewing gum and other products that young people buy.  </P> <P> In exchange for showing the current-events program, Gahr and each of the other  schools received $50,000 worth of electronic equipment, including 25-inch color  televisions for every classroom, two videocassette recorders and a satellite  dish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program Condemned  </P> <P> Because of the commercials on Channel One, however, the program has been  condemned by the National Education Assn., the American Federation of Teachers,  and both the California and the National Parent-Teachers Assns., among others.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, National PTA President Manya Ungar of Chicago said the  group's leaders "applaud efforts to bring new technology into our schools.  However, we are opposed to making the availability of that technology and  programming contingent upon subjecting a captive student audience to the  promotion of commercial products or services."  </P> <P> But at Gahr, the only school in the West taking part in the pilot program,  students and staff seem surprised at what many see as much ado about Whittle.  </P> <P> Gahr Principal Nadine Barreto, who accepted the firm's invitation to take part  in the pilot program, acknowledged that she had some initial concerns.  </P> <P> Whittle promised Barreto and other participating principals that all  commercials would be appropriate for classroom viewing. No ads would be  accepted for alcoholic beverages, tobacco, contraceptives or feminine hygiene  products.  </P> <P> Principals have the option of screening each program in advance and pulling the  plug if they find it objectionable. Gahr students have seen all the programming  to date.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Misgivings Allayed  </P> <P> Barreto said her misgivings were also allayed by the quality of the programming  and the fact that Gahr teachers are using the show to analyze the techniques  advertisers use to sway audiences.  </P> <P> Moreover, she noted, $50,000 worth of equipment is not easy to come by in an  era of Spartan school budgets.  </P> <P> "If we lived in a perfect world, we wouldn't have commercials," she said. "And  education would be the country's highest priority."  </P> <P> Barreto said she believes that high school students are smarter, more  sophisticated consumers than critics of the program give them credit for.  </P> <P> Several Gahr students said they are more likely to be influenced by peer  pressure than by advertising in deciding what to buy.  </P> <P> "These kids are walking commercials," teacher Roger Hughes said, alluding to  the brand names prominently displayed on T-shirts, jeans and running shoes.  </P> <P> On a recent Wednesday morning, the Channel One broadcast featured stories on  the national ban on fruit from Chile and the growing concern about the safety  of apples.  </P> <P> A segment on air pollution touched on everything from acid rain to a Channel  One reporter's observation that "every time a cow belches, it sends out methane  gas."  </P> <P> Hughes' students laughed at the notion of bovine pollution, but not as hard as  they laughed at a deodorant commercial that showed a classroom of students with  dry underarms waving their hands in the air as a voice urged them to "Raise  your hand if you're Sure!"  </P></p>

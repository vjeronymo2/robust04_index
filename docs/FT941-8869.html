			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: SBC starts Swiss season with 36% surge Swiss Bank Corporation has launched the big Swiss bank results season with a 36 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net income to SFr1.37bn (Dollars 945m)  -well ahead of earlier forecasts - and a proposed 14.3 per cent rise in dividends. Following the news, the group's bearer shares put on SFr18 to SFr1,438 in a rising Zurich market. SBC's underlying net income growth rate, excluding extraordinary gains from large asset sales in 1992, was a much higher 80 per cent, thanks to very robust earnings from trading and commissions and modest expense growth. Also, the previous year's profits were severely depressed by the costs of reorganising the group's private banking operations and integrating the O'Connor Associates derivatives subsidiary. Last year's earnings growth was achieved in spite of the decision to set aside massive provisions of SFr2.8bn, 44 per cent more than in 1992. In common with all Swiss banks, SBC has suffered from a surge in bad loans, especially in the depressed Swiss real estate sector. The bank indicated earlier that it would be taking advantage of its high profits last year to make provisions for every foreseeable risk. SBC said that the provisions also included payments made to the former partners of O'Connor Associates which it took over in 1990. The group said its net operating income jumped 31 per cent to SFr9.2bn. Operating expenditure rose 16 per cent to SFr4.7bn, mainly due to performance-related compensation to certain employees, leaving profits before taxes and provisions of SFr4.5bn, ahead by 52 per cent. Total consolidated assets rose 3 per cent to SFr207bn. After-tax return on equity rose from 7.9 per cent in 1992 to 10.2 per cent last year and the directors are proposing to raise the group's dividends for the first time since 1989. The rate on the bearer share would rise from SFr14 to SFr16 while that on the registered share would increase from SFr7 to SFr8. As last year, shareholders will be offered the option of taking their dividends in shares with warrants on terms to be announced at the annual meeting on April 26. The directors are proposing to create SFr100m par value of capital for possible use in acquisitions or rights issues plus SFr150m par value for use in convertible bonds and bonds with warrants. Union Bank of Switzerland will report its 1993 figures next Friday and Credit Suisse the following Friday.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (27): Miracle-maker - Profile of Leszek Balcerowicz THE START of Poland's bold attempted leap from central planning to market discipline was linked to the name of one man - Leszek Balcerowicz. After more than 45 years of communist distortion, this lean, intense, academic economist became finance minister in autumn 1989 and was suddenly given the chance to put theories of economic transition into practice. For the first six months of 1990 his IMF-backed stabilisation policies performed miracles. Hyperinflation was blocked in its tracks, a huge monetary overhang was eliminated, the zloty was made internally convertible and regained its lustre, private enterprise blossomed. Abroad his views and experience continued to be actively sought, especially by the young Russian reformers around Mr Yegor Gaidar. But at home criticism of his alleged insensitivity to the social costs of transition mounted throughout 1991 as lower trade barriers and an increasingly overvalued zloty put pressure on domestic producers andunemployment started to soar. Inflation also remained dangerously high, fuelled by a soaring budget deficit which Mr Balcerowicz, for all his 'iron man' image, proved unable to contain. In an interview shortly after leaving the finance ministry Mr Balcerowicz displayed the quiet but passionate conviction in market-orientated reform which made him the moral as well as intellectual driving force behind Poland's first two post-communist governments. But he does not hide his frustration at the political and institutional barriers to reform which have emerged. He recalls that when Poland pioneered the reform process in January 1990, inflation was running at an annualised rate of around 2,000 per cent and there were shortages of everything. Within weeks the shops were full and by August inflation fell back to 1.8 per cent. But after a mistaken mid-year easing of monetary policy, inflation began rising again to 3 to 4 per cent monthly, which has become a clear sign that underlying structural problems need to be tackled. Even so, Poland has not done badly, he argues, when compared to more fortunate Hungary and Czechoslovakia. They embarked on reform with lower inflation, fewer shortages and, in Hungary's case, a strong head start thanks to earlier reforms of crucial areas such as banking and taxation.</p>

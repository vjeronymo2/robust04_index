			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Tuesday [22 February] Anatoliy Adamishin,  Russia's first deputy foreign minister, reconfirmed to INTERFAX  that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to hold a  special summit of Russian, American, French, British, and German  leaders to solve the Bosnian issue remains in force.    Adamishin pointed out that the pull-out of heavy artillery  and other arms from Sarajevo by Serbs and Muslims means "a  serious breakthrough reached by political means." "Now it is  important to fasten this initial success," he said.    In Adamishin's words, Russia has a concrete program for  further actions. "It provides for final demilitarization of  Sarajevo. It can be fixed by the transfer of the city to UN  interim administration as was foreseen almost in all the plans  for a settlement," he said.    "Solution of several other painful problems in Bosnia,  minding the lessons of the Sarajevo crisis, can become the  second step," said Adamishin.    He emphasized that he does not view the course for "further  ultimatums as a very productive one." "The events around  Sarajevo demonstrated that the line of a political settlement of  the conflict, being pursued by Russia gives the best results.  But one should not be sure that all kinds of ultimatums won't  appear every now and then and that Russia will be able to pull  the situation away from a dead alley, this will not result in  any settlement," he underlined.    Adamishin expressed his dissatisfaction with the version  being spread now, that "the Serbs had to go along with the NATO  ultimatum one way or another and that Russia only saved their  image (face), by asking that they fulfilled not NATO's ultimatum  but request. Events could have taken another turn and this  could have led to unexpected consequences," he pointed out.    INTERFAX's interlocutor believes that such a method as  "shout  and everything will be done" is not the most efficient one in  diplomacy. "It does not mean that Russia rejects utilization of  force once and for all. Moscow has agreed that the NATO forces  in the former Yugoslavia can defend themselves in case of an  attack against them. There are Russian servicemen in the  composition of these forces and we cannot leave them armless in  this sense. The thing is that such decisions should be taken  cautiously and only along one possible line, namely via the UN  Security Council," he said.    Adamishin spoke in favor of continuation of talks between  three confronting Bosnian parties. "This is necessary in order  to solve the Bosnian conflict in complex, though its solution  has been already reached. But after that Muslims took a step  back as they believed that they can reach more at the  battlefield than at the negotiation table, said Adamishin. But  as we speak about a final political settlement, Russia does not  rule out that there can be introduced small and final  corrections into the plan proposed by Lord Owen and Thorwald  Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the international conference on  settlement in the former Yugoslavia."    As the Bosnian crisis has demonstrated, Adamishin said, the  West should study "a new science of cooperation more but not  less than Russia."    In his opinion, Russia and the West will "experience periods  of definite complications because they are getting accustomed to  the interests of each other."    Adamishin said that Russia believes that "inevitable  difference in interests should be regulated by political means,  by means of discussion and partnership." "If we are pushed from  such a way to look for a common denominator in the sphere of  mutual interests then we shall be forced to search for other  methods to defend our interests. As a matter of fact, interests  will no disappear. The West is to take them into consideration  this way or other," noted Adamishin.    He also emphasized that "cooperation with Russia will bring  greater results for conflicts' solution and establishing  European security than recurrences of confrontation with Moscow  reminding of "cold war."</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: BM statement lifts share price SHARES IN BM Group bounc-ed back sharply yesterday after the construction equipment group put out a lengthy statement underlying the strength of the company despite the resignation of its influential chairman, Mr Roger Shute. With remaining members of the board making a grueling tour of its institutional investors, the shares rose from 111p to 145p. Mr Shute's resignation on health grounds on June 26, coming amid a flurry of bad market news, triggered a share price collapse. The company's brokers then issued a profits downgrading and the shares fell to a low point of 85p on Wednesday. Only a month ago BM stood at 398p. BM's board confirmed that it intended to pay an increased final dividend of at least 2.3p for the year to June 30 as promised at the time of the January rights issue. The board also said it was confident that it would be able to recommend 'further significant growth' in the dividend for the current year. At the dividend level of not less than 4.4p for 1992 (3.4p), the dividend cover was 'very substantial', the company said. On current trading BM said it had encountered tough conditions in many of its markets. Sales had been disappointing in April but had recovered in May and June. Adverse currency movements on translation would also hit reported earnings. On the basis of management accounts received for the first 10 months of the year, the directors said there would be continued growth in the profitability of the group. There would nevertheless be 'modest decline' in earnings per share from last year's 27.2p as a result of the increase in the number of shares in issue. BM also said it continued to have strong relations with its important suppliers. In the UK, distribution agreements with Hitachi of Japan had recently been extended for five years; in the US 'strong working associations' continued with Komatsu Dresser Corp. The integration of Thomas Robinson, the most recent of the many acquisitions through which BM has managed to grow rapidly, was proceeding satisfactorily, the directors said.</p>

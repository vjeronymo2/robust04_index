			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Salinas reshuffles cabinet MEXICAN President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has named a hardline state governor as interior minister, in charge of national security, as part of a cabinet reshuffle, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. He also appointed a new energy minister and brought in a reform-minded lawyer and academic as attorney-general, in charge of law and the federal police. The president appointed Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, the governor of Chiapas, as minister of the interior. While governor, Mr Gonzalez was frequently criticised by human rights groups for excessive use of force, and abusing indigenous peoples' rights. As if to balance the appointment, the president named Mr Jorge Carpizo, head of the government's Human Rights Commission, as attorney-general. Mr Emilio Lozoya's appointment as minister of energy and mines makes him a potential presidential contender next year.</p>

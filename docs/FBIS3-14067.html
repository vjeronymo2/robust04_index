			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Amir Hay] </F>   [Excerpts] For the first time since the Madrid conference,  the representatives of all the political factions in Hebron,  including Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad,  held a joint news conference. They protested the steps taken by  Israel in the wake of the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs  and called on 'Arafat to quit the peace talks immediately.  [passage omitted]    The Hebron massacre has unified all the political factions  in  Hebron in their demand to station an international protection  force in the territories and to evacuate all the Jewish settlers  from Hebron. [passage omitted]    Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the deputy chairman of the Palestinian  delegation, said that despite the pain felt over the Hebron  massacre, the Palestinians should continue the negotiations with  Israel. 'Urayqat's remarks elicited a furious reaction from the  audience. [passage omitted]    The steps taken by Israel immediately after the Hebron  massacre, such as the establishment of the Shamgar Commission,  are seen here as a predetermined farce. The only way to resolve  the crisis, the participants said, is to redefine the concept of  security in the territories so that it will cease to be the  exclusive monopoly of the Jews.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / The Tories' hung party Since U-turns are so much in fashion, here is one of mine. It no longer appears to me to be 'almost certain', as I have been saying recently, that Mr John Major will survive as prime minister for another four years. This is not a turn very far around the U. There is no suggestion that Mr Major is definitely, or even probably, for the chop. In fact the odds are still in favour of him keeping his job. It is just that there seems no end to the series of misfortunes that fate has decided to inflict upon his premiership. It has therefore become prudent to visualise scenes in which he steps down. One such was conjured up by a leading Eurosceptic in a hotel foyer during the recent Conservative party conference in Brighton. The conversation had passed beyond the technicalities of a formal challenge, of the kind that felled Lady Thatcher. Nothing of the sort seemed likely to happen. Then Mr E Sceptic said 'what about this?' whereupon he put his arm around my shoulders and, adopting the manner and voice of Sir Marcus Fox, proclaimed: 'Prime minister, the members want you to spend more time with your family . . .' The obvious reply was, 'but if that happened you would get an even more Europhile prime minister than Mr Major, since the candidates are . . .', to which Mr Sceptic replied: 'If we must choose from three peas in a pod, let us at least have a competent pea.' This exchange was quickly forgotten, but over the past few days it has returned to haunt me. The spectres began to reassemble as Sir Marcus, chairman of the backbenchers' 1922 committee, scuppered the plan to close 31 coal pits. Then last Thursday a gang of Europhobes ambushed a regular meeting of the '22, much in the same manner as militant members of the far left once hijacked Labour party and trade union assemblies. The executive of the committee emerged to say that Mr Major's plan to reopen parliamentary debate on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty was premature. That should have been brushed aside as an opening skirmish in a long drawn-out parliamentary battle. After all, it is now clear that what was elected on April 9 was not a Conservative government with a majority of 21, but a hung parliament in which the two parties that most loathe one another, the Thatcherites and the Majorites, stand beneath the Tory flag. The difficulty is that the government has no idea of how to operate in a hung parliament; the notion that one exists is so abhorrent to Conservatives that they will find it hard to accept my half-joking suggestion that it does. After the '22 spoke, Number 10 Downing Street decided to reassert the principle of a parliamentary majority. On Saturday the prime minister's office allowed (encouraged?) newspapers to report that if the government loses the vote on the Maastricht debate due on November 4 a general election will follow. The Labour party would be well placed to win it. This threat was unwisely timed, as Mr Major himself seemed to acknowledge in a radio interview on Sunday and the party chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, appeared to be shouting out loud yesterday. No sane government ties a hand-grenade round its waist and threatens to pull the pin if it does not get its way. For Mr Major and his colleagues to do so is a clumsy confidence trick. So grave have matters become that the Labour party has been roused from its post-electoral slumber. It seems ready to compromise on its commitment to the Maastricht treaty in the hope of damaging the prime minister. The time is not right, its shadow ministers are saying; the Danes have not yet spoken  -anyhow the upcoming vote is a matter of confidence in the government, of which the opposition naturally has none. If there are votes in sophistry, Labour will romp home next time. The likely outcome, of course, is that the government whips and business managers will find a way out, as they did over coal last week. But it is trickier now. A motion that stresses confidence in the government will attract a negative vote from Labour and the Liberal Democrats but should minimise the number of Maastricht rebels. A motion that stresses the merits of the treaty makes it harder for Labour to vote against, but will maximise the Thatcherite party's vote. A soft motion - to adjourn the house, say - exposes the government's weakness. These equations contain too many unknowns to make prediction easy. Tradition has it that governments get their way in the end. Tradition is probably right. If so, Parliament will - eventually - ratify Maastricht, in which case the prime minister's fortunes may begin to take a turn for the better. There is, however, a chance that it will not - that the whole endeavour will be cast aside on Wednesday week, or before the winter is out. If that unlikely accident happens, it will be hard to say what point there is in Mr Major carrying on.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Christic Institute, whose lawsuit against several Iran-Contra figures was  dismissed, posted a $1.2-million surety bond guaranteeing payment of  defendants' legal costs if the group loses its appeal. U.S. District Judge  James Lawrence King in Miami dismissed the Washington-based public interest law  firm's $23.8-million lawsuit last June 23, four days before the trial was  scheduled to begin. He ordered the group Feb. 2 to pay $1 million in legal fees  and costs to 14 defendants. The $1.2-million surety bond covers the defendants'  previous legal costs and appeals costs and fees if the group loses its appeal  of King's ruling.  </P></p>

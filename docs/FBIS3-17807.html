This was reported at a Tuesday briefing in Moscow by  the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov.    He described the current situation in the Korean peninsula  as  balancing on the brink of war.    In his opinion the recent Russian initiative to convene a  conference of six interested countries (China, the USA, Japan,  Russia and the two Koreas) and the United Nations and the  International Atomic Energy Agency promotes a settlement in that  part of the world.    The deputy minister stressed that Russia by no means  questions the efforts of the UN Security Council or the IAEA.  "However, the steps of the two organizations to normalize the  situation in the Korean peninsula do not always produce the  desired results", he remarked.    Panov announced that the Russian initiative is closely  studied by all interested sides. "So far there have been no  negative answers", he said.    In the opinion of the diplomat the conference should  concentrate on making the peninsula a nuclear-free zone. He  stressed that Russia and the USA agree that the conference  should be well-prepared and discuss the membership of North  Korea in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the observation  of all safety regulations and a joint declaration of the two  Koreas on a nuclear-free zone.    According to Panov, the conference could begin in Geneva and  continue in Pyongyang and Seoul interchangeably.    The diplomat said that in the framework of organizing the  conference it would be useful to hold preliminary unofficial  consultations of all interested sides in Moscow. "It is  absolutely unnecessary for everyone to sit at the same table.  We understand that some participants would find it hard to  communicate directly therefore we do not rule out the  possibility of mediators", Panov said.    He added that a conference of six countries, representatives  of the UN Secretary General and the General Director of the  International Atomic Energy Agency is not the final format and  the list of participants could be extended.</p>

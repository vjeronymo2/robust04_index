			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Qin Wenjun Revealed That Name List of First Group </F> of Hong Kong Regional Affairs Advisers Will Be Announced Early  Next Month"]    [Text] The name list of the first batch of Hong Kong  regional affairs advisers appointed by XINHUA Hong Kong Branch  will be published early next month. The name list of the third  batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers will also be made public at  the same time. A ceremony to renew the tenure of the first  batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers will be held. In addition,  the authorities concerned are considering increasing the  membership of the Preliminary Working Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region (PWC).    Qin Wenjun, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch,  attended a cocktail party held by the Hong Kong Association of  Real Estate and Construction Industries yesterday to celebrate  the Spring Festival. When asked about progress made in  appointing "regional affairs advisers," Qin said that the  Chinese side is stepping up the work, adding that the name list  of about 300 regional affairs advisers will probably be  published in early March. The Chinese side is also actively  preparing for the appointment of the third batch of Hong Kong  affairs advisers, including looking for suitable candidates and  soliciting their opinions. He also said that the Chinese side  is preparing the name list of the second batch of PWC members.    Commenting on the possibility that the British side will  table the second part of the constitutional package to the  Legislative Council (Legco), he emphasized that the Sino-British  talks had been suspended unilaterally by the British side.  Whether the constitutional package is submitted to Legco in  part or in full amounts to the suspension of the talks, as was  agreed by the two sides before the talks. The Chinese side did  not expect this, but since this has happened, the British side  must accept the consequences. He also said that if the British  side publishes the minutes of the 17 rounds of talks, the  Chinese side will follow suit.    When asked about support given by the Australian foreign  minister to the Hong Kong governor's political reform package,  Qin said: The Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and  Britain before 1997 and is China's internal affair after 1997.  This is a principle the Chinese side has solemnly told the  world. No third party is qualified to make irresponsible  remarks on the Hong Kong issue. He also reminded the public of  the disparity between the remarks by the Australian prime  minister and the foreign minister. On the human rights issue,  he reiterated that the Asian region values democracy and knows  how to expand democracy, including human rights, in line with  its actual conditions.    Qin said he had no idea about the transfer of Zhou Nan,  director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, to Beijing. Regarding the  appointment of Wang Fengchao, director of the second department  of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, as deputy director of  the office, Qin said Wang is the right person for the post,  because he is familiar with the situation in Hong Kong and Macao.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Presidential Council of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen" on 23 June; place not given]    [Text] The Sanaa regime continues to challenge the  international community, all values, and all ethics. Each time  it claims that it is accepting the decision of the UN Security  Council Resolution No. 924, it simultaneously prepares for a new  offensive. The Sanaa regime has continued to launch successive  attacks on our defensive lines around Aden, and the intensity  and ferocity of these attacks have increased since 17 June.    There have been 14 attacks so far, and for each attack they  have brought in more reinforcements. Our brave forces and the  sons of our people have repulsed these attacks, which aim at the  occupation and humiliation of the land and the people's honor.  In every attack the Sanaa regime launches missiles and  artillery against innocent citizens and vital installations.  Since 17 June the number of casualties, dead, and wounded has  totaled 800 people, most of whom are women, children, and the  elderly.    The Sanaa regime early this morning began an attack on the  battle lines, but is being resisted with heroism and bravery.  At the same time it has been shelling residential areas in the  quarters of al-Shaykh Uthman, al-Mansurah and Dar Sa'd since  this morning. Innocent citizens are being killed and wounded.  The Sanaa regime is also shelling vital installations such as  the desalination plant, the power station, the fire station, and  the refinery.    The Sanaa regime is wrong in believing that its killing of  citizens and destruction of homes and vital installations will  weaken the morale of the sons of our people and force them to  prostrate themselves before occupation and humiliation. The  sons of our people prefer to die bravely in defense of their  homeland and the protection of their women's honor, than to  prostrate and humble themselves before a regime which does not  believe in ideals and does not respect people. It is a regime  which is not interested in law or legitimacy, whether religious,  Arab, or international.    In the name of the Democratic Republic of Yemen we announce  to the fraternal Arab countries and the international community  that the Sanaa regime will not uphold any pledge or commitment  it makes to them. It aims to occupy, destroy, loot, pillage,  and dishonor.    Diplomatic advice is achieving nothing, except to give more  time to the Sanaa regime to continue with its attempts at the  malicious destruction of our people, and Aden in particular.    For this reason we wish to stress what we said in our  previous appeal, and the need to take deterrent measures to  compel the Sanaa regime to heed the resolutions of the  international community and respect human rights. As for our  people, they will not submit, and will resist the aggressors  with all the strength available to them. God is with us, and  those who do wrong should know what kind of end they will suffer.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Shake-up of Welsh agency likely after criticisms A SHAKE-UP of the management of the Welsh Development Agency is expected after yesterday's swingeing criticism by the Commons public accounts committee of the way it has been run. The MPs say in a report that management practices at the publicly funded agency were 'well below' what parliament has a right to expect. The matters criticised include: an unapproved redundancy scheme with overpayments of Pounds 1.4m; the appointment of a fraudster, Mr Neil Smith, who is now in prison, as marketing director; the hiring of models for promotional work who had been interviewed in an hotel room by Mr Smith; the so-called Operation Wizard to consider privatisation in which more than Pounds 300,000 was paid to consultants; an attempt to buy the silence of a director who left with an early retirement package valued at Pounds 228,000; and the failure to get approval for a free petrol scheme for personal cars. The Welsh Office is also blamed for lack of supervision. 'We regard it as unacceptable,' state the MPs, 'that the Welsh Office took no action against anyone in the top echelons of the agency who presided over a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of control and accountability.' Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, who took over last week as WDA chairman, said yesterday: 'We take this report very seriously and we will see that appropriate remedial action is taken in every aspect.' While he would not comment on whether there would be any resignations, he said: 'Clearly personnel has to be part of any investigation.' Some procedures, he said, had already been changed and he would investigate whether they were the correct changes. Mr John Redwood, recently appointed as Welsh secretary, said he took the criticisms very seriously and the charges would be investigated. If they were fair, he would explain to parliament what action had been taken and, if necessary, what action would be taken to discipline the people involved. Mr Alan Williams, the Labour MP for Swansea West and a member of the public accounts committee, protested yesterday that no disciplinary action had yet been taken. 'If no action is taken, one is bound to question what it takes this government to sack its placemen in its ever expanding empire of unaccountable quangos,' he said. The WDA, which was set up in 1976 and has a Pounds 171m annual budget, partly self-funded, was chaired until the end of last month by Dr Gwyn Jones, who was appointed in October 1988 by Lord Peter Walker when Welsh secretary. Among his other interests, he is now the BBC governor for Wales and a non-executive director of Tesco. Dr Jones is at present on holiday with his family.

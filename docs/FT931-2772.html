At the current rate a Pounds 25m net dividend gives rise to Pounds 8.3m of ACT and a gross dividend of Pounds 33.3m. When the move to the 20 per cent rate is complete, a net dividend of Pounds 25m will give ACT of Pounds 6.3m and a gross dividend of Pounds 31.3m. ACT is then offset against mainstream UK corporation tax. The first company, which earns all its profits in the UK, sees no change in its total tax bill, but gets a cashflow benefit as Pounds 2m of tax switches from payment in advance to arrears. However, a tax exempt investor will receive a lower tax credit on its dividend. The second company is unable fully to offset its ACT liability against its UK corporation tax. Under the current system it takes Pounds 33 of corporation tax to relieve Pounds 25 of ACT, leaving it with surplus ACT of Pounds 3.3m. The change to the rate in the budget makes this worse, only Pounds 20 of ACT can be offset against Pounds 33 of corporation tax. However, the lower rate more than compensates and the surplus ACT reduces to Pounds 2.3m. If the foreign income dividend scheme is introduced, making dividends paid from overseas profits free of ACT, the company's problem is solved. The illustration assumes the company opts to pay 80 per cent of its dividend out of foreigh profits. However, the tax-exempt investor is even worse off, as it can only reclaim tax on the proportion of the dividend paid from UK profits. 'I am pleased that the changes have come about, although the pension funds are disadvantaged. I think they are strong enough to withstand the measures. I think it is too early to say whether that means we will pay additional dividends.' Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, who believes the Anglo-US conglomerate's tax charge will fall by about Pounds 35m 'The changes will unquestionably be of use to us over the next few years. But they will be of less help than one might think. There could be a problem from tax-exempt shareholders pressing for higher dividends. T&amp;N has a surplus ACT of more than Pounds 5m.' Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group 'It is not clear our tax-exempt shareholders will be pressing for higher dividends. We will make up our minds as to what we do after we hear back from them.' Peter Clappison, finance director of BBA, the automotive, aviation and industrial component maker, who expects his group to save around Pounds 1m in tax.</p>

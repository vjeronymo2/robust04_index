			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "Call for Extended Term of </F> Office. Vladimir Shumeyko Opposed to Parliamentary and  Presidential Elections in 1996"]    [Text] Delivering a report to the upper chamber of  parliament on Tuesday, Vladimir Shumeyko spoke against holding  elections to the State Duma and the Federation Council in 1996.  The activity of the first Federal Assembly, in his opinion,  should be extended by two more years. The speaker also noted  that the presidential elections could also be postponed. At  least, Shumeyko stated, "it would be useful if Boris  Nikolayevich remained for at least one more term."    The comment by the head of the Federation Council that Boris  Yeltsin's presidential powers should not be restricted to one  term is hardly sensational: Shumeyko has been saying that more  often than anyone else. But this is the first time that the  upper chamber speaker has expressed a wish for the life of the  present Federal Assembly to be prolonged.    Vladimir Shumeyko said that the present parliamentarians  needed an "extended" term for the following reasons: "The  majority of deputies are beginning to understand what is  expected of them, but soon many will be starting to think more  about their election campaign than engaging in legislative  activity."    This high-level praise of the "majority of the deputies,"  who  are only just beginning to "understand what is expected of them"  after six months of state service, is in itself dubious. But  the main thing is that it is undeserved: So far the Duma  colleagues' understanding of "what is expected of them" has  extended only to the adoption of a single law -- on the status  of deputies -- with a wide range of self-bestowed rights,  privileges, benefits, and so forth. And to the amnesty granted  to certain inhabitants of Lefortovo Prison. The publication of  the most important laws, such as, for example, the law on the  Constitutional Court, on the president, and on elections, is  being delayed -- the deputies are busy with scandals,  interfactional war, and incessant bickering.    Against tha background of such productivity as this by the  Duma, the legislative activity of the president, who has been  issuing whole sets of edicts one after another, seems to  demonstrate an enforced need for the head of state to take the  initiative himself. Furthermore, the scale of this initiative,  which seems to contain just about everything imaginable -- from  major economic decisions to edicts on housing construction and  the fight against gangsterism -- has given observers grounds for  saying that Boris Yeltsin has launched his own new election  campaign. To judge from Vladimir Shumeyko's statement, however,  what is being tested is the idea of completely forgoing  presidential elections by extending Yeltsin's powers for at  least one more term. Without any doubt, the aim of the  statement was to find out what reaction it would get in  political circles and in society.    The reaction was this. Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced  that he is ready to support his Federation Council colleague's  proposal on condition that there is a perceptible stabilization  of the economy in the next two-three months and the two chambers  of parliament prove viable. Vyacheslav Kostikov, the  president's press secretary, was more cautious, noting in an  interview for EKHO MOSKVY that Boris Yeltsin had not been  informed of Shumeyko's initiative but that, irrespective of  that, the opinion of the Federation Council chairman "should be  heeded." Aleksandr Yakovlev, the president's representative in  the Federal Assembly, gave a trenchant and forthright reaction  to Shumeyko's proposal when he said in an interview for  IZVESTIYA: "I would regard any initiative aimed at revising the  Constitution with great apprehension, no matter how  well-intentioned that initiative may be. Cancelling the Federal  Assembly elections would set a precedent which would endanger  the existence of one of the main elements of democracy." When  asked whether this judgment also applied to the proposal to  extend Boris Yeltsin's term of office, the president's  representative in the Federal Assembly replied: "Undoubtedly."    The idea of canceling the next presidential election has  been around in the Kremlin for some time now in the form of  repeated public comments on that score by Sergey Filatov and  Vladimir Shumeyko. But this is the first time that the idea has  been circulated politically and socially in conjunction with the  proposal to preserve the present composition of the Federal  Assembly for an extra two years. Clearly, it goes without  saying that such political bartering will make the Duma and the  Federation Council more amenable to the proposed cancellation of  the next presidential election. There is also an assumption  that no political party is yet really prepared for a  presidential campaign and thus might have an interest in  postponing it (apart, perhaps, from the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia and its leader, who are rapidly losing ground and  realize that delay could be fatal). But so far, it seems, there  has not been a sympathetic response in parliament to Shumeyko's  initiative. Boris Fedorov, chairman of the "12 December"  faction, has already stated that he does not intend to prolong  his deputy's powers beyond the term laid down by the  Constitution. In an interview in IZVESTIYA, Communist leader  Gennadiy Zyuganov was even more categorical: "I believe that  the situation in Russia has gone beyond the urgent stage. We  cannot wait until 1995 for elections, let alone 1996."    The implementation of Shumeyko's proposal will require the  amemdment of Section Two, Paragraph Seven of the Constitution,  which lays down that "the Federation Council, First Convocation,  and the State Duma, First Convocation, are elected for a term of  two years." However, that does not bother the upper chamber  speaker. Even if it is necessary to hold a referendum to amend  the relevant articles of the Constitution so as to cancel the  elections, Shumeyko told journalists, that referendum will be  far cheaper than the cost of an election campaign.    How will this latest attempt to skimp on democracy end?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The government on Tuesday  [15 February] adopted a fiscal investment and loan program for  fiscal 1994 that gives higher priority to resuscitating the  ailing economy and upgrading living standards. Ordinary "zaito"  investment programs mainly to finance public works, housing  projects and lending by government-affiliated financial organs  were allocated 39,408.2 billion yen for the year beginning April  1, up 7.7 percent from the initial fiscal 1993 zaito budget.    The Finance Ministry eventually agreed to add 260.3 billion  yen to its draft ordinary zaito program worth 39,147.9 billion  yen in negotiations with other government ministries and  agencies on restoring cuts in their initial requests.    The upward revision focused on a record 630,000 home  purchases covered by lending by the government-affiliated  Housing Loan Corp. This compared with 550,000 homes in the  initial fiscal 1993 budget and 560,000 in the fiscal 1994 draft  budget.    In order to improve living standards in line with Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's policy goal, the government secured  a sharp 25.0 percent rise to 10,386.5 billion yen in  housing-related projects. It earmarked 5,994.5 billion yen for  lending and other programs for struggling small companies, up  10.4 percent.    Outlays of 7,949.4 billion yen, up 12.2 percent, went to  local public organizations and local public financial  institutions to improve infrastructure related to living  standards in regional areas.    Next year's zaito, often called the second national budget,  was endorsed by a cabinet meeting Tuesday morning, and is  expected to be submitted to the Diet in early March, together  with the general-account budget. Overall zaito investment, or  the sum including programs managed by the Finance Ministry's  trust fund bureau, total 47,858.2 billion yen, up 4.6 percent.    The 7.7 percent growth in ordinary zaito investment compares  with a 13.4 percent gain in fiscal 1993 and a 10.8 percent rise  in fiscal 1992. But including fiscal investment newly approved  under the economy-boosting third supplementary budget for the  current year, ending March 31, ordinary zaito programs will  total 40,403.1 billion yen for a marked growth of 10.4 percent.    The extra zaito program for this year should be combined  with  next year's program as a way to ensure continued implementation  for 15 months from January 1994, an official at the Finance  Ministry's budget bureau said.    The zaito program is intended to stimulate the economy for  the fourth consecutive year, the official said. Of the parts of  the program related to housing, the government budgeted a sharp  29.8 percent increase to 8,963.2 billion yen for the Housing  Loan Corp., compared with a 6.6 percent gain in the current year.    Housing investment for fiscal 1994 represents a record 33.51  percent of the total ordinary zaito program, compared with the  previous record rate of 32.6 percent in fiscal 1991.    Programs to assist financially squeezed small companies  include a 10.6 percent gain to 3 trillion yen for the People's  Finance Corp. and a 12.5 percent rise to 2,487 billion yen for  the Japan Finance Corp. for Small Business.    A 15.6 percent growth to 156.0 billion yen was allocated for  lending by the Japan Development Bank for manufacturers striving  to create new businesses under restructuring efforts.    The Development Bank's lending quota was set at 620 billion  yen for urban infrastructure improvement projects, up 9.9  percent, and 277 billion yen for information and  telecommunications infrastructure, up 20.4 percent.    The government earmarked outlays of 6.5 trillion yen for a  growth of 14.0 percent in order to improve sewerage systems,  waste disposal and health facilities.    Fiscal investment and loan programs for housing, health,  culture, education and other matters designed to improve overall  living standards account for a record 73.16 percent of the total  ordinary zaito program, up from the current year's 68.8 percent  and the previous high of 71.4 percent in fiscal 1991.    The zaito program contains 2 trillion yen in stock  investment  under new "shiteitan" accounts, a portfolio with no investment  limits on stocks, down from 2.8 trillion yen. New shiteitan  were created in 1992 as a means to bolster the stagnant stock  market.</p>

GaAs MMIC is desirable for high frequency applications in  which high output and high effective power are needed such as  mobile and satellite communications. For these reasons, the gate  pattern is narrowed from 0.5 m to 0.35 m. The  characteristics which made it possible to succeed with 0.35  m  level phase shift exposure technology are:    /m(1) Employment of shifter with sharp edge formation    /m(2) Optimization of shifter placement    /m(3) Optimization of image reversal resist process    By employing an edge model phase shifter, when the shifter  is  in position (figure 1(a)), it reverses the light phase on the  mask, and the phase shift of oscillation width of passing light  is reversed at the right and left of the shifter edge (figure 1  (b)). When this image is formed on a wafer, light intensity at  the shifter edge becomes almost zero (figure 1 (c)), and a  minute dark area is transferred as a pattern, thus a 0.35 m  pattern is formed.    In optimization of shifter formation and shifter placement,  the width of the shifter was set to over 5 m on the mask,  thickness of the shifter was set 4000 +/- 450 Angstroms, and the  angle of shifter edge was set 90 +/- 20 , so that  asymmetrical pattern due to aberrations of projection lens was  controlled.    Also although traditionally in formation of high output GaAs  MMIC gate electrodes, recess etching in active layer, gate metal  vapor adhesion, and recess model gate by a lift off process  using an organic solvent were employed, a resist pattern  process, which works well for formation of overhang as well as  an effective organic solvent, were needed. For this reason a  reverse image resist process, which can obtain a negative in  order to form a minute small dark area by edge model phase  shift, was developed. Formation of a stable 0.35 m level  recess gate was realized.    In this process, tolerance of over 2 m focus is  obtained  in pattern dimensions of 0.35 +/- 0.05 m, and the value for  the dimensions is 3 _s_  0.03m which is quite  comfortable for mass production.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-45A>           Figure 1.

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs strongly to new record Wall Street After a hesitant start, US share prices rocketed further into record territory yesterday amid strong demand for cyclical stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored yet another all-time high, finishing 44.74 stronger at 3,865.51. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended at a new record peak, adding 5.37 at 475.27, although the American SE composite finished 0.71 off at 478.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 3.75 at 786.69. New York SE trading volume totalled 319.5m shares. Although the market stuttered at the opening bell, sending prices lower in the first hour, the buying that pushed the leading indices to record highs last week quickly materialised again. By mid-morning the Dow and the S&amp;P were in positive territory, with demand concentrated mostly on stocks sensitive to the economic cycle. Analysts again attributed the buying, which picked up strongly in the afternoon, to institutions putting to work the cash they received from investors in the new year. The money flows were sufficiently strong to offset yesterday's decline in bond prices, which pushed long-term interest rates up to 6.23 per cent. Among individual issues, automotive stocks were particularly strong as investors anticipated continued demand for cars and trucks. Chrysler appreciated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 3/4 , Ford Motor put on Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 67 1/4 and General Motors, aided by an analyst's upgrade, added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4 . Other cyclicals that were firmer included United Technologies, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64, International Paper, Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 73 5/8 , and Alcoa, Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 74 1/8 . The latest development in the bid battle for Paramount Communications - last Friday's announced merger between Blockbuster and Viacom and their new, revised offer for Paramount - left investors unimpressed. Paramount fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 77 1/4 , Viacom 'B' shares dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 38, Blockbuster eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 and QVC Network, which still has the highest bid on the table, shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 . Canada After Friday's pause, Toronto share prices resumed their recent advance with a solid gain that moved the TSE 300 index to a record high, helped by a strong bond market. The Bank of Canada's key lending rate is expected to fall five to seven basis points at its weekly setting today to below 4 per cent for the first time since summer 1963. The index ended 32.5 ahead at 4,453.2, while rises outnumbered declines by 459 to 354. Further heavy volume of 71.4m shares was recorded. The financial services group led the way with a rise of 1.78 per cent.</p>

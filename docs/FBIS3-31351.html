			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by D.J.: "Boka Is Also Serbian"] </F>   [Text] If Montenegro secedes from Serbia, the Convention of  Boka is determined to start the process of unification with the  other Serbian lands. This would be done first with Herzegovina  and therefore with Serbia, and would provide Serbia with access  to the sea. This would in fact represent the reassessment of  the decision on the unification of Boka with Montenegro.    These are the first words of the Declaration of the Boka  Convention, which was distributed to the media yesterday,  bearing the signature of Convention chairman Slobodan Panovic.  The Convention demands that the ruling party, the Democratic  Party of Socialists, put a stop to separatist forces -- as the  declaration says -- first in their own ranks.    Serbian Boka will follow and cooperate with the conventions  of Vasojevici, Zeta, old [Stara] Herzegovina, and the Raska  region [Sandzak] on the achievement of the Serbian national  program. We demand that the Montenegrin bodies inaugurate 26  November 1918 as a public holiday, the date of the unification  of Serbia and Montenegro. The Boka Convention demands a change  in the attitude of the Republic of Montenegro toward this region.</p>

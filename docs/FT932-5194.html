			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Saudis in row over pilgrimage SAUDI Arabia, Iran and Libya continued to trade insults yesterday over the conduct of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca which historically has brought to the surface political tensions among the Moslem nations of the Middle East. Iran again this year attempted to defy the Saudi authorities by using the Haj to stage demonstrations denouncing the US and Israel. Saudi Arabia yesterday hit back at Iranian reports of a mass demonstration outside Mecca, describing it as an attempt by extremists to undermine relations between the two countries. Television in Iran had shown hundreds of pilgrims chanting anti-American slogans and claimed that Saudi riot police had surrounded the demonstrators. Libya also kept up its denunciation of Saudi Arabia for refusing to allow its aircraft to fly pilgrims to Mecca, an action taken to comply with UN sanctions imposed as a result of Libya's alleged involvement in the destruction of a Pan-Am airliner over Scotland. In a bizarre twist at the weekend, Libya sent nearly 200 pilgrims to visit religious sites in Jerusalem.</p>

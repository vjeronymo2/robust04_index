			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Maxwell probe urged by MPs MPs yesterday called for an official investigation into revelations that a web of private companies linked to the Maxwell family survives, apparently beyond the reach of administrators, while pensioners face the loss of benefits. Pensioners expressed outrage at the disclosure in yesterday's Financial Times that the companies, some controlled from the secretive tax haven of Liechtenstein, were still trading and were apparently beyond the reach of administrators and creditors of the Maxwell empire. As the political controversy surrounding the looting of more than Pounds 400m from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's businesses looked set to erupt again, Mr Kevin Maxwell, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication Corporation was yesterday working in the London office of a Liechtenstein-controlled company with links to the Maxwell family. The listed four-storey building off Ludgate Hill in the City of London was rented over a month ago on behalf of Sphere Inc, a California computer games publisher which expects to have a turnover of Dollars 20m (Pounds 11m) this year. Mr Robert Maxwell, who died last November, bought an 80 per cent stake in the company, a stake which is held by the Maxwell Charitable Trust in Liechtenstein. Mr Kevin Maxwell refused to comment yesterday. At the House of Commons, Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the cross-party social security select committee in the last parliament, said the revelations reinforced the case for re-establishing the committees, which were dissolved before the election, as soon as possible. Mr Field said: 'It's an incredible form of privatisation, that a public body with the staff to look into these areas is dependent on the FT's doing it for us.' He said the news also raised the question of what other companies might be beyond the reach of creditors and the pensioners. Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP and formerly a member of the social security committee, said there should clearly be a 'full investigation by the Bank of England, the government or parliament' into the relationship between the UK-based Maxwell businesses and those controlled in Liechtenstein. Mr Shaw has put down a parliamentary question asking Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, to trace Maxwell pension monies and Maxwell company assets to Liechtenstein and other countries outside the control of the UK. Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, pressed further his call for a government statement on the plight of the Maxwell pensioners. The government is expected to announce next week a review of pension law. Mr Doug Bristow, a Maxwell pensions campaigner, said of the disclosures: 'I am sickened and staggered that the Maxwell heirs can still get their hands on huge amounts of money around the world, when the people who are really owed it haven't got a hope in hell of seeing a penny of it.' Roughly half of that scheme's 10,000 members face a 70 per cent cut in benefits from next month, and others who are deferred pensioners risk losing their entire pension benefits. Mr Kenneth Trench, who heads the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said the latest revelations underscore his group's argument that the government has an obligation to compensate pensioners whose benefits have been slashed. 'Why weren't regulators as suspicious as we were?' Mr Trench said. 'All we're going to do now is to go for compensation,' he added. Fivetell, one of more than 270 companies in which Mr Kevin Maxwell holds directorships, is being examined by investigators trying to find assets outside the control of the administrators. Documents at Companies House also reveal a company called Panlor, created last December, six weeks after Mr Robert Maxwell's death. The shareholders and beneficiaries are Laura and Pandora Maxwell, the wives of Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell respectively, the two directors. Secret London office, Page 8</p>

			<p>920824 FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: NBC exposure to O&amp;Y rises to CDollars 500m NATIONAL BANK of Canada said its exposure to Olympia &amp; York Developments and related companies rose from CDollars 473m (USDollars 400.8m) to CDollars 500m in the third quarter. It has made total provisions of CDollars 350m against these loans, including about CDollars 200m in the latest quarter. Mr Andre Berard, chairman, said the bank's provisions for loan losses in the fourth quarter would be at normal levels and he expected the bank to show a small net profit. The bank has tightened up lending practices and its core business in Canada continues strong. The extra provisions brought a loss of Dollars 118m, or Dollars 1 a share, in the third quarter ended July 31 against a profit of Dollars 39m, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Loss for nine months was Dollars 38m, or 52 cents a share, against a profit of Dollars 145m, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>

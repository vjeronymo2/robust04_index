			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Augusto Pinochet, Army commander in </F> chief, by Cristian Bofill in Santiago on 6 April]    [Excerpts] Welcoming QUE PASA into his spacious office on  the fourth floor of the Armed Forces Building late in the  morning of 6 April, General Augusto Pinochet seemed anxious to  give the impression that he was uninvolved in the crisis that  had erupted the previous day in the big building that can be  seen from his office window. No matter how hard he tries to hide  it, however, he knows that everyone is aware of his key role in  these events. When he occupied the choicest office at La Moneda,  he was instrumental in the first chapter of the current  imbroglio, which culminated with the resignation of General  Cesar Mendoza. Now, given the weight his opinion carries in the  Armed Forces, he has a monumental influence on what happens in  the crisis that has placed General Rodolfo Stange's head on the  block. The general had agreed to this interview before the  crisis broke, and it was supposed to focus on the release of the  second part of Volume 3 of his memoirs and on his current  concerns. In the event, however, the general revealed some  valuable hints about his position on this new chapter. He also  discussed a number of other issues, such as his relations with  the current government, his conversations with Margaret  Thatcher, and the wasted opportunity to privatize the Copper  Corporation (Codelco).    [Bofill] When you were president, the case of the beheadings  came to light, and the solution adopted was the departure of  Cesar Mendoza, then director general of the Carabineros. Do you  think that the same thing should be done now with Gen. Rodolfo  Stange?    [Pinochet] I did not oust Gen. Mendoza. That case led to a  series of problems that raised many obstacles. The general chose  to tender his resignation and to clear the way for the removal  of obstacles. It was his decision.    [Bofill] Did you suggest to him at that time that he obey  his  conscience, as the current government has done in the case of  Gen. Stange?    [Pinochet] To tell someone to obey his conscience, you have  to be rather monastic, rather...ascetic.    [Bofill] Why?    [Pinochet] Because you cannot have a devil selling crosses.  It is like having a sinful person tell another person not to  commit sins. There is a reason why Christ said that he who was  without sin should cast the first stone, and no one threw any  stones. What we have now is a whole lot of Pharisees casting the  first stone. That has to be examined very closely. This problem  is very deep; it has other facets.    [Bofill] What other facets?    [Pinochet] There is a trial that has not finished yet. It is  in progress. The final word has not been spoken. As I said, you  have to look at other facets. As for the comparison with the  case of Gen. Mendoza, this is quite different. Mendoza, who  wanted to clear up matters, was a member of the Military Junta.  He was in the government. But now Gen. Stange is only director  general of the Carabineros. He does not have any government  responsibilities, as the other general did.    [Bofill] Aside from that difference, do you believe that  Gen.  Stange should step down?    [Pinochet] That is up to him. I cannot tell him whether he  should resign. I do not know. I cannot get into Gen. Stange's  head.    [Bofill] It is known that Gen. Stange has talked to you and  asked for your opinion. What did you tell him?    [Pinochet] You are wrong. I have not talked to Gen. Stange  about this matter.    [Bofill] But you do, at least, admit that you have talked  about it with Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma?    [Pinochet] What I have talked about with the defense  minister  are matters related to the Army and the ministry. We have talked  about the military missions and the visits he plans to make to  Army units. I have not discussed this issue with either Gen.  Stange or the defense minister.    [Bofill] Does that mean that your position on the matter  will  be made public only if the government convenes the National  Security Council to propose the retirement of Gen. Stange?    [Pinochet] In my opinion, it should think more than twice  before convening the National Security Council. In the first  place, it is questionable whether this case falls within the  purview of the National Security Council.    [Bofill] But that is the legal mechanism the government has  available to it to bring about the retirement of Stange or of  the commanders in chief of the other branches.    [Pinochet] Yes, that is the legal mechanism. But it should  think twice before using it, because it is an extreme measure.  You go to the National Security Council after numerous events  have taken place, and once you get there, that is the end of the  line. Everything ends there. That is why I say it is an extreme  measure.    [Bofill] For that same reason, would it not be a good idea  to  go right away to the National Security Council to bring the  matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible?    [Pinochet] The problem lies in what I pointed out earlier:  The situation should be studied very thoroughly, and everything  should be considered several times before making a decision,  because first it must be determined whether this is a matter for  the Council to deal with. I will not tell you what my position  is, but I do want to make it very clear that this problem must  be analyzed through and through.    [Bofill] Supposing that the National Security Council is  ultimately convened. How would you vote?    [Pinochet] That will be revealed at the time of the vote.    [Bofill] When there were problems between the Army and La  Moneda in the previous administration, there were some very  tense times, such as the liaison exercise and the so-called  boinazo [display of force by the military in May  1993]. Do you think similar situations could occur now between  the Carabineros and the current administration?    [Pinochet] I cannot tell you anything about the current  situation in the Carabineros. What I want to make very clear is  that during the previous administration, the Army always  respected the law that was in effect at the time. On the other  hand, I think that the periods of good relations far outweigh  those that you have mentioned, and in any case, they were  resolved satisfactorily.    [Bofill] With regard to the human rights cases involving the  Army, what problems do you see in the future?    [Pinochet] I do not see any problem in the future. The  normal  course of action is being taken. The majority of the cases have  qualified for amnesty. What problem could there be?    [Bofill] The case of General Manuel Contreras, for example.    [Pinochet] And why will there be a problem in that case? He  had his trial, the case is on appeal, and ultimately a final  judgment will be forthcoming. I do not see any hindrance. The  courts are handling pending human rights cases, and that is the  branch of government that will make the final decision, and that  decision, of course, will be respected.    [Bofill] Many people say you seem more serene than before,  and they say it is due to....    [Pinochet] (Laughing) Due to my age, no doubt.    [Bofill] Some may think that. But the majority say it is  because you have good relations with the new government,  especially with Minister Perez Yoma.    [Pinochet] There are several things going on there. I like  to  see military matters treated as military matters, without  interference from people who want to insert issues that are of  concern to people who know nothing about the military. Things  must be viewed with professionalism.    [Bofill] Does that mean that former Minister Patricio Rojas  knew nothing about the military?    [Pinochet] No, I am referring to people. What I am saying is  that I see a difference in the approach. Now, issues are dealt  with, they are discussed, and ideas and concepts are seen with  precision. It is very clear what actions will be taken. I see  that difference. For me, it is very important for issues to be  dealt with properly. I have been in the military for 62 years,  and I have held every job. I have a lot of experience, and that  is very valuable for a commander in chief.    [Bofill] There has been a lot of talk about a number of  signs  that you are more in sync with this government. One of them is  the fact that your wife recently attended a reception at La  Moneda, where she had not set foot in four years.    [Pinochet] Our visit to La Moneda was a friendly gesture.  [passage omitted]    [Bofill] Getting back to the previous administration, did  the  contact you had during that period with Socialists such as  former Minister Enrique Correa change your opinion of that  political sector?    [Pinochet] I do not want to get into that, because it is a  political matter. I will answer questions about the Army. I must  be extremely prudent about this.    [Bofill] One of the most controversial issues involving the  Army recently was the departure of General Jorge Ballerino....    [Pinochet] That is a very simple problem. Gen. Ballerino was  10,000 kilometers away, and he saw the situation from a  different perspective. Gen. Lucar was able to remain one more  year in the job of vice commander in chief, which blocked the  way for Gen. Ballerino. So he had to remain in the post of  inspector general of the Army, which is the same as the chief of  staff or the commander of the First Corps, because they all come  under me. But someone butted in and gave him bad advice, and,  well, everyone knows how things turned out.    [Bofill] Who was it who butted in and gave him bad advice?    [Pinochet] Someone. [passage omitted]    [Bofill] You do acknowledge that you had problems with the  United States.    [Pinochet] No one has behaved more badly toward us than the  Americans did during our time in government. I will always  remember that. Today I refuse to buy as much as a rifle from the  United States, because tomorrow I may have a problem and they  will not give me ammunition. [passage omitted]    [Bofill] One issue that is in the forefront throughout the  world at this time is corruption. Can you say for certain that  during the 17 years you were in power, not a single high-ranking  official abused his office for some purpose?    [Pinochet] I never had any complaints about my officials,  with very few exceptions. And when I did have a complaint, I had  the official investigated. The officials in my government, first  of all, earned less than they do now, and people worked more for  the good of Chile than for their own good. I had very dedicated  mayors, and I had officials who could have earned 20 times more  working for a bank than for the government.    [Bofill] That is all very well, but human weaknesses do not  recognize ideological or political borders. Why do you think the  corruption issue is so hot now?    [Pinochet] Well, because people want to own more things. And  television and advertising undoubtedly contribute to that.  Everyone wants to have a nice car, a nice house, a nice swimming  pool, they want to have a good time, go to a nice place and be  served a good whisky. Those things do not tempt me.  Unfortunately, I do not drink, not even copper [yo no tomo ni  cobre]...    [Bofill] All of these temptations that you mention are  seductive not only to civilians, but also to military men. To  what extent are the low salaries in the Armed Forces a dangerous  factor in the spread of corruption?    [Pinochet] Look, it might be dangerous, but we take steps to  make sure our men are well off. They are able to go on very  inexpensive vacations, something that other people have to spend  much more on. They wear uniforms, so they do not have to spend  money on civilian clothing if they do not want to...I will not  tell you they are not asking for raises--they do ask. The cost  of living has gone up a lot, more than the CPI. You used to be  able to fill your cart, buy a whole week's groceries at the  store for 1,000 pesos. Now that does not buy enough for two  days, not even one. They are asking for raises to cover  necessities, but this is not a problem that can affect us in the  sense that your question implies.    [Bofill] One of the great contradictions that people mention  about your government was that it never privatized Codelco. Why  not? Do you think that if that had been done, scandals like the  current one could have been avoided?    [Pinochet] I do not buy the notion that scandals happen only  in state-run companies. Scandals happen with or without  privatization.    [Bofill] But why did you not privatize Codelco as you did  with so many other state-run companies?    [Pinochet] In the first place, because it was important for  national defense. It was thought that we needed to have all the  copper in our hands. Later on, however, I favored privatizing  it. What happened was that internal factions formed in  opposition to it, and even though it was a good idea, I could  not do it.    [Bofill] You were in charge of this country. There were a  lot  of other things that people opposed, but you did them anyway....    [Pinochet] Well, there are things and there are things. As I  said, if it were just up to me, Codelco would be in private  hands right now. Do not forget that I was not alone. A number of  steps had to be followed to privatize a company, and that was  the idea. In the northern section, the southern section. It did  not just happen. You cannot do everything.    [Bofill] Former President Aylwin had a problem with the  Codelco scandal that has affected you as well: seeing relatives  involved in scandals. In your case, it was the matter of your  eldest son's checks. How does that affect you?    [Pinochet] I think it is a great injustice, because people  immediately connect it with the person who is at the top. In the  case of my son's checks, it was concluded that he was telling  the truth. People kept the issue alive because I was commander  in chief. The goal was to attack the commander in chief.    [Bofill] Is that kind of problem more difficult to face than  others?    [Pinochet] (Smiling slyly and touching his left hand with  the  tips of his right fingers) In time, you develop a thick skin.  You learn how to confront these things. I have the hide of a  crocodile.    [Bofill] Do you think former President Aylwin does, too?    [Pinochet] Do not get me involved in that.    [Bofill] Is it true you plan to travel to Russia?    [Pinochet] I will tell you a story. I was invited to Russia,  before Yeltsin assumed power. The people who brought me the  invitation were right there where you are sitting and in the  chair across from you. But later they came back and asked me to  please postpone the trip for a little while because everyone was  in the KGB. There was a woman who controlled them with her  glance. Then the Yeltsin problem arose, and I did not have  anything more to do with them. Since then, I have not accepted  any invitations. But of course I would like to visit Russia, a  country with a long history, and I like history a lot. [passage  omitted]</p>

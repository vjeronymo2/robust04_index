			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Nuclear plant gets safety extension NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned power company, was yesterday given permission by safety inspectors for the first time to extend to three years the operating periods between statutory shutdowns at an advanced gas-cooled reactor. Permission has been granted for the Hartlepool AGR three years after Nuclear Electric applied to extend the statutory period there from two years. The Health and Safety Executive said the extension marked a significant change in the operation of nuclear power reactors. Since licensing began in 1960 all power reactors have been subject to statutory shutdowns every two years. Nuclear Electric, which operates nuclear plants in England and Wales, hopes for similar extensions at its other four AGRs. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said Nuclear Electric was trading off economics for safety. Faults would go undetected for longer, it said. Nuclear Electric said safety was a priority and the case to the HSE 'took full account of our own stringent safety requirements'. A typical safety shutdown at an AGR lasted 10 weeks and cost about Pounds 20m, including lost sales of electricity.</p>

The British Indian Ocean Territory, considered to be of  "outstanding international conservation importance", includes  the strategically important Diego Garcia base, the only US  nuclear base in the Indian Ocean.    It failed to appear in the Government's action plan on  biodiversity last week -- drawn up in response to the 'Earth  Summit' in Rio -- despite featuring in a draft version.    The territory lies just south of the equator approximately  2,000 miles off the coast of Keyna. It was bought by Britain  from Mauritius for 3 million pounds in 1965. A Royal Navy  detachment is based there and Diego Garcia was the refuelling  point for American B52 bombers attacking Iraq during the Gulf  war.    The territory contains the Great Chagos Bank, the world's  largest atoll, and more than 700 species of fish and sea birds  and over 500 species of hard coral and molluscs.    Friends of the Earth is writing to the Department of the  Environment asking why it has been left out of the conservation  plan.</p>

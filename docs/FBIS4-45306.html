			<p>Traffickers   at 200,000   <F P=102> OW0106160694 Taipei CNA in English 1344 GMT 1 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> OW0106160694 </F> <F P=104>  Taipei CNA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma  Ying-jeou said Wednesday [1 June] that there are 200,000 drug  abusers and traffickers in Taiwan, and that the drug problem on  the island has reached an alarming state.    Ma, speaking to the press two days before a national  anti-drug conference is set to start, said, that although the  supply and use of amphetamines had dropped 20 percent in the  first four months this year, the first such decrease since 1990,  the supply and use of heroin has increased 66 percent.    Despite the jump in heroin use, though, he claimed that  illicit drugs are reportedly in short supply--a sign that the  war on drugs declared by Premier Lien Chan last year has begun  to show results.    Ma reported that the supply of drugs was at its highest  level  last year, when law enforcement authorities seized 1,110  kilograms of heroin and 3,375 kilograms of amphetamines.    He said 47,000 inmates in Taiwan prisons last year, or 31  percent of the prison population, were in for drug-related  crimes. The figure was several times that of the past few  years, he said, adding that drug-related crimes have taken  precedence over theft and robbery.    Speaking on the strategy to combat the drug problem, Ma said  the Justice Ministry would draft a law to prevent drug kingpins  from laundering drug money, and will target specific age groups  in its anti-drug drive.    Statistics show that 30 percent of drug-related crimes in  the  first four months this year were committed by people aged  between 12 and 24 years old.</p>

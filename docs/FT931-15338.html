			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Russian minister attacks price curbs MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's new deputy prime minister for economics and finance, was yesterday trying to persuade Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin to reverse controversial price curbs which he described as impracticable and politically inappropriate. Mr Fyodorov, in Washington when the curbs were adopted last week, said he believed Mr Chernomyrdin had been 'misled' by other advisers in taking a decision 'contrary to market reform'. The government ordered enterprises to restrict their profit margins to 10-25 per cent, widening the scope of existing restrictions. 'Economically speaking, it is not possible to implement. . . from the political point of view, it is just wrong,' Mr Fyodorov said in Moscow. 'We will fight to neutralise it or repeal it for good.' He was later due to meet Mr Chernomyrdin. Mr Fyodorov, 35, revealed he would propose measures next week for 'further reform, make the rouble stronger, and stabilise the situation'. This would include a sharp rise in interest rates, measures to try to stop the rouble being spurned in favour of the dollar as a means of payment within Russia, and promote a bond market to help finance the budget deficit. He would also propose creation of escrow accounts in Russian-owned banks abroad, such as Moscow Narodny in London. These would hold a portion of profits from Russian enterprises in hard currency, giving foreign investors the guarantees they sought, while enabling the Russian authorities to monitor the flow of capital in and out of Russia. Asked if he was intruding into areas previously managed by the central bank, he claimed the central bank was failing to defend the national currency. 'The central bank cannot operate in a vacuum. The government has a certain priority. If the central bank were fulfilling its function, we would not worry. But if it is not, then I have to worry,' he said, promising to take his case to the public if necessary. 'If the rouble rate falls and inflation increases, people should know it is because the central bank is not performing its role.' 'I believe that without a strong rouble it is not possible to stop a fall in production and living standards.' He was against the indexation of enterprises' working capital carried out until now by the central bank and finance ministry. Money should instead be spent on social security payments for those in need or who stood to lose their jobs as enterprises closed. He wanted to ensure the central bank 'did not interfere' in areas such as industrial production, which it has sought to prop up by providing cheap credit for struggling state enterprises.</p>

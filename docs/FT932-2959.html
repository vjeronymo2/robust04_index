			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (5): Agreement welcomed by Maori people - Improvements in race relations THE government achieved a significant breakthrough towards settling long-standing Maori grievances this year when it gave financial backing to a deal which helped Maori tribes buying a half share in the country's biggest fishing company, Sealord. The grievances date back to the early days of British colonisation; for generations, the Maoris have claimed that the British, and successive New Zealand governments did not honour the 1840 pact between both sides, the Treaty of Waitangi. Both National and Labour governments have worked hard over the last decade at settling these problems. The Waitangi Tribunal was established to try to settle disputes particularly relating to land and fishing matters with the aim of finalising all grievances by the year 2000. However, the tribunal is not supposed to concern itself with land now owned by Europeans, and pessimists suggest there will be ongoing problems in the years ahead. While some of the tribunal's decisions have been unpopular with some sections of the European community, there is widespread support with the view that the matters be dealt with promptly. There is also an acceptance that, in the past, the Maori people were unfairly treated, especially in land matters. In the 1860s, for example, large tracts of valuable Waikato land was confiscated by the government at the end of the so-called 'Maori land wars.' The problem was that the areas taken were top-quality farm land confiscated from Maori tribes who had supported the government. The dissident tribes were left with their poorer quality land. THE Sealord deal, which cost the government Dollars 175m, followed a Waitangi Tribunal ruling last year that Maori tribes were entitled to the deep sea fish resource around the South Island. Prompted by South Island tribes, the government entered negotiations which allowed them to acquire a 50 per cent stake in Sealord, which controls about 25 per cent of the national fishing quota and most of the valuable hoki fish resource. Brierley Investments bought the remaining 50 per cent. Earnings from the company will be shared around Maori tribes by a special commission. In spite of some initial squabbling between different tribal groups, the Maori people have now welcomed the agreement, which it is hoped will lead to greater employment opportunities for a group which has been particularly badly hit by the protracted recession. Unemployment problems are particularly acute among younger Maori people and, as a consequence, they out-number other races in jail. The government and other agencies, including Maori people, are working hard at solving these problems through promoting education and raising Maori pride. The aim, according to the Minister of Justice Doug Graham is to ensure that the work of the tribunal will not only have the effect of improving race relations, but help lift the Maori people out of the dependency mode 'where they have been for much too long.'</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRS IS STILL JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service will keep its toll-free telephone lines open  through this afternoon to help taxpayers rushing to meet the midnight Monday  deadline for filing 1989 tax returns.  </P> <P> The IRS said Friday that telephoned tax questions also will be answered into  the evening Monday.  </P> <P> Numbers to call are listed in the instructions for filling out Forms 1040,  1040A and 1040EZ.  </P> <P> Taxpayers with touch-tone telephone service may use the IRS Tele-Tax lines 24  hours a day. Tele-Tax is a system of tape-recorded explanations of more than  140 specific topics, including pensions, dependents and the child-care credit.  Phone numbers and topics also are listed in the IRS instructions.  </P> <P> The IRS expects one of every five tax returns to be filed next week -- 23  million out of 111 million due this year. Four of every five returns have been  qualifying for refunds.  </P> <P> Those who wait until the final hours to file will have to wait another eight  weeks or so before receiving any refund. When a return is filed on time, the  IRS is required by law to pay interest on any refund that is not paid within 45  days.  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: NFC's logistic success set to survive pension fund glitch - The company's record is strong Companies announcing results when their shares are touching an all-time high are prone to accidents. NFC, the transport and logistics company that changed its name from National Freight Consortium, learnt this lesson on Wednesday. NFC's 3 per cent profits decline to Pounds 91m for the year to October 3 was expected, given recession in its main markets. But a much higher than expected Pounds 14.5m pension fund credit led some analysts to question the company's real underlying earnings growth. 'NFC is a very high quality company with one of the best managements in the marketplace,' according to Mr Ian Wild of BZW. 'Over the long term it should realise quite a lot of potential. The worry is whether it realises its full potential,' he said. The shares, which stood at 284p before the announcement, have been slipping ever since and closed yesterday at 256p. Mr James Watson, chairman, admitted the company had not 'done our PR very well'. 'It was the surprise of it and we've got to say we're sorry,' he said. But he rejected suggestions about the quality of the company's earnings. He said most of the pension credit was taken in NFC's transport division, where it was almost cancelled out by restructuring costs. The incident was unfortunate, and probably accelerated an overdue bout of profit-taking. But it does not raise doubts about more significant, longer term changes at NFC - its success within logistics and moves overseas. NFC has developed rapidly since its Pounds 53.5m employee-led buy out from the government in 1982. The previously dominant transport division, which offered vehicle hire and transport services through BRS and Lynx, has been overtaken in terms of profits and employees by logistics, which provides warehousing and distribution services under the Exel name to retailers and manufacturers. Meanwhile, NFC is losing its reputation as a bell-wether for the UK economy. Some of its businesses, like truck hire and Allied Pickford home removals, will always be quick into and out of recession. But revenues from long-term contracts, less exposed to the economic cycle, have almost doubled, to about 55 per cent. As NFC has moved into the US and continental Europe, overseas earnings have risen from almost nothing to nearly 40 per cent. Mr Watson is convinced this growth can continue. Logistics services are more developed in the UK than elsewhere, partly because of deregulation and partly because big food retailers like Sainsbury and Tesco, two of NFC's biggest clients, moved to 'just-in-time' delivery and contracted out distribution. Although the process started with food retailers, NFC now provides logistics and warehousing services to non-food retailers, including Marks and Spencer and manufacturers, such as Ford. Mr Watson estimated that in the UK about 50 per cent of the distribution and logistics market had been contracted to specialists. In the US and continental Europe, the figure is closer 10 per cent. NFC is targeting these markets, and spent Pounds 75m last year buying companies and infrastructure. 'Our belief is that the revolution we have seen here in the UK will also happen in Europe and the US,' Mr Watson said. Operating profits from logistics reached Pounds 46.8m last year, compared with Pounds 31.5m two years ago. Investment in the US and Spain is largely complete, although NFC remains weak in other European markets, such as Germany. Profits from the US dipped Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 26m last year, mainly due to one-off reorganisation costs. This compared with profits of Pounds 72.7m in the UK. But the difference is set to narrow, especially if the US recovery continues and the UK remains flat. 'I would be very disappointed if we didn't see a very significant increase in US profitability this year,' Mr Watson said. Attention has now turned to Europe, although NFC is unlikely to spend as much this year as last on new ventures. A sharp rise in gearing from 29 per cent to 55 per cent unnerved some analysts. But NFC employees still hold 45 per cent of the shares, making a rights issue difficult. This suggests gearing will remain high, although interest cover is comfortable at 12.2 times. The company usually gives 'best views' on future profits at its annual meetings in February. Until then, analysts are pencilling in profits of Pounds 100m. Some argue that the pension credit and gearing questions will overshadow the shares further, to about 240p before recovery. But institutions are often underweight in NFC because of the high proportion of employee shareholders. Some institutions may decide last week's share price fall provides a buying opportunity. 'The shares are still not cheap, but after this week's correction they are a strong hold,' one stockbroker said.</p>

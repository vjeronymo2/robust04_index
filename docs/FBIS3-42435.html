			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article based on foreign press materials by Colonel V. </F> Georgiyevich: "Computers and Neurocomputers in Artillery"]    [Text] Creation of neurocomputers "is only  a small part of Pentagon efforts to turn `intelligent' weapons  into weapons of `genius'." From an ABC television  report.    The appearance of precision weapons fundamentally changed  forms of warfare and allowed U.S. specialists to speak of a  genuine S&amp;T revolution in military affairs. The new weapons  required sophisticated control, guidance and navigation systems,  which must function at a rate and with a precision going beyond  human capabilities. Electronics, which under present conditions  is represented by sophisticated computer systems and automated  command and control and weapon control systems, came to man's  aid. Computer technology is the material and S&amp;T basis of  these  systems. In creating it, engineers always dreamed of devices  which would be able to solve not only complex mathematical  problems, but also diverse problems of logic to perfection and  at great speed.    According to military specialists, a considerable gap  presently has formed between the rapid development of missile  and artillery weapons and the increased mobility and striking  power of troops on the one hand and artillery fire control  systems on the other.    With the appearance of third-generation computer technology  in the first half of the 1960's, West German military  specialists began designing automated field artillery fire  control systems, which became operational in the FRG Army as the  Falke automated control system. Substantial deficiencies were  revealed from this system's operation at the battery-battalion  level because of the low degree of automation and imperfection  of equipment being used.    The FRG Ministry of Defense developed and began implementing  a comprehensive program at the end of the 1970's for upgrading  Army command and control and communications systems. New systems  for automated control of tube artillery and MLRS combat  operations also are being introduced within its framework. They  include high-speed, fourth-generation digital computers and  modern gear equipped with microprocessors. The main advantages  of these automated control systems are a minimum reaction time  of artillery subunits to new targets and increased resistance to  jamming, survivability and operating reliability under combat  conditions.    It is proposed to include field artillery automated control  systems in the Army HEROS-1 tactical command and control,  communications and intelligence system. Much attention is being  given to solving the problem of interfacing with similar systems  of other armies. The foreign press notes that FRG automated  artillery control systems also will interwork excellently with  the French ATILA, U.S. AFADTS and British BATES. In the opinion  of military specialists, this will significantly simplify  collection, storage and generalization of intelligence, permit  supporting a broad exchange of information on friendly and enemy  troops, and if necessary enable using allied weapons for  delivering mass strikes against enemy groupings.    New automated systems for control of self-propelled [SP]  artillery battery fire--IFAB, regimental and battalion artillery  fire--ADLER, towed artillery fire--ABACUS, rocket artillery  fire--ARES, artillery target location equipment--AOR,  meteorological support--ATMAS and aerial reconnaissance assets  are being developed within the scope of a program for gradual  development (progressing over time) of the full equipment  complex. We will dwell briefly on the first two.    The IFAB (Integrierte Feurerleitmittel fur Artillerie  Batterien) is intended for calculating settings for fire for  effect and fire control of a battery of M109A36 155-mm SP  howitzers. It consists of the M1136A2 mobile artillery  observation post, mobile fire control post, ground target  acquisition radar, and Aurora, a system for automatically laying  guns on the target.    The IFAB performs tasks of reconnoitering the enemy and  terrain and observing friendly troop operations; reconnoitering  targets and determining their coordinates, nature, size, and  degree of cover and protection; performing a topographic survey  of each battery piece; receiving and transmitting data and  calculating settings for fire for effect; preparing commands for  commencing fire; and automatically laying guns on the target.    In addition, the mobile observation post observes  the battlefield and results of fire, adjusts fire and provides  communications with supported infantry formations. A number of  requirements are placed on the mobile OP depending on the combat  mission to be performed, the main ones being short reaction time  to combat situation changes, determination of target coordinates  with high accuracy (up to 20 m) and in no more than 20-30  seconds, continuous determination of one's position, and  automatic monitoring of the electronic equipment operation.    The main electronic equipment units are an optical target  survey system with built-in laser rangefinder, land navigation  unit, data input/output devices, monitors, radio and intercom.    The optical target survey system is regarded as  the most important assembly of the mobile OP. This is what  supports the computing of angles of gun elevation and deflection  with the help of appropriate encoders. The periscope is coupled  with a laser rangefinder controlled manually or by a knife  switch.    The land navigation unit is intended for measuring  distance covered and for continuously determining the vehicle  heading using a gyroscope and current coordinates of the mobile  OP location. The heading sensor is powered and its signals  processed using the gyroscope's electronic circuits. The  navigational computer converts incoming signals on target  coordinates and performs a topographic survey.    All data necessary for this are input to the control device  and light up on its display.    The data input/output device is a control device  with indicator, keyboard and data transmission equipment. It  supports compilation and storage of all fire control data in the  form of coded messages in a 64-bit format.    The monitors consist of a control unit with  display, an error light and two reflectors. The monitors  automatically perform diagnosis and monitor correctness of  operation of all electronic, electrical and mechanical systems.  Errors and malfunctions in operation of systems as well as  errors arising during data transmission are output in visual and  audible form.    The radio and intercom consist of two transceivers  for communicating with the battery and battalion, a telephone  line for communicating with a forward observer, a radio for  communicating with troops and an intercom for four operators.    The mobile fire control post includes the  commander's control post and data processing post. The mobile  fire control post supports artillery observers' communications  with the tube artillery command post.    The commander's control post is accommodated in a  motor vehicle in which the following are located: Data  input/output devices with buffer storage having a capacity of 64  alphanumeric symbols, radio communications equipment, and a  place reserved for the ADLER automated control system terminal  device.    The data processing post is outfitted in a tracked  M113CAI APC and equipped with the Falke (Falcon) TP-84 computer,  dot matrix printers, data input/output devices, a teletype,  communications equipment and monitoring equipment.    The computer has an internal memory size of 32,000 18-bit  words and a speed up to 200,000 operations per second.    The ground target acquisition radar is one of the  main components of the automated control system and is designed  for collecting and processing intelligence on enemy ground  targets.    Information comes to the mobile fire control post and is  communicated to appropriate artillery subunits using all the  ADLER system command and control equipment.    RATAC and RASIT radars also are included in the FRG Army set  of technical reconnaissance equipment. It is planned to install  these radars in aircraft, helicopters and special tethered  platforms to increase their effective range.    The Aurora autonomous automatic laying system was  developed to determine location and automatically lay guns on a  target in accordance with fire control post data. Therefore the  guns are outfitted with navigational equipment and a gyrocompass.    Repeated surveys are made when firing against moving  targets,  and the fire control post computer automatically makes  corrections to commands for commencing fire.    Use of the Aurora system permits a significant reduction in  the time it takes for occupying battery firing positions and for  commencing fire when moving on a march, and permits a  substantial improvement in fire accuracy.  <H5>  Analysis of IFAB Automated Control System Functioning </H5>   In accordance with the authorized German Army organization,  an artillery regiment consists of three battalions of M109A36  155-mm SP howitzers (18 guns), a composite battalion of M110A2  203-mm SP howitzers and H70 155-mm towed howitzers (36 guns),  and a battalion with 16 110-mm LARS launchers, to which 240-mm  MLRS launchers will be introduced additionally.    Military specialists and the Bundeswehr leadership state  that  each M109A36 155-mm SP howitzer is equipped with the DEA24A data  input/output device for the gun commander, DA8A receiving  display device for the gunner and DA12A display for the loader.  Thus, a closed SP artillery fire control system is formed at the  battery level which includes an artillery mobile armored OP,  fire control post and gun.    It is believed that such a system acquires very great  importance in connection with the planned reorganization of  6-gun batteries into 9-gun batteries. It is presumed that each  gun platoon (4 and 5 guns) will have its own control post, which  will allow it to operate autonomously and substantially reduce  the likelihood of damage from enemy fire. It is pointed out that  the reaction time until counterbattery fire commences will be  reduced fourfold.    The ADLER (Artillerie-Daten-Lage und Einsatz-Rechnerverbund)  system is intended for preparation of firing data for tactical  employment of artillery, for communications with higher field  artillery command and control entities, and for supporting  interworking with the HEROS-1 tactical battle management,  intelligence and communications system and with field artillery  automated control systems of the U.S., British and French armies.    It has been under development under Bundeswehr order by the  firm of Elektrik System Gesellschaft (ESG) since the middle of  1985.    While all IFAB, ABACUS and ARES battery fire control  equipment is intended for improving accuracy and reducing time  of preparing battery fire, ADLER equipment is used at the  battalion-field level and must provide swift, comprehensive data  evaluation and constant battlefield situation display and  promptly monitor OP work using electronic data processing.    The technical level of all elements of the ADLER automated  control system permits not only accelerating the performance of  large-scale fire missions, but also economizing on ammunition  while simultaneously increasing the number of targets engaged.    U.S. and FRG military specialists conducted field testing in  June 1988 to determine the practical possibility of the ADLER  automated control system interworking with the U.S. TACFIRE  artillery fire control system. Prototypes of equipment, special  software and a translator from one programming language to the  other were used in the testing. To work out the interface of the  two automated artillery fire control systems, 17 message  formats, including intelligence and commence-fire orders, were  transmitted between them over the communications channel.    U.S. and FRG specialists gave test results high marks and  drew a very reassuring conclusion that they were an important  step in providing mutual fire support of ground troops of all  NATO member countries.    Full, comprehensive field testing of the ADLER command and  information system were held in November 1988 and went very  successfully according to Bundeswehr military specialists.    The new automated control system is to become operational  with FRG Army artillery subunits in the first half of the  1990's. It is proposed to outfit all artillery command posts  with it at corps-division, artillery regiment-battalion and  field artillery battalion-battery levels.    The possibility of practical use of fourth-generation  computers in the ADLER field artillery automated control system  indicates the wide use of miniature processors in them. It is  expected that the 1990's will become the years of creation of  fifth-generation computers, which will considerably surpass  existing models in basic characteristics, above all in power.  The Illiac IV high-speed computer project being developed under  a U.S. Defense Department order can serve as a typical example  in this respect. Parallel operation of 256 processors with a  capacity of a billion is planned in this machine. Human contact  with the intelligent interface system in such computers will  occur in conventional language and programming will be in  logical programming language.    Fifth-generation computers open up great opportunities for  enhancing all spheres of human activity connected with  information processing, including solving artificial  intelligence problems.    Announcements by the Japanese firm of Fujitsu about creation  of equipment (a neurocomputer) based on a model of a neural  network for solving artificial intelligence problems are  reassuring in this respect. It operates according to the  principle of a human brain and can process the same amount of  data as a hundred thousand neurons. As a comparison we will note  that modern supercomputers can perform operations to an extent  inherent to capabilities only of six brain neurons.    Western specialists assert that neurocomputers will be used  widely in five years, above all in the military area in  developing automatic systems for controlling spacecraft, troops,  and modern weapons. In connection with this, a broad front of  joint basic research by physicists, neurobiologists, electronics  specialists, and specialists in brain theory and data processing  has appeared in the United States, Japan, the FRG and other  countries. All this indicates the objective reality of the  appearance of a fundamentally new scientific direction whose  practical realization will ensure a qualitative breakthrough in  the area of developing and creating super-effective weapon  systems.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hanson drives jump in overseas acquisitions THE VOLUME of British companies' overseas acquisitions more than trebled to Dollars 9.9bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in the first half of 1993 from Dollars 3bn in the same period last year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants and consultants. The increase, which comes against the declining trend in continental Europe, was driven by Hanson's Dollars 3.2bn agreed bid for the US company Quantum Chemical. Mr Richard Agutter, head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG, said Britain was one of the first countries to enter recession, along with the US and Canada. The three countries then experienced a corresponding downturn in cross border M&amp;A. However, 'in recent months each has shown some sign of recovery, although the indicators have been uncertain and have not been as consistent as we would wish for. 'The increase in acquisition activity in these countries does, however, demonstrate and add to the level of business confidence.' US purchases were up 39 per cent to Dollars 6.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn) and Canadian purchases leapt to Dollars 2bn (Dollars 599m). Over the same period the recession in continental Europe has contributed to a 40 per cent fall in the volume of cross-border M&amp;A world-wide, preliminary figures from KPMG's deal watch survey show. Cross-border acquisitions worldwide amounted to Dollars 25.1bn (Dollars 42.2bn) in the first half. French buying activity declined most sharply to Dollars 428m (Dollars 8.7bn). Italian purchases also fell, held back by the criminal investigations into political and business corruption, but no values were disclosed.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL'S PAY PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The highlights of the ethics reform package leads off with "A ban on outside  employment for all elected officials" (March 1).  </P> <P> This will be one more nail in the coffin of the citizen-elected representative.  It is basic American competitiveness that the best income provides the best  living.  </P> <P> That to be elected to office one must give up his business or profession, has  the certain negative effect of keeping good people from seeking office.  </P> <P> Simple honesty and integrity are the foundation of good citizenship. "Ethics"  means nothing to me. As law it is worthless. Laws are only good for punishing  those who are egregiously dishonest and whose integrity is flawed.  </P> <P> W.J. VALENTINE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

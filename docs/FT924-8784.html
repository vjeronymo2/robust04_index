			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Bosnian Moslem refugees reach the end of a long line: The dejected inmates of Posusje's camp JASMINA CERIC was top of her class in English. Until this spring she lived a happy, middle-class life. Her father was the owner of the local supermarket and a cafe. Eight days ago she arrived here with her mother and sister to share a run-down school building with 700 other people, one of more than 800,000 displaced people trapped in warring Bosnia-Hercegovina. In the schoolroom where she sleeps there are one man, nine women and eight children and all their remaining belongings. From her home she took only clothes and a doll called Sonja. Jasmina is 11, with translucent green eyes and a ponytail. Her ambition was to become an English teacher, but now she has no idea what her future is. She is at least luckier than those in the gym, which has to accommodate about 400 people. Old men sit on their mattresses and smoke. Clothes are hung on wallbars and climbing ropes. The school has no heating. Posusje is just inside the border from coastal Croatia. On the road that you meet here, you can travel 30 miles in either direction and you enter a war zone. A small mountain town with a white stone church, it would be a pleasant enough place. But the refugees here - there are more in the hotel and some 3,000 in family homes - are disillusioned. Decanted through a network of reception centres, they all come hoping to cross the border. But the Croatian authorities say they can take no more than the 340,000 who have already come from Bosnia. Aid workers say overcrowding and poor sanitation are compounded by constant struggles with local authorities. Almost all the refugees at the school are Moslems. They believe Bosnian Croats are more favoured. They are meant to move on from here, but it seems like the end of the line. Jasmina comes from Prijedor in northern Bosnia, where before this year Moslems slightly outnumbered Serbs. Last month Serb leaders from Bosnia and Croatia called an 'all-Serbian parliament' in the town. Jasmina's father, who belonged Bosnia's territorial reserves, was captured by Serb soldiers seven months ago and sent to the Manjuca camp near Banja Luka. He has managed to send his family three letters through the Red Cross. The supermarket and cafe were looted and burnt down. Their three cars were also destroyed. Before coming here, mother and daughters spent 20 days at another centre in Travnik, northwest of Sarajevo, which has recently come under shelling. They went by bus, but walked part of the way. At Posusje they are given cold fish - the same every day - and bread, sometimes milk. The gym has cooking facilities but many do not use them for fear of disease. The camp has hepatitis and typhus cases. There are six makeshift latrines. Clothes are washed outside in buckets and hung on trees. The refugees rely on rainwater collected in cisterns. 'It is horrible,' Jasmina says. 'It is very cold at night and there are not many blankets.' She wants to go to school, but does not, and instead has to live in one. The family has no money left, no papers. Her mother has told her they will not go back to Prijedor. Jasmina is not quite sure why. Sakib Karavic is 14 1/2 . He would like to go back to his village not far from Prijedor. 'But there is no place to go. It's pointless.' His grandfather was killed when a shell hit his home. Sakib's family has been here a month and a half after an odyssey through Bosnia by cattle-wagon, on foot and by truck. They knew Serbs in the village. 'They were our neighbours. And then they burnt our houses.' Everyone has seen the pictures, the packed camps, the streams of people last week fleeing Jajce along the road to Travnik. But equally strong are the impressions made by the stench, by the way the women fix their gaze, half pleading, half hopeless, and by the surrounding hillsides with their neat villas. A few yards from the school building, people sit around cafe tables. This is, after all, Europe. Hasan Hasecic, a dignified man with a white stubble, acts as spokesman for the refugees at Posusje. 'Other countries refuse us, abandon us,' he says. 'Nobody wants to live here. It's a grave.' He has little faith in outside help. 'Every day, people come, and they ask, and they write, and nothing happens.'</p>

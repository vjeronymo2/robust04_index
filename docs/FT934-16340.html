			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Clinton aid cut shocks Israelis ISRAELI officials have reacted with shock to a Clinton administration decision to cut by almost a quarter an aid package intended to help Israel finance absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Under an arrangement reached towards the end of the Bush administration, the US agreed to grant Israel loan guarantees worth Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year for five years, enabling Israel to raise funds at lower interest rates on the international market. The one condition was that the annual Dollars 2bn figure would be cut, dollar for dollar, by the sum Israel spent on settlement activity in the occupied territories. This week, the US State Department announced that, in accordance with that penalty clause, the administration would be authorising only Dollars 1.563bn worth of loan guarantees for fiscal 1994. This is a cut of Dollars 437m, reflecting Israeli government spending over the past year on housing, road building, education and other services for Jewish settlers in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, says Israel is now seeking 'clarifications' of the penalty. Privately, officials say they foresaw a cut of only Dollars 100m. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has greatly reduced spending on settlements since taking office. Much of the Dollars 437m figure, say officials, represents the fulfilment of contracts agreed by the previous, pro-settlement, Likud coalition. Mr Ya'acov Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, has stressed the cut will have negligible economic impact. When Israel first sought the aid package, it expected having to house an annual 200,000 new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. But immigration is running at considerably less than half that number. Israeli officials are upset by the political implication: an apparent get-tough message from the US to Israel at a time when Mr Rabin needs Washington's full support for his sensitive negotiations with the PLO on autonomy in the occupied territories.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> CHANGING BEHAVIOR  </P> <P> Everyone wants to be healthy, but sometimes other needs come first. When we  talk about cardio-vascular risk reduction, we're talking about getting people  to change behaviors now, so that they don't get heart disease 20 years from  now.  </P> <P> That's real difficult for any ethnic group to deal with, but I think with the  Latino belief, which tends to be more fatalistic -- that many of these things  related to health are in God's hands, for instance -- it becomes more difficult  to grasp the idea (of preventive measures) and to become active in taking  control of their own health.  </P> <P> But what we've found is that once people become educated, that turns around and  they become very active and involved.  </P> <P> We have an 18-member coalition of Latino leaders. Some are physicians, but we  also have people who are just interested citizens. They're taking over a lot of  the activities, and that's one of the goals -- to get people to realize that  they do have something to do with their own health.  </P></p>

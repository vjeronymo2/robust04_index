			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jordan Is Committed to Comprehensive Peace"] </F>   [Text] Jordan responded to the U.S. call to take part in  the Madrid conference because the conference was based on  achieving a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in accordance  with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the  land-for-peace principle. The conference was also based on  restoring all the occupied Arab territories, foremost of which  is holy Jerusalem, and on fully restoring the national rights of  the Palestinian people.    However, the U.S. Administration abandoned its role as a  full  and effective partner in the peace process and forgot about the  Madrid terms of reference. It began to encourage and support  Israel in its attempts to fragment the peace process and to  strike separate deals. It also gave Israel the liberty to  maneuver and prevaricate. It went on to plant obstacles on the  road to a just and comprehensive peace. The U.S. Administration  bypassed UN Security Council resolutions and tried to impose its  conditions on the Palestinian and other Arab parties.    Furthermore, the U.S. Administration harshly pressured all  the Arab parties in order to impose Israeli conditions on them.  As a result, Israel succeeded in imposing the Oslo, Davos, and  Cairo accords on the Palestinian side.    Because Jordan is firmly committed to a just and  comprehensive peace based on Resolutions 242 and 338, the U.S.  Administration, at Israel's request, strongly pressured and  harassed Jordan to agree to sign a separate agreement with  Israel. The U.S. siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah is  part of this harassment, which has caused serious harm to  Jordan's economy and trade.    When His Majesty King Husayn visited the United States, he  was asked to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel before  the problems of water, occupied territories, and refugees are  solved.    However, His Majesty King Husayn, who has never submitted to  pressure or harassment from any party, rejected the U.S. offer  with courage, pride, and a firm Hashemite will. He stressed the  need to restore Jordanian rights to the occupied territories and  to the plundered waters, and the need to resolve the issue of  refugees and evacuees. This spurred a U.S. desire to take  revenge on Jordan.    As a result of all this, the U.S. Administration began to  tighten the siege on Jordan in order to cause more harm to it.  Hence, the brave Hashemite response announced by His Majesty  King Husayn when he linked continuation of Jordan's  participation in the peace process with the lifting of the siege  imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah. He stressed that Jordan is a  difficult number in the equation and that it will not submit to  pressures that are suspect in terms of causes and objectives.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on oil sector TUMBLING oil prices prompted one US house to turn bearish on the sector yesterday. US investors have been the principal supporters of the leading oil shares and the move raised the spectre of a change of mind on their part. However, dealers said US buyers were still attracted by the recovery potential of the leading oil stocks particularly BP. Lehman Brothers published a broad downgrade based on a two-dollar cut to Dollars 16.75 a barrel in its estimate for the average price of Brent crude next year. As a result, the house slashed its BP earnings forecast for next year to 16.6p a share from 22.1p. Analyst Mr Jeremy Hudson said: 'UK and European energy stocks are priced more highly than their US equivalents and we are recommending that BP's fair value is about 250p.' This contrasts with a close last night of 296 1/2 p, down 7 on the day. The house says Shell Transport is more up with events because of the attractive valuation of its Royal Dutch arm but it has reduced its eps forecast by nearly 5p to 40.8p and believes a fair share price is 612p. Lehman's gloomy forecasts are approaching the historically cautious view of SGST which is a long-time seller of BP. Strauss published a hefty review earlier in the week which forecasts a first-quarter oil price of Dollars 15.50 a barrel and sees BP's share price slipping to 255p. Meanwhile, agency broker James Capel reiterated its bearish view of the sector ahead of a key Opec meeting on September 25. Nearly 10m shares in BP traded. Shell, which goes ex a 7.2p dividend on Monday, was held up by yield buying and closed 2 ahead at 657p.</p>

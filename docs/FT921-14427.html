			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Realism impresses more than magic: There are no sweeping solutions to Asda's problems, says Archie Norman, chief executive Mr Archie Norman, who has been chief executive of Asda for less than a month, yesterday achieved the rare feat of impressing the stock market by saying almost nothing about the future of the troubled grocery group. 'We are not coming in in a swashbuckling way and saying that we have the magic formula for Asda. What we have to do is look at the assets of the business and see whether there is potential for doing something better with them,' he said somewhat prosaically. Yet his comments - and the company's better-than-feared results - added 19 per cent to Asda's market value as its shares closed 5 1/2 p higher at 34 1/2 p. Mr Norman's refusal to suggest sweeping solutions to Asda's deep-seated problems was appreciated by analysts, who said the approach smacked more of realism than reticence. 'After all, he has probably not even got sensible answers to his questions yet,' said Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at Kleinwort Benson. But analysts can see the outlines of Asda's immediate strategy. It can be summed up in Mr Norman's statement: 'It is essential to make Asda's core business work.' Over the past few years, Asda's grocery chain has lost much of its appeal while its rivals' offerings have forged ahead. The new management's immediate priority is to restore credibility with customers by improving Asda's pricing proposition, sharpening its product offering and improving the physical appearance of its stores portfolio. Already the company has taken several initiatives on the price front. It froze the price of 30,000 items in the run-up to Christmas and has recently introduced a range of 200 lower-priced products at its underperforming stores. Next week, Asda will launch an extra value promotion featuring hundred of products at 'substantial' reductions. According to the company such initiatives are already bearing fruit; market research studies show Asda to be offering more competitive prices than at any time since 1987. The company's products will also be scrutinised. Asda's George range of clothing - produced by Mr George Davies of Next fame - has been doing 'quite well' with clothing sales up 25 per cent. But home goods, which account for the bulk of non-food sales, lack 'authority' and tie up capital in slow-moving stock. As well as the all-important task of winning back customer loyalty, Asda must exploit its market position and assets far more effectively. The company runs 200 superstores with more than 8m sq ft of selling space. It has annual sales of Pounds 4bn with particularly strong market shares in Scotland and North England. At great expense, it has built eight composite distribution centres supplying over 80 per cent of its food sales and has introduced information technology systems at all its stores. Yet as the company readily admitted: 'This asset base is significantly underperforming against its profit potential.' Mr Norman yesterday expressed dismay at the 'lousy' way Asda used its sales information. 'I cannot tell you whether our canned vegetables are profitable or our toys. But the systems that we now have in place give us the opportunity to do that,' he said. Such improvements are an obvious priority. But cleansing the Asda stables of the results of mismanagement is the easy task; finding a horse for the company to ride away on will be a much harder one. Asda accepts it has lost the 'me-too' battle it fought with the industry leaders, Sainsbury's and Tesco. But it has yet to develop a viable formula for ensuring future prosperity. 'It is going to be a very exciting task but it clearly has a lot of risk attached to it,' said Mr Norman. One immediate problem is the poor performance of Asda's 49 older stores  - some of them 25 years old - where sales slipped 6 per cent during the half year. It remains an open question whether it is worth investing heavily in these outlets and some of the more hopeless stores will no doubt be swiftly closed. But the company may choose to use some of the space more creatively  -perhaps adopting a different trading format as Gateway has done by launching its Food Giant discount stores at its loss-making superstore sites. Intriguingly, Asda said new store formats and pricing strategies would be tested with the 'expectation of roll-out from 1993 onwards'. But the company has little time to tackle these concerns. It is suffering from weak sales as a result of the recession while watching its competitors increase the competitive heat with big store-opening programmes. In spite of its recent Pounds 357m rights issue, Asda is saddled with debts of Pounds 668m which it will find difficult to pay down simply from trading profits. This raises the prospect of it selling Allied Maples, its furnishings business, or disposing of its 25 per cent stake in MFI, the furniture group. But the company cannot count on selling assets in the current climate and analysts suggest it may yet have to look for further financing perhaps through a convertible bond issue. Mr Norman yesterday seemed under few illusions about the gravity and urgency of the problems confronting him. 'History does not matter to Asda any more. Survival does,' he said.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: The Mystery of Dr Martinu - Television It is 22 years, no less, since Ken Russell last made a film for the BBC. The Mystery of Dr Martinu, screened on BBC2 on Saturday to open the channel's season of Collaborations and Commissions, offered a belated postscript to the Martinu centenary in 1990 as well as a splendidly batty study of one of twentieth-century music's more elusive figures. Personal prejudice needs to butt in here. There are few celebrated composers of any nationality or any century whose music infuriates me more than Martinu's, none whose works, with the single exception of the opera Julietta, seems more trivial or dispensable. But even after watching Dr Martinu it's still difficult to work out just what Ken Russell thinks of the music, or indeed of Martinu himself as anything but a suitable case for televisual fantasy. His life was that of a wandering composer - from Bohemia to Paris, Paris to New York, and finally back to France - his musical output staggeringly vast, much of it still unpublished. The crux of Russell's film was Martinu's breakdown in the late 1940s. The fantasies and fears of that period provided him with a rich parade of images - a troop of deaf-mute girls dabbling in rock pools on the seashore, images of the composer's hands alive with ants, and, repeatedly, a lighthouse from which a beautiful girl endlessly beckons and from whose delights Martinu is barred by a succession of uniformed doormen. A key to all this was provided by the final confrontation between Martinu and his analyst, teasing out the threads and obsessions in a script of unashamed banality. The girl, for instance, turned out to have been a student with whom Martinu had had an affair in Paris, and with whom he had been discovered in flagrante by his ever faithful wife. But Russell never made a connection between any of this and the music, so that the soundtrack of blithely trivial works counterpointing these lusciously choreographed scenes appeared quite irrelevant. Perhaps that was the point. Did Martinu always compose on automatic pilot, careful to keep himself completely detached from his art? As he moved from fashion to fashion he never found the style that he sought. The real mystery of Dr Martinu is surely that a composer of such tremendous facility and skill was able to hide his own personality so completely; confronted by Russell's own fantasies he just didn't stand a chance.</p>

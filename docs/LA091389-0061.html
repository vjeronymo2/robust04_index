			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BAIL DEADLINE SET IN ZUNO ARCE CASE  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors have until noon today to persuade an appeals court that  Ruben Zuno Arce, who is charged with perjury in a case related to the 1985  murder of a U.S. drug agent, should not be released on bail.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi set bail at $200,000 for  Zuno Arce, 59, a prominent Mexican businessman and the brother-in-law of  Mexico's former president.  </P> <P> But at the request of Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano, who called Zuno Arce  a "profound flight risk," the judge delayed implementation of his order until  noon.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have until then to try to persuade the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals to overturn the bail ruling.  </P> <P> If not, Zuno Arce could go free.  </P> <P> Takasugi set Zuno Arce's bail at $200,000 plus two parcels of land owned by a  friend and a cousin. The judge noted that Zuno Arce has complied with requests  to be interviewed and said he was not a danger. But as a condition of bail,  Zuno Arce must sign away his right to protest his extradition from Mexico.  </P> <P> Zuno Arce was indicted last week on charges of lying to a grand jury in Los  Angeles about his relationship with three Mexican drug lords suspected in the  February, 1985, slaying of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique  Camarena.  </P></p>

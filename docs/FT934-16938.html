			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Lord Chief Justice backs curb on right to silence: As the Tories try to regain the initiative on law and order FT writers look at the crisis in the CONTROVERSIAL govern-ment proposals to curb a suspect's so-called right to silence have won the backing of Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice. Under the government's plans, trial judges would be able to comment to the jury on a defendant's failure to answer reasonable questions put to them at a police station. The right to silence has existed in its present form since 1855. At present, judges have to tell juries that a defendant's refusal to answer police questions should not be a factor in deciding guilt or innocence. The move would necessitate a change in the police caution to suspects. The police would have to say that although a suspect is not obliged to answer questions, failure to do so might be the subject of adverse comments by the judge at the trial. Speaking at the Bar's annual conference in London at the weekend, Lord Taylor said he supported change. 'I feel there are circumstances in which it should be open to a judge to comment on the defendant's failure to respond to questions.' He said it was important that it be left to the judge to decide in each case whether comment should be made. But later he said the position in Northern Ireland where since 1988 judges have been able to comment on a refusal to answer questions at any stage of a police investigation made 'a great deal of sense'. Lord Taylor confirmed his opposition to abolishing the defendant's right to a jury trial in cases that can be tried by magistrates or at a crown court. That was the most controversial of the 352 recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in July. But it is thought that opposition from the judiciary has persuaded Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, not to attempt to introduce it at this stage. Last week Mr Robert Seabrook QC, vice-chairman of the Bar, told the Labour Party conference that multiple cautioning and a cut in in the budget for part-time judges meant that crown courts in parts of England and Wales were lying idle.</p>

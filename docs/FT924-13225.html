			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / British Coal bidder pulls out of race: Customer's imports to rise tenfold ANGLO UNITED, British Coal's second-largest customer after the electricity generators, has withdrawn as a possible bidder for the nationalised industry because the severity of the pit cuts has left the operation too small to be of interest. The company is also being forced to increase its annual coal imports from 100,000 tonnes to almost 1m tonnes because of the pit closures. Mr David McErlain, chairman, said yesterday: 'Eighteen months ago we were looking at a business with 30 mines selling 50m tonnes to the generators. Now it is only 20 mines. It's suddenly a small industry and getting smaller.' Mr McErlain also said that executives from his company would visit Australia and South Africa shortly to discuss purchases of coal. Anglo United owns the Coalite smokeless fuel company and also distributes 3m tonnes of coal a year. But many of the UK mines that supply the company are on the shutdown list. British Coal will try to meet its needs, but there will be a growing shortfall. Mr McErlain blamed the growth of gas-fired power generation for the shrinkage of coal, and urged that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, investigate it. 'I hope that the government will look at this and see that people are worried about the viability, and get it looked into,' he said. Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of British Coal who left after disagreements over the cuts, is to lead a consortium which will attempt to lease four pits due for closure in South Yorkshire: Markham Main, Hatfield, Bentley and Rossington. Mr Edwards told BBC Leeds: 'Here we are dealing with mines, it has been said over and over again, which are among the best in Europe.' He said he had held talks with Brian Nichols Associates of New South Wales who would operate the mines. Mr Crispian Hotson, chief executive of Ryan Group, the UK's largest private coal mining company, said he had put a proposal to Mr Eggar to break British Coal into five competing companies, with two in the Midlands and one in each of Wales, the north-east and Scotland. That would break up centralised decision-making, he said, and increase efficiency. 'Selling it as a single entity or a fudged duopoly will never achieve the right end. If the right amount of competition is introduced, British Coal could be the envy of the industry.'</p>

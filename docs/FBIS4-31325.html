			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 4 (MTI) -- At its one-day closed-door  session on Saturday [4 June], the National Board of the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] discussed parliamentary  election experiences and the party's internal situation. A  statement issued to the press after the conference, party  chairman Lajos Fur announced the resignation of the MDF  Presidium at the party's next special national convention, the  date for which will be set later on. The statement says, "The  board considers it necessary to thoroughly examine both the  party's unsatisfactory election result and its future policy."    Spokesman Karoly Herenyi told journalists that the board  meeting heard over 30 contributions on reasons behind the  election failure and ways of proceeding ahead. The MDF,  adapting to current conditions, should shape its policy in a  different style as an opposition force, it was stated at the  session.</p>

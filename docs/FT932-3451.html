			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Vard to reveal sale of ferry business VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, expects to announce the disposal of its ferry business this week, according to a senior executive in the company. Trading in Vard's shares were suspended temporarily on Friday in Oslo and London. On Thursday Vard's shares closed on the Oslo bourse up NKr3 at NKr25, and were the second most actively traded with 3 per cent of the share capital worth NKr23.8m (Dollars 3.44m) changing hands. Mr Trygve Hegnar, a Vard board member, on March 15 made an 'indicative' offer of NKr1.2bn for the ferry business, which includes the Scandi and Larvik lines. Union Bank of Switzerland is leading negotiations on behalf of Mr Hegnar and a group of financial investors, while Mr Truls Sanner, Vard's chief executive, is negotiating on behalf of the board. Mr Hegnar is also Vard's second biggest shareholder with an 11.8 per cent stake in the group. In Vard's 1992 accounts, the three ferries which make up the fleet were booked at a value of NKr455m. Vard forecast a 'satisfactory' result in 1993 for the ferry business. Last year, the business achieved its best result ever, posting a net profit of NKr123.7m against NKr104.5m in the previous year. In the first quarter of this year, however, it saw losses widen to NKr32.6m from NKr5m in last time. Domestic analysts estimate proceeds of the disposal will reach Dollars 170m. About Dollars 120m will be used to pay off the bulk of the Dollars 220m worth of debt of Vard's holding company. The rest will be used to service remaining debt and cover overheads. Vard is also seeking to dispose of just over 50 per cent of Miami-based Kloster Cruise, its cruise business.</p>

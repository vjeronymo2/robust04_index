			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / SDP poll could ruffle coalition JAPAN'S Social Democratic party faces a disruptive election for a new chairman that could destabilise the seven party-coalition government, in which it is the largest group. The apparent decision of Mr Sadao Yamahana not to stand for re-election later this month comes after he has forced the party to adopt a new policy on South Korea by visiting that country recently. Until now the SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, has maintained close ties to totalitarian North Korea. Mr Yamahana was the first SDP leader to visit Seoul, angering left-wing members of his party. Mr Yamahana is a member of a moderate faction which has attempted to push the SDP to reform its policies over the past few years, and he has taken advantage of his time in the month-old government to make changes in spirit if not wording to past policies. If Mr Yamahana is not a candidate, he will back another moderate representative in a party poll, scheduled for September 18, in the hope of continuing reforms intended to broaden the party's popularity. Serving in the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has prompted the SDP to blunt its past opposition to the use of nuclear energy and even to suggest that it accepted a foreign policy little changed from that of the conservative Liberal Democratic party, which ruled for 38 years. However, the party's growing pragmatism raises the possibility that members loyal to traditional hard-line policies will split to form a new party - a move which could bring down the coalition government. Mr Hosokawa said the dispute within the SDP was an internal matter that did not directly concern the government, though 'we have to wait and see what happens'. Other government officials said they were confident that the SDP would remain a coalition member, regardless of the leadership contest's outcome. But the likely departure of Mr Yamahana, who has said he will resign in order to take responsibility for the party's poor showing in July's general election, raises doubts over whether he will continue to serve as the cabinet minister responsible for political reform.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (2): Clouds of uncertainty - The economic outlook is not promising THE Japanese economy is still stuck. In spite of hopeful signs early in the year that a recovery was imminent, it is still too early to say that the economy has bottomed out from the long decline which began with the sharp fall in land and stock prices in 1991. This short term uncertainty about when the economy will hit the bottom is only further clouding its medium term outlook. It seems increasingly likely that when growth resumes it will be extremely moderate and tentative. In the longer term, beyond the next couple of years, the strength of the economy will depend upon Japan's capacity for further fundamental restructuring to deliver growth. It achieved this with a vengeance in the 1970s in response to the oil shocks, by manufacturers upgrading their product ranges and shifting from heavy to light industry. Now Japan faces challenges of a similar magnitude - not just in the structure of its industry but also in its markets for labour, assets and consumer goods - if its economy once again is to grow strongly in the second part of this decade. The slump set off by the sharp fall in stock and land prices which began two years ago is still with Japan. In the year to this March the economy grew by about 0.8 per cent, the lowest rate since the oil shocks of the 1970s. In the past few weeks forecasters have been downgrading their estimates of what is to come this year and next. Optimists, such as Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salmon Brothers, the US securities house, predicts that the economy will grow by 3.2 per cent this fiscal year to next March and by 3.4 per cent in the following year. However, many other forecasters believe growth will be more moderate, at closer to 2.5 per cent or less. In the short run there is growing evidence that the slowdown in the economy has been arrested by a huge public sector effort to prop up the economy and prevent it falling into recession. The main domestic source of growth has been a massive infusion of public funds into the economy, through special pump priming packages worth more than Y24,000bn over the past year. This has helped to fuel construction demand and house building. Industry is finally getting its vast stocks of unsold inventories under control but only after sustained cuts in industrial production. Within the next six months industrial output may start to revive thanks to this inventory control, but the pickup is expected to be moderate. The money supply has also begun to rise, after an unprecedented period of contraction late last year. Meanwhile, the health of the financial sector has improved with the surge in the stock market over the past few months, which has taken the Nikkei away from the lows of about 17,500 it plumbed last year to more than 21,000. This recovery was in large part orchestrated by public pension funds buying stocks and regulatory changes to improve the profits outlook at NTT, the telecommunications group which accounts for a large chunk of the Tokyo stock market's valuation. This rise has helped to ease many of the difficulties faced by Japan's banks which are weighed down with bad debts left behind by speculative property lending in the late 1980s. The stock market's rise has strengthened the banks' balance sheets and so made it more likely that they will be able to lend enough to finance recovery when it finally arrives. However set against these signs of recovery are three restraints on growth. First, consumer spending which accounts for between 55 per cent and 60 per cent of Japanese gross domestic product, is still deeply depressed. The reasons for this baffle economists. The labour market is weakening but it is still tight, with official unemployment at 2.5 per cent. Inflation is depressed, with discounting rife, so real incomes are rising. The fall in land prices is bottoming out, which combined with the rise in the stock market should be strengthening consumer balance sheets. This should soon translate into less precautionary saving and high high street spending. But a revival in consumer spending has been predicted for many months without materialising and it is still not clear when it will recover strongly. Second, corporate investment, which accounts for between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of GDP is still being cut back as companies attempt to respond to three years of declining profits by cutting costs. Third, Japan's opportunities for exploiting external sources of growth are being curtailed by: the rise in the value of the yen from about Y125 to the dollar at the start of the year to about Y108; mounting pressure over Japan's trade surplus and the recession in Europe. In spite of their rapid growth the south east Asian economies are unlikely to provide an alternative market in the short run, especially for more expensive, sophisticated goods. In the longer run, the outlook for the economy will depend on a different mix of factors. There are powerful forces working towards a resumption of high growth in Japan. The US will maintain its pressure for Japan to run an expansionary economic policy to stimulate demand for imports to cut the trade surplus. Japanese manufacturing companies are busily laying the basis for a new surge in productivity in the next few years, with ambitious programmes to increase efficiency. However, against these forces that will drive growth are other factors that will constrain it. The political uncertainty may cast a shadow over the prospects for further fiscal stimulus. The decline in Japan's birth rate, slow growth of its working age population and rapid ageing mean Japan could face a structural labour shortage unless it allows greater immigration. This labour market constraint could limit Japan's capacity for non-inflationary growth. Japan's asset markets present another constraint. Policy makers are so worried that the stimulus may spill over into another bout of speculation to match the late 1980s that they want to control growth. Meanwhile, the pressure from the US over the scale of Japan's trade surplus, which is expected to be worth about Dollars 150bn this year, means that there is a curb on Japan's access to foreign markets as a source of growth. The main hope for escape from these constraints lies with reforms at home to create conditions for more sustainable domestic demand-led growth, by freeing consumer and retailing markets to increase the share of consumption within the economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pit Muller and Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] General Constand Viljoen's position as a leading  figure in right-wing politics is under pressure. His dramatic  eleventh hour registration of a new party for the election was  rejected overwhelmingly yesterday in a secret vote by the  decision-making structures of the National Front -- and he has  apparently retreated.    But in political circles the big question this week is  whether General Viljoen is going to sit back in the face of this  setback. There is a possibility that he will submit a  candidates' list of his new party -- the Freedom Front -- even  before Wednesday [9 March] for participation in the election.  If he does not do it, his registration will lapse.    In such a breakaway from the National Front, he could  possibly be followed by at least six Conservative Party [CP]  MP's who are known to be pro-election men and who have been  pressuring the CP to participate. They are the brothers Pieter,  MP for Schweizer-Reneke, and Corne Mulder, MP for Randfontein;  Mr. Willem Botha, MP for Uitenhage; Mr. Joseph Chiole, MP for  Pretoria West; Mr. Pieter Groenewald, MP for Stilfontein; and  Mr. Leon Louw, MP for Welkom; Cape Province CP leader Jan Hoon's  name was also mentioned in this regard.  <H5>  Marathon Meetings </H5>   Yesterday's drama in right-wing politics took place against  the background of very tense marathon meetings which began at  0700 and lasted until just before 1600.    The feeling among the majority of people, who had gathered  from the early morning in front of the Synod Hall, was  predominantly against General Viljoen. RAPPORT has even been  told that arrangements were made for him to leave the hall  through a side door in the event of tempers becoming so heated  that his safety would have been in jeopardy.    General Viljoen, co-leader of the Afrikaner National Front,  first came on the firing line during a morning session of the  National Front's Executive Council and later the People's  Representative Assembly.  <H5>  Acted Unilaterally </H5>   One thing that he was castigated for was acting unilaterally  when he registered the Freedom Front as a party for the coming  election on Friday night. This is probably the reason why the  registration was not made in the name of the National Front.    While Constand Viljoen had informed CP leader and his  co-leader in the National Front, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, late on  Friday night that such party was going to be registered, at the  end of it all he had acted against Dr. Hartzenberg's wishes.    At a news conference after yesterday's meeting, Dr.  Hartzenberg did not want to commit himself on what he said to  General Viljoen on Friday night.    General Viljoen's registration acts directly against the two  previous decisions by the National Front -- one of them as  recent as a week ago. Just this week Dr. Hartzenberg had even  said that the CP would not participate in the election as there  was "nothing new on the table."  <H5>  Secret </H5>   Notwithstanding the "official" mood within the National  Front, plans to register were pursued secretly. This emerges  from the fact that the new party's emblem had been designed some  time ago, the forms had been ready for a while, and the  necessary registration fee had already been raised.    Despite the intimate get-together between him and General  Viljoen, yesterday Dr. Hartzenberg tried to hide the differences  within the National Front while speaking in "parliament." He  said General Viljoen had acted properly by registering the party  as he had the interests of the National Front at heart.    "When he heard on Friday evening that the Inkatha Freedom  Party had registered provisionally, he immediately went to  register so that the National Front could get a chance to think  about the matter at its leisure this morning.    "Since the government did not want to give us the  opportunity  to test our support in a plebiscite, but had instead insisted  that this must be done in an election, the council stands by its  decision of two weeks ago not to take part in the election."    The crisis in the National Front boiled over on Friday after  an all-day meeting of the Front's Executive Council and attempts  by the government and the ANC [African National Congress] to  persuade General Viljoen to participate in the elections.    By Friday night, while the clock for registration was  ticking  away minute by minute, a storm was raging inside the National  Front's inner circles.    It was ultimately the late night decision by the Inkatha  Freedom Party to register that brought the pro-election members  in thee National Front into motion and that culminated in Gen.  Viljoen's dramatic journey to Kempton Park.  As of press time, there was as yet no consensus on a map for a  proposed Afrikaner homeland. A week ago instructions had been  given for such a map to be drawn up as this would strengthen the  National Front's claim for such a homeland.</p>

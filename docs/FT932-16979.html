			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Stock lending business benefits from tax ruling AN AMENDMENT to tax regulations aimed at keeping international stock lending business in London was announced yesterday by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. The ability to borrow stock is essential for financial houses whose trading strategies involve them in selling securities they do not own, making it one of the key services underpinning London's active international equity market. The business has been hindered by the tax treatment of so-called 'manufactured dividends' - dividends which are paid to the lender of stock. These have been subjected to a withholding tax in the past, which cannot be recovered by an overseas lender which has no UK tax liability against which to offset the charge. Following discussions between the Inland Revenue and the City's Stock Borrowing and Lending Committee, headed by Mr Ian Plenderleith, a director of the Bank of England, such dividends will now be paid gross to overseas lenders, it was announced. A similar ruling on the payment of dividends to UK-based lenders was made two years ago. The restriction that overseas stock can only pass through one intermediary between borrower and lender is to be lifted, and a wider range of market participants will be authorised to borrow stock, rather than just the marketmakers and 'quasi-marketmakers' who are currently recognised. The new rules apply only to overseas securities.</p>

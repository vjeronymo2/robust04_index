			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting  chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society,  in a telephone message to the president of the South Korean Red  Cross today, strongly urged the South side once again to show an  affirmative response to the North's humanitarian proposals  before it is too late.    Noting that the South side has not shown any response to the  North's proposals for the repatriation to the North of Kim In-so  and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war now under detention in South  Korea, and of Kim Chi-hyon, a daughter of Kim Pyong-chu who was  an unconverted prisoner, now suffering from a serious illness,  the message says:    This cannot be deemed a righteous behavior of the Red Cross  men whose essential mission is to show noble humanitarianism by  saving human beings from misfortunes and helping them.    Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who were taken prisoners by the  U.S. Forces side while engaging in guerrilla activities in the  South Korean area during the Korean war are obviously prisoners  of war in view of the international law, and your side is  obliged to send them back to our side.    This notwithstanding, your side is dealing with their issue  according to the "National Security Law" of South Korea which is  now being denounced by the international community. This is,  indeed, a wrong act of interpreting and applying the  international law in a self-centred way.    Moreover, your side is behaving as if it were interested in  humanitarian issues, while disregarding the question of  repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, a more urgent matter  than the problem of separated families. This is an extremely  improper act.    Failing to manifest any intention to give medical assistance  to Kim Chi-hyon now in a critical condition, your side turned  down our offer to fetch and treat her here. This cannot be  construed otherwise than an attitude of neglecting the duty and  mission of the Red Cross men.    The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society  sincerely  advises your organization not to follow the South side's  authorities who pursue North-South confrontation but to remain  faithful to its duty as a Red Cross organization.</p>

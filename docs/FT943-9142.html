			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Rate rises hit markets Financial markets yesterday received a rude wake-up call from their summer torpor as both Sweden and Italy lifted short-term interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. The 50 basis-point increase in the Swedish ceiling rate to 8 per cent, and a similar rise in the Italian discount rate, to 7.5 per cent, raised fears that the interest rate cycle in Europe may have bottomed. The rate moves were poorly received by sceptical markets, and both currencies traded lower. Yesterday afternoon the lira was quoted at a record low of L1,016.50 against the D-Mark, compared to a London close of L1,005 some 10 minutes before the rate move was announced. The Swedish krona was quoted in London at SKr4.987 against the D-Mark, off a low of SKr5, but well below Wednesday's close of SKr4.940. Events in Europe overshadowed the release of a fairly neutral set of July PPI and retail sales figures in the US. The dollar, however, weakened sharply as nervous investors sought refuge from currency turbulence in the D-Mark. Yesterday evening the dollar was trading at DM1.5635, more than 2 1/2 pfennigs off the day's high of DM1.5905. In New York it finished at DM1.5600. Sterling had a steady day, with weakness against the D-Mark offset by strength against the dollar. At midday in New York the pound was trading at Dollars 1.5485, up from Dollars 1.53 earlier, and DM2.4256, down from DM2.4350. The interest rate futures markets had a hectic day with heavy volumes traded, and large price movements. The December short sterling contract saw more than 50,000 lots traded and was bid yesterday evening at 93.23, compared to Wednesday's close of 93.43. The December Euromark contract traded 66,000 lots and was bid at 94.78, compared to the previous close of 94.96. Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said it raised rates as a pre-emptive strike against inflation. The Bank of Italy, in turn, said rates were lifted in order to defend the lira. Markets, however, were equally unimpressed with both motivations and predicted further currency weakness. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, commented: 'The message from the market to big budget deficit governments is that investors are no longer prepared to invest in their assets unless we see a big cut in their budget deficit, or a big increase in interest rates. Fifty basis points is neither here nor there.' Mr Hawkins said the market's initial response had been so negative that speculators were now likely to turn their attention to other countries with fiscal problems, notably Portugal, Greece and Belgium. 'The foreign exchange market at the moment is now looking at budget deficits more than anything else.' Countries with a sounder fiscal position are expected to stay out of the firing line. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, commented: 'I do not think German policy will be altered in any shape or form by events we have seen today.' Indeed, some analysts believe another interest rate cut from the Bundesbank is likely, possibly as soon as next week when the council next meets. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, noted: 'The issue is fiscal deficits rather than Swedish monetary policy being a leading indicator for Europe. But that is certainly how the market is seeing it now.' That said, yesterday's rate moves have clearly served as a further catalyst for bearishness across the board in European interest rate markets. A common criticism among analysts was that both central banks had essentially missed the point, which was that markets were worried about large budget deficits. Against this background, selling the currency is logical because higher interest rates promise only to aggravate the economic difficulties these countries face, and make holding their assets a less palatable prospect. Some analysts said the central banks' actions could be interpreted as warning shots across the bows of the politicians, warning them that they had to cut their budget deficits. Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg in London, said high debt countries might have to accept a degree of exchange rate fluctuation as the price for interest rate independence. He predicted that the issue of how high deficit countries would cope with rising interest rates would prompt further speculation against their currencies. The dollar's weakness was attributed more to the search for safety in the D-Mark rather than in any specific concern about the US currency. Analysts said that yesterday's data were unlikely to have altered any views of the likelihood, or not, of a Fed tightening at next week's FOMC meeting. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 120m after forecasting a Pounds 350m shortage. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 200m liquidity at established rates. In the cash markets, sterling LIBOR firmed on speculation of higher rates to 5 per cent from 5 9/16 per cent.</p>

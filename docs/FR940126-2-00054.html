The August 30, 1993 publication was required by section 709(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992. This was the first annual publication and identified 4,973 HEAL borrowers in default. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Director, Division of Student Assistance, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, Room 8&hyph;48, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

All borrowers who had defaulted on HEAL loans and for whom claims had been paid by the Department of Health and Human Services (Department), from the beginning of the HEAL program through March 31, 1993, were subject to inclusion in the August 30, 1993 notice. However, to identify most accurately those HEAL borrowers who were in an unsatisfactory status with the Department, borrowers in the following categories were excluded from the August 30, 1993 listing: (1) Those who had paid their loan in full subsequent to their default; (2) those who had received HEAL loan cancellation due to death or permanent and total disability; (3) those whose loans had been repurchased from the Department by a HEAL school, lender, or holder; (4) those who had been approved by the Department for deferment or forbearance; and (5) those who had made 12 monthly payments or the equivalent during the 12-month period ending March 31, 1993. Borrowers in the above five categories were viewed by the Department as having made satisfactory arrangements to resolve the default or as no longer obligated to repay a HEAL loan to the Department, and therefore were excluded from publication in the August 30, 1993 listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since publication of the August 30, 1993 listing, the Department has determined that the names of some borrowers should not have been published. Accordingly, this notice lists borrowers who should not have been included in the August 30, 1993 listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first category of borrowers whose names should not have been published are those for whom, as of March 31, 1993, the Department had paid one or more claims due to the borrower filing for protection under bankruptcy law and who were not in default status on a HEAL loan. A total of 115 names are included for this reason.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that this category of corrections includes only loans in bankruptcy that were not in a default status as of March 31, 1993. Thus, any borrower with a loan in bankruptcy that was in default prior to or subsequent to the bankruptcy proceedings, and who did not qualify for any of the 5 exclusionary categories listed above, was included appropriately in the August 30, 1993 publication. In addition, it should be noted that HEAL loans are not eligible for discharge in bankruptcy except under very limited circumstances, as set forth in 42 U.S.C. 292f(g). Thus, a HEAL borrower generally remains responsible for repayment of the HEAL loan once the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed, and could be included in a future listing of HEAL defaulters if he or she failed to enter a satisfactory repayment arrangement subsequent to the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second category of borrowers, whose names were published in error, are those for whom default claims were paid by the Department, but who, subsequent to publication of the notice, were determined by the Department to have met one of the following categories for exclusion from the listing, based on their status as of March 31, 1993: (1) Had paid their loans in full; (2) had been approved by the Department for forbearance; or (3) had made the equivalent of 12 monthly payments during the 12-month period ending March 31, 1993. A total of 44 names are included for these reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An updated listing of HEAL defaulters who are not in a satisfactory repayment status will be published in late 1994. Those who have entered satisfactory repayment will not be included in that listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Retraction List (Category One)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alabama  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Osteopathy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Yanulis, George E., Birmingham, AL, $24,094.78, Chicago College of Ost Med, Downers Grove, IL, Osteopathy, February 1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

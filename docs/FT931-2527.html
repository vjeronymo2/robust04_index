			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Amstrad launches 'Pen Pad' product AMSTRAD, the consumer elec-tronics company, yesterday announced the first of a family of 'personal digital assistants', hand-held electronic notebooks which recognise and accept their owner's handwriting. It can also be used to send faxes over the telephone network when connected to a modem. Designed by Amstrad and manufactured in mainland China, the 'Pen Pad', which weighs under a pound, will be in high street shops by early May for Pounds 299.99 including value added tax. It is not the first of its type, because Japanese and US companies are already marketing hand-held computers which recognise handwriting. Some of the world's largest electronics companies see a bright future for such electronic notebooks and are planning their own versions. The list includes IBM, AT&amp;T and Apple. Their products are expected to be more sophisticated than Amstrad's version, although much more costly. The Amstrad launch is an indication that the company, which recently returned to profitability, is still capable of producing new product ideas. Mr Sugar failed in December to persuade shareholders to sell him the shares he does not already own, saying he could see no prospect of a 'blockbuster' product on the horizon.</p>

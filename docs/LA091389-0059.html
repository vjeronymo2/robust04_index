			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS MOVE TO GET SKID ROW'S WINE OF CHOICE OFF SHELVES  </P> <P> Duke's Liquor is one of the few places on Skid Row where street people can't  get a cheap drink.  </P> <P> That's because several years ago owner Carl Johnson Jr. stopped selling pint  bottles of cheap, fortified wines "to keep the winos away so we can get a  better clientele."  </P> <P> Taking the idea a step further, the county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday  to ask wineries to voluntarily suspend sales of the cheap wines to liquor  stores and markets on Skid Row, but for a different reason: to reduce  alcohol-related social problems in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The truth of the matter is, if we remove this product from the Skid Row area,  there will be less public drunkenness," Ken Schonlau, executive director of the  California Assn. of Alcoholic Recovery Homes, told the supervisors Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Francisco Trial  </P> <P> Board Chairman Ed Edelman proposed the move after reading about San Francisco's  seedy Tenderloin District, where E &amp; J Gallo Winery and Canandaigua Wines  of New York in June voluntarily suspended sales of cheap wines on a six-month  trial basis in response to community pressure. Community activists had appealed  to the wineries after local merchants refused to curb sales.  </P> <P> A Gallo spokesman declined comment on Los Angeles County's request. But the  spokesman reiterated Gallo's long-standing position that alcoholics deprived of  one way to get inebriated will find another. The huge winery agreed to suspend  sales in the Tenderloin District "to find out if our beliefs are correct."  </P> <P> Al Wright, director of Los Angeles County's office of alcohol programs, said  the trial program under way in the Tenderloin District has had mixed results.  He said the San Francisco neighborhood is considerably smaller than Los  Angeles' Skid Row, making it easier for alcoholics to leave the area to buy  cheap wine.  </P> <P> "We don't believe people would travel a great distance to buy fortified wines,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 70-Square-Block Area  </P> <P> Los Angeles County defines Skid Row as a 70-square-block stretch bounded by  3rd, Spring and 9th streets and Central Avenue.  </P> <P> Cheap, syrupy wines -- which have twice the alcohol of chablis or burgundy and  sell for a fraction of the cost -- are the beverage of choice of curb-side  alcoholics, according to a study by the county Department of Health Services. A  typical 13-ounce bottle of fortified wine contains about 18% alcohol, the  equivalent of four cocktails, and sells for about $1.30, health officials said.  </P> <P> "You probably will never see Night Train Express on the wine list of your  favorite restaurant," said Bob Pratt, president of Volunteers of America, which  runs an alcoholic treatment program on Skid Row. "The reason is that this  product is targeted as the most effective and efficient way for an individual  to become inebriated."  </P> <P> Supervisors, with a dozen bottles of the cheap wines lined up on their desks,  acted after health officials reported surveying more than 300 alcoholics in  treatment programs on Skid Row, touring liquor stores and markets and observing  "drinking practices among people on the streets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Strategy  </P> <P> Edelman said that attacking the supply represents a departure from the county's  previous efforts to fight alcoholism by targeting the drinker.  </P> <P> The supervisors also voted to form a task force of city and county officials,  downtown business people and social service providers to study other ways to  reduce alcoholism on Skid Row and in other problem areas, including  South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Among issues to be studied are requiring health warnings on bottles of  fortified wines and placing restrictions on liquor stores and markets on the  sale of alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> Wright pointed out that in Pacoima, "some local merchants have voluntarily  decided to stop selling single cans of beer in brown paper bags. They will sell  you a single beer, but in a plastic bag. This has a chilling effect on street  drinking."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Wine Institute in San Francisco said that cutting the  supply is a "narrow solution to a much broader societal problem." He said the  trade organization favors stricter enforcement of existing laws, including a  ban on drinking in public.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No More 'Shortdogs'  </P> <P> Johnson, owner of Duke's Liquor on San Pedro Street, said he discontinued the  sale of "shortdogs," the pint-sized bottles of cheap wine, about three years  ago.  </P> <P> "We actually have gained clientele by cutting that wine," he said, pointing out  that customers "don't see the winos sitting out in front of the store."  </P> <P> But Johnson said he is skeptical of government efforts to restrict the sale of  cheap wine. Referring to alcoholics, he said, "If they want it, they're going  to get it."  </P></p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Fininvest poised to raise cash by activities merger FININVEST, the privately-owned media and financial services group of Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is poised to raise cash by merging and floating its main publishing activities. The scheme, which has yet to be given a formal go-ahead by Mr Berlusconi, involves merging Silvio Berlusconi Editore, Fininvest's magazine publishing and industrial printing business, with Mondadori, Italy's biggest publisher, which Fininvest controls. Shares in the amalgamated unit, which would have annual sales of about L2,000bn (Dollars 10m), would be offered to domestic and international investors, with Fininvest retaining 51 per cent. The proceeds would be used to bring down the group's debts, officially about L3,000bn, although some bankers put the total higher. 'We are looking seriously at these hypotheses, but no final decision has been made,' said Fininvest. The group has steered clear of some of the over-ambitious takeovers which have driven other international media concerns into difficulties, and has not visibly suffered from the recession. However, Mr Adriano Galliani, head of its television interests, and one of Mr Berlusconi's main lieutenants, said it was 'in a consolidation phase'. Indirect confirmation that preparations for the deal are well under way came with news last weekend that SBE had bought 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares from the Fininvest parent company. No price for the intra-group transaction was disclosed. However, the transfer has been seen as a first step to the merger between the two publishing operations later this year. Goldman Sachs and Banca Commerciale Italiana have been appointed to advise on the deal. However, bankers note that Mr Berlusconi, on whom the ultimate decision rests, has not yet fully committed himself. Two years ago, the widely-expected flotation of Fininvest's Silvio Berlusconi Communications film subsidiary was shelved because of opposition from Mr Berlusconi, who remains hostile in principle to the participation of outside shareholders in his activities. However, bankers believe a cash-raising exercise is much more likely now in view of the greater financial pressures on his group. The merger of SBE with Mondadori is likely to come through a reverse takeover, which would precede placing a large proportion of the shares in the combined unit. SBE is best known for publishing Italy's biggest-selling magazine, TV Sorrisi e Canzoni and a new magazine, Noi. The company made net profits of L29.7bn on sales of L320bn in 1992. Mondadori is Italy's biggest book publisher, and also has sizeable magazine interests, including Panorama, the country's biggest-selling news magazine. Sales amounted to L1,600bn last year. Fininvest gained control of Mondadori's book and magazine interests after a long-running battle for control between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Carlo De Benedetti at the end of which Mondadori was split, with Mr Berlusconi retaining its publishing and magazines. Although still listed, Fininvest controls almost 90 per cent of its ordinary shares and 80 per cent of its savings stock. Mondadori's share price has risen sharply this year on rumours of a deal. Bankers believe up to 40 per cent of the shares being sold could be placed with foreign investors, explaining the role of Goldman Sachs in the transaction. However, in contrast to the planned flotation of Fininvest's film interests, which had been slated for the New York Stock Exchange, the SBE listing would only involve Milan.

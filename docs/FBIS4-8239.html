			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 9 (ATA) -- "The Albanian Army and  people have a special respect for NATO as an alliance of peace  and security," Lieutenant-General Ilia Vasho, chief of the Army  General Staff, said in the meeting with NATO supreme commander  and the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe, George  Joulwan. Mr. Vasho described for his honoured guest the reforms  carried out in the Albanian Army, focusing on the main tasks of  the army to create new visions in training, improvement of  living conditions for troops and officers, preparation of a new  military doctrine, and upgrading the qualifications of the  officers in contemporary military science.    General Joulwan said he was impressed by the great progress  that had been made in restructuring and modernizing the army.  He extolled the character and high qualities of the Albanian  fighting man which, General Joulwan said, were evident both in  his meetings with the staff at the military bases and in his  talks with Albanian officers. General Joulwan hailed the role  of the alliance in promoting friendship among peoples. "The  peoples appreciate freedom, friendship and sovereignty, these  are the values that unite mankind and which our alliance  manifests," General Joulwan said.    During its stay in Tirana, the NATO delegation attended the  inauguration of the Academy for Non-commissioned Officers.</p>

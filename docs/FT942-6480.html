			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Havas considers US link Havas, the French media and leisure group, is considering plans to expand its international interests through a partnership with a US group in the multimedia field, according to Mr Pierre Dauzier, chairman. Mr Dauzier, speaking on French radio, said the group's plans were still in the early stages, but he hoped to start negotiations soon with a potential US partner. 'If we want to do something coherent and constructive we've got to find a partner in the States,' he said. 'We're considering the matter at the moment. Perhaps between now and the end of the year we'll be able to talk about an agreement with a US company.' Havas has already expanded aggressively in the media sphere since its privatisation in the mid-1980s. It is already the largest force in French advertising, through its Euro-RSCG subsidiary, with extensive interests in travel and posters. Mr Dauzier has made no secret of his ambitions of extending the group's influence in the multimedia field. He scored a coup earlier this year when he won control of Canal Plus, the dynamic French pay-TV group, after forging a controversial alliance with other shareholders which triggered the resignation of the founder and chairman, Mr Andre Rousselet. The Canal Plus coup followed an agreement which left Havas strengthening its links with France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group that has become its partner of choice in multimedia. Mr Dauzier has also been increasing Havas's international interests with a number of deals in other European countries. He has long been committed to securing a foothold in the US.</p>

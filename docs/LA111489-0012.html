			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-RTD WORKER CHARGED IN ILLEGAL COMPUTER  USE  </P> <P> A former Rapid Transit District employee has been charged with using an RTD  computer to help her run a video pirating operation, prosecutors said Monday.  </P> <P> Karen F. Fox, 40, a former RTD junior systems programmer, was charged last week  with 18 counts of illegal computer access and use and four counts of videotape  piracy.  </P> <P> A co-defendant, Michael A. Pagan, also 40, was charged with two computer law  violations. All the charges are misdemeanors.  </P> <P> An investigation by the FBI, RTD police and a private agency hired by the  Motion Picture Assn. of America found that Fox was allegedly making illegal  copies in her Pasadena home of rented videotaped movies and selling them for  $10 each.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said Fox was using her computer at RTD  headquarters to catalogue her extensive videotape library and keep track of  orders for pirated tapes.  </P> <P> Investigators raided Fox's home March 10 and seized 805 videotaped movies,  along with seven VCRs, Hahn said.  </P> <P> Hahn said Fox gave some of the copied material to Pagan, a former RTD systems  programmer.  </P> <P> Pagan and Fox, who was fired by the RTD last month, surrendered to RTD police  on Friday and were released on $5,000 bail each. They are scheduled to be  arraigned Dec. 13 in Municipal Court.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Mini-Venture: Texas Instruments and Sharp Electronics of Japan are designing a  4 1/2-pound laptop computer that they will market, with slight variations,  under different names. Sharp's version, the PC-6220, was introduced at trade  shows last month. TI will manufacture not only the PC-6220 but its own version,  the TI TravelMate 2000 Notebook PC, and versions that customers will sell under  their own names. Industry watchers say the joint venture is an opportunity for  TI to break into the computer business and will give the company a new market  for its core business of integrated circuits. Dallas Morning News, Denver Post  </P> <P> Brewer's Bonus: Miller Brewing Co. is reaching for more of the beer market by  offering wholesalers 50 cents for every case of premium beer sold over company  goals -- in addition to the $2 per case they usually make. The target is a 3%  increase over last year's sales. Milwaukee Journal  </P> <P> Florida Bound: The world is opening up, more people than ever are traveling and  Florida expects a big piece of the action. Rockwell Schnabel, head of the  Commerce Department's tourist and travel operations, said foreign travel to the  United States should double by 2000. Florida has had 82% more foreign visitors  since 1985, mostly from Europe and Japan. The next wave, expected to last  through the decade, will come from Eastern Europe. St. Petersburg Times  </P> <P> Spotting Theft: After a record loss to shoplifters of $25 billion last year,  retailers are looking for new ways to deter thieves. One concept is a tag that  squirts indelible ink onto a garment when improperly removed. Security Tag  Systems of St. Petersburg, Fla., says it has sold 500,000 since production  began last fall, and ColorTag of New York has sold more than 1 million since  1988. Although ink tags are more expensive than electronic-alarm tags, they  seem to be effective, reducing losses about 60% at the 40 Casual Corner stores  testing them. Tampa Tribune  </P> <P> Added Warning: In a move that caught the attention of several U.S. drug  manufacturers, a Milwaukee law firm recently placed ads in the local paper  about theophyllines, a family of drugs used to treat asthma and other lung  diseases. In some cases these drugs have severe side effects, such as fever and  seizures, if taken when a patient has influenza. A spokesman for  Schering-Plough Corp., one of the makers of the drug, says its product "has  been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and provides effective  warnings about circumstances that can produce side effects."

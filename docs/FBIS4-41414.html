			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Felgengauer in the "Defense" column: </F> "Russian Nuclear Triad Ready for Action. President Yeltsin  Presses `Red Button' for First Time"]    [Text] The latest annual command staff exercise on control  of the Russian Federation Strategic Nuclear Forces, held 21-22  June at the Russian Army General Staff with the participation of  the main staffs of the Navy, the Air Force, and the Strategic  Missile Forces (the sea, air, and ground components of the  strategic nuclear triad), differed markedly from the previous  ones. Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov told SEGODNYA's  correspondent that for the first time the country's top civilian  official -- the supreme commander (the president) -- personally  directed the national Strategic Nuclear Forces. This is without  precedent in the entire existence of Soviet nuclear weapons.    On the morning of 22 June -- a notable day in Russia's  history -- during the final stage of the exercise, Boris Yeltsin  arrived at the General Staff accompanied by his national  security adviser Yuriy Baturin and, according to General  Kolesnikov, "personally exercised control" from the General  Staff Central Command Post. According to the military, "the  president showed a deep understanding on matters of the control  of strategic forces and issued guidance on improving the  Strategic Nuclear Forces taking into account the bilateral  agreements with the United States and Great Britain on missile  retargeting."    Then the president returned to the Kremlin, canceling a  scheduled meeting with the press, so his personal impressions  about how the famous nuclear button operates remain unknown to  the broad public. Meanwhile, the country's top military  leadership went to "a command post at one branch of the armed  forces to rehearse one element," and with that the training  session was successfully concluded.    According to the chief of General Staff, the exercise showed  that the Russian Federation nuclear triad and early warning  system are "ready to address the tasks assigned in accordance  with existing regulations."</p>

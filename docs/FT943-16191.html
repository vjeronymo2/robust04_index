			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Man with new set of rules to learn Mr Christo Liebenberg, South Africa's newly appointed finance minister, is a respected member of the South African business community, report Philip Gawith from London and Mark Suzman from Johannesburg. Without any political background, and given his solid reputation as a successful banker, he is seen as unlikely to diverge sig-nificantly from the cautious fiscal policy framework established by Mr Keys. But he lacks Mr Keys' charisma. Mr Liebenberg, 60, was until February chief executive of Nedcor, South Africa's fourth largest banking group. Under his guidance, Nedcor had a good record of social involvement, and was co-sponsor of the influential Nedcor-Old Mutual planning exercise a few years ago. The resulting document set out policy proposals to help push South Africa into growth and alleviate black poverty. In politics, Mr Liebenberg will have to learn to play by a new set of rules as he seeks to maintain fiscal stability in face of continued demands for extra spending. He will also have to try to earn the respect of his key cabinet colleagues, especially Deputy Finance Minister Alec Erwin, and Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, with whom he will have to work closely in implementing the reconstruction programme, the centrepiece of the government's economic policy.</p>

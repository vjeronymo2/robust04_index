Bilateral trade and economic cooperation is still short of  its potential despite Japan's overtaking Hong Kong as China's  biggest trading partner and in 1993 China becoming Japan's  second largest trading partner after the United States, Zhu said.    The value of two-way trade reached a record 39 billion U.S.  dollars, an increase of 54 percent over 1992.    "But the amount of 39 billion dollars is still too small a  figure," Zhu told a welcoming party for him sponsored by  Japanese trade organizations in a downtown Tokyo hotel.    He called for improved economic ties which would benefit the  Asia-Pacific region as well as the world at large.    Welcoming Zhu on a nine-day visit that began Wednesday,  Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi  Kumagai said Japan pays much attention to China's economic  development, especially as it is now working hard to establish a  socialist market economy.    Japan shares much in common with China because the  administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is also  reforming the country's politics and restructuring the sluggish  economy, Kumagai said.    He renewed Tokyo's support for China's bid to have its  membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  restored, saying China's re-entry would help promote the  expansion of global free trade.</p>

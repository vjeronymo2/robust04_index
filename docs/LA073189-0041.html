			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOY STRUCK WITH BAT LEAVES HOSPITAL; PROGNOSIS BRIGHT  </P> <P> Joshua Garrett, the 9-year-old boy whose skull was fractured last week by  someone swinging a bat, was released Sunday night from Children's Hospital,  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Joshua has progressed rapidly and is expected to fully recover, said hospital  spokesman Mark Morelli.  </P> <P> Garrett was struck on the back of the head as he rode to a convenience store in  south San Diego on his sister's bicycle. A car drove up behind him, and one of  the passengers struck him, San Diego police said.  </P> <P> Two teen-age boys were arrested in connection with the attack and are expected  to appear at a detention hearing Tuesday in Juvenile Court. Prosecutors want to  try the teen-agers as adults.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a fund has been established by a group of recent nursing-school  graduates to defray the boy's medical costs.  </P> <P> "I just felt there was a need," said Marcia Miles of her decision to help set  up the fund. "I feel like the community better start caring around here and get  involved."  </P> <P> Donations can be sent to the Joshua Leon Garrett Fund, Bank of America, 1775  Camino de la Reina, San Diego, CA 92108.  </P></p>

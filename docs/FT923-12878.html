			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors fail to get regulator's evidence heard CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International failed yesterday in an attempt to submit evidence from the Luxembourg Monetary Institute which they argued would strengthen their attempt to reject the compensation plan negotiated between liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. The evidence, which has been shown to the Financial Times, outlines a strongly worded objection to the liquidation plan from the LMI, which had regulatory responsibility over the Luxembourg-registered BCCI SA, one of the two main banking arms. Mr David Hunt QC, counsel for the creditors, told the Court of Appeal yesterday that the evidence emerged after last month's High Court ruling that sanctioned the Dollars 1.7bn compensation package, and could have influenced the court's decision. A summary of the LMI criticisms, contained in documents prepared for the case but ruled by the Appeal Court judges as inadmissible, outlines a 17-point objection to the plan which some creditors believe presents a powerful argument against the package drawn up by Touche Ross, the liquidators. The main points were: The majority shareholders were given wide powers of decision in the liquidation. The presence of an Abu Dhabi government representative on the board of BCCI meant that the Sheikdom could not be considered 'passive shareholders exposed to the actions of the board over which they had no control'. The power to pursue some third-party claims has been passed to Abu Dhabi in the agreement without any commitment by Abu Dhabi to do so. If Abu Dhabi was successful in claims against third parties to the extent that it succeeded in having the entire losses repatriated, it would qualify for half the proceeds - potentially more than it would have paid. Under the terms of the proposed agreement the Abu Dhabi government reserves the right to withhold BCCI files in its possession if it judges it to be in its interests. The significance of this agreement is also apparent in the documents, which reveal that Abu Dhabi is holding more than 81,000 BCCI files crucial to the Touche Ross investigations. Some papers are still being withheld from the liquidators more than a year after BCCI's closure by the Bank of England. Lord Justice Dillon rejected the application, saying the Luxembourg regulator's views were opinion. The appeal is expected to end tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 27 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav  Government on Monday expressed utmost concern over a dangerous  deterioration of the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, caused by continued offensive operations  of Muslim-Croat forces, and it called for an urgent U.N.  Security Council action.    Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic quoted at a news  conference, held after the federal government session, a  statement in which the government said it expected of the U.N.  Security Council immediately to take necessary measures to avoid  consequences which a further negative development of events  could have for the peace process.    The Yugoslav Government statement said that, at the present  crucial moment, it was the primary duty and responsibility of  the Security Council not to permit a real chance for a peaceful  resolution of the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina to  fall through. The statement said that, if use was not made of  that chance, there would unavoidably follow an escalation of  conflicts with unforeseeable consequences.    Prime Minister Kontic said that the developments since June  10, when the Geneva ceasefire agreement went into effect, showed  that not all sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina wanted a peaceful  solution.    The creation of the Muslim-Croat federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has increased the ambitions of the radical  Muslim leadership to persevere in its choice of a military  solution, Kontic said. He set out that the Muslim-Croat side  was using the Geneva ceasefire agreement for open preparations  for a large-scale military offensive, which he said was  confirmed in reports of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    The Yugoslav Government said the UNPROFOR reports showed,  among other things, that Muslim-Croat forces were supplying  themselves with large quantities of most modern weapons and were  not prevented in doing so.    The statement said the regrouping of Muslim-Croat forces,  coupled with a steady escalation of their combat operations,  aimed at provoking the resumption of the war, were a flagrant  violation of the ceasefire agreement and could seriously  undermine all efforts invested so far to achieve peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Yugoslav Government said that Muslim-Croat forces were  of  late launching strong offensive operations against Bosnian Serb  positions, and also towns, practically on all lines separating  the two sides, which it said resulted in numerous casualties  among the civilian population and in material damages.    The statement said it was encouraging, nevertheless, that  the  Bosnian Serb forces were, for the time being, reacting with  extreme restraint to the Muslim-Croat offensive operations and  preventing the military operations from turning into a conflict  on the largest possible scale.    The Yugoslav Government said it viewed as crucial the  current  phase of the negotiations, which it said should lead to a  resolution of the crisis caused by the civil war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Prime Minister Kontic said it was the Yugoslav Government's  position that the active participation of international  factors--the United Nations, the European Union, the United  States and Russia-- in the quest of a lasting political  solution, one acceptable to all sides in the Bosnian conflict,  gave rise to hope that the tragic civil war would soon be  brought to a halt and conditions would be created also for the  solution of other major issues on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia.    The Yugoslav Government expects that full use will be made  of  the currently favourable elements and it, itself, is trying to  make a concrete contribution to that end.    The government said that Yugoslavia maintained that stable  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina was possible only through  negotiations, and it called on the international community to  put pressure on those who were violating the signed ceasefire  agreement and demand that they immediately accept peace as the  sole option.    The Yugoslav Government listed in the annex to the statement  the ceasefire violations committed by the Muslim side since the  agreement took effect.    The Yugoslav Government set out in the annex that UNPROFOR  representatives had been informed about all the incidents, and  that they, themselves, had been able to see in the field that  Muslim troops were acting contrary to the ceasefire agreement.  It said UNPROFOR representatives had promised representatives of  the Bosnian Serb Army that they would inform their respective  commands about everything.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: HK broadcaster advances 27% TELEVISION Broadcasts, Hong Kong's leading television company, announced a 27 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 163.5m (USDollars 21.08m) for the six months to June 1993, up from HKDollars 128.3m in 1992. Turnover was up 8.5 per cent to HKDollars 871.5m. The company said earnings growth came from more efficient allocation of resources and aggressive marketing. However, international programme licensing revenues continued to be hampered by piracy from illegal Taiwanese cable TV operators. TVB is controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw and Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok, who tried to sell a 22 per cent stake to Mr Rupert Murdoch in July, only to be thwarted by Hong Kong's television ownership restrictions. TVB faces competition with the launch of cable television in Hong Kong on October 31, and from Mr Murdoch, who recently bought 64 per cent of Star, the satellite broadcaster. The interim dividend is 15 cents a share.</p>

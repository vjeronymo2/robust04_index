			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ling Yun (0407 0061): "The Inside Story of the </F> Explosion of the `Fengyun-2' Satellite"]    [Text] The Senior Central Hierarchy Shocked by 46  Casualties    On the afternoon of 7 April, the State Council General  Office  issued a circular on the first geostationary  satellite--Fengyun-2--scheduled to be launched by Long March-3  carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the  middle of April. According to the circular, since an accident  had occurred in the course of technological testing and the  satellite and the workshop had been damaged, the launch plan  would be rescheduled.    The circular did not disclose details of the accident or  whether or not there were casualties, but viewed from the  wording, that is, the "satellite and the workshop were damaged,"  the accident was quite serious. As the workshop at the Xichang  Satellite Launch Center for installing satellites is very big  and its ceiling is very high, it would be very difficult for an  ordinary and light explosion to damage the workshop. Moreover,  people feel that this accident was very unusual because the  Chinese authorities concerned did not mention the timing for the  rescheduled launch.    This was how things were. The news that this writer got from  the State Council Science and Technology Commission and the  State Science and Technology Commission [as published] was very  astonishing: The Fengyun-2 exploded during a satellite test and  caused a fire at 1010 on 27 March. It was learned that the  accident had caused heavy casualties, that is, 46 scientists and  functionaries were either injured or dead, and some of the  injured were sent to Beijing by special plane for treatment.  Among the dead was a CPC senior satellite expert and deputy  chief engineer of the Xichang Satellite Headquarters surnamed  Su, who headed the leading group for launching the Fengyun-2  geostationary meteorological satellite as well as the satellite  test.    The CPC's senior hierarchy was immediately called into  action  following the satellite explosion. Ding Henggao, Song Jian, and  Luo Gan rushed to the scene by special plane that very night.  On 29 March, Zou Jiahua and Zhang Wannian also went to Xichang  to carry out an inspection on behalf of the CPC Central  Committee and the CPC Central Military Commission. The  explosion was so strong that equipment worth 600 million yuan  was destroyed in an instant and the launch center could not  function. After discussions, in early April, the State Council  appropriated 350 million yuan in emergency funds for the Xichang  Satellite Center for reconstruction. As the site had been  severely burned, it is still uncertain when the center will be  able to launch satellites again.  <H5>  Different Versions of the Cause of the Accident </H5>   Different versions of this extraordinarily large satellite  accident spread. A relatively "orthodox" version said that the  test on that day was the final assessment test and that leaders  and experts concerned went there to carry out an inspection.  When the test had just began, a power source short-circuited,  causing sparks. The head of the test immediately ordered that  the operation be stopped and that all personnel retreat to the  safety room. But when the order had just been issued, the  satellite exploded and started burning. Fire fighters standing  by on the spot instantly threw themselves into the rescue  operation and put out the fire two hours later and brought the  injured out of danger.    In another version, the accident was even described as  intentional sabotage. It was alleged that the Satellite Launch  Headquarters and the chief satellite installation engineer had  carried out an assessment and considered everything to be ready  before allowing the test to be conducted on schedule. However,  three power sources short-circuited simultaneously, which was  unimaginable. That day, the person who should have been on duty  at the power supply department had suddenly been replaced by  somebody else. Following the accident, the person in charge of  the power supply room who was on duty shot himself. Some people  said that he committed suicide because he felt frustrated, while  others said that he did so to escape punishment.  <H5>  Ding Henggao, Song Jian's Instructions </H5>   Other versions tended to ascribe the cause of the accident  to  negligence and carelessness. It was alleged that at the time of  the test, a certain part of the satellite made an unusual sound  soon after it started operating and the person in charge ordered  a halt to the operation for an examination, but the operator  mistook this for accelerating the speed, and consequently the  satellite exploded.    Some people said that the head and the chief engineer had  suggested that the test be conducted after obtaining one or two  additional verifications and making further checks, but the  leaders concerned held that since time was pressing, they could  secure proofs while conducting the test. Consequently, the  accident occurred.    Other people said that something wrong had been found at the  testing ground, but that the authorities did not watch out for  it and still ordered that the test be conducted on schedule.  Consequently, the satellite exploded less than three minutes  after it started operating.    Apart from the above-mentioned versions, the accident was  also analyzed in the following way: Recently, many accidents  have occurred in the process of launching and producing  satellites, and this is related to the fact that scientists and  technicians are emotionally unstable because their pay is too  low and they have worked in a remote environment for a long  time. In addition, major accidents have occurred because the  system is so slack.    The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but  the versions spread and remarks made by Ding Henggao and Song  Jian after their inspection deserve to be pondered. At that  time, Ding and Song said in unison that the key to the problem  still lay in rigorous enforcement of rules and regulations and a  strict scientific attitude and in paying close attention to the  requests and feelings of scientists and technicians.  <H5>  Deplorable Remuneration of Personnel of the Astronautics </H5> Sector    Xichang, called Gongdu in ancient times, is situated in the  southwestern part of Sichuan Province, a zone of Central Asian  tropical plateau monsoon weather hemmed in by mountains with an  elevation of 1,590 meters, and it is painstakingly portrayed by  the official media as the "beautiful and fascinating moon city."  But in reality, the water quality of the mountain valley in  which the Xichang Satellite Launch Center is located is poor.  People are particularly fond of eating meat after drinking the  water, but they feel bloated after eating. [sentence as  published] Some people call it the "Xichang disease." Also, it  is common to have the reactions to high-plateau weather, such as  diarrhea, headaches, and fever. Intellectuals of the Xichang  Satellite Launch Center are even more distressed spiritually.  There is no fashion or pop music, but only the popular saying:  "Devoting one's youth, life, and offspring to the cause."  Vigorously played up by the CPC media, this jingle has become  the portrayal of scientists' and technicians' unselfishness.  The satellite town in Xichang is different from the nuclear  test base. The two are located in equally remote areas, but the  former officially started opening up to the outside world from 1  September 1988 and has been visited by people from over 50  countries and regions and, owing to the atmosphere of liberation  outside, the CPC's grand but empty and unreal propaganda of  "devoting oneself to the cause" can no longer be effective. In  particular, they know that in order to have a share in the  highly competitive global satellite-launching market, China has  to win launch contracts at a low price. For example, the price  for launching two satellites with a U.S. Titan-3 rocket is from  $100 million to $125 million; the General Dynamics Corporation's  price is from $40 million to $90 million; and the McDonnell  Douglas Corporation's price for launching a medium-sized  commercial communications satellite is from $45 million to $50  million. In order to compete with the "three U.S. moguls,"  China sets the satellite-launching price at $25 million only.  Such a "bargain price" is really effective and has lured  representatives of over 20 countries and regions to Xichang to  hold talks on cooperation.    The monthly pay of an intellectual of the Chinese  astronautics sector is a mere several hundred yuan, and the  saying that "one who deals with missiles is even inferior to  those selling tea" is the best portrayal of their situation.  The meager pay of satellite installation workers, who bear a  great responsibility, is really astonishing. In the Xichang  Satellite General Installation Plant, workers at grade 2 are  paid only around 50 yuan, and those at grade 8 are paid 100 yuan  for a long time without any increment. Workers worked hard  round the clock for over a year to produce the Long March 2  cluster carrier rocket, and each of them was paid merely a  little more than 200 yuan bonus, with the monthly average less  than 20 yuan. It was learned that those installing satellites  in Xichang are experienced workers with unique skills. They  thought that once commercial rockets were launched, their living  conditions would be improved, but, to their disappointment, it  was only their own wishful thinking!    There were generally grievances in the hearts of most  scientists and technicians. At the launch center monitoring  station, some young college students could no longer bear the  lifestyle of "seeing soldiers in the daytime and counting stars  at night." Some of them cried secretly, some asked for  transfers, and others simply sneaked away. However, the  authorities concerned did not pay attention to their growing  feelings of insecurity, and were stunned only by the explosion  of the Fengyun-2 satellite.  <H5>  More and More Serious Satellite Accidents </H5>   Over the past four years, four satellite accidents have  occurred in China, each more serious than the last, which will  certainly affect China's "commercial credit" in the global  satellite-launching market. Apart from the one reported in this  article, the other three accidents were as follows:    On 22 March 1992, due to a breakdown in the ignition system,  the launch of Australia's Aussat-B1 communications satellite at  the Xichang base failed.    On 21 December 1992, Australia's Optus-B2 communications  satellite exploded 48 seconds after being launched into orbit  from the Xichang base.    On 16 October 1993, China's recoverable satellite for  scientific exploration and technological experimentation broke  down and could not be recovered eight days after being launched  into orbit. The United States said it had fallen into the  Pacific, but China said it was still wandering through space.    In addition, China's "commercial image" is also called into  question by many overseas clients. For example, when the  satellite accidentally exploded on 21 December 1992, the  personnel of the Xichang Center still opened bottles of  champagne to celebrate the launch and the scene was really  bustling. In fact, the satellite exploded less than a minute  after being launched into orbit. However, China "only cared  about the launch," whereas the explosion was caused by the  satellite's internal problems, so the case should be handled by  the client!    Moreover, last year's grand launch of the satellite for  scientific and technological experimentation was even a farce.  A Mao Zedong gold badge numbered "8341," which was cast in  18-karat gold and inlaid with 44 South African diamonds (some  people revealed that the diamonds were fake), was put inside the  satellite and the company concerned had the unique idea of  selling the badge by auction after it had "travelled through the  universe" because they thought that by so doing, the badge would  certainly be sold at a much higher price. It allegedly cost  80,000 yuan to send the Mao Zedong badge into space by satellite  and a 100,000-yuan insurance premium was also paid; but a Hong  Kong company had offered to buy it for 2 million yuan, therefore  over 1 million yuan net profit would be reaped in this deal.  However, all these calculations were not realized. China has  successfully retrieved 14 recoverable satellites, but it was  such a coincidence that the satellite with the Mao Zedong badge  met with an accident and became a heap of garbage in space....</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Scoring is Ireland's problem Ireland are expected to stick to 4-5-1 against Holland, using one striker supported by five mid-fielders. Manager Jack Charlton can use first-choice full-backs Dennis Irwin and Terry Phelan, suspended for the 0-0 draw against Norway. But Ireland's problem is not defence. They are having trouble scoring. They scored only twice in three first-round games, though the manager says his team had to play in the toughest group. 'We have fully justified our presence here by qualifying (for the second round),' Charlton said. 'It's still a difficult situation for us, but I said from the beginning that if we got there we would be dangerous since the pressure would be off. 'We'll see what happens next but we've already got a solid sense of achievement.' The Irish have a fully-fit squad. 'We've now gone to the second phase of two World Cups and we would like to go a bit further,' added the manager.</p>

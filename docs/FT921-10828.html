			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on Maxwell pensions - Social Security THE GOVERNMENT yesterday pledged during blunt exchanges in Commons social security questions to underwrite the guaranteed minimum pensions of Maxwell company pensioners. Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, said the pensioners would receive the equivalent of their state earnings-related pension scheme entitlements, even if the assets in the Maxwell funds were insufficient to secure their guaranteed minimum payments. It was 'not the case that pensioners in these schemes will get nothing or be left penniless,' he said. Mr Newton was responding to opposition charges that the government was to blame for the Maxwell pensioners' misfortune since it had delayed enacting regulations that would have protected them in the event of a company winding up. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, charged the government with 'culpable negligence in sitting on these regulations' and called for all affected pensioners to receive compensation. Thousands of pensioners stood to lose 'most or all of their pensions for which they have contributed for up to 35 years' as a result of the government's 'complacency and reprehensible laxity,' he said. The Commons social security committee heard last night that the Press Association news agency 'pillaged' its pension fund to aid its redundancy programme. Mr Alfred Browne, former weekend editor of the PA and now a pensioner, said that last year an actuarial valuation found a deficit of Pounds 600,000 in the fund, despite a surplus of Pounds 4.16m in December 1987.</p>

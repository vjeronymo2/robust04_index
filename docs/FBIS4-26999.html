			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 5468) and Sun Yong (1327 </F> 0516)]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Eighth National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] Standing Committee held its seventh meeting  this morning at the CPPCC Hall. Agricultural issue topped  today's agenda.    CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan presided over and spoke at the  meeting. He said agriculture is the foundation of the national  economy. In China, agriculture has a direct bearing on economic  construction, people's life, social stability, and so forth.  The broad masses of people show great concern about ways to  solve the agricultural issue. The CPC Central Committee and the  State Council also attach great importance to the agricultural  issue and have called a number of meetings since last year to  make important arrangements. As a political organization, the  CPPCC should show concern for and attach importance to  agriculture and suggest ways and means to solve agricultural  problems.    Li Ruihuan said the CPPCC has made elaborate preparations  after deciding on the meeting agenda. The CPPCC National  Committee Office set up three inspection groups. Members of  many special committees conducted special investigation and  study. Provincial-level CPPCC organizations have also done a  great deal of work. Li Ruihuan expressed the hope that comrades  at the meeting would freely air their opinions, fulfill their  duty of taking part in politics and in political discussion, and  contribute to agricultural development.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng delivered a work report at  the  meeting on agricultural work. He said the situation of  agriculture and rural economy at present is good as a whole.  However, he called on all to see that in the course of the  rapid development of the national economy and in the process of  changing the economic system, new situation emerges in the  development of agriculture and of rural economy. China is now  faced with some issues which it cannot afford to ignore. The  CPC Central Committee and the State Council have always attached  great importance to the new situation and new problems. Both  the CPC Central Committee and various levels of governments are  adopting measures to solve those problems step by step.    He said agriculture has a direct bearing on the overall  situation of the national economic development. It will be  difficult to maintain the overall performance of the economy  unless we take steps to guarantee the basic status of  agriculture, to further enhance leadership over agricultural  and rural work, and devote more energy solving existing problems  in agriculture and in rural work. The CPC Central Committee and  the State Council have repeatedly stressed the need to attach  great importance to agriculture, called on localities and  departments to enhance leadership over agriculture and rural  work, and called for implementing measures to support and  develop agriculture in actual work.    In conclusion, Chen Junsheng said: The CPPCC has always  showed great concern for agriculture and rural work; it has  enthusiastically advanced suggestions and ideas to develop  agriculture, rural economy, and to build new, prosperous, and  civilized socialist rural areas. I want to express sincere  thanks on behalf of Premier Li Peng and the State Council. I  also hope that the CPPCC members will continue to supervise and  support our work, make even greater contributions to develop  agriculture and to revitalize rural economy.    CPPCC Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xuequan, Yang Rudai,  Wang  Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi, Deng  Zhaoxiang, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying,  Ding Guangxun, Sun Fuling, Henry Fok Ying-tung, Ma Man-kei, Zhu  Guangya, Wang Guoquan; and Secretary General Zhu Xun attended  the meeting.</p>

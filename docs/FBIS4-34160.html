			<p>BFN     [Text] National Defense Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Jorge  Patricio Arancibia has stated that the Chilean and Peruvian  Armed Forces have substantially improved their relationship as a  result of the annual meetings held by their respective chiefs of  staff.    He said that in his opinion the history of the Latin  American  countries has been marked by conflicts that have regrettably  affected the continent's relationships. Arancibia said: "This  has become a sort of culture which we are trying to modify with  these meetings designed to make our relationship more feasible,  pleasant, and attractive."    Yesterday Arancibia presided over the inauguration of the  second meeting of the Chile-Peru working group. This is a  preliminary meeting to the IX Round of Talks between the Chilean  and Peruvian Armed Forces High Commands scheduled to be held at  the end of the month in Lima.    The meeting started at 0900 in hall No. 7 of the Diego  Portales building and was attended by two special commissions:  the Peruvian commission headed by Army Colonel Mario Lucero  Welblund and the Chilean commission led by Air Force Colonel  Nelson Sanhueza Lagos.    Vice Adm. Arancibia added that during these preliminary  meetings the specific subjects to be discussed during each joint  meeting of the chiefs of staff of the various Armed Forces'  branches will be chosen.    Arancibia said: "During the past nine years we have made  progress regarding a series of measures that have allowed a  rapproachment and allowed us to establish greater and closer  relations of mutual confidence."    Arancibia said that this rapproachment has resulted in  exchanges, among other things, in the welfare field as well as  of books edited by the armed institutions of the two countries.    He added that contacts have been established at the border  sector chief level and this has made it possible to effectively  tackle and solve problems that have appeared in that area.    The working sessions between the representatives of the  chiefs of staff of the Chilean and Peruvian Armed Forces lasted  all day yesterday.</p>

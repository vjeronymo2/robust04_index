			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Subsidies urged for computer workers JAPAN'S computer makers are to seek government employment subsidies, underlining the severity of the downturn in the country's high technology industries. The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association, representing 198 companies, is to ask the Ministry of Labour for help under its employment assistance programme. This provides funds to companies in designated industries where production cuts have made it harder to keep workers in employment. The scheme, which was started in 1974, is intended to help prevent unemployment and is funded by Japan's unemployment insurance, which is compulsory. Companies belonging to one of the designated industries can apply for aid to re-train employees, transfer them to subsidiaries or other parts of the business or simply to pay staff while a factory is temporarily closed. To do so, they must provide the authorities with a convincing plan of how they intend to use the money. The Labour Ministry has recognised 119 sectors, from steel mills to vehicle body manufacturers, as industries qualifying for employment assistance. For the computer industry, however, which is applying for the first time, the need for such assistance is a clear sign of the difficult times ahead for the industry. Japan's computer output dropped 10.2 per cent last year to Y5,460bn (Pounds 32bn) in value, and the association is expecting the level to be about the same this year. It has been suffering a sharp fall in orders as Japanese companies, particularly in the financial sector, have scaled back investment. Consumers also held back from purchases towards the end of last year in the face of an intense price war, according to Dataquest, the high technology consultancy.</p>

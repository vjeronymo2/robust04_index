			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Opencast mines in the firing line / An option for ministers seeking a solution to the coal crisis IMAGINE THE reaction of shareholders and bankers if a private-sector company cut the most profitable part of its business to concentrate on a production area which had less chance of success. But that is what the government wants British Coal to do, even as it prepares it for privatisation. In its efforts to dig itself out of the problems sparked by the closure programme of deep-mined pits, the government plans to tell the corporation to reduce its highly profitable opencast operations to make room for less financially rewarding, but more politically sensitive, deep mines. The proposal, contained in the draft of the white paper on the future of coal reported in the Financial Times last Thursday, has caused deep concern at British Coal and at dozens of private-sector companies which are involved in opencast mining. One British Coal executive asked: 'How are we expected to bring our prices down to world levels if the government takes away the best parts of our business?' In strictly financial terms the case against cutting opencast output is impeccable. Last year the opencast operation contributed Pounds 171m to British Coal's total operating profits of Pounds 361m, even though it mined only 16m tonnes of coal, less than a fifth of the corporation's output. The easier access of opencast coal makes it much cheaper to extract - production costs last year were about Pounds 31 a tonne, Pounds 10 cheaper than for deep-mine coal. This means that if the government ordered British Coal to replace 4m tonnes of opencast product with deep-mine coal, then overall profitability would fall by about Pounds 40m a year. Even that might be an under-estimate since environmental considerations would lead to British Coal losing opencast greenfield sites before industrially derelict areas that are more expensive to operate because they have to be rehabilitated. British Coal could undoubtedly withstand a reduction of Pounds 40m-plus in its annual profits. Last year overall profits were Pounds 170m and significant growth is expected, even in this troubled year. But the reduction in profits would add to the government's problems of a growing public-sector borrowing requirement. It would also make the corporation less attractive to prospective purchasers in the privatisation which is planned for the middle of the decade. Lower profitability would, however, be a marginal problem compared to the effect which restrictions on opencast production would have on British Coal's ability to match the cost of coal imports. If the government were to restrict opencast mining by stricter planning controls, as seems likely, then private-sector mining companies such as RJB Mining and NSM would suffer. Private-sector mining companies might have difficulty increasing their opencast output from a combined 3m tonnes to 7m tonnes a year in five years as British Coal had previously expected. That in turn would affect their ability to buy parts of British Coal when it is privatised. Civil engineering contractors, which provide the equipment and most of the labour for opencast mining, would also be hit. Mr John Chance, chairman of Wimpey Mining which, with subsidiaries of Taylor Woodrow and Amec, is among the main contractors, said: 'We would be looking for compensation. Contractors have Pounds 1bn worth of plant employed in opencast and the majority is specialised and cannot be used in other industries. It would go to waste.' Mr Chance added: 'Each 1m tonnes of opencast provides employment for about 1,000 people, many of them in areas which were formerly mining communities.' However, there are powerful factors pressing on the government to cut opencast mining. A reduction could be portrayed as a concession to environmentalists who have long complained about the problems associated with opencast mining. The government could achieve its aims to cut production by revising the presumption in the planning guidance to local authorities that opencast mining is in the national interest. But while environmental considerations could provide the public reason for cutting opencast mining, the more pressing need is political. Having rejected the more radical suggestions the government is struggling to find all the extra coal tonnage it needs to satisfy backbenchers. The attraction of cutting opencast mining is that, because of planning permission considerations, it would start to have an effect only in the latter years of the five-year subsidy which the government is planning to implement. Most of the other measures in the white paper would increase demand in the early years but would have less effect later. This means that, in spite of the intensive lobbying it faces from British Coal engineering contractors, the government might find reducing the output from opencast mining impossible to resist.</p>

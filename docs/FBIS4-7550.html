			<p>BFN     [Text] Semily, East Bohemia, March 31 (CTK) -- If he had  not had to negotiate the division of the federation with Slovak  ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar every other day just at the time when  the constitution was being approved, he would never have allowed  the Senate to be anchored in the constitution, Premier Vaclav  Klaus said this evening.    Klaus was speaking after a public meeting of the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS), of which he is chairman.    ODS Executive Chairman Petr Cermak added that "after the  next  parliamentary elections parliament will come to believe that  rather than have a bad Senate, it will be easier to take the  Senate out of the constitution." The attempt to fill the Senate  completely in the first senatorial elections he called "an  attempt to turn round the results of the last elections, an  attempt to gain greater television exposure."    A bill which would amend the method of voting for senators  is  now the subject of controversy among the coalition partners. At  today's meeting of coalition party experts to consider the  voting laws, ODS representatives stood by their party's original  opinion, that the forthcoming senatorial elections should take  place in only a third of 81 constituencies. Deputy Radim Spacek  (Civic Democratic Alliance, ODA) said that Friday's compromise  proposal on the method of elections to the Senate had been  "decreed" by a member of the ODS, Deputy Petr Bachna.    This suggestion, Spacek told journalists today, consisted of  27 constituencies electing three senators each, with  limited-period mandates, with everybody being able to take part  in individual voting periods.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Notes on Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 </F> 0393): "Marking `Mao's Birth' Amid Cries of Reproach"]    [Text] With the approach of 26 December, the contradiction  between respecting and degrading Mao will become more pronounced  both within and outside the CPC. The top CPC leaders view the  use of "Mao's birth" to negate Deng Xiaoping's theory and line  as a "left" deviation and the total negation of Mao Zedong as a  "right" deviation. They have sensed that the resurgence of  "leftism" is very terrible. Therefore, while marking the 100th  anniversary of Mao's birth, they want to limit the scope of the  activities.  <H5>  The Contradiction Between Respecting and Degrading Mao </H5>   On 13 December, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat held a  teleconference of party and government leading cadres of  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, at which Hu  Jintao delivered a speech and conveyed the central instruction  on activities recently carried out by local authorities to mark  the centenary of the birth of Mao Zedong. The instruction says:  We must undertake commemorative activities in strict accordance  with the requirements set out by the Propaganda Department of  the CPC Central Committee, rather than on a large scale. We  must not debate the appraisal of Mao Zedong. We must not force  others to undertake such activities and must not urge  prefectures, cities, enterprises, democratic parties or  organizations to do so. We must do a good job in the current  central work and tasks, and must study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The  Central Committee urged preventing and checking both "left" and  right deviations making use of activities in some localities and  departments to stage a resurgence, as well as a guard against  negating the basic appraisal of and conclusion on Mao Zedong  which were made at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC  Central Committee.    The remark "not debating" laid bare the contradiction  between  respecting and degrading Mao, and the awkward predicament in  which the CPC decisionmaking body found itself.  <H3>  Hu Jintao: Prevent a Handful of People From Whipping Up the  "Leftist" Ideological Trend </H3>   At the conference, Hu Jintao pointed out the acuteness of  the  contradiction when he said: In some localities and departments,  debates on the appraisal of Mao Zedong and the understanding of  Mao Zedong Thought have caused work delays and even clashes at  meetings. He urged promptly correcting this abnormal,  disorganized anarchy and lack of discipline, and preventing a  handful of people in one or two departments from using  activities marking the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth to whip  up the "leftist" ideological trend, and to attack and negate  reform and opening up to the outside world, the party's central  work, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory.    The "clashes at meetings" mentioned by Hu Jintao referred to  brutally attacking each other by banging on tables. This state  of affairs is rarely seen in regular activities or at other  meetings of CPC organizations. This being the case, Hu Jintao  -- in all seriousness -- termed the state of affairs "abnormal,  disorganized anarchy and lack of disciple." This remark was  also an embodiment of Deng Xiaoping's idea of "guarding against  rightism, but mainly preventing `leftism.'"  <H3>  Those Who Want To Restore the "Leftist" Line Will Be Removed  From Office </H3>   As for as those who want to use activities marking "Mao's  birth" to restore the "leftist," line the CPC decisionmaking  body will resort to wielding the killer mace -- dismissal from  office -- against them.    At the conference, Hu Jintao said: Party committees and  governments at all levels must have a firm grasp of leadership  and the initiative, pay close attention to the current central  work, and prevent and criticize the handful of people attempting  to divert the orientation of this work. Those who refuse to  correct their mistakes after being helped must quit their  leading positions and the party.    Those who capitalize on "Mao's birth" in order to inflame  and  agitate people constitute a "tiny minority of people." Most  party- member cadres -- particularly those who greatly suffered  during the Great Cultural Revolution -- either showed  indifference or had an extremely strong aversion to "Mao's  birth."  <H5>  Marking "Mao's Birth" Is Regarded as a Task </H5>   According to restricted XINHUA news reports, most central  departments, commissions, and offices regarded conducting  activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth as a  task. The meetings, report meetings, and forums marking the  occasion were very dull and spiritless, with more than 30  percent of the expected participants requesting leave. At the  report meetings sponsored by central organs to commemorate the  centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, some veteran comrades raised  objections and said the commemoration was "inappropriate in  timing and not in keeping with the common aspirations of the  party and the people." Still other veteran comrades denounced  the errors committed by Mao Zedong during his final years and  the catastrophe brought about by the Great Cultural Revolution.  Some excessively fierce clashes between people with differing  views took place at some meetings.    These phenomena could be found among both the central and  local authorities.  <H3>  Restricted News Reports Show Local Authorities' Resistance  to Commemorating "Mao's Birth" </H3>   According to restricted XINHUA news reports on 15 and 16  December, among the activities sponsored by local authorities to  mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, the following  phenomena could be found almost everywhere.    1. Local party and government leaders regarded conducting  activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth as a task  assigned from the higher authorities; in most cases, local party  and government organizations carried the activities only  perfunctorily.    2. In doing their work, propaganda departments found  themselves under great pressure. They were afraid both of  evoking repercussions among their subordinates by exceeding the  central commemoration requirements and of not attaining the  goals of the commemoration activities.    3. Organization departments were passive in their work.  Most cadres, party members, and activists were unenthusiastic,  and some remained unconvinced as to the purpose of all the  activities.    4. Grass-roots party organizations and some party committees  stated openly that they did not want to carry out the  commemoration activities for fear that the "leftist" ideological  trend would spread again, that the activities would hamper their  work, and that they would serve as a blow to the feelings of  middle-aged and elderly intellectuals.    5. The community was interested in Mao Zedong's life, style,  and related stories, which had a relatively great impact. Some  people did not understand why the Communists -- who did not  believe in gods or heresy -- could praise and commemorate  someone as a god.    It is not difficult to understand why local cadres have  defiant feelings to the commemoration of "Mao's birth." They  all are afraid of the resurgence of "leftism" because their  interests would be greatly harmed should the disaster of  "leftism" befall the country again. This situation merits  attention.  <H3>  Peng Zhen: Do Not Provoke the People To Review the Bitter  Experiences of the Mao Years </H3>   It has been reported that in early December 1993, Peng Zhen  made another speech on the commemoration of centenary of Mao  Zedong's birth. He urged stressing on appropriateness, realism,  paying attention to reactions from within both the party and  society, and refraining from provoking the people to review the  bitter experiences of the Mao years.  <H3>  Some Eighty Research Fellows Urged the Central Committee To  Guard Against "Leftism" </H3>   More than 80 research fellows at the Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences wrote a letter to Jiang Zemin and the party  Central Committee to urge preventing Mao Zedong's "leftist"  ideological trend disrupting the current central work and  undermining the confidence and rallying force of the broad  masses of people for carrying out the four modernizations in the  spirit of seeking truth from facts, and that history, as well as  the will of the majority of people inside and outside the party,  be respected.  <H3>  The Voice Opposing the Commemoration of "Mao's Birth" Is  Building Up </H3>   At the third plenary session discussions, the party  committees of Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong,  Guangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shandong, Anhui,  Xinjiang, Qinghai, Fujian, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia  reported to the Central Committee that in society there were  strong voices opposed to commemorating the centenary of Mao  Zedong's birth. More than 17 celebrities in Shanghai and  Beijing stated that they would go on a hunger strike on 26  December to protest the commemoration.  <H3>  Two Hunan Teachers Kill Themselves To Protest "Mao's Birth"  Commemorative Activities </H3>   Unexpectedly, there actually were people who killed  themselves to protest the commemoration of "Mao's birth." This  hearsay came from Mao's birthplace: Hunan.    Since the beginning of 1993, two middle school teachers from  Hengyang and Xiangtan cities in Hunan had written 10 or more  letters to the CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang  Zemin, and the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee, calling for a  halt to nationwide activities marking the centenary of Mao  Zedong's birth or at least for carrying out the activities in a  low-key manner. They said the activities should be carried out  in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation.    In August, during the summer holidays, with the signatures  of  nearly 30 university and middle school teachers, the two  teachers asked to go to Beijing to make their demands known. A  deputy director of the Complaints Bureau of the State Council  said: We understand your wishes, but the matter must be decided  by the Central Committee. The Hunan Provincial CPC Committee  criticized the two teachers and warned them against being used  and against creating chaos.    It has been reported that the two teachers wrote a letter to  Deng Xiaoping entitled "Comrade Xiaoping, People Are Longing for  Your Decision" and a letter to Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central  Committee entitled "To Make Fresh Contributions to the People,  It Is Imperative To Thoroughly Criticize Mao." Time and again,  the two teachers' demands and protests were rejected, distorted,  and shelved the moment they were submitted. In despair, the two  teachers committed suicide by throwing themselves into the Xiang  Jiang on 26 November. The Hunan Provincial Government accused  them of being "distraught."    The emergence of activities to mark "Mao's birth" and  related  events has proved that the root of "leftism" is still with the  CPC, the disaster of "leftism" has not been eradicated, and the  soul of "leftism" still haunts Zhongnanhai.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: European markets vault on poll results A WEEK is a long time in politics and last week was no exception, with elections in Italy, Germany and the UK each having an impact on their respective markets. But Japan remained a dark shadow in the corner ready to spring yet another surprise. Having slipped to a five-year low at the beginning of the week, Tokyo then fell even further before picking up 7.6 per cent on Friday. The effect on the FT Actuaries World Index, however, was partly offset by a stronger Wall Street, which was given a boost by a cut in the federal funds rate, and firm European bourses. One of the exceptions to the positive sentiment in Europe was Austria. The resurgence of conflict in Yugoslavia and some bad corporate results depressed investors. OMV, the oil group, came under pressure on concerns over its exposure to Libya, which faces the imposition of UN sanctions. Another market leader, Universale, the construction group, also fell back after reporting losses in its Venezuelan division. Ireland was strong last week, although most of the gains came after the UK election results on Friday. However, a strike at the country's four main clearing banks, which appeared to be moving in favour of the employers, and better-than-expected results from Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and ceramics group, also helped. Mexico continued the previous week's decline as investors remained nervous following the postponment of talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Money was also being moved from equities into Treasury bonds after the raising of interest rates. The UK market responded to the Conservative party's return to government with a rally on Friday that was the biggest rise in a single day since the market crash of October 1987. For the political pollsters, however, it was not a day for celebration - they had all got their forecasts wrong.</p>

Discretionary funds, pursuant to Section 646 of the DOE Organization Act, are awarded to Indian tribes to participate in DOE's remediation and management program for wastes produced as the result of its activities at its former and current weapons production facilities. Such participation relates directly to DOE's American Indian Tribal Government policy, pursuant to DOE Order 1230.2, recognizing a government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the potential for broad interest, DOE is providing interested parties an opportunity for comment on issues related to the funding of Indian tribes who are directly affected by DOE activities. DOE invites written comment on the criteria development process before proposing guidelines. In addition, DOE will schedule public workshops at several of its sites. Announcement of the location, date, and time of the public workshops will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . At these workshops, tribes and other interested parties will have an opportunity to further discuss issues related to guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written submissions on this notice of inquiry are due on or before June 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be submitted to Margaret Fernandez, Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management, Office of Public Accountability (EM&hyph;5), U.S. Department of Energy, Room 5B&hyph;031, 1000 Independence Ave. SW., Washington DC 20585.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1989, the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management was established to address environmental problems at the Department's facilities. Many of the Department's past, present, and future activities potentially affect Indian tribes. Past activities of DOE involved the research and production of plutonium, uranium, and other hazardous substances. Present and future activities focus on the management and remediation of wastes produced as a result of the Department's production activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because DOE's activities may affect tribes in close proximity to DOE sites, the Department's policy is to consult with these tribes and support tribal environmental remediation programs. The fundamental goals of DOE's policy are to involve affected tribes in remediation activities, provide tribes safe access to and management of cultural and natural resources, and promote tribal economic competitiveness and self-sufficiency pursuant to administration policy and legal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, DOE discretionary funds have been distributed to Indian tribes primarily through planning grants. Planning grants have funded tribal environmental restoration and waste management programs to identify, analyze and take initiatives to address waste management and cleanup issues stemming from DOE sites and facilities. The Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Yakima Indian Nation have received planning grants related to the Hanford site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative to planning grants, DOE has used cooperative agreements to fund tribal activities. A cooperative agreement requires greater involvement between DOE and the participant in negotiating and conducting the proposed activities. This involvement results in specific project milestones and products that ensure greater accountability. The Department has successfully employed cooperative agreements to implement hazardous materials emergency response programs, as occurred in the case of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project with the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, and at the Hanford site with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Based on this experience, DOE intends to use cooperative agreements as the prime vehicle for tribal involvement in environmental remediation activities. In addition to the use of cooperative agreements, the government-to-government relationship between DOE and tribal nations may also be expressed through site-specific agreements, memoranda of understanding, and joint ventures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of DOE discretionary funds available for tribal cleanup activities in the early years of the DOE environmental program was based on large projected budget increases. However, present and anticipated budget constrictions for the EM program only allow for moderate funding. As a result, the amount of funds available for tribal environmental management and cleanup activities has leveled, while the degree of involvement by tribes, and the number of tribes that want to be involved in remediation activities, continue to grow. Budget limitations, coupled with DOE's commitment to involve affected tribes in its cleanup and management activities, necessitate the development of standards and guidance for disbursement of DOE discretionary funds to tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These standards will require the development of criteria relating to eligibility and funding. Eligibility criteria would determine which tribes would qualify to enter into cooperative agreements with DOE. Funding criteria would determine the types of activities that are to be funded and the levels of funding. DOE acknowledges that eligibility and funding criteria may utilize similar factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Tome, 19 May (AFP) -- Sao Tomean Prime Minister  Norberto Costa Alegre's party, the Democratic Convergence Party  [PCD], has accused President Miguel Trovoada of setting  "conditions which might bring down the government, as was the  case in May 1992, when former Prime Minister Daniel Daio was  dismissed," the party newspaper reported in Sao Tome today.    These accusations come amidst tension between President  Trovoada and the government, following attacks published by the  government newspaper, NOTICIAS, against the president. The  newspaper is run by a PCD parliamentarian, Martihno Tavares.    According to a source at the presidency, President Trovoada  asked the premier to intervene to put an end to the attacks.  The newspaper further accused President Trovoada of "not  respecting the agreement reached between himself and the PCD  during the 1991 democratic transitional period." The newspaper  did not state what that agreement was.    President Trovoada was elected at the beginning of 1992  during the country's first multiparty presidential elections, in  which he stood as an independent candidate. The government was  formed following the country's first multiparty parliamentary  elections, which the PCD won.    President Trovoada dismissed Premier Daniel Daio in April  1992 following a sociopolitical crisis linked with the adoption  of austerity measures, an increase in the price of petroleum  products, and the 40-percent devaluation of their currency, the  dobra. Finance Minister Costa Alegre then took over as prime  minister.</p>

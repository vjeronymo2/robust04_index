			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [2 May] the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP] leadership confirmed in Bonn the  intention to continue the coalition with the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] after the  Bundestag elections on 16 October with an almost unanimous  decision in the Executive Committee. At the vote in the Federal  Executive Committee, which consists of 48 members, four members  abstained, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel told the press.    The Executive Committee thus followed the vote of the  12-person FPD Presidium, which had unanimously voted in favor of  continuing the coalition with the CDU/CSU on 11 April, upon  Kinkel's recommendation. In Bonn it is not doubted that the FDP  Congress, which has the last say, will also agree to this  decision in Rostock at the beginning of June.    Kinkel said that the clarification of the coalition  statement  has strengthened the FDP's ability to act in material issues.  Polls confirm that the Liberals are "on their way up." The  prospects for a success of the coalition on 16 October have  improved considerably. The CDU and the CSU now must also  contribute their share to a positive result. The FDP will  pursue the election campaign with a view to the coalition  partner, following the slogan "marching separately, attacking  together."    The FDP chairman announced that the FDP election program,  which is to be adopted in Rostock, will be the basis of the  negotiations with the CDU/CSU for the next legislative period.  He said that the FDP is a guarantor against a red-green  coalition and against a grand coalition. In his view, a  red-green government would lead to a crisis of trust in foreign  policy and to a disaster for the economy and for jobs. A grand  coalition would be "autocratic rule by two."</p>

Tohoku  Electric Power Company is planning to build the plant (in Miyagi  Prefecture). The last public hearing on nuclear power facilities  that MITI held was a hearing on Tokyo Electric Power Company's  Kashiwazaki-Kariwa No. 6 nuclear power plant over six years ago.    Dozens of members of an anti-nuclear group who were opposed  to the hearing barged into the entrance of the gymnasium to  protest and shout their slogans. Chaos ensued when some members  of the group forcefully broke through the entrance gate and  jostled with MITI officials and Miyage Prefecture police.    The hearing started with an explanation of Tohoku Electric  Power Company's plans to establish the new facility. Then, 20  people selected beforehand from five nearby towns stated their  opinions, and company officials responded to their questions.    The Onogawa No. 3 power plant, which will have a  conventional  boiling- water reactor (BWR) like plants No. 1 and No. 2, will  have an output of 825,000 kW. Commercial operation of plant No.  3 is planned to begin in March 2002.    The Onogawa No. 1 power plant (524,000 kW) is already in  commercial operation. Plant No. 2 (825,000 kW) has been under  construction since 1989; the target for its completion is 1995.  However, nearby residents have instituted a law suit demanding  suspension of the construction of No. 2 plant. For the first  time in Japan a court order was given in June mandating the  submission of the nuclear reactor's internal data and materials,  such as security provisions.</p>

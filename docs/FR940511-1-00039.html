The nature and use of the household substance. 15 U.S.C. 1472(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These items have been considered with respect to the various determinations made in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> E. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The PPPA provides that no regulation shall take effect sooner than 180 days or later than one year from the date such regulation is issued, except that, for good cause, the Commission may establish an earlier effective date if it determines an earlier date to be in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. 1471n.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of their voluntary program, members of the NDMA and the CFTA are already implementing assembly line and mass production techniques to package ethanol-containing mouthwashes with CR packages. These groups have indicated that their program will be fully implemented by May 1, 1995, and will involve at least 95 percent of the industry's sales. Furthermore, these groups have indicated that each of their members will have at least one size of product in CR packaging by August 31, 1994. Thus, it appears that the manufacturers will be phasing in CR packaging over various product sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it appears that as the end of the industry's phase-in period approaches, there will be a relatively small portion of production that would not be in CR packaging. At least one major manufacturer has already started using CR packaging on what reportedly is a major portion of its production. The Commission concludes that even the few packagers of mouthwash products containing 3 grams or more of ethanol that are not participating in the voluntary program should be able to implement CR packaging for their products by 6 months after the issuance of a final rule, or by May 1, 1995, whichever is sooner, without serious adverse economic effects. Any packagers that did not have their assembly lines for CR packaging fully operational by that time could obtain appropriate packaging on an interim basis from contract packers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the final rule is proposed to become effective 180 days after issuance of a final rule, or May 1, 1995, whichever is sooner, as to all products subject to the rule that are packaged on or after that date. It is possible, therefore, that the effective date will be less than 180 days after issuance of the final rule. The Commission finds that there is good cause for preliminarily determining that an effective date of less than 180 days is in the public interest. This determination is based on (1) the desirability of having CR packaging for this product on the market as soon as practicable in order to reduce the risk of ethanol poisonings to children from a widely distributed product and (2) the fact that, under the industry's voluntary program, at least 95 percent of the industry will be in compliance by May 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> F. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> When an agency undertakes a rulemaking proceeding, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., generally requires the agency to prepare proposed and final regulatory flexibility analyses describing the impact of the rule on small businesses and other small entities. The purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as stated in section 2(b) (5 U.S.C. 602 note), is to require agencies, consistent with their objectives, to fit the requirements of regulations to the scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to the regulations. Section 605 of the Act provides that an agency is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis if the head of an agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's Directorate for Economics has prepared a preliminary economic assessment of a rule to require special packaging for mouthwash preparations with 3 g or more of ethanol in a single package. Based on this assessment, the Commission concludes that such a requirement would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses or other small entities because of the widespread acceptance of the voluntary CR packaging program. CR packaging for mouthwash preparations is readily available at an incremental cost of one-half to two cents per closure, and the PPPA permits manufacturers to market preparations in one non-CR size. The relatively low costs of CR packages should not be a burden to current small business manufacturers or an entry burden for future marketers. Manufacturers would be given enough time to use up existing supplies of non-CR packages and to obtain suitable CR packaging and incorporate its use into their packaging lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, for the reasons given above, the Commission preliminarily concludes that the rule to require special packaging for mouthwashes containing 3 g or more of ethanol would not have any significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> G. Environmental Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations and CPSC procedures for environmental review, the Commission has assessed the possible environmental effects associated with the proposed Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) packaging requirements for ethanol-containing products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1021.5(c)(3) state that rules requiring special packaging for consumer products normally have little or no potential for affecting the human environment. Preliminary analysis of the potential impact of this proposed rule indicates that CR packages for certain mouthwash preparations would have no significant effects on the environment. This is because the rule will not significantly increase the number of CR packages in use and, in any event, the manufacture, use, and potential disposal of the CR packages present the same potential environmental effects as do the currently used packages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

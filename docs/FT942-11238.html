			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Associate companies help News Corp rise by 28% News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media and publishing group, yesterday announced a 27.6 per cent rise in net profits but before abnormal items, to ADollars 852.8m (Pounds 410m) in the nine months to end-March. Profits in the third quarter were ADollars 227.9m, up from ADollars 178.4m. But, as in previous quarters, the improvement was due to associate companies  -BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster, and Ansett Airlines - and reduced interest charges. BSkyB had 3.4m subscribers - an increase of more than 1m since last June. News News owns 50 per cent of BSkyB. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a minority interest. But operating profits from News' core newspaper and publishing operations fell to ADollars 303.7m in the quarter from ADollars 373.4m a year ago. Their operating profits in the first nine months stood at ADollars 1.16bn, down from ADollars 1.24bn. Group revenues were ADollars 2.59bn (from ADollars 2.64bn) in the third quarter, and ADollars 8.42bn (ADollars 8bn) in the nine months. News said filmed entertainment, television and TV guide business showed 'strong gains,' but these were offset by lower results from UK newspapers, book publishing and the 'free standing inserts' division. Results in 1992-93 were also boosted by the inclusion of the South China Morning Post, now sold. However, even after adjusting for this, nine-month operating profits nudged down to ADollars 1.17bn from ADollars 1.13bn. On the newspaper side, operating profits fell from ADollars 167.9m to ADollars 91.3m in the third quarter, due to the UK price war and SCMP omission. However, News said its strategy of boosting circulation by cover price reductions was being achieved, with The Sun's circulation up by 16 per cent, and The Times by a third. That allowed The Sun to increase advertising rates, and advertising revenues generally were up 11 per cent year-on-year. Book-publishing made a ADollars 22.1m loss (from a ADollars 3.6m profit) in the quarter. Magazines and inserts made ADollars 92.5m in operating profits, down from ADollars 113.4m, but television improved from ADollars 55.2m to ADollars 79.7m, and filmed entertainment from ADollars 31.9m to ADollars 61.9m. Associate companies contributed ADollars 102.4m in the third quarter, compared with ADollars 28.9m. Interest charges dipped from ADollars 180.4m to ADollars 158.3m. A net abnormal charge of ADollars 5.2m in the quarter, compared with a ADollars 12.3m profit last year, left attributable net profits at ADollars 222.7m (ADollars 190.7m). The nine-month figure after abnormals stood at ADollars 991.6m (ADollars 643.5m). Lex, Page 20</p>

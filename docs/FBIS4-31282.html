			<p>BFN     [Text] President Milan Kucan talked to Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman in the presidential residence in Zagreb this  morning for more than two hours. Slovene Foreign Ministry  adviser Ida Mocilnik and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic  also participated in the talks. Let us listen to a report by  Nadja Pengov:    [Begin recording] [Pengov] We established that the  relations have been stagnating for a long period of time,  President Kucan said in a statement for the public, and we had  to ask ourselves whether this was in the vital interest of  Slovenia and Croatia:    [Kucan] We have established that this is not in our interest  and does not suit the vital interests of any of the countries,  and that we must thus find solutions, even if they prove to be  demanding and difficult ones. Our discussion was very frank,  fierce, and in some points also very hard, which means that  these problems cannot be solved by silence, without a constant  dialogue and capability for dialogue.    [Pengov] We are convinced, President Kucan continued, that  such an assessment will also be adopted by the incumbent offices  of our states and agreed that unilateral and imposed solutions  do not contribute toward the deepening of trust between the two  countries.    The international community also does not want members who  cannot negotiate. Some international circumstances have  changed, Kucan continued, while we have been receiving  discouraging news from our western neighbor [Italy]. Also:    [Kucan] Mr. President and I both concluded -- which makes me  particularly happy -- that our statements and conclusions about  the need for good relations alone are not sufficient if they are  not followed up by concrete actions.    [Pengov] Now to Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman.  There is a high degree of consensus in the views on essential  issues despite open questions. There are no such problems in  the relations between the countries that could not be resolved.    [Tudjman, in Croatian fading into Slovenian translation]  Numerous reasons exist for our governments to accelerate the  resolution of open and controversial problems, President Tudjman  said and especially emphasized the importance of refraining from  exaggeration of problems in the public. He spoke in favor of  the relations that will help both sides.    In his statement he also warned of the neo-Fascists  appetites  for the Slovene and Croatian territories, even though he  expressed hope that the new Italian Government will pursue its  old policy in its relations with neighbors. He also warned of  some tendencies for the formation of a sort of new Yugoslavia.    Regarding the relations between the countries, he said the  following: There are no territorial demands, he said. The  issue of Trdinov Vrh [Sveta Gera], Piran Bay, and the Phyrn  highway [Sentilj-Zagreb] need to be resolved as quickly as  possible. The economic relations must be developed on the basis  of a deeper cooperation and we are interested in taking a joint  path toward European integration, he said. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Troubling memories of the 1930s - London Markets WHO WROTE this, and when?: 'It is now fairly obvious that we are on the downward slope of an international credit cycle. The intensity of our own problem today is due to the fact that we now have the influence of this international depression superimposed on our own pre-existing domestic troubles. A year or two ago our troubles were primarily domestic; now the international problem is at least equally important.' Those words come from John Maynard Keynes, in the spring of 1930. They describe the dilemma of the Major government as accurately as that of Ramsay Macdonald's. And they cast an intriguing light on the events of the past week. On Friday, for example, a 1 per cent cut in UK interest rates resulted in only a 17.3 point rise in the FT-SE share index, because the market had a nervous eye cocked at Wall Street's jitters. And earlier in the week, while the job losses at British Coal monopolised the attention of the UK press, Siemens and BASF were adding several thousand job cuts to the steady stream of labour reductions at big German companies. Back in 1930, Keynes was a vigorous participant in the debate - which raged over the next two years - about whether Britain should seek to escape through devaluation from a fixed exchange rate system; and, once that had taken place, what post-devaluation policy should be. In the passage quoted earlier, he summed up one particularly intractable aspect of the problem: the way in which a UK economic crisis, caused by the failure of domestic policies, had been made much worse by a global depression. At the time, though, it was often hard to disentangle the domestic and the international aspects of the crisis, the economic and the political. Just so this week, as headlines about the EC emergency summit at Birmingham have jostled for prominence with those about the closure of more than half British Coal's mines. In the background, however, lies a worsening economic picture almost everywhere. JP Morgan, the big US bank, has nearly halved its forecast for growth in the industrialised world next year, to 1.2 per cent. Within that, forecasts for economic growth in Britain's most important group of trading partners, its fellow members of the European Community, range from a high of 0.9 per cent in Spain to a low of minus 0.5 per cent in the western part of Germany. Of course, though these estimates may still prove to be optimistic, they are not the world-wide slump that Britain had to cope with in the early 1930s. Equally, however, they offer little immediate hope that the British economy can be tugged back to prosperity by expansion elsewhere. Forced to rely, therefore, on estimates of the likely impact of domestic policy, the market has responded by sitting on its hands. After the immediate sharp rise that followed sterling's escape from the ERM, the FT-SE index has moved sideways, closing on Friday at 2563.9, 3.1 points below the level at which it closed the week of sterling's ERM suspension. It is still 173.9 points below the level of 2737.8 reached in May this year. Adjusted for inflation, it has lost nearly a third of its value since the summer of 1987. Another sign of the times is the performance of the gilt market, where long-term interest rates jumped nearly a full percentage point in the fortnight after sterling's departure from the ERM, to 9.6 per cent, reflecting fears of higher inflation. Since October 6, however, they have been falling: the 9 per cent gilt maturing in 2008 closed at 8.97 per cent, down a quarter-point on the week. One possible explanation for the relatively strong performance of long gilts in recent days might be that investors were confident that the government had a long-term plan for controlling inflation. However, since what most investors think about the performance of the government is unprintable, that is unlikely to be the right answer. One explanation could be that fixed-interest investors believe the economy is now so depressed that no amount of short-term political expediency will raise the risks of inflation. Confusion might be as likely a cause, since prices of index-linked gilts also rose yesterday. The gloom over the domestic economy is reflected in the performance of the two indices shown in the chart. One of them, the FT-SE 100, is the familiar index of the UK market's biggest stocks. The other, the FT-SE Mid 250, is the new index that captures the performance of the next 250 companies - again ranked by market market capitalisation. Over the course of the year, there have been quite big swings in the performance of the two indices, reflecting the balance of investors expectations about whether the big international stocks in the FT-SE 100 would do better than their more domestically oriented counterparts in the FT-SE Mid 250. Over the past week, the pattern has been one in which a drop in the FT-SE 100 index is exactly mirrored by a drop in the Mid 250; but a rise in the FT-SE 100 attracts only a feeble imitation from the Mid 250. As a result, though the FT-SE 100 is only 6 per cent or so adrift of its May high, the Mid 250 is more than 15 per cent below the figure it reached then. FT-SE 100 stocks, many of them big overseas earners, are clearly seen as better insulated from the woes of the British economy than their mid-sized counterparts. One FT-SE Mid 250 company, RHM, this week failed to do much to help the index. It announced its response to a Pounds 780m all-cash takeover bid from Hanson: a demerger into three parts. To strengthen the weakest of those parts, the baking and milling division, it agreed to buy Federal Bakeries from Dalgety. Though the demerger offers shareholders, in principle, the opportunity to profit themselves from any value released by the break-up - rather than handing it over to Lord Hanson - the market appeared disappointed. RHM's shares rose only 5p to 246p, 26p above Hanson's cash offer.</p>

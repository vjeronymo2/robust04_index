			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SELF PROTECTION;  </P> <P> PREPARING YOURSELF FOR SURPRISE;  </P> <P> HOME ALARMS;  </P> <P> LOWER PRICES OPEN DOORS TO HIGH-TECH SECURITY  </P> <P> In medieval times, a moat and drawbridge kept most intruders out of the castle.  But modern Orange County residents increasingly are turning to sophisticated  high-tech equipment to protect their dwellings.  </P> <P> Police and security specialists say there are several reasons for the boom in  burglar-alarm sales. More families are relying on two incomes, and their  deserted homes become tempting break-in targets during daytime hours.  </P> <P> At the same time, the price of home security equipment has dropped, putting it  well within the reach of budget-conscious families. Today's high-tech alarms  also appeal to young adults who have become hooked on electronic gadgetry, from  personal computers to compact discs.  </P> <P> Finally, daily reports of gang violence and drug abuse have heightened concerns  about personal safety. Although home burglary reports in Orange County have  been declining slightly since 1984, a single high-profile crime spree can send  many residents scrambling for protection.  </P> <P> "When the Night Stalker was out, our phone didn't stop ringing," recalled  Clarence Peer, owner of Dial One Amtech Security Corp. in Brea. "We were  backlogged continuously."  </P> <P> Today, security-conscious homeowners are faced with a dizzying array of  products and services, from install-it-yourself alarms for less than $500 to  customized technician-installed systems for up to $25,000.  </P> <P> Sensing a growing demand for modestly priced systems, mass marketers such as  Brinks and Black &amp; Decker have targeted the Orange County home security  market in recent years, creating mixed reactions from independent installers.  </P> <P> "They advertise a lot," said Peer. "It makes people more aware, and it helps  all of us."  </P> <P> But he added: "These cut-rate prices are exactly that -- their marketing  philosophy is to put a lot of systems in very quickly and pick up the monthly  monitoring account. Then people have to be concerned about how well it will be  serviced."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Brinks and Black &amp; Decker insist that the quality of their  products is comparable to that offered by independent installers. Nationwide  marketing helps them keep the costs down, they said.  </P> <P> George De Marco, president of the Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn. of Orange  County, said he's not disturbed by the lower-priced systems. "I think there's a  market for that," said De Marco, who is president of Greater Alarm Co. in  Huntington Beach. "More competition is good for any industry."  </P> <P> Nearly 19,000 home burglaries occurred in Orange County during 1988, according  to the California Bureau of Crime Statistics. Of these, 9,577 occurred during  daytime hours and 4,960 at night. The time of the break-in was uncertain in the  remaining 4,428 burglaries. Security experts say 85% of home  </P> <P> burglaries occur when no one is at home. The front door is the most common  entry point, with windows a distant second.  </P> <P> Homeowners who buy burglar alarms usually announce it to potential thieves via  lawn signs or window stickers.  </P> <P> "Crooks are not smart but they are percentage players," said Robert M. Johnson,  president of Anaheim-based Central Station Security Systems, which handles  burglar alarm calls from 31,000 homes and businesses. "The first purpose (of a  home security system) is to be visible as a deterrent. The second part is to  detect an entry and to let everyone know a burglary has been committed -- even  the burglar."  </P> <P> Police agencies concede that they can't constantly patrol the neighborhoods  targeted by burglars. "We have absolutely no problem whatsoever with anyone who  wants to make their life more secure by installing a home security system,"  said Lt. Richard Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> But residents of unincorporated Orange County and most of the county's cities  must pay a penalty if they trigger more than two or three false alarms annually  to the Sheriff's Department or local police. The fines vary by city, but in  Newport Beach, repeated false alarms can result in a fine of more than $100.  </P> <P> Security experts say a home burglar commonly seeks a television set, video  recorder or computer in the family room and cash, jewelry or firearms in the  master bedroom.  </P> <P> To prevent such break-ins, the typical home security system uses electrical  contacts that signal a controller box when a door or window is open while the  system is active. A resident usually has about 40 seconds to turn off the  system by punching a code into a key pad, similar to that on a touch-tone  phone.  </P> <P> If the code is not entered, the alarm sounds, usually causing the intruder to  flee immediately. Many systems are also connected to an automatic telephone  dialer that either signals police directly or alerts a security monitoring  service.  </P> <P> If a service is used, the operator usually telephones the home. If the alarm  was triggered accidentally, the resident gives a password, and the alarm is  disregarded. If no one answers or an incorrect password is given, the operator  contacts the local police department.  </P> <P> Subscribing to a monitoring service generally costs $20 to $30 per month.  Proponents say these private operators prevent police from being flooded with  false alarm calls.  </P> <P> In addition to the door and window contacts, many home security systems use  motion detectors that trigger an alarm when an intruder is inside. These  include infrared models that sense body heat, photoelectric units that activate  when an intruder breaks a light beam and ultrasonic detectors that use sound  waves to find moving objects.  </P> <P> People who have indoor pets face an extra challenge when using motion  detectors. In some cases, the devices can be positioned to create "pet alleys"  so animals moving close to the floor will not set off the alarm.  </P> <P> Another alternative is an under-carpet foot sensor that is triggered by the  weight of human intruder but not a lighter pet.  </P> <P> For residents who worry about a face-to-face confrontation with an intruder,  many security systems also provide panic buttons in the bedroom and elsewhere  to allow immediate activation of the alarm. Portable panic buttons that fit  inside a purse provide peace of mind when walking from the car to the house.  </P> <P> Beyond burglary, a security system can be linked to a smoke detector to summon  firefighters even if one is at home when a blaze begins.  </P> <P> The cost and sophistication of home security systems vary significantly. Alarm  sensors can be wired directly to the controller, running beneath the carpet or  through the attic. Or battery-powered wireless sensors can trigger the alarm  with radio signals or audible tones.  </P> <P> For the do-it-yourself set, Radio Shack offers motion sensors, sirens and entry  switches or alarm package sets starting at less than $150.  </P> <P> For $295, Brinks will install a hard-wire system with three entry switches and  one interior motion detector. Brinks retains ownership of the equipment and  requires a minimum two-year subscription to its monitoring service, which costs  $19.95 a month.  </P> <P> For about $500, Black &amp; Decker sells a wireless system that the homeowner  can install with just a screwdriver. It includes sensors for six entry points,  two sirens and a lamp flasher. A telephone dialer and monitoring service are  options that about one-third of Black &amp; Decker's customers choose for an  extra charge, company spokesman Peter Neville said.  </P> <P> Residents who hire an independent security firm to install a customized  hard-wire system in an average Orange County home can expect to pay about  $1,500. But that cost can vary according to the size of the home and complexity  of the system.  </P> <P> BUYING A HOME SECURITY SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn. of Orange County and local police offer these  tips for buying a home security system:  </P> <P> * Get estimates from at least three companies and make sure the quotes are for  comparable equipment and services.  </P> <P> * Find out how long the company has been in business and ask for references.  Make sure the company is licensed by the California Department of Consumer  Affairs. For elaborate installations, a state contractor's license may also be  needed.  </P> <P> * The county and most Orange County cities have burglar alarm laws. Find out  about permit requirements, false alarm penalties and restrictions on the length  of time a burglar alarm is allowed to sound.  </P> <P> * Ask if a monthly security monitoring contract is required. Ask about  connection to a smoke alarm, if that protection is desired.  </P> <P> Burglary by the numbers: CLIPBOARD, N2  </P></p>

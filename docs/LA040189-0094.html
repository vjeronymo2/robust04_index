			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESTAVERDE AND WIFE OF NINE MONTHS AGREE TO DIVORCE BECAUSE OF HIS TEMPER  </P> <P> Vinny Testaverde, quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said the breakup of  his nine-month marriage has nothing to do with fame, money, jealousy or  bitterness, but rather a longtime problem -- his temper.  </P> <P> "I've been seeing a counselor because I have a temper, which I never wanted to  believe was a problem," said Testaverde, who married Laura Gambucci last June  11.  </P> <P> "I hoped it would be different. I kept thinking it would get better," his wife  said. "During the season, I just chose to ignore it . . . and not distract  Vinny. But then after the season, it was just a little overwhelming."  </P> <P> Vinny Testaverde filed for divorce Wednesday in Tampa, saying the marriage was  "irretrievably broken."  </P> <P> Testaverde insisted the tribulations he suffered on the field through two  losing seasons were not to blame for the flareups, saying: "The season had  nothing to do with it. The problems were there way before . . . "  </P> <P> The couple said the divorce was amicable and all claims against each other have  been settled. They would not reveal the amount of a lump-sum alimony payment  that was a condition of the settlement.  </P> <P> Testaverde, 25, met his wife in Tempe, Ariz., in January of 1987, when he was  preparing for the Fiesta Bowl with the Miami Hurricanes.  </P> <P> His wife, an aerobics instructor, said she feared her husband at times and  decided to end things before the situation got out of hand.  </P> <P> "It's best to do this and not go on hurting each other," Testaverde said.  </P></p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Nigeria turns to business leaders TWO WEALTHY businessmen with no direct experience of government will contest Nigeria's presidential elections, due to take place in June. A scheduled handover of power in August would end a decade of military rule in the country. Mr Bashir Tofa, a businessman from the northern city of Kano, won almost unanimous support from the 5,000 delegates at the National Republican Convention (NRC) convention on Sunday in Port Harcourt. Mr Mko Abiola, who owns a domestic airline and newspaper group, was endorsed at the Social Democratic Party (SDP) convention in the central Nigerian city of Jos on Sunday. Both men are Moslems but have contrasting approaches to politics. Mr Tofa has a low-key style but lacks the popular appeal and oratory of Mr Abiola. A key factor in the outcome will be the choice of running mates. Mr Tofa is likely to chose a Christian from the south, while some observers expect Mr Abiola to select a prominent northern Christian. But there is a strong possibility that Mr Abiola may be confident enough of the backing of the predominantly Christian Yoruba ethnic group, to which he belongs, to choose a northern Moslem politician in order to strengthen his appeal in the region. In the NRC convention, Mr Tofa heavily defeated his main rivals from the north, Dr Dalhatu Tafida and Mr Samalia Mamman, for the nomination. Mr Joe Nwodo, a prominent lawyer from Enugu, finished third and is expected to be Mr Tofa's nomination for the vice-presidency. Mr Abiola narrowly won the first ballot of the SDP's convention, with 3,617 votes, 392 more than his main competitor, Mr Baba Gana Kingibe. Voting at the conventions was well ordered and peaceful. Since January the National Electoral Commission has assumed direct control of the two parties' presidential campaigns and has so far succeeded in eliminating electoral irregularities which marred last year's primaries and led to the disqualification of all last year's presidential aspirants.</p>

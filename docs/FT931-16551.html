			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Lots of of blood in the soap dish - Television As you may have gathered, one way of starting the new year at a serious social disadvantage is not to have seen The Vampyr, BBC 2's soap opera cum blood-bath set in the luxury apartments and river frontages of Docklands. Unhappy creature, you missed the quintet of the car-wash attendants whose line, 'London Transport makes me sick', rhymed not just with 'quick', but also with 'prick'. You also missed the socialites' black sabbath among the stuffed fish in the Saatchi Gallery, not to mention the soprano aria with synchronised swimming in the penthouse pool . . . And what good puns there were as the vampire, woken by a bulldozer from three centuries of slumber in a subterranean Docklands drain, profitted from a 'cut-throat climate' to join the property developers and sink his teeth into their bimbo girl-friends and offspring. But before you collapse from terminal regret, an omnibus edition of The Vampyr will be shown on Saturday at 9.55 on BBC2. The rest of us saw it screened as five half-hour episodes culminating last Sunday evening when, to a hushed chorus of 'Jeeee-sus Christ]', the stunned Sloanes congregated for a society wedding saw a cross plummet into the evil heart of Ripley the Vampyr. Cue for baritone Omar Ebrahim to sprout his fangs again and for yet another tidal wave of blood to engulf our screens. The Vampyr is an adaptation (musically faithful, I am told) of an opera written in 1828 by Heinrich Marschner, a Bohemian born lawyer who throve when he turned to the opera business. According to Grove's, Marschner had a hand in the formation of Wagner, although to judge from this opera it was more like a finger-nail. So it was not great music, although the overture recurring nightly as the theme tune has since proved horribly hummable. Janet Street-Porter and Nigel Finch produced and directed this magnificent exercise in operatic overkill, with Charles Hart (responsible for Aspects of Love) as librettist. As a fan of Opera Factory, I was delighted to detect everywhere the hand of another collaborator, the wonderfully inventive David Freeman. It may be that The Vampyr will lose something in its omnibus version. After all, part of the joke was seeing how neatly a rather unremarkable 19th-century opera can adapt to being seen in instalments. I also wonder whether a fizzing cocktail of sex and gore (did you notice the wonderful canapes shaped like eyeballs at the gallery reception?) would be quite so funny swallowed at one go. Too much blood in the soap-dish just might begin to pall. It was an interesting week on TV for property developers with an interest in both Docklands and the City. In its first week of taking over the ITV franchise, Carlton TV launched A Day in the Life (Tuesday 7.30), a series in which Desmond Wilcox visits London landmarks. This week's portrait to Docklands gave a voice to some of the local critics of London's 'great white hope'. However, in the main it was a blandly appreciative picture of a development project which in my view, produces the 1980s version of Devil's Island. Just before the ferociously efficient Docklands PR lobby hits the phone, I wish to make clear that my views are not those of the carping section of the Press castigated on the film for knocking a place it has never seen. Admittedly, my two year stint in developing Docklands was before the kayak-club opened. We met a cross-section of Docklands folk, from hyper-enthusiastic PR consultant Sunny Crouch to the ladies in the bingo-circle. Star turns were gnarled old dockers and stevedores, who pick crops of beans in well-manured allotments (pity I never found the Mud Flats riding school) and yarn about the past. The 'place of huge dreams' began to look far less of a nightmare: memo for 1993, to board the Docklands Light Railway for another trip east. Meanwhile, as Canary Wharf was a-building, the City of London was looking over her shoulder in a state of high, yet as it turned out, unjustified, anxiety. Masters of the Universe (BBC 2; Saturday) was much cleverer and more compelling than if it had been just another architectural ding-dong about what went right or wrong in the 1980s building boom in the City. Brilliantly filmed, with just the right dose of tricksiness, this was a documentary which made one see what it might have been like to have been a major player in the transformation - or was it a rape - of the Square Mile. Were they heroes or villains, the men who changed the skyline, built over roads and stations? One thing which emerged loud and clear was that the architects were merely the handmaidens to a process conceived and shaped by an alliance between planners and developers. Next time you sit next to an architect at dinner (spot him by the designer suit which has seen far, far better days), do remember that he is not responsible. Beside models of some of the largest buildings this country has seen, Leon Krier brooded over a process which to him marks the impotence of the architectural profession and a profound failure to understand the way people want to live. The tragedy, he argued, was that there was no master plan, no integration between places to live and places to work. But then, the key players reply, there just was no the time to hang about, with Canary Wharf set to ruin the City as a commercial centre. As property developer David King said, borrowing Pounds 100 million 'is about as heady an experience as you can have in your lifetime.' Where was the fun in messing about with a master plan when instead it was possible to be master of the universe, to have money for the asking and giant buildings to play with.</p>

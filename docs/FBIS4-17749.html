			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia is interested  in stepping up the integration processes within the framework of  the CIS and will strive to play a more active role in them.  However, as President Boris Yeltsin stressed today at a meeting  with the leadership and members of staff of the Foreign  Intelligence Service, some politicians in the West regard this  as proof of the revival of the former imperialist claims of  Russia. In his opinion this far- fetched thesis is being used  to cause an artificial exacerbation of relations among the CIS  and the Baltic countries with Russia.    Rejecting the concept of "global" and "total" intelligence  activity, Boris Yeltsin thinks it necessary to systematically  keep track of the situation throughout the perimeter of the  frontiers of Russia. In this connection, he stressed, the  Foreign Intelligence Service has a crucial task to tackle -- to  obtain advance information on the relevant plans and intensions  of the leading countries of the West with regard to Russia's  neighbors, and to make timely proposals to neutralize this type  of design.</p>

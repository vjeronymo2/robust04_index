			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hohhot, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Children of minority  nationalities in China now have more books to read, thanks to  efforts by writers and publishers devoted to ethnic-minority  children's literature.    Actively involved in producing such works on the subject are  not only writers from minority nationalities, but also those of  Han nationality.    China has 55 minority nationalities, who have developed  colorful literatures in the process of their historical  development.    These works, covering anecdotes, fairy tales, fables and  poems, are rich in content and of high artistic value. They are  a precious part of the world's literary heritage.    Over the past few years great efforts have been made to  boost  the output of literature for children of minority nationalities.    A number of books, such as "Selected Stories for Chinese  Children of Minority Nationalities", "Selected Stories for  Minority Nationalities in South and North China" and "Folk Tales  of Chinese Minority Nationalities", have been published. Some  of them have been translated into foreign languages and been  carried by foreign magazines.    "The Story of a Living Buddha", written by Malchinfu, a  famous Mongolian writer, has been highly praised by readers for  its vivid description of the life of a Mongolian child who  started life as a living Buddha and then became a doctor.    In 1987, China's first nationalities publishing house was  built in Inner Mongolia. It has published thousands of books in  the Mongolian language, including some world classics, such as  "Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales".    Other such publishing houses have emerged in many  ethnic-minority areas, from the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet  Autonomous Regions in the west to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous  Prefecture in northeast China's Jilin Province.</p>

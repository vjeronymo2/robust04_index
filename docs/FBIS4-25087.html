			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Central government  departments under the Chinese State Council, the country's  highest governing body, have gotten everything ready to combat  possible floods from the south to the north between June and  late August.    Those involved in preparations are the Chinese ministries in  charge of supply and transportation of flood control equipment  and supplies, such as the ministries of railways, the coal  industry, electric power and posts and telecommunications.    The Ministry of Railways has already completed its annual  inspection in the south to remove hidden perils. Major Chinese  oilfields have allocated special funds of up to 70 million yuan  this year for flood control use.    To improve accuracy in weather forecasting, the  meteorological department has decided to form a combined service  group to provide timely and accurate analysis of weather  conditions in areas which are possible targets of heavy flood.</p>

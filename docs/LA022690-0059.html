			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MACHINE TOOL ORDERS DROP 4.2% IN JANUARY  </P> <P> Machine tool orders fell 4.2% in January to $197.6 million, the National  Machine Tool Builders' Assn. said Sunday in its monthly report.  </P> <P> Orders for the industrial tools totaled $206.3 million in December.  </P> <P> The association said machine tool shipments fell 40.9% last month to $224.1  million from $379.4 million in December. The decline was in part a reflection  of the normal seasonal year-end surge in shipments.  </P> <P> "Machine tool activity in January was in line with that of recent months,"  association president Albert W. Moore said.  </P> <P> Machine tool orders fell 14.4% from January, 1989, but shipments rose 47.2%.  Machine tools, such as lathes, make the machines that produce sophisticated  weapons and other manufactured goods.  </P> <P> Moore said although many economists predict a slowdown in the U.S economy,  several trends independent of the business cycle point to potential demand for  machine tools.  </P> <P> They include high backlogs in the aerospace sector, the need to replace farm  machinery and the increasingly urgent need to "rebuild much of our nation's  aging infrastructure," he said.  </P> <P> The trade group reported that the machine tool order backlog for January was  $1.78 billion, compared to $1.80 billion in December and $2.27 billion in  January, 1989.  </P> <P> Metal-cutting machine tool orders fell 11.1% to $140.9 million in January and  were down 15.6% from a year ago. Metal-cutting equipment shipments fell 48.1%  to $162.25 million but rose 57.8% from a year ago.  </P> <P> The association said metal-forming orders rose 18.7% to $56.70 million but were  off 11.2% from January, 1989.  </P> <P> Metal-forming shipments dropped 7.1% in January to $61.9 million but rose 25.3%  from the year-ago period.  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mountleigh calls off development sale Mountleigh Group, the debt-laden property company, yesterday called off the Pounds 125m sale of its shopping mall development at Merry Hill, Dudley, West Midlands. Mountleigh had agreed to sell the centre to investors led by the O'Connor Group, a US pension fund adviser, in partnership with Hammerson, as part of its disposal programme. Mr Steven Gerard, Mountleigh's chief executive, said that although his group was still prepared to sell the property at the right price, it was equally happy to keep it, given its strong trading performance.</p>

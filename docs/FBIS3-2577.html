"Today there are as many Chinese  soldiers in Lhasa as there are Tibetans. Tibet, its people, and  its unique culture are in grave jeopardy," said Lodi Gyari,  president of the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT).    There has been no progress on human rights in Tibet in the  past year, Gyari said. The ICI showed photographs smuggled out  of Tibet showing a massive build-up of military facilities, six  prisons, and huge areas of new housing. The group also  displayed an official city planning map for Lhasa in the year  2000 which showed the traditional Tibetan areas of the city  reduced to virtually nothing -- just the Jokhang and Potala  palaces, described as cultural and tourist sites.    Roads to monasteries in and around Lhasa are frequently the  sites of military checkpoints, effectively restricting monks'  movements, and military installations virtually surround many  monasteries, the ICT said. "ICT and others have documented  repeated and widespread use of arbitrary detention, torture and  repression of religious and other civil freedoms throughout  occupied Tibet," the ICT said.    ICT hoped to alert Americans as the country weighed renewal  of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. President Bill  Clinton said last year that he would not extend China's MFN  beyond June 1994 unless Beijing could demonstrate significant  progress on human rights. One specific request was that China  begin dialogue with the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama.    Gyari endorsed Clinton's call for China to begin talks with  the Dalai Lama, but said there must be a clear commitment from  the Chinese government to the time, place and a substantive  agenda for such negotiations to be useful. "In the case of  Tibet, China has made no signs of taking steps to protect  Tibet's unique cultural and religious heritage, as stipulated in  the president's MFN executive order," the ICT said.    Human rights analysts believe the number of political  prisoners held in Lhasa's six prison camps has risen by 30  percent in the past year, the ICT said. China has countered  that Tibet remained at the centre of anti-socialist activity  from "internal and external hostile forces".</p>

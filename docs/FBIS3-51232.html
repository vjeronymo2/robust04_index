			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In an editorial in the 1-2 January  left-of-center Paris daily LIBERATION, Gerard Dupuy examines the  reasons that may have caused the government to release and  extradite to Iran--rather than Switzerland, which had asked for  them--the two suspects in the murder of Iranian dissident Kazem  Rajavi. Perhaps it was in hopes of avoiding Iranian terrorist  blackmail as the trial in France of former Iranian Prime  Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's assassin draws closer, Dupuy  conjectures. Perhaps it was a way of ingratiating  fundamentalists the world over, and especially in Algeria, he  adds. Then again, the government may have been motivated by its  desire to promote economic relations in an area where France's  role is "unremarkable." Deploring the government's refusal to  comment, Dupuy expresses the hope that, on the contrary, much  will be said, it being "at least strange" that a government that  includes "professional terrorist eaters" such as Interior  Minister Charles Pasqua would show Tehran a kindness "whose  laxism borders on cynicism." The "national interest" invoked by  Paris entails a minimum of political morality, and hence  transparency, Dupuy concludes.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: A Ripping drama - Malcolm Rutherford reviews a promising playwright KAREN HOPE'S new play opens with such a burst or repetitive swearing that it seems like a throwback to the 1980s. That may be an act of deliberate symbolism, for suddenly a character enters declaring that there are enough words in the English language to make swearing unnecessary. Then the effing more or less stops and we may have entered new ground. Ripping is a cerebral play, full of ambiguities, but it is not clever-clever. It does not draw on Harold Pinter, nor anyone else who immediately comes to mind. Like all good plays, it is physical as well as verbal. It is also almost frighteningly sane. It stems from a good idea, not far away from facts. Ripping makes an analogy between mind-building and body-building. A child prodigy goes up to Cambridge to read advancedmathematics. She is so young that she has to be accompanied by her father whose maths she is rapidly outstripping. The pair of them lodge in a place where there is a not dissimilar menage. A rather older girl has been a champion swimmer: some of her records are still unbeaten. In her twenties she has moved onto body-building with a coach who is also her lover. The play revolves around the interchanges between these two couples. Tom Stoppard, who has toyed with mathematics and the sciences in Arcadia, ought to look to his laurels. For Ripping is also about the application of maths to biology and the other way round, and it is very convincingly done. The young mathematician is fascinated by the development of the older girl's muscles and physical movements. The body-builder coach is a scientist of a kind as well: he has learned a lot from studying mushrooms. But this is not an abstract piece. The play works on a level of almost total realism. The dialogue is in the vernacular, loud music occasionally interspersing the talk. Apart from the mind and body-building analogy, there is a sub-theme. Both girls have been pushed into their ambitious positions by their respective fathers. Laura, the mathematician played by Lindsey Wilson, has her father still around and fussing. Melanie, the athlete, was encouraged to take body-building drugs by a father now absent but who still turns up at her contests. Only four characters appear in the play: the two girls, Laura's father and Melanie's coach. All become entangled with each other, though how far is left ambiguous. The one possible character weakness in the writing is Anthony, the father of Laura. It is not clear how much he responds, or wants to, to Melanie's sexual advances, nor whether he remotely understands the maths in which he is driving his daughter. For the rest, however, this is a remarkably vibrant play, beautifully done and precisely directed by Jessica Dromgoole. The Cockpit is a good place to do it because the theatre in the round is exactly right for the various contests. (The National's Cottesloe Theatre would be another.) As Melanie, Victoria Harwood looks at times like a graceful female Atlas, and can then movingly crack up. The ultimate tribute is to Ms Hope whose Foreign Lands was performed at the Finborough early this year. If she goes on like this, we may have a playwright for the 1990s after all. The Cockpit, London NW8 until October 30. (071) 402 5081</p>

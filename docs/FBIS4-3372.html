			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- The concerned  departments of the Taiwan authorities recently used the "Qiandao  Lake incident" as a pretext to announce the "temporarily  halting" of cultural exchange activities between the two sides  of the Strait and "boycott" travel to the mainland and economic  exchanges between the two sides. The actions taken by the  Taiwan authorities have cast a shadow over relations and  contacts between the two sides and have made more and more  people on the island worried and dissatisfied. People of many  trades and professions hold that the Taiwan authorities' actions  are not appropriate and that the suspension of exchanges and  contacts with the mainland will hurt Taiwan the most.    Taiwan's tourist business will suffer seriously due to  "boycotting travel to the mainland." Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs  Commission" decided to boycott travel to the mainland by the  people starting 1 May and the tourist services would have to  assume economic losses due to the decision. People of related  trades pointed out that travel to the mainland account for a big  proportion of Taiwan's tourist business. In Taibei [Taipei]  City alone, there are some 100 travel services handling travels  to the mainland. April and May are peak months for travel to the  mainland with 15,000 to 18,000 travelers each month. The travel  services will suffer at least 100 million New Taiwan dollars'  economic losses due to the halt of travel to the mainland.  People of Taiwan's tourist business pointed out that in the  past seven years, Taiwanese visited the mainland some 6 million  times. The number is unprecedented and the people's visits are  practical exchanges between the two sides. Travel and contacts  between the two sides of the strait must not stop because of  this singular "Qiandao Lake incident."    People in business circles also hold that the two sides of  the strait have already established close contacts and that the  retrogression of economic exchanges and trade between the two  sides will bring very big harm and loss to Taiwan's businessmen.  Huang Zhaofu [Huang Chao-fu], secretary general of Taiwan's  "Industrial Association for Relations Between the Two Sides of  the Strait," said: Many Taiwan businessmen told the association  that economic and trade activities must not be influenced by the  "Qiandao Lake incident." Taiwan businessmen's interests are  mixed together with the mainland's interests, and we should make  no distinction between what are one's own and what are other  people's interests. Using the "Qiandao Lake incident" to create  a big display will only hurt the interests of Taiwan's  businessmen and cannot stop the tide of Taiwan businessmen's  investment on the mainland and economic exchanges and trade  between the two sides of the strait.    The temporary halt of cultural exchanges was also opposed by  people of cultural circles. Many people of the cultural circles  pointed out that cultural exchanges between the two sides of the  strait are favorable to Taiwan's absorbing the mainland's  advantages in culture, science and technology and are conducive  to Taiwan's cultural development. To stop cultural exchanges  between the two sides because of this singular incident will  hurt understanding and link established gradually through  cultural exchanges.    Taiwan's news media also pointed out that some people on the  island are using the "Qiandao Lake incident" to instigate Taiwan  compatriots' anti-mainland sentiments and advocate "Taiwan  independence." They are both inadvisable. The Taiwan  authorities' "boycotting measures" are to seize on an incident  to exaggerate matters and will hurt both sides, especially the  people in Taiwan.</p>

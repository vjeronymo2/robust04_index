			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Mixture of old myth and modern madness - A play which is like thinking aloud at Scrabble Do not make the mistake of reading Caryl Churchill's new play before you see it. The live performance of The Skriker is infinitely better than the text suggests. And if I still do not like it, that may be due to a distaste for fairies, spirits and the underworld, whether they come from the ancient Greeks or a contemporary British writer. Possibly sheer prejudice on my part. The play is a mixture of old myth and modern madness. Two girls, one pregnant, the other having aborted, become embroiled with spirits. A pagan underworld, whether real or imagined, is all about them. Chief among the spirits is the skriker, defined as 'a shapeshifter and death portent, ancient and damaged'. As skrikers go, this one is relatively modest: she describes herself as 'one of many, not a major spirit, but a spirit'. She has been around 'through all that stuff that you would call history, Cavaliers and Roundheads, Henry VIII, 1066 and before'. What she is doing in 1994 is less clear. Anyway, the skriker torments the two girls with a variety of charms and threats. She is magnificently played by Kathryn Hunter in one of the most physically and vocally versatile performances I have seen. An act of contortion at the start almost takes the breath away. Ms Hunter keeps it up to the end, having been through several guises, young, old, male, female. The style may be borrowed from Robert Lepage; the admiration for the execution must be total. Alongside the skriker is a large number of presumably lesser spirits. They include the Kelpie, half-man and half-horse on a huge pair of stilts, Rawheadandbloodybones, Yallery Brown, Jennie Greenteeth and Black Annis. Apart from the spectacle and filling up the stage - Philippe Giraudeau on stilts takes up a lot - their contribution is limited. True, The Skriker contains an element of dance, especially when the underworld hots up for dinner, but there is not very much of it. Perhaps there should be more. There is only one song, when the spirits sing 'Drink, drank, drunk'. The Skriker is not really a new departure into multi-art forms; it remains essentially a play. Easily the most fascinating part of it is the language. Churchill has steeped herself, consciously or otherwise, in Gerard Manly Hopkins. There are other allusions. The witches in Macbeth crop up repeatedly, there is perhaps the Fool in King Lear, and references to nursery rhymes abound. But it is Hopkins who dominates. The Skriker is studded with multiple alliterations and playing with sounds and words - almost like thinking aloud at Scrabble. Hunter's opening speech lasts 14 minutes, which is another reason for admiring her performance. It is not much shorter than Hopkins's Wreck of the Deutschland. And when she says 'a bit a bite a bitter bread and he was crumbs crumbling to dust panic. Better forget them, not always be talking stalking walking working them over and understand still' the debt is plain. Ms Churchill adds some engaging flourishes. There are also comic touches. One of the girls after kissing the skriker spews out pound coins, the other  -less friendly - live toads. But it is the linguistics that catch the memory. The two girls, Jacqueline Defferary, as the pregnant Lily, and Sandy McDade, as Josie, are excellent. A curate's egg, The Skriker is worth seeing out of curiosity. Les Waters directs and the music is by Judith Weir. In repertory, Cottesloe. (071) 928 2252</p>

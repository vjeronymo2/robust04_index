			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (9): Ready to exploit changing political climate - Profile, the South African producer, Sappi, has been hit hard It has been a rough few years for Sappi, the South African producer that claims top position on the continent in pulp and paper production. Not only has it had to contend with the industry-wide downturn, but a severe South African recession, compounded by the worst drought of the century, has severely weakened the domestic market and forced the company to write off a chunk of operations. On top of that, South Africa's volatile political situation has played havoc with Sappi's international expansion programme, first by making it difficult to get permission from the South African Reserve Bank to export funds, and then, as a result of the currency's recent slide, exaggerating the effect of losses in its new offshore operations. Domestically, therefore, while Sappi remains dominant in the market, the company has been hit hard on all fronts. The effects of the three-year local recession was aggravated by increased competition from imports, particularly from Brazil and Finland, which have exploited the country's low tariffs on paper products to exploit the top end of the South African market at low prices. Despite all this, aggressive expansion has seen the company's turnover rise from R2.9bn (Dollars 580m) in 1990 to R5.54bn in 1994, but after-tax earnings have dropped over the same period from R604m in 1990 to just R142.2m in 1994. Now, however, Sappi believes the worst is over on both counts, and it is well placed to exploit the expected upturn in the market and take advantage of South Africa's return to economic growth and its newfound international respectability. Executive chairman Eugene Van As says: 'The changing political climate is creating new business opportunities for our operations.' The company is a fully-integrated producer and its divisions encompass all sectors of the industry from raw timber to finished papers. Its core operations together supply more than half of South Africa's total paper requirements. Sappi grows its own timber on 340,000 hectares of forest land in the southern Africa region, most of which is then used in the company's own plants. These in turn are divided into Sappi Timber industries, kraft papers, fine papers and pulp. The timber operations supply structural wood products for the building and mining industry, as well as particleboard and medium density fibreboard for use in home furnishings. For its other products, the group has three fine paper mills and three kraft paper mills around the country, used for packaging and a wide range of home, school and office requirements. Its Usutu pulp division, based in Swaziland, is the lowest cost producer in the world of unbleached kraft market paper. Sappi's forests benefit, in non-drought years, from the local climate, which allows for fast growth of trees suitable for pulp. Combined with access to some of the cheapest electricity in the world, this puts the company among the cheapest producers in the world despite the relatively high quality of its output. This cost competitiveness is true of most of Sappi's South African operations, helped by a combination of cheap inputs and low delivery costs. And, given the company's substantial excess capacity, Mr van As believes that the end of South Africa's recession, combined with increased spending plans by the new government in areas such as education, will significantly benefit the local paper market thus helping lift domestic results in the near future. Over the past few years, however, the export market has become the main focus for many of the company's divisions. Sappi now ships a wide range of products, accounting for around 65 per cent of total output, to all parts of the globe, with east Asia and Europe being dominant, Spearheading this drive is the company's SAICCOR division, the world's lowest cost dissolving pulp producer, which reserves nearly all of its production for overseas demand. The operation has a capacity of 450,000 tonnes and is undergoing a R1b expansion plan which will make it by far the world's biggest single producer. To complement these exports, over the past few years the company has focused on increasing its overall foreign exposure and its foreign asset base. In addition to being listed in Frankfurt, Paris and London, the company now runs a substantial European operation, with subsidiaries in the UK and Germany, making it one of the largest producers of paper products on the continent. However, despite impressive recent productivity gains and improvements in output, these acquisitions have proved very costly for Sappi. The group's five paper mills in the UK, acquired in 1990, were particularly severely hit by the British recession, although they have managed to increase market share. Similarly, Sappi's high profile purchase of Hannovier Papier the biggest German producer of coated papers, made in 1992, has also suffered from the domestic recession there. As a result, the company has proved a severe drain on resources and its losses have severely depressed Sappi's bottom line because of their denomination in D-Marks. However, the sell-off of some assets has recently improved Hannovier's cash base, and here, too, Sappi feels that it has turned the corner and is in an excellent position to exploit the upturn. 'Our European operations are very much in the value-added area of the market, encompassing high-quality coated and uncoated papers, and we expect to be in the black for 1994,' asserts Mr van As, citing a 24 per cent growth in exports last year as support for this view. That investors share this view is evident in Sappi's share price, which has been buoyant in spite of the the company's recent dismal results. However, some analysts warn that this picture may be overly rosy, particularly as much of the group's machinery in the UK and South Africa is old and outdated, requiring a hefty dose of new capital expenditure over the next few years. 'The company's basically healthy, but it will probably take a little longer to achieve substantial profitability, especially in Europe,' warns Christopher Sloan of brokers Fergusson Brothers Hall Stewart. Nonetheless, Sappi has managed to increase its market share on the continent, helped by the successful operations of Sappi Trading, a Zurich-based marketing arm formed in 1991 that conducts its activities through Speciality Pulp Trading in Hong Kong and regional distributors in Europe, Africa and America. South Africa's increased respectability as a trading partner has allowed the group to start tapping previously closed markets, and overall exports have been growing rapidly. Further expansion, particularly in east Asia and the Americas, is expected over the next few years.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BARNYARD JAMBOREE;  </P> <P> FAIR PLANS NEW EVENTS IN BID TO BEST 1989'S RECORD ATTENDANCE  </P> <P> Organizers are counting on new events such as pig racing, llama judging and a  show of experimental aircraft to help the 52nd annual Antelope Valley Fair and  Alfalfa Festival, which opens Friday in Lancaster, to match an attendance  record set last year.  </P> <P> Theme for the 11-day event, the largest yearly public gathering in the high  desert, is "It's a Barnyard Jamboree." Organizers say they hope to match last  year's attendance of 188,212 despite a downturn in the economy and a 50-cent  boost in the adult admission price to $4.  </P> <P> As usual, the publicly sponsored fair is an oddball collection of events.  </P> <P> Scheduled are produce and livestock competitions that reflect the valley's  agricultural roots, rides and games, a demolition derby, a rural Olympics,  rodeos and a week of concerts, headlined by country singer Kenny Rogers.  </P> <P> Many events have evolved into something akin to rituals, but there are new  touches as well.  </P> <P> Fair Manager Jim Pacini said new events are pig races at Hollypig Park, a llama  judging competition and a display long-sought by aerospace enthusiasts in the  valley of experimental aircraft.  </P> <P> In addition, Pacini said the fair's nine-member governing board has created a  new Little Barnyard area for children that will have free puppet and magic  shows, a petting zoo, treasure hunts, and watermelon and marshmallow eating  contests.  </P> <P> Fair activities get under way Friday with a 5:30 p.m. parade down Lancaster  Boulevard from 10th Street West to Sierra Highway. The 80-acre fairgrounds at  East Avenue I and Division Street open at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Fair hours are 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday, noon to 1 a.m. Saturday, noon to  midnight Sunday, 3 to 11:30 p.m. Monday, and 4 to 11:30 p.m. Tuesday through  Aug. 30. Next weekend, hours are 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. Aug. 31, noon to 1 a.m. Sept.  1 and 2, and noon to 11 p.m. Labor Day.  </P> <P> Daily admission is $4 for adults, and $2 for youngsters ages 6 to 16 and senior  citizens. Children under 6 and military personnel in uniform get in free. Added  charges include $2 a day for parking and the price of tickets to concerts and  the various track events.  </P> <P> Special prices will be in effect for Family Day on Sunday, when two parents and  up to four children will get in for $10. Children 12 and under will be admitted  free Monday, handicapped individuals will get in without charge Tuesday, and  people 60 and older will be allowed in free Wednesday.  </P> <P> No serious crimes or injuries occurred during last year's event, and fair  officials are hoping for the same this year.  </P> <P> Beer and wine sales, which are a major fund-raiser, will continue. But there  will be no cigarette giveaway booth, a plan fair officials canceled last year  after protests.  </P> <P> About 8,900 of the 9,700 tickets to Rogers' Aug. 31 concert have been sold;  only $10 tickets remain.  </P> <P> Other concerts include Michael McDonald and Belinda Carlisle on Monday, Eddie  Rabbitt and Juice Newton on Tuesday, Tommy Page and Sweet Sensation on  Wednesday, and Jan and Dean and Paul Revere and the Raiders on Aug. 30. The  concerts begin at 8 p.m. Tickets range from $8 to $14.  </P> <P> Tickets for track events, such as stock car racing Friday, motocross and a  tractor pull Saturday, and motorcycle racing and a demolition derby Sunday, run  $6 to $8. Admission to the Rural Olympics and three days of rodeo next weekend  is $6 to $8.  </P> <P> Pigeon judging will occur 9 a.m. Friday before the fair's formal opening.  </P> <P> The pig races will occur throughout the fair's run.  </P> <P> The llama competition is set Friday at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Satellite wagering on horse races, which occurs year-round at the fairgrounds,  will continue through the fair's run.  </P></p>

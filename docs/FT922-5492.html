			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: My property-free portfolio - Diary of a Private Investor THIS week's announcement that receivers have been called in at Mountleigh - one of the UK's largest property groups - and that Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development is in the hands of administrators, did not come as much of a surprise to me. As a private investor, I sold my last property share in 1989, although, over the years, I have made some useful profits from the sector. In December, 1985, my wife bought shares in the property group, Stockley, paying 69p per share. We liked the quality and design of its buildings, which seemed to indicate good rental levels, especially its development at Stockley Park, near Heathrow Airport. In May, 1987, my wife accepted Mountleigh's takeover offer for Stockley, taking the cash option of 135p per share, rather than Mountleigh shares or loan notes. Reading the takeover documents, I was struck by Mountleigh's numerous property-dealing transactions. Could Mountleigh maintain the tremendous flow of property deals in the future? The documents also showed that Mountleigh had a subsidiary, Mountleigh Air Services Ltd, involved in air-charter activities. Did this mean the company had executive jets? Unless a company has a worldwide spread of interests, I consider ownership of a corporate plane rather like a luxury yacht - a signal to sell the shares. Whether or not Mountleigh had a private aircraft, I did not bother to find out, since at that time I was also concerned that some property companies and City institutions were playing 'pass the parcel' with shares and property. One company or institution seemed to acquire a property and then quickly sell it on to another, which, in turn, added a bit to the price and sold it on. What would happen if the game stopped and no one wanted to accept the parcel? Prices, too, seemed to have reached rather unrealistic levels. It was thoughts like these that saved me from making huge losses in the stock market crash of October 1987 - since I had heavily reduced my share portfolio in the summer of that year. It is interesting to look back at other examples and see some of the disasters I avoided. At various times in 1986 I bought, for my personal pension scheme, shares in Dares Estates at prices ranging from 12.5p to 15.5p. I sold most of them, in several stages in 1987, achieving 40p to 71p per share. I disposed of my remaining Dares holding in 1989 for 30.5p per share. Dares shares are now less than 2p each. After the Stock Market crash of 1987, I avoided property shares for a while, but then did some selective stock-picking in 1988, buying (again for my pension scheme) shares in companies like Priest Marians, Warringtons, and Mowat. However, by June 1989, I was concerned about the effect of high interest rates on heavily borrowed property companies and the massive rises in uniform business rates on commercial property in London and the south of England. Just walking around London, it seemed obvious that there were a lot of empty offices and shop premises. I therefore sold my property shares. I was fortunate, for example, to be able to dispose of my Mowat shares for 43p each. Now they are 7.5p. Over the past few years, various people have promoted property shares, claiming that prices had fallen to such low levels that it was now time to go 'bottom fishing'. I ignored such blandishments. I still believe property prices (and shares in property companies) are likely to fall further. Why? Just look around you. Who needs all the empty office space when companies are busily cutting staff? Many companies in the financial services sector, such as insurance, are looking rather sickly, and it may take further rationalisation and mergers to save some of them. Again, this means cutting down on paper-pushers in offices. As to other property: if Lloyds takes over Midland (or if there are further building society mergers), there could be a glut of bank and building society premises on the market. Look at the average high street. How many of the shops are boarded up, occupied by charity organisations, or let on very short leases? Quite a lot. Who wants to be a shopkeeper? My wife has shares in Burton Group, mainly to get the shareholder discount on her purchases in Debenhams. This week, she received Burton's interim statement. If you exclude Debenhams, and divide the trading profits of all the other shops (Principles, Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Champion Sport, Evans, etc) by the number of outlets of those shops, it produces less than Pounds 2,000 profit per outlet. And that is before interest charges. Hardly an encouragement to anyone to embark on massive store openings] As far as the housing market is concerned, I feel that many people have unrealistic price expectations for their properties. The problems at Lloyds will affect upmarket house prices; and, while so many people are unemployed or fearful of losing their jobs, then fewer lower-price house moves will take place. The minute economic prospects improve and unemployment is reduced, many of the people who have delayed moving may flood the market with their homes, which could again keep prices depressed. But are house prices depressed enough? Why are homes in France and much of the US lower than in the UK? Surely it cannot be due to higher UK wage levels, but to over-optimistic evaluations. As with shares, I believe that property does not have intrinsic value. The true value of a property, or a share, is not its book value, but whatever someone is genuinely prepared to pay for it, or, taking a short-term view, what a gullible bank is prepared to lend against it - but that is another story . . .</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / New push and old pull rock Japan's politics / Chronicles of the many dilemmas facing a leading member of the LDP rebels MR KAZUO Aichi was understandably nervous. Before him were 200 local dignatories who lead the group that supports him as a member of the Japanese parliament - village mayors, president of parents associations, doctors. Many could recall Mr Aichi's father, a former top bureaucrat who became a powerful Liberal Democratic party politician, standing before them asking for their support. Yet his son was there to warn them that he would probably rebel against the LDP leadership, help to launch a rival party led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister and so crack open the post-war structure of Japanese politics. A week later Mr Aichi and more than 30 LDP rebels defeated Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government by voting with an opposition no-confidence motion. One of Mr Aichi's aides recalls: 'If the leaders of the support group had gone against, it would have risked our entire local organisation. But even the 80-year-olds fully supported it.' Yet their reasons highlight the ambiguous character of the dramatic changes unleashed by the Hata rebels. Mr Aichi's group supported him out of loyalty to the family name rather than because they want sweeping reform of Japan's corrupt, introspective and slow moving political system. Mr Aichi's reliance upon traditional supporters and methods while advocating radical reform is symptomatic of the dilemmas faced by all Japan's would be reformers. The gravity of Mr Aichi's decision should not be underestimated. Not only has he risked his political inheritance by breaking with the LDP, but also his future. As a sixth-term member of the parliament's lower house, he could have expected a cabinet post after the next election if he had stayed on the LDP merry-go-round. He cites three reasons for joining the Hata breakaway:'Scandals are eroding public trust in government, rotting the basis for a free society. Japan has to play a larger world role and that requires a government with clear policies and strong public backing. Yet the LDP is incapable of reforming itself, so we have gridlock.' Mr Aichi supports electoral reforms, including proportional representation and the elimination of Japan's distinctively large, multi-member constituencies in favour of smaller single-seat constituencies. A reformed system would support two major parties, the LDP and probably the Social Democratic party and perhaps three minor parties which would hold the balance of power, he says. The result would be a more open political system in which policies would determine who was elected rather than the amount of public spending on local bridges and sports facilities. However to get there Mr Aichi will first engage in some very traditional Japanese politics. He needs about 150,000 votes to retain his seat. About 50,000 come from his support group, which extends like the root system of a tree down from the top 200 members into local neighbourhoods and companies. Political advertising is banned, so Mr Aichi will have to spend millions of yen on a time-consuming trawl to reach his voters. The money will be raised by remortgaging his Tokyo basement office, which has served as a dissidents' meeting place over the past few weeks, a bar at one end and a karaoke machine at the other. During the campaign, while Mr Aichi is out every day from 8am till late in the evening making speeches, a few dozen people at his headquarters will be at a phone bank cold-calling voters. In the evening the campaign headquarters will become a restaurant which voters visit in groups to sit and eat supper with Mr Aichi. In most industrial countries the politician's main campaign weapon is a soundbite delivered on the evening television news. For Mr Aichi it will be tea and noodles. Mr Aichi remarked: 'I will lose about 10 per cent of my traditional support but I hope to more than make that up by attracting new voters.' His chances of success have been greatly enhanced by a local electoral deal to minimise competition between rival reformist parties, which is testimony to the enduring strength of personal networks in Japanese power politics. Mr Aichi explained: 'The Japan New party was going to run a candidate. But I know Mr Hosokawa the JNP's founder very well and so they decided not to run a candidate.' He will also need to project a clean, reformist image which marks a clean break with the LDP. On the difference which political reform would make to Japan's role in the world he explained that greater democracy was vital: 'Japan has to become more pro-active. That means politicians taking decisions rather than bureaucrats who cannot take bold initiatives. At the moment politicians are just mouthpieces for the bureaucrats. The bureaucrats should serve the politicians.' Yet on the vital details he is more circumspect. Mr Aichi represents both urban and rural voters in Miyagi prefecture which is well known for its pearl white rice. As a result even Mr Aichi, one of the most internationalist of Japanese politicians, will not openly call for Japan to lift its ban on imported rice, one of the obstacles preventing a successful conclusion to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round. 'Rice is a very sensitive issue which is difficult to address in the election campaign. I will not make it an issue. That is something which will have to wait until afterwards,' he said. Judging by the conflicting pressures upon Mr Aichi, even if the ruling LDP is defeated, political reform will only lurch forward slowly because even the modernisers have no choice but to carry so much traditional baggage with them.</p>

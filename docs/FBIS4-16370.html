			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F> correspondents Igro Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Tajikistan's leadership "greatly hopes" that in the  course of the negotiations with the representatives of the Tajik  opposition in Moscow "an additional impetus" will be given to  the return of refugees to the republic. "It is impossible to  stop this process and its politicizing is inadmissible,"  Tajikistan's Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov, on a visit in  Moscow, declared in his interview with Interfax.    He pointed out that "in general, refugees return to their  homeland irrespective of the course of the negotiations." "We  have been solving this problem for a year already, the  department of the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, Russia and  Uzbekistan render their backing to us. More than 60 percent of  refugees, primarily from Afghanistan have already returned to  their homeland, said Alimov.    Lavrov [as received] believes that the delegations must  negotiate so that all refugees willing to return to Tajikistan  could do this. The Tajik leadership should undertake additional  measures in order to ensure security for returning refugees and  their reintegration into the political, economic and cultural  life of the republic. It is necessary to realize that the  process of return of refugees is irreversible. There might be  attempts to hinder it but only on the part of the opposition,  Alimov stressed.    In his words, some time ago as may as 700 refugees were  already prepared to return to Tajikistan from the neighboring  Afghanistan but this process was suspended due to a rocket  shelling of the border. "Unfortunately, last year we also  experienced great difficulties with the repatriation of refugees  due to an outbreak of Cholera in the boarder area," Alimov  stated.    "If the parties started to exploit the plight of refugees to  solve their immediate problems it would be a serious mistake,"  said Alimov.</p>

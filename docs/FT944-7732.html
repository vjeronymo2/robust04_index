			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Readicut declines to Pounds 5.4m after contract problems Pre-tax profits at Readicut International fell 20 per cent at the interim stage as the household textiles, carpeting and yarn company suffered production difficulties on a military contract. The Yorkshire-based group lost Pounds 1.2m on a contract at its textile bonding division, which had to take over the manufacture of ballistic products from a sub-contractor. Analysts cut full-year profit forecasts from about Pounds 18m to Pounds 14.5m. The shares closed down 4 1/2 p at 67 1/2 p. The pre-tax profits decline, from Pounds 6.73m to Pounds 5.41m, in the six months to September 30, was on lower turnover of Pounds 100.7m (Pounds 113.4m). Last year's figures included the discontinued operations of Firth Furnishings, the car carpets producer, and Readicut Wool, the handicrafts distributor. Operating profits on continuing operations also declined, to Pounds 5.72m (Pounds 6.67m), as margins were squeezed by raw material price rises. Polymer prices rose by 80 per cent in the six months, with UK wool costs increasing by 20-30 per cent. Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said: 'Conditions in the UK are still not ideal and continental Europe is still difficult.' The core carpet division reported operating profits of Pounds 2.68m (Pounds 2.07m) on turnover of Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 41m) as its US activities enjoyed better trading conditions. The UK operation, Firth Carpets, replaced a 10 per cent drop in domestic sales with a similar rise in contracts. Yarns and fibres lifted operating profit to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.79m) on turnover of Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 23.6m) as the company succeeded in passing on the higher raw material costs. However, furnishings and household textiles dipped into the red with operating losses of Pounds 65,000 (Pounds 801,000 profits) on turnover up 11 per cent to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.3m). Net interest costs fell to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 665,000) and gearing fell from 18 to 5 per cent. Earnings per share declined to 1.83p (2.36p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.63p. On the revised profit forecasts the prospective p/e is 14 at yesterday's closing price. Analysts said they were surprised by the textile bonding losses and the speed with which raw material costs had affected Readicut's profits.</p>

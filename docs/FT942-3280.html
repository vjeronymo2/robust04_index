			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: MetLife and Travelers combine operations Metropolitan Life and Travelers are combining their health insurance businesses in a joint venture company. The deal is a further sign of the consolidation among US managed healthcare organisations. Travelers, which has the smaller health insurance business of the two, has agreed to pass to MetLife disability, dental care and other insurance businesses with annual premiums of more Dollars 950m in return for a half-share in the new company. Travelers is also selling MetLife its group life insurance business for Dollars 350m. By growing in size, healthcare groups hope to reduce unit costs and force bigger discounts from healthcare providers, such as hospitals and drugs companies. The deal marks the first steps taken by Mr Sanford Weill, whose Primerica financial services group took over Travelers at the end of last year, to sort out some parts of Travelers' underperforming insurance operations. Earlier this year, Mr Weill predicted mergers in the insurance industry as companies sought greater efficiency. The two insurers said their new company, which had yet to be named, would provide health insurance to 13m people. However, only 391,000 of these are in the two companies' health maintenance organisations (HMOs), under which individuals are serviced by a prescribed network of doctors and hospitals. This leaves them well behind other insurers. At the end of last year, Cigna had 2.7m people in its HMOs, Prudential 1.6m, Aetna 905,000 and Sanus (a division of New York Life) 651,000, according to the Group Health Association of America, an industry trade association. All US insurers are attempting to move people from their traditional fee-for-service plans into HMOs, which have become a more profitable way of proving healthcare cover.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Drive on benefits fraud nets Pounds 500m CRACKDOWNS against fraud involving social benefits saved the taxpayer a record Pounds 500m last year, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday, Emma Tucker writes. He said 90 per cent of the 270,000 individual benefit recipients found to be cheating the system had been successfully prosecuted. Last week the Department of Employment announced a Pounds 45m saving from investigations into unemployment benefit fraud. The cases highlighted by the DSS were similar, but it administers a much wider range of benefits, including sickness and invalidity payments, income support and housing benefit. Mr Lilley said savings on false claims had risen by Pounds 100m in the past 12 months. 'While the vast majority of claims are genuine, these figures show that there are large numbers of people who make fraudulent claims,' he said. The DSS said the main areas of fraud were centred on income-related benefits such as income support and housing benefit administered by local authorities, as well as short-term benefits such as invalidity benefit. The prosecutions included 59 minicab drivers in Gravesend, Kent, who were signing on for benefits, 28 false claims for child benefit in Washington, Tyne and Wear, involving 62 fictitious children, and a Bolton man who pretended that his wife was his sister in order to carry on claiming means-tested benefit.</p>

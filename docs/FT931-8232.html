			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / 'Wise men' warn against tax rises: Treasury team says outlook remains uncertain - Survey finds sharp fall in confidence THE UK government's new team of private-sector economic advisers warned yesterday that economic recovery is far from assured and could be jeopardised by any tax increases in next month's Budget. It also warns that Britain's potential to produce goods and services during the rest of the 1990s may have been damaged by increased long-term unemployment and the premature scrapping of capital equipment. The generally gloomy report from the advisers coincided with news that consumer confidence has fallen sharply in recent weeks, a reminder that lack of strong indications about an upturn in the economy may continue to hold back spending. According to a monthly survey by Gallup, a market research group, confidence has dropped partly in response to worries about inflation and unemployment. The survey, based on interviews with more than 2,000 people at the start of February, says 60 per cent of UK citizens are either just making ends meet or drawing on their savings. The report by the Treasury's seven-strong advisory panel was published at the end of a mixed week of economic data which saw the headline jobless total climb above 3m for the first time in six years. Although the panel believes economic prospects have been helped by lower interest rates and sterling's devaluation, it says there is 'considerable uncertainty' about the strength of any rebound from the recession. The panel sees more scope for further cuts in bank base rates from 6 per cent, should economic activity weaken in the next few months. It says high debts 'may be a greater brake on consumer spending than we have allowed for'. Of the seven economists only Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research, wants to see Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, increase taxes in the March 16 Budget. The others say such a move could hold back a recovery but are keen to see the Treasury 'set out a clear strategy' to reduce the rising deficit by tax increases from 1994-95 or cuts in public spending. The part-time advisers - recruited by Mr Lamont at the end of last year as part of a move to greater openness in economic policymaking - think that underlying inflation will fail by a small amount to breach the Treasury's 4 per cent target this year and next. However, the target is likely to be exceeded in 1995 and 1996 as extra economic activity prompts rising cost pressures. All the advisers think unemployment will rise further to between 3.1m and 3.4m by the end of the year. The average forecast of the advisers is for the UK economy to expand 1.1 per cent this year, with growth picking up to 2.7 per cent in 1994. The advisers warn that another year of flat or declining output, after economic contraction last year and 1991, would be 'extremely damaging'. The group is concerned about the large current account deficit. It reckons the gap between imports and exports will rise from Pounds 12bn last year to Pounds 15.5bn this year.

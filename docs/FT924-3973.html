			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Observer: China syndrome Everything seems to be going wrong at once in Hong Kong. Relations between China and the UK are rock-bottom, Governor Chris Patten seems to have lost his deft political touch, and the Hong Kong stock market is nose diving. The Hong Kong Jockey Club - that bastion of colonial plutocrats - has been forced to cancel the remaining eight of this year's racing fixtures due to an epidemic of herpes . . . . among the horses that is. And finally, China's People's Liberation Army has just finished practising its military manoeuvres in Guangdong province next door to Hong Kong. The name of the exercise: Catch the Eagle. The word for eagle is pronounced 'ying' in the Cantonese dialect. The word for England, though a different ideograph, is also pronounced 'ying'. Its meaning was not lost on Hong Kong.</p>

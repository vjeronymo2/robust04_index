			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--A 10-member Republic of  China [ROC] delegation, led by Vice Finance Minister Li  Chung-ying, is leaving for France Friday [29 April] to attend  the 27th Asian Development Bank (ADB) annual meeting.    Some 54 ADB member countries are expected to attend the May  3-5 meeting in Nice. An annual report will be released at the  meeting and participants will discuss economic prospects in  Asia, common problems Asian countries are facing, and problems  funding infrastructure development in Southeast Asia.    During the meeting, Li will report on Taiwan's overseas  investment and economic development as well as express the  island's strong desire to join the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT).    Li said before departure that delegation members will also  explain Taiwan's "southern strategy," which encourages  investment in Southeast Asia, as well as Taiwan's financial  situation.    In addition, Taiwan delegation members will attend a meeting  of the procedures committee. This will be the first time since  1970 that the ROC, a founding member of the ADB, has been  allowed into the 12-member committee.    During the meeting, Li will protest the ADB's unilateral  decision to change the ROC's designation at the international  banking institute to "Taipei, China."    The ADB changed the ROC's representative name after Beijing  joined the group in 1986. Taipei refused to take part in any  ADB activities in protest of the unfair treatment in 1986 and  1987. Participation resumed in 1988.    The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei May 8.</p>

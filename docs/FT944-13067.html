			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Nolan committee to meet next week The committee headed by Lord Nolan set up to examine standards of conduct in public life is to hold its first meeting next week. This underlines the speed with which the prime minister wishes to calm concerns of sleaze hanging over his government. Lord Nolan has told Whitehall officials that he wants to hold most of the committee's hearings in public. But he has also given an assurance that he will abide by the remit set by Mr John Major, and will avoid investigating specific allegations of impropriety against Tory MPs. The committee's eight men and two women will include Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the British Council, Sir Clifford Boulton, the former clerk of the Commons, and Dame Anne Warburton, former president of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge. One member said the task of examining whether standards of conduct for public servants should be tightened would be hard to achieve.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Fang </F> Jin (2455 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- This morning, Lu Ping,  director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, and Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong  Kong branch, held an informal discussion with the third batch of  Hong Kong affairs advisers and newly appointed members of the  Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR]  to hear their views on Hong Kong affairs.    Participating in today's informal group discussions were 49  Hong Kong affairs advisers and 13 new PWC members. The  participants expressed their individual views and put forward  many constructive ideas and suggestions on Hong Kong's monetary  policy, inflation, housing prices, public servants' continued  employment after 1997, and youngsters' education; on how Hong  Kong's major capital construction could be coordinated and  brought into line with that of the mainland; and on other issues  touching upon a wide variety of fields such as politics,  economics, culture, education, law, and social order.    Lu Ping and Zhou Nan spoke separately at the informal  discussion. Lu Ping said: Although Sino-British talks on Hong  Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections broke down due to the lack of  sincerity by the British side, the Chinese Government still  hopes to continue maintaining cooperation with Britain in other  fields. However, whether or not the two sides can cooperate  will mainly hinge on Britain's attitude. He said: On the one  hand, we hope for cooperation with Britain; on the other, we  should not cherish too many illusions concerning Britain. We  should build our work on our own foundation, truly realize  participation by the Hong Kong people, and properly carry out  various preparatory work during the final transitional period to  bring about a smooth transition in 1997. We are now three years  away from 1 July 1997, and we still need to carry out a much  work of various types. I hope that all PWC members and Hong  Kong affairs advisers will actively throw themselves into  preparatory work for the HKSAR. He said: Hong Kong has many  qualified personnel in various fields; we believe that Hong Kong  certainly will be able to enjoy continued prosperity and  stability under the future HKSAR government staffed by patriotic  Hong Kong people.    Zhou Nan said: All of you have put forward so many  constructive ideas; this reflects the great sense of  responsibility among Hong Kong affairs advisers and PWC members.  Zhou Nan said: It is extremely important for the Hong Kong  people to take part in local affairs during the transitional  period. I hope that Hong Kong affairs advisers and PWC members  will always put forward ideas and suggestions to make  contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term  prosperity and stability.    Chen Ziying and Wang Fengchao, State Council Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office deputy directors; as well as Qin Wenjun,  XINHUA Hong Kong branch deputy director, also participated in  this morning's informal discussion.</p>

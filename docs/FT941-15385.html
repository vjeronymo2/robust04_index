			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Nissan dealer to sell Ford vehicles in Japan A leading dealer linked to Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, has agreed to sell cars made by Ford in Japan in a move that could help ease trade friction with the US. Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales, one of Nissan's leading dealers based in central Tokyo, said it reached agreement with Ford on Wednesday to sell the US company's cars in Japan starting this spring. Details on which models are to be sold and how many have yet to be decided, but the dealer hopes to sell Ford's Taurus, Explorer and the new Mustang cars at stores independently of those selling Nissan cars, the company said. Ford's cars are already sold through 300 Mazda dealers in Japan. The decision by Nissan to give the go-ahead to a deal between one of its main dealers and a foreign competitor, sends a clear signal to other Japanese car dealers that carmakers are increasingly prepared to relax their grip on the choice of cars their dealers sell. Nissan, which owns 25 per cent of Tokyo Nissan Sales, said the deal was an issue between Tokyo Nissan Sales and Ford and that it had merely made the introduction. However, the close links between Japanese carmakers and dealers have, in practice, prevented most dealers from selling cars other than those allotted to them by the manufacturers. This has led to an admission by the country's Fair Trade Commission that dealers are tightly bound to carmakers and has prompted US charges that Japan's car market is closed. The agreement follows a deal last year between Toyota and GM, the largest of the US big three carmakers, for Toyota to sell 20,000 GM cars through its dealerships in Japan starting in 1996. It comes as US-Japan tensions have been rising in recent weeks over a lack of progress in a series of bilateral trade talks aimed at increasing foreign penetration of Japan's markets. Disagreements on how to tackle the huge US trade deficit with Japan in car parts have been particularly difficult to bridge.</p>

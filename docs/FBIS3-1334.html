			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Pik Botha; place and date not </F> given; later issued by the NP Federal Council on the SAPA PR  Wire Service]    [Text] At a National Party [NP] press conference in  Pretoria today Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said:    On 24 January the SACP [South African Communist Party]  published a list of 34 members on the ANC [African National  Congress] candidates list. The SACP acknowledged that its  members made up an "embarrassing" 16 of the top 50 on the ANC  list.    SACP member Jeremy Cronin challenged the NP to produce proof  of any other members on the ANC list. Today the NP is doing  exactly that. We attach documentary evidence drawn from public  sources to disprove the SACP's figures.    We say that the SACP is systematically deceiving the South  African people by concealing the extent of its influence in the  ANC. An examination of the top 50 ANC candidates reveals that  25, not 16, are current SACP members. A further 3 are former  SACP members.    This means that a total of 28 out of the top 50 ANC  candidates are current and former SACP members. It is  absolutely extraordinary that the SACP, which as a political  party in its own right only obtains 1 percent support in opinion  polls, should be given the majority of places in the ANC's top  50. This is truly a case of the ANC horse being ridden by the  SACP jockey. Or a wolf in sheep's clothing.    The questions for the SACP to answer are:    Why, when they held their press conference, did they lie to  the media and the public about the number of SACP members on the  ANC list?    Why did the SACP conceal the identities of the following  party members who are in the ANC top 50? (ANC list number in  brackets):  Steve Tshwete (12), Dullah Omar (15), Gertrude Shope (22),  Mohammed Valli Moosa (26), Peter Mokaba (27), Aziz Pahad (37),  Penuell Maduna (38), Alfred Nzo (44), and Gill Marcus (47).    The SACP on 24 January declared that Ahmed Kathrada (7) and  Marc Maharaj (17) no longer belonged to the party.    Why did the SACP omit to mention that Thabo Mbeki (3) was in  the same category? Furthermore, there is doubt over whether Mr  Kathrada has really left the party. As recently as 7 January  1994, he was named by fellow SACP member Essop Pahad (29) as one  of 15 SACP members on the ANC National Executive Committee.    The ANC and the SACP have continued to lie about the extent  of SACP influence in the ANC.    On 23 February, Thabo Mbeki was reported as telling a  Johannesburg breakfast meeting that "no aspect of the ANC could  be described as communist".    On 13 March, during the Top Level TV programme on communists  in the ANC, Mr Joe Slovo said of SACP members "we know there are  26 on the list". Mr Slovo should have known better. After all,  he is the SACP chairman. His figure was 8 members less than the  SACP itself admitted in its deception of 24 January.    Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the minority of non communists  in the ANC top 50, remains silent on this highly embarrassing  issue. Interviewed on Britain's Channel 4 TV news on 24 January,  Mr Mandela said, "I think as far as the question of the  Communist Party is concerned, that's a non issue as far as we  are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it".    The ANC and the SACP have also remained silent about the non  elected communists they intend to bring in to the administration  after the April election.    THE WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN (11-17 February) named several  members of the ANC's civil service unit pilot group expected to  become senior Pretoria officials. These included Josiah Jele  (also 138 on the ANC candidates list); Sindiso Mfenyane; Sipho  Makana (former ANC chief of mission in Moscow); Anthony Mungalo  (former ANC chief of mission in East Berlin); and Stanley  Mabizela. All are SACP members.    THE SUNDAY TIMES (13 March) led its business news section  with the headline, "ANC's Fiery Turok To Run PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Economy". Mr Turok who the ANC  plans to be in charge of its Reconstruction and Development  Programme in the PWV, is a former member of the SACP.    There can be little doubt in the minds of any objective  person that the communists play a dominant role in the ANC, and  would play a dominant role in ANC government posts and policy  formulation. This is why the communists are trying to reassure  the business community and international opinion by pretending  that their policies are not those which brought economic and  political disaster to every other country which practised them.  But if the SACP try to deceive people about their real numbers  in the ANC, they will try even harder to deceive people about  their real policy intentions.</p>

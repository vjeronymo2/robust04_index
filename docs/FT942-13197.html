			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF accounts delayed Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics subsidiary of Thomson, the state-controlled French electronics group, is being forced to delay the publication of its 1993 accounts as a result of the difficulties of Credit Lyonnais, the ailing bank in which it is a minority investor. Credit Lyonnais, which is in dire financial straits after years of aggressive expansion, last month announced that it had made a FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.18bn) net loss for 1993 and disclosed details of a FFr44.9bn emergency financial restructuring package, including a FFr4.9bn capital increase and the transfer of FFr40bn of non-performing property loans to a new shell company. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, is understood to have taken a tough stance in negotiations with the government over Thomson-CSF's involvement with the rescue. The Thomson holding company will contribute FFr1.2bn towards the capital increase. However, Thomson-CSF has been left with a FFr1.5bn loss for 1993 due to its 21.56 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais. It will have to participate in providing guarantees for the new shell property company. The value of its participation in the guarantees has been estimated at FFr1.8bn, but has not yet been finalised. As a result, Thomson-CSF has decided to delay publication of its 1993 results, originally due to come out last Thursday, until it has assessed the full impact of its involvement in the Credit Lyonnais rescue. Thomson-CSF warned shortly after the announcement of the Credit Lyonnais rescue plan that it would fall into the red in 1993 because of its share of the bank's losses. The company, which made a net profits of FFr1.52bn in 1992, said its own businesses had produced 'very good' operating profits last year. Mr Philippe Mouthon, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, estimated that Thomson-CSF would make a net loss of FFr2.2bn for 1993 and come back into the black with net profits of FFr1.12bn this year. Credit Lyonnais's management is pressing ahead with the implementation of the rescue package. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, told L'Agefi, the French financial daily, he hoped to complete the capital increase by the end of June.</p>

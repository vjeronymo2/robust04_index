			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Sugar warns of weak demand MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, warned yesterday that there was no evidence of any pre-Christmas spending boom in Britain's high streets. Amstrad's often outspoken chairman told shareholders at the group's annual general meeting in London yesterday: 'Contrary to what you may hear from the government, trading conditions are not very good; people just aren't spending money.' Earlier Amstrad had issued a statement to the stock exchange warning that 'trading conditions in October have been poorer than anticipated, particularly in the UK where volumes and margins have been under pressure'. The statement, which led to Amstrad's share price plunging by 10 3/4 p or 20 per cent to 43p, added that the company expected November and December to reflect 'relatively weak demand'. While Amstrad acknowledged that the outturn for the Christmas season 'still remains unclear', the board warned that sales and margins were likely to be below last year's levels. As a result, Amstrad said that current market expectations for the group's sales and operating profit for the year to June 1994 were likely to be over-optimistic. Mr Sugar said that Amstrad, which once dominated the personal computer market in the UK, was now losing money on its remaining high street personal computer sales and had seen margins on its satellite television equipment business plunge. Amstrad's first-half results have traditionally been dependent on the strength of its October to December trading. Early indications of trading conditions can give advance warning of likely profit performance. After hitting a low of 20p last autumn, just before Mr Sugar attempted to buy back the company with a 30p-a-share bid, Amstrad's share price has risen sharply in recent months, buoyed by hopes of the economic recovery and the company's mounting cash balances, which stood at Pounds 167.1m at the end of June. Yesterday Mr Sugar rejected suggestions from a small group of dissident shareholders that Amstrad should increase its dividend and distribute some of its cash reserves - which have fallen to Pounds 140.5m at the end of October, reflecting seasonal factors - to shareholders. Mr Sugar said the cash would probably be used make further acquisitions that fell outside Amstrad's core consumer electronics business. London SE, Page 48</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Japanese-owned ICL wins Brussels research contracts ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer, has overcome the politically sensitive issue of its Japanese ownership to win a number of important European Commission research contracts. The projects are chiefly concerned with the development of 'intelligent' computers which appear to reason like humans. Computer experts believe that such 'thinking machines' will be commercially available well before the turn of the century. The chief purpose of the research is to strengthen European computer manufacturers' competitiveness with rivals in Japan and other countries. Siemens of Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Groupe Bull of France opposed the awarding of contracts to ICL on the grounds that it is Japanese-owned. But over the past two years, since its purchase by Fujitsu of Japan, ICL has re-established its European credentials by staying at arm's length from its new owner and maintaining its position as a leader in technological research. There has also been a change of mood in Brussels, with the recognition that fortress Europe is no longer feasible and an acceptance that the EC's members need ICL's input. Success in bringing intelligent computers to the market first could give European manufacturers a chance to retrieve their failing fortunes in the global market. One of the contracts ICL has been awarded is concerned with research critical to the future of Jessi, the European microchip programme from which the UK company was partially excluded two years ago after its purchase by Fujitsu. The Japanese company owns 80 per cent, with Northern Telecom of Canada owning the remaining 20 per cent. So far ICL has been awarded five contracts in the latest phase of Esprit, the European Programme for Research into Information Technology, worth a total of about Pounds 1.5m to the UK company. It expects to be awarded a further five or six. The value of the contracts, however, is comparatively unimportant compared with the acceptance of the company as a full member of the European computing community with a big part to play in its future. Esprit, established in 1982, is the Commission's main research effort in advanced computing. It allocated research funds to the value of Ecu1.6bn between 1987 and 1992. The Commission pays 50 per cent of companies' costs. Esprit is concerned with precompetitive research - developing basic technologies on which individual companies can build competitive products. It was set up in direct response to the Japanese 'Fifth Generation' project, a multi-million dollar plan to co-ordinate research between Japanese electronics companies and academic institutions to develop computers with human reasoning powers. It failed, however, to fulfil its lofty ambitions.</p>

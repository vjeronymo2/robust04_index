			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 15 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] There has been growing support recently within the  government and the ruling parties for a plan to resolve the  issue of full-fledged tax cuts beyond fiscal 1994 before the  meeting of leaders of the advanced countries (summit) to be held  in Naples from 8 July, instead of "before the end of 1994" as  originally planned. The purpose is to alleviate U.S. discontent  with Japan's huge current-accounts surplus. The Japanese  Government plans to include this in the market opening measures  to be compiled by the end of this month, and inform the United  States about this.    In connection with the tax cut, Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa announced in early February that a total of 18 trillion  yen reduction in income and residential taxes over a period of  three years would be implemented, to be followed by an increase  in consumption tax rate from 3 to 7 percent, which he termed the  "national welfare tax scheme." However, this plan was rescinded  due to the opposition of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] and other groups. As a result, only a 6 trillion yen tax  cut for fiscal 1994 has been agreed upon, and the issue of tax  cuts beyond 1994 is being left to deliberations by the ruling  parties' consultative body on tax reform, aiming at "passing the  relevant laws before the end of 1994."    However, the United States is strongly critical of a  "single-year tax cut." Visiting Secretary of State Warren  Christopher criticized Japan's stance at a news conference on 10  March, saying "this will be ineffective."    While the government intends to include in the economic  measures to be announced by the end of March four major steps to  liberalize the market -- such as import promotion -- and other  steps to bring about improvement in the automobile and auto  parts sector, and two other priority areas in the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, there is a persistent opinion in the  Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry that "the  United States will not be appeased unless there are concrete  measures offered in macroeconomic policy."    Top on the list of macroeconomic policies being considered  is  a plan to further augment the basic program for public  investments totaling 430 trillion yen. However, since it is  believed that "what the United States wants is tax cuts; and  they will also contribute to the expansion of domestic demand,"  (according to a senior Finance Ministry official) an earlier  conclusion in the ruling parties'debate on tax cuts has now  become a major focal issue.    Nevertheless, if an announcement that tax cuts are to  continue beyond fiscal 1994 is to be made, it will not be  possible to evade the issue of revenue source -- that is, the  consumption tax hike. There is still the problem of how to  persuade the SDPJ and other opposing forces inside the ruling  coalition parties.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROUGHT AND PORTER RANCH  </P> <P> I'm shocked by the City Council's lack of foresight in approving the Porter  Ranch development project. This project epitomizes the kind of rampant and  ill-conceived development that currently plagues our entire city.  </P> <P> Incredibly, just the impact of this one massive project on our already  considerable traffic, air pollution and waste disposal problems has the  potential of bringing this great city to its knees. Yet the council approves  this project unanimously.  </P> <P> This vote flies in the face of all reason and the overwhelming majority of  citizens who oppose it. The repercussions of this vote will be far-reaching and  costly. It will cost the taxpayers to clean up the mess it brings. It will cost  the city its reputation as a quality of life world leader and it will cost  those shortsighted council members at election time their status as  representatives for having shown the voters that they stand with the developers  against the interests of Los Angeles and the desires of the citizens.  </P> <P> BONNIE CHERMAK  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

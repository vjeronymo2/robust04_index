			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] In the evening of 26 April Georgian parliament  concluded confirmation of the composition of the Cabinet of  Ministers. Despite the rejection of the parliamentary opposition  to participate in the confirmation procedure which is lasting  for a month already the list of candidates proposed by Georgia's  leader Eduard Shevardnadze was adopted without any changes.    Almost all of the confirmed members of the Cabinet headed by  Premier Otar Patsatsiya have already worked in the government  with the exception of Vice Premier on economic reform Teimuraz  Basiliya and Defense Minister Lieutenant General Varden  Nadibaidze.    The new head of the military department and former deputy  commander of the Group of the Russian forces in Transcaucases  reported to INTERFAX that the proposal to become a defense  minister "was slightly unexpected for him." "However, I have  accepted it and, of course, at the first stage of my work on  this post I shall get acquainted with the people and with the  situation in the Georgian Army," he said.    Speaking about the Georgian Army, Nadibaidze declared that  "the Army should be disciplined, mobile, and combat efficient."  "In order to create such an army we need assistance of the  state, I think that we shall receive this aid," he said.    When asked about his position with respect to the settlement  of the Abkhazian conflict, Nadibaidze said that "the  negotiations on this issue are underway but they would not  determine everything."    On Wednesday in Tbilisi, Shevardnadze presented Nadibaidze  to  the staff of the Defense Ministry. The press center of the  ministry reported to Interfax that addressing the ministry's  board, Shevardnadze expressed hope that this appointment would  assist in a faster making of the Georgian Army and increase its  combat efficiency.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Increased Sun price fails to halt paper war The newspaper price-cutting wars seem likely to continue into the autumn in spite of yesterday's 2p increase in the cover price of The Sun to 22p. The rise came as Today - also a News International title - ended local price-cutting experiments in Liverpool and Scotland and returned to a national cover price of 25p. News International insisted yesterday that the price increase at The Sun merely reflected rising costs, particularly of newsprint, and did not represent a retreat from its aggressive pricing policy. Early estimates suggest that The Sun has been selling about 4.17m copies a day in the traditionally dead month of August. There were claims that circulation rose 1 per cent yesterday in spite of the price increase. Sales were helped by heavy television promotion of a 16-page football supplement and the latest news of the Princess of Wales. The 2p increase will help the Daily Mirror as it narrows the price differential between the two tabloids to 5p. The Mirror believes it is beginning to close the gap with The Sun. Its estimated circulation is 2.7m, or 3.8m when the Glasgow-based Daily Record is included. Although News International said prices were always kept under review, it insisted yesterday: 'There is certainly no plan to increase the price of The Times at the moment.' The broadsheet, at 20p, is now 2p cheaper than The Sun and is estimated to be selling just under 600,000 copies a day. The other main participants in the marketing struggle seem determined to keep their nerve. 'We're fighting for every copy and for our lives,' said Mr Stephen Grabiner, managing director of The Telegraph group. He said that cutting the price of The Daily Telegraph to 30p during the week had emphasised the paper's pre-eminence. Circulation had slipped below 1m, but the paper is now believed to be selling more than 1.07m copies a day. 'We are not going to do anything with our price unless The Times reacts,' said Mr Grabiner. 'We are going to try to prove to Rupert Murdoch that the Pounds 30m or Pounds 40m it is costing him isn't worth it.' The Independent, which reluctantly moved to 30p to protect its circulation and has now increased sales to about 285,000, is expected to stay at that price for the time being. The price wars have undoubtedly hit profits, but according to July figures the national broadsheet market was up 8.4 per cent year-on-year. The tabloid market rose 3.21 per cent. The first hard evidence of the cost of the adventure will come on Thursday with News International's results, but the bill will probably be a good deal less than the Pounds 50m suggested by some analysts.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / ILO reports severe job losses in Russia Russian industry has suffered severe job losses over the past three years according to an International Labour Organisation report released yesterday. Mr Guy Standing, head of the ILO's central and eastern European team, said there had also been a big rise in those on unpaid leave or short time. This year could see even more jobs cut. Nearly a third of the enterprises surveyed last year feared they could soon go bankrupt, under new laws soon to come into effect, mainly because of debts owed to other enterprises. The real level of unemployment in Russia was already some 6-7 times the official rate of about 1.5 per cent, he added, warning that the growth of a large marginalised minority endangered economic and social reforms. However, the findings were dismissed by Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, who has been helping Russian economic reformers with labour problems. He said he had had 'long conversations' with the ILO representative compiling the figures but remained convinced unemployment stood at 1.4 per cent. The ILO has called for an international commission to co-ordinate assistance to Russia on labour market and social protection issues. The 340 enterprises surveyed in 1993 cut employment on average by 8.8 per cent over the previous 12 months, similar to the decline shown in two previous surveys and bringing the cumulative fall since 1991 to well over 20 per cent. Nearly 40 per cent of factories said they could meet current low levels of output with fewer workers, almost a quarter fewer on average. Five per cent of all workers were on unpaid leave in 1993 which, if extended to the economy as a whole, could involve more than 2.5m workers. Short-time working had become 'pervasive', with 10 per cent of normal hours not being worked. At a news conference in Geneva Mr Standing said the survey results contradicted claims by some Russian reformers that 'shock therapy' had never been tried because industry had not shed workers. State enterprises had actually cut employment by more (13 per cent) than those in private hands last year, he noted. Russia recorded a Dollars 16bn foreign trade surplus in 1993, thanks to increases in energy and raw material exports and a sharp fall in imports due to a cut in the system of centralised purchases by the state, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.</p>

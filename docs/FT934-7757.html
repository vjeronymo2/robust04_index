			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: WooL There were some signs this week that the wool market recovery might have spent itself, if only for the time being. In Australia the market indicator after rising to 511 cents a kg. fell back to 503 yesterday, and clearances at two of the three selling centres, Fremantle and Sydney, were less than 90%. softness in the Australian dollar has also had a slight cheapening effect for buyers in many countries. A setback after almost three months of rising prices and an advance of 25% overall is not causing great concern in the trade.</p>

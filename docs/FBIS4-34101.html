			<p>BFN     [Text] A poll conducted by Vox Populi between 4 and 7 June  is published exclusively by JORNAL DO BRASIL. It indicates that  compared to the poll conducted in May, support for Workers Party  candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has dropped by 5 points.  His support dropped from 41 percent to 36 percent, but the  votes lost by Lula have not been absorbed by any of his main  rivals. Support for Fernando Henrique Cardoso, of the Brazilian  Social Democracy Party, remains at 17 percent and he continues  in second place. Democratic Labor Party candidate Leonel  Brizola still holds third place and is supported by 7 percent of  the voters. Those who will annul their votes or who still do  not know for whom they will vote total 29 percent. The poll  also indicates that President Itamar Franco's support for  Cardoso is important and that strikes staged by the Sole Workers  Center harm Lula's image.</p>

That will mean an increase of about 3 percent  over the initial 1993 budget, and represent a higher annual  growth rate than that for the 1993 budget.    But, in order to avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds,  financial manipulations--like rolled-up repayment of loans from  profits in the sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation (NTT) shares--will be made, and expenditure not  contributing to new projects will have to increase. As such, it  will be a de-facto "belt-tightening" budget which will in effect  fall below the initial 1993 budget. The reason for this is the  expected fall in tax revenue in the year; it is likely tax  revenue will be less than 58 trillion yen.    The Finance Ministry hopes to raise expenses on public works  projects while containing the total budget amount. The ministry  also hopes that, in combination with a third 1993 supplementary  budget, this one will stimulate the national economy.    The government and ruling coalition parties plan to carry  out  a large-scale income tax reduction retroactive to January 1994  by revising the taxation system. Once a decision on tax  reduction is made, the tax revenue estimate must be lowered by  that much. But since government bonds will be issued to raise  government revenue, the size of the general-account budget will  not change much. The Finance Ministry will formulate the third  1993 supplementary budget while formulating the 1994 budget. The  ministry is considering increasing public works projects in the  supplementary budget. It can be said the ministry in fact aims  to boost the national economy by formulating the two budgets as  one unit (a budget for 15 months).    What normally becomes a point of concern in formulating the  revenue part of the general-account budget is the estimation of  tax revenue. This fiscal year, because of the economic  recession, the revenue from such sources as corporate tax has  fallen. At the time of formulating the second supplementary  budget, tax revenue amounted to only 55.68 trillion yen, falling  short of the budgeted revenue by more than 5.6 trillion yen.  Although tax revenue for fiscal 1994 will be estimated by using  these figures as a base, the government is leaning toward  ironing out differences of opinion on the basis of an idea to  set an estimated economic growth rate in real terms at about 2.5  percent. It is likely the growth rate will be about 4 percent  even in nominal terms. Therefore, it seems that overall tax  revenue will be only some 58 trillion yen. This is the lowest  level since the 58,004 billion yen posted in fiscal 1990 as far  as initial budgets are concerned.    Regarding revenue other than from taxes, national bonds will  be issued to cover expenses related to public works projects.  The government will also issue construction bonds, which will  amount to a little more than 8.5 trillion yen, to cover  occupancy expenses [setsubihi] and other costs. It is expected  that nontax revenues, including Bank of Japan contributions,  will amount to a little less than 3 trillion yen.    However, following the rolled-up repayment of the loans from  profits in the sale of NTT shares, the government will issue  additional construction bonds, which amount to a little less  than 3.3 trillion yen. Moreover, repayments by municipalities  will be appropriated in the budget as nontax revenues.  Therefore, the size of the budget will expand by about 4.5  trillion yen in total. Due to the shortage of financial  resources, the rolled-up repayment of project loans from profits  in the sale of NTT shares, will be used to secure the balance of  amortization fund, which stops the withdrawal of fixed amount of  payment from the general account. We can say that it is a  desperate measure taken under the pressure of necessity to avoid  deficit-financing government bond issues by issuing additional  construction bonds.    The actual size of the general account, excluding this  special primary factor, will be some 70 trillion yen, which is  about 3 percent less than the fiscal 1993 general account.  Previously, the size of the general account was smaller than  that of the previous year only in 1956 (it was 0.8 percent less).    Regarding expenditures, the amount of grants from the  national government to local governments [chiho kofuzei kofukin]  designed to distribute a certain percent of tax revenues to  local governments, will be a little less than 15 trillion yen as  far as calculations on tax revenues are concerned. However, due  to reimbursement of excessively paid local allocation tax and  other reasons, the total amount of expenditures will be set at  the 13 trillion yen level. Although the amount of roughly  estimated budget request for amortization of government bonds,  which is an expenditure for paying back national debts, is 16.58  trillion yen, it will be kept down to about 15 trillion yen.  Moreover, 1.54 trillion yen is needed to cover the revenue  shortfall of fiscal 1992.    Therefore, it is necessary to keep down the growth rate of  general expenditures to less than 41 trillion yen, which is a  little more than the 2 percent growth of the previous year.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker Pounds 83.3m in the red after interest - Evening opening boosts turnover at William Hill BRENT WALKER, the leisure and property group which continues to trade with the support of its bankers as it breaches covenants agreed during last year's refinancing, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83.3m in the half year to end-June after an interest charge of Pounds 98.1m. Although the interest charge had fallen from Pounds 107.9m, helped by lower interest rates, the pre-tax loss was up from Pounds 79.4m. There was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 80.7m). William Hill, the group's betting shop chain, whose future is under consideration by Brent Walker, increased its turnover by 11.5 per cent to Pounds 791.4m. Mr John Leach, finance director, said he estimated that a change to evening opening had increased turnover between 5 and 10 per cent. The non-running of the Grand National had cost William Hill about Pounds 2m, Mr Leach thought, and operating profits were down 5.2 per cent to Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 25.5m). Mr Leach said if Brent Walker were to float William Hill it would probably wait until the new year when an estimate of 1993 profits could be made. The other options are to sell the chain or refinance its ring-fenced loan, which falls due on March 1 next year. Brent Walker's pub business suffered difficult trading conditions, and profits fell from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 5.14m. The figures were affected by costs of restructuring the business, Mr Leach said. Group turnover was up 10 per cent to Pounds 858.9m, with that from continuing operations up 11.5 per cent. Operating profits totalled Pounds 25.3m (Pounds 28.5m) after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1m). These relate to refinancing costs and provisions against asset values. There was an Pounds 11.7m charge relating to losses on sales or planned sales. Mr Leach said that William Hill's operating profit roughly equalled its interest bill, and the group is also paying interest on a Pounds 70m new money facility extended by its banks at the time of last year's refinancing. In all about Pounds 27m of the interest was paid in cash, with the remainder rolled up into the debt or converted into preference shares. The balance sheet shows negative net worth of Pounds 629.8m, up from Pounds 557.9m at the end of 1992. Net bank debt grew from Pounds 1.33bn at the year end to Pounds 1.37m as interest accrued, and convertible notes remained at the year end figure of Pounds 87.9m. Brent Walker is still waiting for an adjudication on its dispute with Grand Metropolitan over the Pounds 685m price it paid for William Hill and Mecca Bookmakers. Both sides have made further submissions to the arbitrator. Brent Walker continues to owe GrandMet the final Pounds 50m of the purchase price, plus about Pounds 20m of accrued interest.</p>

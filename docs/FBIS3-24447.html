			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Economist Yevgeniy Yasin by Galina </F> Kovalskaya, NOVOYE VREMYA correspondent; date and place not  given: "The Basic Reforms are Already Behind"]    [Text] The well-known economist Yevgeniy Yasin has  given a regular quarterly interview to NOVOYE VREMYA.    [Kovalskaya] The new year has been marked by changes in the  composition of the government. The rhetoric has also changed at  once: on practically all levels the talk is about strengthening  state monitoring, state regulation. This is all but the basic  motive in the president's message to the Duma. Are there not  threats to the reforms here?    [Yasin] Strengthening of state power in Russia is totally  necessary. And I can only welcome such intentions. We have spent  two years under conditions of the continuous weakening of the  state, which has been related also to the political  situation--the disintegration of the Union, the strengthening of  separatism within Russia, the replacement of the ruling elite,  and to the economic reform, since the liberation of economic  subjects under our conditions has inevitably also turned into  the weakening of legal control.    Privatization was the main thing in the first stage of the  economic transformations. This task has been basically resolved.  The mechanism has been started up and the further course of  privatization depends already on the economic and social  conditions in the country. So the task of consolidating state  institutions or, in other words, of maintaining order is now  advancing to the forefront. Effective functioning of the  militia, the tax inspectorate, customs houses and investigatory  and judicial organs is required.    Let's take the problem of non-payments, one of the most  acute  social problems--the consequence not so much of stringent  financial policy as of the absence of the monitoring of money  flows. Entrepreneurial activity is being held in check not only  by inflation but also by the unprecedented scope of criminality  and corruption. These costs in the form of chaos and lack of  control, obviously, are inevitable. But in the same way the  struggle with them, moreover on the state level, is also  inevitable.    However, another fear is expressed in your question: will  not  a strengthening of the interference of the state in the economy  according to formulations like those our respected academicians  proposed take place? Will they not try to return to price  regulations and to close up the economy? This would really bring  nothing but harm. I think that in the goverment they understand  that such measures would be a retreat from the reforms.    Perhaps I will now surprise you. However, I think that the  reforms are on the whole already behind us. The main thing has  been done: prices have been liberalized, the economy has been  opened up, and privatization is almost completed. Now one needs  to preserve all this and to proceed further along specific  institutional directions. It's right here that a strong and  effective state is required.    For example, the question of optimizing the management of  state enterprises has been on the agenda since the middle of  1992. It was talked about in the Gaydar program for the  intensification of economic reforms. There is nothing  anti-market here: an enterprise cannot operate efficiently if it  is not controlled by the owner. Since the owner in this case is  the state, so there should be state control.    In everything else the level of state interference in the  economy ought to come down to promulgating good laws and  providing the mechanisms for their operation.    [Kovalskaya] How strongly will the departure of the  reformers  from the government strike at reform?    [Yasin] Let's get used to the fact that the time of simple  solutions and unequivocal evaluations has passed. I'm by no  means delighted with the new composition of the cabinet. I very  much regret the departure of Boris Fedorov, even more than the  departure of Gaydar. At the same time I think that Gaydar has  done his own very important part in the matter and already other  people will be able to accomplish the rest. But to read the  burial service over the reform and to call Chernomyrdin an  anti-reformer, as many mass information media have been doing in  recent months, is both incorrect and simply harmful in my  opinion.    [Kovalskaya] At the end of last year the government was  getting ready to begin the clearing up of the finances of  insolvent enterprises and the appropriate preparatory work had  been done. Will this now be given up?    [Yasin] As far as I can judge feelings are rather firm, in  any case for the prime-minister. But the question is very  difficult and is connected with the fate of millions of people.  All the talk that bankruptcy will not lead to the closing of an  enterprise is no more than an attempt to comfort. In the  overwhelming majority of cases, bankruptcy inevitably should  lead precisely to the closing of an enterprise. Otherwise, it  makes no economic sense.    In a normal situation the question of bankruptcy is not a  state question. It is the creditors who are not being paid who  should initiate legal proceedings in regard to their partners.  But in reality this is not yet occuring among us. There is no  financial discipline, not even an understanding that this is the  case. The new stockholders don't yet know their rights and don't  know how to fight for them. State interference is apparently  necessary in this situation.    As for state enterprises, no legal proceedings whatever are  needed here at all. And a bankruptcy law is not necessary. All  this talk last year that, they say, our hands are tied since  there is no bankruptcy law is groundless. An owner has a right  to manage his own property as he sees fit. In reality another  thing brought it to a standstill: a well-founded fear of social  explosion.    You can't avoid the sorting out of insolvent enterprises.  This is becoming a question of survival. Meager financial  resources are being spread thin. As a result both promising and  unpromising economic subjects find themselves under the same  atttack. A stratagem for redistributing budget funds is  required. Only efficient enterprises should be supported. By the  way, not only state but private.    I call attention to this especially, since a stereotype has  taken root among us that the business of the state is only the  state sector. So the criterion here should be efficiency and not  the form of ownership. Especially as it is difficult with  certainty to call enterprises like Uralmash just now made  joint-stock companies private. They somehow occupy an  intermediate niche.    [Kovalskaya] The ruble exchange rate sometimes stabilizes,  sometimes suddenly, as this week, falls spasmodically. What is  this related to?    [Yasin] It's very good to have a stable national currency.  It  is an indicator of the economy's health. But artificial support  of a currency's stability in an unhealthy economy leads to  nothing good. The stablilization of the exchange rate last  year--the consequence of a stringent monetary policy--is the  direct service of Boris Fedorov. Jumps are a reaction to the  growth of prices.    Why doesn't a smooth increase occur? Because the conduct of  the agents of the currency market is determined by two  circumstances: on the one hand the physical shortage of rubles  and on the other--the approach of internal Russian prices to  world prices, so that the dollar also ceases to be a reliable  means for storing money.    The special feature of our financial situation is that the  dollar exchange rate, despite all the jumps, is nevertheless  growing slower than internal prices. The fact is that in recent  years the circle of strictly market enterprises (commercial  banks and production units directly related to import and  export), which very quickly and economically adequately reacts  to stringent financial policy, has been set apart. They also are  the basic agents on the currency exchange.    But those producers which basically establish consumer  prices, wholesale and retail, in their mass are far less mobile,  more "socialistically" oriented, inclined to pay wages first and  then debts. That is why prices in the country react slower to  financial policy than to the ruble exchange rate.    [Kovalskaya] It turns out that our inflation also is really  not related to monetary policy and the Abalkin-Shatalin-Petrakov  group is right?    [Yasin] In no circumstances can one give up a stringent  financial policy. But the talk about "cost inflation" instead of  "demand inflation" is altogether unfounded. Inflation always is  urged on by both demand and by costs. The one reinforces the  other. But here it is, of course, necessary to pay attention to  the structural factors which provoke the growth of inflation.    Consequently, we again return to the strengthening of the  role of the state. Who thought to what extent our inflation was  caused by the fact that taxes are not being collected? Or by  corruption? Or by the lack of currency control?    [Kovalskaya] Are these really feasible tasks? Some  presidents  in the near abroad proclaimed the struggle with corruption their  basic task and the disintegration of even those poorly operating  structures which were there merely occured as a result.    [Yasin] Of course, the best method of fighting corruption is  a liberal economy and regulation of the functions of bureaucrats  and departments. However, one also cannot attempt to suppress  corruption and arbitrariness by forceful methods, with the help  of the law, the militia, the tax inspectorate, and customs  houses--the impunity in such cases completely demoralizes  society.    For example, an appropriate economic policy is needed first  of all to stop the export of currency abroad: an increase in the  interest rates on deposits. But currency control, which not a  single state can do without, is also necessary.    Corruption, I am certain, will not decline in Russia until  privatization is completed, and until state property is either  pilfered or plundered. But this does not mean that deliberate  connivance is permissible.    [Kovalskaya] Everyone is anxious about the impending  reunification of monetary systems with Belarus. One of the  sorest subjects is that Belarus for the last two years has  stubbornly not liberated prices and has "maintained production."  How are we now to unite while in fact taking on the maintenance  of their unprofitable enterprises? Or to succeed in insisting on  the liberation of Belarus's internal prices?    [Yasin] I'm not sure. But didn't you notice that the fact is  that prices are also regulated in Russia? Only not on the state  level, but by the local authorities. In Moscow, for example,  Luzhkov holds down the prices for gasoline and for many  products. The local leaders do this in a majority of oblasts.    There are oblasts that are record-holders in the regulation  of prices like Ulyanovsk and Orel oblasts. In my view they are  acting more reasonably in Nizhniy Novgorod, where the prices are  completely free and compensation is paid to the poor. However,  the government is very wise in not interfering in the internal  affairs of the regions. Imagine if the inhabitants of Ulyanovsk  Oblast, who are terribly proud of the low prices in their  stores, suddenly found out that "from the top" they are  prohibiting the freezing of prices?    Let the population itself rather react to the disappearance  of goods from the counters and to the inevitable setting of  norms for products, or enterprises rebel against the additional  tribute which the oblast assesses them in order to be able to  hold on to low prices.    I think that Belarus also, if the unification of finances  takes place, will find itself in the position of an oblast in  which prices are being regulated on the regional level. Ten  million strong, Belarus will not inflict catastrophic damage on  the Russian economy.    [Kovalskaya] In December the country lived through a series  of strikes. A new bout of the strike fever is now beginning.  What, in your view, is the optimal conduct strategy with respect  to strikes?    [Yasin] I personally think that one should display great  severity precisely towards those who try to take the country by  the throat: the power industry workers, the transport workers.  Of course, for a state order, once this obligation has been  thoughtlessly undertaken by the government it needs to be paid  for at the proper time. However, under no circumstances whatever  should the government clear off from the budget the indebtedness  of enterprises that are users of coal or other energy resources.    That these same miners have a right to demand certain  actions  from the government is another matter. To close unprofitable  mines and to resettle people from the North to the  mainland--these are all just and reasonable desires. Very little  is being done in this direction as yet. The World Bank will  grant money for modernization of the coal industry but we are  still not able to use it.    One should respond in the right way not to intensive  pressure  but to the needs of those groups like invalids and single  mothers who cannot stand up for themselves.</p>

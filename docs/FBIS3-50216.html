			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 21 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign  Ministry has rejected statements made by Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky in an interview for the Polish weekly  POLITYKA in which he questions Slovakia's compliance with its  commitments in the framework of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe (CE).    In a statement given to CTK today the Ministry expressed  surprise that the Hungarian foreign minister has assumed the  right of arbitration in assessing whether the Slovak Republic is  fulfilling its multilateral obligations. Jeszenszky again  described Slovakia's attitude towards the Hungarian minority as  the only problem in Slovak-Hungarian relations and stressed that  the problem of borders between the two countries did not exist  and that there was thus no need to deal with it.    Slovakia is interested in concluding a basic interstate  treaty with Hungary and it reiterates its readiness to provide  guarantees that Hungarian minority rights will be observed in  Slovakia in the spirit of international norms. However at the  same time Slovakia demands that a clause on inviolability of  borders be included in the treaty, the statement says.    Jeszenszky's statements do not serve to create mutual trust  and they could lead to the strengthening of the positions of  extremists on both sides, which could endanger the atmosphere  for solving other open questions between the two countries, the  statement says.</p>

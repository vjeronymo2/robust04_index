			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Draft constitution gives Yeltsin supreme powers RUSSIA'S draft constitution, published last night, establishes the president as the supreme authority in the country and guarantees, for the first time, the right to own and sell land. The draft, which will be put to a national referendum on December 12, also establishes the central bank as independent of all levels of state power. President Boris Yeltsin, in a television address last night, said the constitution was designed to lay down a 'firm, legal order' for a democratic state. It marked a break with the Soviet past and with the period of 'dual power' between presidency and parliament which ended with the banning of parliament in September. The draft establishes the president as the supreme authority in the country, giving him the right to override the decisions of the two-chamber parliament, issue decrees and be impeached only after a lengthy process of voting and reference to the courts. The president also proposes candidates for the chairman of the central bank, all key judges and the prosecutor general. It establishes all 89 'subjects of the federation' - the republics, regions, districts and two main cities (Moscow and St Petersburg) - as equal in their rights and subject to the laws and decisions of the federal authorities. It sets out civil and social rights for all citizens of the federation, enshrining in law rights to belief, travel and assembly. 'The right of private property is secured by the state,' it says. In a final section on the 'transitional situation', it lays down that the president must serve his full term until June 1996 - thus cancelling Mr Yeltsin's promise to stand for election in June - a decision that he announced at the weekend and which has attracted fierce criticism. The draft constitution will be enshrined in law if 50 per cent of those voting in the referendum support it. The constitution has already attracted criticism from the liberal end of the political spectrum. Mr Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion and a candidate of the pro-Yeltsin group Choice of Russia, said: 'It is obviously temporary, it cannot serve the country in the longer term.' In a front-page editorial in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Mr Valery Tretyakov, the Moscow daily's editor, said the constitution would be approved in the referendum but that 'it is a constitution for presidents in general and for President Yeltsin in particular'. Mr Yeltsin, in a pre-emptive move yesterday against the attempt by the Sverdlovsk region to upgrade itself to the status of the Urals Republic, cancelled the region's declaration of republican status - only to have the regional leader, Mr Eduard Rossel, proclaim he would stand for election as governor of the republic, also on December 12. The Central Electoral Commission also urged the leadership of the North Caucasian republic of Chechnya to take part in the elections.

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet Open air Shakespeare in London has to triumph over cold and wet, and in New York over humidity and noise. A successful play in the Theatre, Regent's Park or the Delacourt, Central Park needs to be robust and expansive enough to counter the environment. The New Shakespeare company's Romeo &amp; Juliet, directed by Judi Dench at Regent's Park, is full of tense excitement but never manages to catch the spirit of the play. Shakespeare pinched the plot from a dull version published in 1562, and wrote it in 1595, when he was 31. Because the principals are youthful, Romeo is often taken for a play about youth. And because the fighting and feuding happen outdoors, in the 'public haunts of men', it is taken for an open air play. Most of the action takes place inside, in the dark chambers and private space of house, cell and tomb. A good production needs more subtlety than outdoor style in acting or presentation can provide. The verse is tortuous: 'My only love sprung from my only hate] Too early seen unknown, and known too late' cannot be shouted like an invocation to the rear seats, but should be muttered close to. Shakespeare conjured a disturbing mixture: bachelor banter with Mercutio, frolics with the nurse, dense and delicate verse, botched and casual slaughters, and a plot that falls over itself with dispatch. The best moments of the evening come when Mercutio or Friar Lawrence perform, in front of the other actors, irrespective of the audience. Given the unsuitability of the play, the actors fare well enough. Rebecca Callard as Juliet and Zubin Varla as Romeo maintain a breathy and anxious commitment. Dench's direction favours a full stage, and the fights are lusty and inventive. The set (Jack Notman) is a wonderful colour, perfect Veronese masonry, and opens out nicely for the house and the tomb scenes. But the balcony which waits patiently stage right has an air of inevitability. Soon Romeo, not ivy, will be clinging to it. Regent's Park Theatre, Inner Circle, Regent's Park 071 486 2431</p>

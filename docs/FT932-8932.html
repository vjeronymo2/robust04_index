			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Poll tax defaulters made bankrupt FOUR 'persistent' poll tax defaulters have been declared bankrupt after actions brought by Knowsley Council on Merseyside, the local authority said yesterday. The council conducted 12 test cases at Liverpool County Court last week  - the other eight defendants agreed in court to clear their debts. The four bankrupt defaulters will now have their property, belongings and income possessed by the bankruptcy trustee who will discharge their debts. The council warned that it would pursue other poll tax defaulters.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> QUAYLE BOOED BY WEST POINT CADETS;  </P> <P> MENTION OF HIS DUTY IN INDIANA GUARD SETS OFF STUDENTS  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, dogged during last year's campaign by suggestions  that he was a draft dodger, was booed by West Point cadets today as he was  introduced as commencement speaker.  </P> <P> Ignoring the less-than-hearty welcome and a steady downpour, Quayle praised the  nation's new second lieutenants -- including 112 women, 156 minority members  and four foreign students -- who were presented with degrees and officer's bars  at the U.S. Military Academy's 191st commencement ceremony.  </P> <P> "You are the guardians of peace. While working for peace, we must keep our  defense strong," he said.  </P> <P> The boos and hisses arose from the corps of cadets, West Point's  undergraduates, when the vice president was introduced with a mention of his  Vietnam-era service in the Indiana National Guard. Quayle, 42, did not react.  </P> <P> Questions were raised during last year's presidential campaign about whether  Quayle's family, influential in newspaper publishing and Indiana political  circles, pulled strings to get him into the Guard to dodge the draft.  </P> <P> In his commencement address, Quayle praised the graduates who had earned  academic honors and noted that he had never made the dean's list while in  college.  </P> <P> He told the cadets -- resplendent in dress gray uniforms, purple sashes and  white hats -- that "devotion to the profession of the military and to the  well-being of soldiers is a legacy of West Point and of those leaders in the  long, gray line that preceded you.  </P> <P> "It is their achievement and their sacrifice that you must never fail to honor,  and whatever the circumstances, always remember to be proud, very, very proud.  . . . There is no more noble calling than serving your country."  </P> <P> Quayle drew applause when he announced that former President Ronald Reagan, who  in 1987 reviewed the corps and granted "amnesty" for all demerits, will receive  the academy's Thayer Award, which goes to the American who best fulfills West  Point's motto, "Duty, Honor, Country."  </P></p>

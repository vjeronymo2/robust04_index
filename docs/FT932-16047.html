			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Danes to press for EC law on works councils THE DANISH presidency of the EC yesterday made clear its determination to push for the setting up of mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies. This is one of the Community's most controversial pieces of draft social legislation. After talks among employment and social affairs ministers, it became clear that Britain - the only member state opposing the measure - will have to fight to dilute its content, or see it passed by its 11 partners, assuming that the Maastricht treaty and its social protocol come into force later this year. If the works council directive were passed by the 11, British companies would still be among those most affected. According to British calculations, more than 100 UK companies have operations in continental Europe which are large enough to fall under the requirements of the directive for their operations outside Britain. If the UK were party to the scheme, more than 300 companies would be affected, a fifth more than in Germany and three times more than France. Denmark wants agreement among the 11 by June, in an effort to demonstrate to its sceptical voters that the EC can deliver social standards comparable to its own. If the UK wishes to stay detached from the measure, as it did from the Maastricht social chapter, the works council requirements would go through without the British if and when the treaty is ratified. If Denmark itself ratifies Maastricht in its referendum on May 18, the works council issue could itself become embroiled in the tangled process of British parliamentary ratification of the treaty. The directive would oblige companies employing more than 1,000 workers in more than one of the EC's 12 member states, and with more than 100 employees in at least two of them, to set up elected works councils. They would have to be consulted on issues such as job changes, new technology and investment plans and relocation of business. During the recent controversies over alleged 'job poaching' in the relocation to the UK of production by Hoover in Burgundy and Digital from the west of Ireland, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, pledged a new effort to get the works councils directive into EC law. The Commission believes cases like Hoover and Digital would be less inflammatory with obligatory consultation of the workforce, denying companies the chance to play one set of employees off against another.</p>

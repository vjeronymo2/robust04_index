			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the Left Bloc </F> Deputies Club, by Jana Sprunkova and Jan Stetka; place and date  not given: "The ODS Is Attempting To Control the Senate"]    [Text] Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the Left Bloc  Deputies' Club, is concerned that, through the currently drafted  laws on elections to the Senate, Chamber of Deputies, and local  administration, the government coalition parties intend to  reinforce their power and throw the present opposition out of  the game. Therefore, LIDOVE NOVINY asked Ortman several  questions.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is the reason for your concern?    [Ortman] I believe that the Civic Democratic Party [ODS],  which advocates the one-seat wards for the Senate elections,  wants to assume complete control over this body. It depends on  its unrivalled position confirmed by public opinion surveys. If  other parties of the coalition want to work their way into the  Senate, they must endorse the three-seat alternative--namely, if  a joint slate of the coalition parties is not established, the  Civic Democratic Alliance, the Christian and Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, and the Christian Democratic  Party have no chance of having senators.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Is the position of the opposition parties  any different?    [Ortman] In the example of the one-seat wards, the  opposition would also remain without senators. The clash over  the number of seats, however, will be a bone of contention for  most of the coalition parties.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you in favor of introducing candidate  deposits in the elections?    [Ortman] The deposits contradict Article 18 of the Czech  Constitution on the principle of equality. Our state abandoned  property censuses with the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Property censuses do not belong in modern legal systems. If  20,000 korunas per candidate is being considered now, this  amount over time could climb to a million, and then it certainly  would be discriminating. The censuses principle is a catch  placed like a time bomb in the election law.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you worried about the reduced number of  local administration members following the local elections? The  government has proposed a reduction by as much as one-half.    [Ortman] Imagine that small communities would have just  three aldermen who must choose one of them to be the mayor,  whether the communal property is to be released, some cultural  object is to be sold, etc. In a town with a population of tens  of thousands, there might be just seven aldermen. These people  would concentrate in their hands an unbelievable power. For the  coalition parties, I would use the slogan "Oh Lord, how low I  have sunk." Just to fill their slates, they are willing to  sacrifice the number of members of the administrations. In  principle, the status quo should be preserved.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] It is well known that the Left Bloc deputies  would best like it if the Senate were removed from the  Constitution. Do you not believe it occasionally necessary that  the poor laws adopted by parliament be caught in time by the  Senate and thus prevent unnecessary amendments?    [Ortman] The Senate would really play the role of a guard  dog. We have, however, other insurances--namely, the president  with the power to return the laws and the Constitutional Court.  The poor laws are, above all, the result of hasty and inferior  work in parliamentary committees. In this respect, the decisive  factor is the composition of the Constitutional and Legal  Affairs Committee, the present expert knowledge of which does  not provide any guarantee of quality. Some parties even  assigned people who are not lawyers to this committee.</p>

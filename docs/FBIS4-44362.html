			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Wastell, Christopher Lockwood: "Tory </F> Delight as Major Uses EC Veto"]    [Text] Corfu -- John Major surprised and delighted the  Conservative Party last night by using Britain's veto to block  what he called a Franco-German "carve-up" which would have  installed Jean-Luc Dehaene, the avowedly federalist Belgian  premier, as the successor to Jacques Delors at the helm of the  European Commission.    Mr Major's move, which throws the European Community into  temporary disarray, means a frantic search to find alternative  candidates has now begun. Germany, which takes over the EC  presidency from Greece on July 1, yesterday called for an  emergency summit to be held in Brussels on July 15.    Many Tory MPs, including some who have been openly critical  of Mr Major's leadership over recent months, applauded his stand.    One of the Prime Minister's most prominent critics on the  backbenches, John Carlisle, said Mr Major was "at last" showing  real strength of leadership. "Good for him. At last he has  been wielding his predecessor's handbag. It is just exactly  what people wanted to see."    Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Tory  right-wingers, said: "John Major has shown we mean business in  the Community."    The veto raised the possibility that Britain's EC partners  would put up alternative Belgian candidates who would be as  unacceptable to Britain as Mr Dehaene, or that Mr Delors could  be put forward by German diplomats for a further term.    The Prime Minister defended his decision, declaring to  fellow  leaders at the Corfu summit: "This situation is only a crisis  if everyone wants to make it one."    He said at the end of the meeting: "I believe it is  necessary even at the expense of painful decisions and difficult  moments to make sure that we have the best candidate for this  vitally important job."    The new Commission president will see the Community through  the crucial 1996 conference which will revise the Maastricht  Treaty and set the shape of the EC into the next century.    Although Mr Major yesterday appeared isolated, with all 11  other EC countries voting to accept Mr Dehaene, he drew support  from several of his partners for his tough stand against the  imposition of Mr Dehaene without proper consultation. Italy, in  particular, though reluctantly agreeing with the majority, has  been infuriated by the attempt by France and Germany to  steamroller Mr Dehaene's appointment through.    "It is important that someone has reminded us of the  importance of principles," said Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign  minister. The Dutch, too, were forced to withdraw their prime  minister, Ruud Lubbers, as a candidate, and have spoken out  against the tactics of the Dehaene camp. Sir Leon Brittan, who  Mr Major described as the best candidate for the job, failed to  win the support of a single other country, and withdrew from the  contest yesterday morning at the same time as Mr Lubbers.    Explaining why he has continued to oppose Mr Dehaene after  everyone else had come round to him, Mr Major said: "What I  could not understand is why, when at a very late stage, and  since everyone has expressed approval of the qualities of Sir  Leon and of Mr Lubbers, we should drop two such well-qualified  candidates for one who was in my view less well qualified."    Mr Major said he liked Mr Dehaene personally but the Belgian  premier came from "a tradition of big government and of  intervention. That's not my position; it is a tradition that is  not quite in touch with the direction in which Europe is now  moving. We need a Commission president whose instincts are for  enterprise, openness and subsidiarity."    The Prime Minister revealed that, since rumours of Mr  Dehaene's candidacy began to circulate earlier this year, he had  indicated "on more than one occasion" to the Belgian government,  to Mr Dehaene's office and to the Greek presidency that he would  not be able to support his appointment. Under the EC's rules,  the Commission president must be agreed "by common accord."    Unlike Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon, who openly declared  themselves well in advance, Mr Dehaene announced his bid just a  week before the summit, weeks after a Franco-German summit  agreed jointly to back him.    Mr Major said he also objected to the way Mr Dehaene had  emerged as the leading candidate despite the fact that a  majority of member states had not been consulted. But his  attack on Mr Dehaene's fitness for the job brought a stinging  rebuke from German officials, foreshadowing a period of cool  relations with Britain. One said: "You cannot call the prime  minister of a neighbouring EC country badly qualified.  Politically this is very damaging."    Last night neither President Mitterrand nor Chancellor Kohl  was prepared to commit himself to continuing their support for  Mr Dehaene. Diplomats speculated that the search for other  candidates has begun. Peter Sutherland the Irish  director-general of GATT, is now the most prominent name. A  former EC commissioner, he is well qualified. But the Reynolds  government is reluctant to nominate a member of the opposition  Fine Gael.    The decision by the Greek hosts to abandon the attempt to  decide on his successor followed intense discussions and some  sharp words. At times the arrangements degenerated into  near-farce, including an emergency U-turn on narrow, winding  Corfu roads by the Irish motorcade after Mr Reynolds was  summoned back to a late-night meeting which he thought had  broken up.</p>

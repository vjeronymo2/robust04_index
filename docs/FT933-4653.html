			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Management: A little local difficulty - Christopher Lorenz reports on a shake-up at Ciba that has caused tension among national subsidiaries Wolfgang Samo has pioneered a string of controversial changes at Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and drugs multinational. He is best-known in the company for three things: for the toughness with which he has turned round several of its problem businesses; for his early creation of small, transparent business units at a time when Ciba was still heavily centralised and organised in large, opaque lumps; and for transforming the motivation and performance of managers outside Ciba's Basle base by shifting the global headquarters of several businesses away from there well before so-called 'transnational' structures became fashionable in the late 1980s. But never before has Ciba's top management - which now includes Samo himself  -repeatedly had to reassure the rest of the company that an experiment which he is conducting today will not necessarily be applied to the rest of the group tomorrow. The latest attempt to pacify managers' fears is being made this month, following a lakeside conclave of the top team in late August. A tall and youthful 55-year-old bearded German who bears more than a passing resemblance to Europe's best-known corporate revolutionary, Percy Barnevik of ABB, Samo admits that, even in top management, some people think one of his latest actions is 'sheer madness'. But he adds quickly that several other division bosses would like to follow suit. Out in the various countries affected by his action, reactions to Samo's move also differ, ranging from enthusiasm in Spain, Italy and France to a decided lack of conviction in Britain. The British say their reluctance has been misconstrued, and that it resulted from organisational difficulties arising from the relative size and complexity of the UK polymer operations, which are based outside Cambridge. But Samo claims that 'it has nothing to do with the organisation - it is purely a matter of the individuals'. The action in question was taken last January in polymers, one of the most hard-pressed of four divisions which report to Samo. As part of a Europe-wide 're-engineering' project for that division which is even more far-reaching than most such exercises, the divisional heads for 10 west European countries were replaced by a leaner supranational structure. Salespeople in each country are still organised nationally, but they now report to one of three regional sales managers located around Europe, who in turn report to a European sales manager in Basle. The move has not only meant the early retirement of a batch of national division managers, but also a further weakening of the muscle of a second group of more senior executives, Ciba's 'group company heads' - once-powerful country bosses who used to control the activities of its various divisions on their territory. This has naturally provoked resistance. Until 1990 the 'group company heads' were jointly responsible for local divisional operations. Since then, in common with many other companies in chemicals and other industries, this strong geographic influence has been reduced throughout Ciba to a 'dotted line', giving clearer control to divisional bosses. In polymers, that dotted line has been removed entirely. Instead, 'there's a big hole', says Samo. That is what John Fraser, the UK group company head, dislikes. 'I feel no problem at the loss of direct authority over divisional heads,' he insists. 'I've been doing that for eight years of my own volition,' as part of a decentralisation policy he initiated in the UK before the rest of the group followed suit. But he does prize the ability to comment from time to time on UK aspects of divisional affairs, and for his input to be respected. In polymers 'that has now been lost', he says starkly. The second source of the fuss over the polymers move is the national heads of other divisions, who 'fear the same fate as polymers', as Samo puts it. There are also some genuine fears that, although most of the division's customers are multinational companies which themselves operate across national borders, the removal of local management will impair Ciba's responsiveness to different demands in different markets. Samo protests to the contrary: the need to make the barely profitable polymers division more customer-responsive by shortening its lines of communication was one of the sparks behind the re-engineering project, he says; the others were the division's in-built heavy overheads and stocks. To help achieve this, the existing network of 28 warehouses will be cut to six between November and the end of 1994, and order processing will done centrally in Basle. This re-design of polymers' supply network, and the associated information system, was the concept with which the re-engineering project began, before it was enlarged with the help of consultants from CSC Index to encompass the changes in sales management. Together, annual savings of more than SFr30m (Pounds 14.2m) are expected, compared with the project's one-off cost of SFr20m-plus. The fact that the change was so systems-driven, and that consultation, staff training and 'culture change' initiatives were left very late, is one of the points on which the UK's John Fraser criticises the project. John Beadsmoore, who was UK head of polymers until the post was abolished in January, agrees. He retains a sort of sponsorship role which has been negotiated especially with Basle, but his main job is now global head of the group's adhesives business, a responsibility which Samo transferred to him from Basle last year. Samo says he wishes Beadsmoore were 'more struck' by the latter than by the loss of polymers. 'We still have a lot of convincing to do with our British colleagues,' he says. Diplomatically, Beadsmoore and Fraser claim repeatedly that their differences with Basle have been over the 'how' of the re-engineering project, rather than over its basic direction, and that their constructive suggestions have been misconstrued as opposition. But it is self-evident that this is an understatement. From his relatively neutral vantage point north of Basle on the River Rhine, Fraser's German counterpart Walter Fuellemann sees the British reaction as 'quite understandable'. He says: 'It's easy to plan strategic projects in black and white, but when you go into detail you hit a minefield.' Local management has no choice but to speak up, he says. Fuellemann also sympathises with Beadsmoore's rueful observation that, for a company now so committed to decentralisation, the new polymers organisation is remarkably centralised on Basle. Samo replies firmly that Basle just happens to be virtually in the centre of Europe, that it is only the division's salesforce and logistics management which have been centralised - much of the rest was already in Basle - and that in other respects his decentralisation drive continues. In the end, Fuellemann sides with Samo on the need to centralise (or 'regionalise', as he puts it) in polymers. 'The only way to find out whether a European organisation really works, and can be a reasonable approach for other divisions too, is to try it,' he says. If, after a year or two's experience, other divisions are allowed to follow suit, Samo forecasts that that the centralisation would not necessarily be on Basle: 'it could just as well be Brussels, or elsewhere', he says. He is equally clear that 'it would be crazy' for pharmaceuticals, and several other Ciba divisions which need deeper sales management in each country, to copy the new polymers organisation. 'Each division is different, and needs to be organised differently'. If he has his way, Ciba will move even further away from having a standardised structure, and become a model of what business school academics call 'the differentiated organisation' of the future.</p>

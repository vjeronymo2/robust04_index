Such optionally certified engines are subject to all provisions relating to mandatory certification and enforcement described in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.103&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definitions in subpart A of part 89 apply to this subpart. All terms not defined herein or in subpart A have the meaning given them in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.104&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Useful life, recall, and warranty periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The useful life is a period of 8,000 hours of operation or ten years of use, whichever first occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Engines are subject to recall testing for a period of 6,000 hours of operation or seven years of use, whichever first occurs. However, in a recall, engines in the subject class or category must be recalled regardless of actual years or hours of operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Warranties imposed by the Clean Air Act are for 3,000 hours of operation or five years of use, whichever first occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Manufacturers may apply to the Administrator for approval for a shorter useful life period for engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment, or are designed specifically for lower useful life hours to match equipment life. Such an application must be made prior to certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.105&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certificate of conformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Every manufacturer of a new nonroad compression-ignition engine must obtain a certificate of conformity covering the engine family, as described in &sect;89.116&hyph;96. The certificate of conformity must be obtained from the Administrator prior to selling, offering for sale, introducing into commerce, or importing into the United States the new nonroad compression-ignition engine for each model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.106&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibited controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An engine may not be equipped with an emission control system for the purpose of complying with emission standards if such system will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An engine with an emission control system may not emit any noxious or toxic substance which would not be emitted in the operation of such engine in the absence of such system except as specifically permitted by regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.107&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Defeat devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An engine may not be equipped with a defeat device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For purposes of this section, ``defeat device'' means any device, system, or element of design which senses operation outside normal emission test conditions and reduces emission control effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Defeat device includes any auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use unless such conditions are included in the test procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

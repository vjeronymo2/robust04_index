			<p>CSO     [Text] Commissioner of Police Colonel Trevor MacMillan said  yesterday the police have identified 27 drug gangs in Jamaica,  which are controlled mostly by deportees. The police have  declared war on these gangs, on illegal drugs and on drug  trafficking, he said.    "I cannot say much about the police plans, but we have  identified some 27 gangs linked to drugs and who are operating  in the Corporate Area, the Commissioner told THE GLEANER.    Metropolitan Crime Officer, Senior Superintendent Forbes,  said the thrust in apprehending the drug "lords" will be  intelligence-driven. This was in keeping with the recent  statement by Minister of National Security and Justice, K.D.  Knight, that the new type of policing will depend mostly on  intelligence.    Some of the communities identified by the police where the  drug gangs operate out of are: Central Kingston, Tivoli Gardens,  Upper Oxford Street, Hannah Town, Jones Town, Waterhouse and  McIntyre Villa in the Kingston 16 area.    Information reaching THE GLEANER is that some of these  communities are now being probed by the police.    Mr. Forbes said in the past there have been speculations as  to the link between drugs and guns, but the police have now  positively established that there is a link, as in some cases  drug money is used to purchase guns.    The Anti-Narcotic Department of the Force will play a major  role in the drive against these drug gangs. The Division was the  recipient of 18 new motor vehicles and some communication  equipment yesterday.    The vehicles include eight Toyota Corollas, four Isuzu  Troopers, two Isuzu double-cab pick-ups, one Isuzu single cab  pick-up, one Hiace 15 seater bus, one Toyota panel van and one  Isuzu five-ton truck. They were donated to the Ministry of  National Security and Justice by the United Nations  International Drug Control Programme.    Mr. Knight said the police have been working hard and wanted  to double their efforts to combat the drug problem.    Last year, the police recovered 80.79 kilograms of cocaine,  673 pieces of crack, one kilogram of heroin and 123.93 kilograms  of hash oil; and a total of 6,915 persons were arrested by the  police for breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Mar (EFE) -- Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the countries that are partners in the  Common Market of the South (Mercosur) -- have decided to ratify  that they will negotiate as a bloc their possible joining of the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United  States, Canada, and Mexico.    Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said that the  decision "is the most important political fact" in the meeting  of the ministers of economy and foreign affairs of the Mercosur  countries, which ended today in Buenos Aires.    "There are ways to make Mercosur compatible with NAFTA, and  this is what we are studying," Di Tella added.    The deliberations in Buenos Aires seem to have given  definition to the Argentine position, which at one point was  considering the possibility of unilaterally joining NAFTA upon  invitation by the United States.    The Mercosur countries will now study how to reactivate the  negotiations known as "four plus one," begun two years ago, that  aim at approaching the North American commercial bloc.    The Mercosur ministers also agreed to study all the options  for promoting broad regional economic integration, on the basis  of a Brazilian proposal to create the South American Free Trade  Association (ALCSA).    The ministers avoided, however, resuming discussions on the  Mexican decision to refrain from extending the concessions  obtained within NAFTA to the other Latin American countries,  diplomatic sources have said.    The matter, which has been a source of conflict, has been  awaiting resolution since the last Latin American Integration  Association (ALADI) meeting held in Montevideo in February.    The proposal to create ALCSA, which was raised in October  1993, was formally presented to the Mercosur ministers by the  Brazilian ministers of finance and of foreign affairs, Fernando  Henrique Cardoso and Celso Amorim respectively.    Cardoso told EFE that the initiative "does not go against  anybody, and seeks to preserve the Latin American bloc and  strengthen regional commerce," thus denying that it is an  attempt "to put the brakes on a commercial invasion" by NAFTA  members.    Brazil, South America's most developed country, sells 13  percent of its exports to Mercosur and 8 percent to the other  South American countries.    Cardoso said that his country has not considered the  possibility of joining NAFTA "because we cannot take the  initiative; we have not been invited."    "The idea is to promote commercial liberalization, but  always  on the basis of the consolidation of Mercosur as an  institutional structure and as an organization for joint  negotiations for the entire continent," Uruguayan Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu said.    Uruguay maintains that "everything is compatible, provided  the obligations assumed under Mercosur are complied with and  provided there is a common foreign policy toward third  countries."    The Brazilians proposed that the South American Free Trade  Zone come into operation 10 years after 1 January 1995, the day  when Mercosur will become fully operational. Mercosur is  considered the "nucleus" of the integration process.    This means that Mercosur commercial policies should be  coordinated with those of the Andean Pact, which is made up of  Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, and with  Chilean policies.    The Mercosur area has a population of 190 million people,  with a gross domestic product equivalent to slightly more than  50 percent of Latin America's total GDP.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: PIANIST BRYAN PEZZONE: BACK ON TRACK  </P> <P> Now recovered from injuries sustained in a mugging that occurred in early  February, pianist Bryan Pezzone says his hand is now "doing great," and he has  begun playing the piano again.  </P> <P> Pezzone's left hand suffered a deep cut during the incident, endangering his  ring finger. A month later, the pianist underwent hand surgery. "The finger is  numb, but feels great," he said last week. How does the rest of Pezzone feel?  </P> <P> "Really well. Somehow, this whole experience has become positive. I guess  that's a decision I made, early on -- not to let it get me down. I don't know  if I would feel the same way if I hadn't been able to play again, though. . .  ."  </P> <P> The CalArts faculty artist will play in public soon too, first at a private  birthday concert for Nicolas Slonimsky being cooked up by the Los Angeles  Philharmonic and MOCA, on April 27.  </P> <P> Then a week later, at a Green Umbrella series concert with the New CalArts  Twentieth Century Players, at the Japan America Theatre, May 8. Brand-new works  by Morton Subotnick and James Tenney will highlight that concert, as well as  other pieces by Michael Jon Fink, and George Antheil's historic "Ballet  mecanique"."  </P> <P> "I'm working harder, getting up earlier, and using my energy in new ways," the  26-year-old pianist/composer explained, relating how his life is different  since the incident.  </P> <P> In the coming season, he said, he and his wife, flutist Susan Pezzone, will  perform together in public more than they have been able to do, recently.  Already, he is putting in more time on his own compositions. His entire career  seems to be coming into focus, he commented.  </P> <P> "Out of all this, and of spending all those weeks at home, recovering, I think  I've got a greater appreciation for life in general, and for a lot of small  things I used to take for granted." Even the apparent necessity of acquiring  two German shepherds has been a positive, Pezzone feels. "We love these dogs.  But they need us, too, and that's a whole new set of responsibilities for us to  arrange into our lives. It feels good."  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: Robert Duerr, who joined the musical staff of the Metropolitan Opera  at the beginning of this season, will make his conducting debut with the  company during 1989-90, when he leads performances of Gershwin's "Porgy and  Bess." . . . Bruce Broughton, president of the Society of Composers and  Lyrticists, will lead a new, UCLA Extension one-day course, "Knowing the Score:  The Business and Benefits of Music in Film," on the Westwood campus, May 20.  Information: (213) 825-9064. . . . Still unseen in Los Angeles, John Clifford's  Ballet of Los Angeles continues to tour. The troupe is next scheduled to  perform in Florida, April 22 and 23, in a ballet gala to be given in Miami.  Listed on the roster are Allegra Kent, Nancy Davis, Valentina Koslova, Andris  Liepa, Karyn Connell, Antonio Lopez and Courtland Weaver. . . . The Santa  Monica performance space Highways, a new center announced here two months ago,  will open its first season May 1. Announced for the first two months at the  center co-founded by Tim Miller and Linda Frye Burnham are a gala, four-day  benefit; a Cinco de Mayo celebration; an Irish minifestival, and performances  by "troupes of local homeless people and unemployed shipbuilders," according to  Miller/Burnham.

The first  annual May Music Festival at Cal State Northridge, May 1-6, will celebrate the  30th anniversary of the Northridge university (called, at the time of its  founding, "San Fernando Valley State College"). On opening night, actress  Cicely Tyson will narrate Joseph Schwantner's "New Morning for the World," on a  concert by the CSN Symphony conducted by David Aks. The festival closes May 6  with a performance, utilizing ensembles totaling nearly 450 musicians, of  Berlioz's Requiem conducted by John Alexander.  </P></p>

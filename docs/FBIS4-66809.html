			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] Hyderabad, March 20--The Bharatiya Janata Party  [BJP] will begin preparations for the forthcoming elections in  10 States on Monday, when the party's National Executive will  discuss the poll strategy at length.    Briefing newsmen about the deliberations of the first  session  of the Executive meeting here on Sunday [20 March], the party  general secretary and spokesman, Mr Krishan Lal Sharma, said the  party's Central Election Committee will hold a meeting on Monday  morning to chalk out the programme. [passage omitted]    Mr Sharma said the main issue on the first day's agenda was  the economic scenario in the country, including the Dunkel's  proposals and the post-budget situation and its fall-out. He  said the Executive would come out with a resolution in this  regard. To a question, he said the party would hold a massive  rally against the Dunkel proposals in New Delhi on April 6 and  the Executive would discuss the preparations for the rally.  Though the party had held several dharnas and rallies in  different States, this rally would be its first major programme  at the national level. The rally would prevail upon the Centre  not to sign the Dunkel draft as it would be detrimental to the  farming community, he said and added that the party would decide  the future course of action after April 6.    Replying to a volley of questions on the issue, Mr Sharma  said the party would wait for the outcome of the March 29-30  special session of the Lok Sabha before taking an official stand  as to whether it would demand the withdrawal of India from the  General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). He denied the  reports that there was confusion within the party over India  signing the multi-lateral trade treaty. "What was the need for  the government to take such a hasty decision to sign the  agreement. It should have discussed the issue with the  Opposition," he opined.    He said the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] would not approach  other Opposition parties to launch a common struggle against the  Dunkel proposals. "We cannot take the initiative in this regard  as all other opposition parties are against us. If any of them  invites us to share the platform, we will accept it. But  unfortunately, there is no indication at all about a united  action programme against Dunkel among themselves," he said.    To a question, Mr Sharma said Ayodhya remains top on the  party agenda. The issue has brought in polarisation of political  forces in the country between secularists and  pseudo-secularists. It had given the BJP a break in the  political scene, he said. However, the issue was not discussed  at the present Executive meeting, he added.    The BJP National Executive meet began in the morning with  the welcome address by the State unit president, Mr V. Rama Rao,  which was followed by felicitation to the veteran leader, Mr  Atal Behari Vajpayee, for his achievement in thwarting the  attempts of Pakistan in raising Kashmir issue at the United  Nations Commission on Human Rights at Geneva recently. Later,  the party president, Mr L.K. Advani, delivered the inaugural  address. The Executive adopted the resolutions and other issues  on the agenda to be discussed during the three-day meet.    Later, the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mr Kalyan  Singh, presented a report on the deteriorating law and order  situation in his State during the last 100 days of Mulayam Singh  Yadav's rule. He told newsmen that as many as 65,000 crimes were  committed during this period, which included 2,259 murders,  1,050 kidnappings, 2,000 robberies, 565 dacoities and 49 rape  cases.</p>

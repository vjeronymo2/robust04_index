			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DELUCA RALLIES TO BEAT SALAZAR, WIN NABF TITLE  </P> <P> Although he was knocked down once and left barely standing another time, San  Diego's Tony (Bazooka) DeLuca landed enough telling punches to win a 12-round  split decision over Willie Salazar Thursday night at the El Cortez Convention  Center.  </P> <P> With the victory, DeLuca claimed the North American Boxing Federation's  flyweight title (108 pounds).  </P> <P> One judge scored it 116-110 Salazar, while the other two gave it to DeLuca,  117-111 and 115-112.  </P> <P> DeLuca (16-2-1, six knockouts) had heavy swelling under both eyes beginning in  the fifth round but began to find the range with his right hand in the ninth.  </P> <P> Salazar (35-15-1), of Guadalajara, Mexico, finished the fight with blood  flowing from his left eye.  </P> <P> After being knocked down in the eighth, DeLuca seemed to carry the last four  rounds with his left hand, which he had virtually ignored previously.  </P> <P> Salazar appeared to have a slight advantage in the first, which was basically a  feeling out time for both fighters. DeLuca seemed to control the second,  scoring with short, lead rights. Salazar went down early in the round, but the  referee ruled it a slip.  </P> <P> DeLuca landed two straight rights early in the third and appeared the carry a  close round. After he was staggered in the fourth, DeLuca came back in the  fifth, opening a cut over Salazar's left eye with a straight right hand. He  followed with a number of right jabs to the cut.  </P> <P> In the sixth and seventh, DeLuca continued to pound away with right hands and  appeared to carry both rounds.  </P> <P> Salazar dropped DeLuca in the eighth with a right hand that got over the  challenger's lazy left. Although DeLuca came back with a couple of  combinations, Salazar was a big winner in the round.  </P> <P> In preliminary bouts, Jorge Rodriguez (164) of Los Angeles came down in weight,  but it didn't seem to affect his stamina in an easy four-round unanimous  decision over San Diego's Lee Lark (168).  </P> <P> Rodriguez (3-1) captured every round and dropped Lark (1-1) late in the fourth  with a left-right combination.  </P> <P> Even with the lopsided victory, Rodriguez was not completely satisfied.  </P> <P> "I was not that pleased," Rodriguez said. "I have to look to pinpoint my  punches a little more. I had better stamina than I thought though."  </P> <P> Rodriguez was looking to fight again in a couple weeks, but a cut over his eye  will force a postponement.  </P> <P> Amado Zavala (146) of La Mesa solved the awkward style of left-hander Carlos  Gonzalez (146) to take a five-round unanimous decision in the third fight.  Zavala (3-0) floored Gonzalez (7-4, five knockouts) in the first round and  dominated all but the second.  </P> <P> Zavala, 29, was hit below the belt on several occasions. Finally, in the fifth,  a point was taken away from Gonzalez.  </P> <P> "The last one took a lot of power out of me," Zavala said. "I was in control,  but left-handers always seem to bother me."  </P> <P> Rogelio Perez (123) of San Diego won a unanimous decision over San Diego's  Sergio Alonzo (124 1/2), who was making his professional debut. Perez (3-1) put  Alonzo down with a left hook in the second round and won all four rounds  handily.  </P> <P> In the opener, the debut of San Diego 172-pounder Ray Harring lasted all of  2:37 as he was knocked out by Roberto Servin (175).  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DEMOCRATS FIND NO LIFE IN THE PARTY  </P> <P> Things are always tough for Democrats in Republican-rich Orange County. But  these days, they've gotten tougher.  </P> <P> Last week, party leaders announced at a meeting in a Santa Ana union hall that  they were flat broke. Actually, they were about $4,000 in the red.  </P> <P> In fact, the party's executive director had to quit recently because the party  didn't have enough money to pay his salary.  </P> <P> A new $100-per-month club called the Truman Forum brought in just one donation  last month -- $100. And that came from party chairman Michael Balmages, who  started the program last spring.  </P> <P> "The party is in the same precarious situation it has been in for years and  years and years," Balmages said. "It's a concern and it's something that's  typical. Does it make it right because it's typical? No."  </P> <P> Money is not the only problem. There has been in-fighting among the leadership.  Balmages said he has been busy with his law practice and unable to dedicate the  time he should to the party. And now, with no money in the bank, the party  still has no plans for fund-raisers or strategies to strengthen itself.  </P> <P> Privately, some party officials say they are concerned about the deterioration.  But many said the situation is typical -- a fact of life for Democrats in  Orange County.  </P> <P> "It's not unusual to be very lean at this time of year and just barely making  it," said John Hanna, former county Democratic chairman. "If it's April of 1990  and there's no staff, then I think it's something to be concerned about. . . .  That's a party in trouble."  </P> <P> The Democrats' problems appear even more severe when compared to the power of  the Republican Party in Orange County. The GOP's influence can hardly be  overstated.  </P> <P> For one thing, there are about 560,000 registered Republicans compared to about  365,000 Democrats.  </P> <P> Then there is the fact that Republican candidates hold all of the area's 23  county, state and federal elected offices except one, an Assembly district that  straddles the Los Angeles County line. Of the 146 city council seats in Orange  County, Democrats hold only 37.  </P> <P> And financially, even in their best year ever, Democrats were soundly beaten by  the Republicans. During the 1988 presidential race, Democrats raised about  $212,000 while the county Republican Party raised $462,000.  </P> <P> Greg Haskin, executive director of the local Republican Party, said Orange  County's GOP has the "largest county operation in the country." It has a  full-time staff of three with up to 15 part-time employees, including an  accountant and a crew of operators for a phone bank.  </P> <P> Despite the dismal facts, Democratic leaders see the framework of a strong  opposition in Orange County.  </P> <P> Almost 400,000 Democrats live here, more than in 16 states. The number is the  fourth highest among all of California's counties. And, party leaders reason,  the pool of Democrats in this affluent county probably represents untapped  resources.  </P> <P> The task, however, is to organize that power.  </P> <P> Balmages said he wants to cultivate modest donations from the county's  Democrats, forming a donor base that could then be sustained.  </P> <P> "It's the only way we are going to permanently get out of this hand-to-mouth  situation and develop an ongoing source of funds," he said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take a lot of math to figure that if we got a penny each month from  the 400,000 Democrats, that would be enough to fund the basic operation right  there," Balmages said. "If you got a dollar a year from 400,000 Democrats,  you've got a lot of money."  </P> <P> But so far, Balmages said, there hasn't been any work done to get such a  fund-raising program under way. And there has not been any discussion about how  to pay for the start-up cost of a donor program or for the hiring of a new  executive director.  </P> <P> The money raised by the party is important because it pays for the foundation  of the power of local as well as state and federal officials. The political  parties sponsor voter registration drives, coordinate appearances for outside  politicians, seek out and encourage candidates to run for office, donate to  campaigns and rally their forces during elections.  </P> <P> Balmages said he was hoping to get some money from the state Democratic Party  because it passed a resolution in February pledging support for Orange County's  attack on freshman Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> Last year, Pringle won the only legislative seat in Orange County that has a  Democratic majority in a close race that was marred by the Republican Party's  hiring of security guards at 20 Santa Ana polling places.  </P> <P> But Cathy Calfo, executive director of the state party, said last week that the  "resolution is not a binding order allocating money" to Orange County. And, she  said, the party has since adopted an annual budget that does not include  financial help for county Democrats.  </P> <P> "That's bad news," Balmages said.  </P> <P> Also troubling the party's financial effort, say party insiders, is a rift  between Balmages and Audrey Redfearn, chairwoman of the Democratic Foundation.  </P> <P> The foundation is a club with about 100 Democrats who pay $1,000 each year to  be members. The group is host to appearances by leading state and national  Democrats and contributes to Democratic candidates inside and outside Orange  County.  </P> <P> Balmages said he was concerned that the foundation is draining money from the  party organization and he disagrees with Redfearn about how much the foundation  should pay to support the county party.  </P> <P> "I never felt any rift," said Redfearn. "The rift was created by Mike Balmages  insisting he get whatever money he wanted. He was quite demanding."  </P> <P> Balmages said he would like to see the relationship between the foundation and  the party changed, but he hasn't talked to Redfearn about it. He suggested that  the foundation has been attractive to members because it hosts famous  Democrats. "We can do that too," he said.  </P> <P> Several Democratic leaders said they were not surprised that the party is short  of money during the holidays in an off-election year. It has happened several  times before.  </P> <P> None criticized Balmages' leadership either, but they encouraged him to begin a  fund-raising program to replenish the party coffers.  </P> <P> Paul Garza, the former executive director who left recently, said: "We need to  do some ongoing fund-raising; we need to get much more serious about it. My  leaving is just one of those slumps you hit now and then. I do feel very  positive about the party's prospects."  </P> <P> James Toledano, chairman of the Orange County Democratic Associates, said:  "Right now we are in the coalescing stage. We have a lot of unstructured  capabilities; we are just looking for the chemistry."  </P> <P> Redfearn said: "We just need something for people to become excited about. I  don't see anything alarming about the situation."  </P> <P> Jerry Yudelson, a Democrat who has already announced his challenge to Pringle,  said, "You've got to remember the dictum of Will Rogers: 'I belong to no  organized political party; I'm a Democrat.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Contributions  </P> <P> Total contributions raised by the county Democratic and Republican parties. In  1988, 387, 515 people registered as Democrats in the county; 596,151 registered  as Republicans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In thousands of dollars  </P> <P> 1985  </P> <P> Democrats: $26  </P> <P> Republicans: $274  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1986  </P> <P> Democrats: $42  </P> <P> Republicans: $258  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Democrats: $43  </P> <P> Republicans: $189  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> Democrats: $212  </P> <P> Republicans: $462  </P> <P> Source: County registrar of voters  </P></p>

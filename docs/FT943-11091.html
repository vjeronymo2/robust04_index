			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / China flies in the face of satellite parking convention China has become the first country to flout the conventions of space by parking a satellite in a position that could interfere with other satellites and hinder the Asian ambitions of international broadcasting companies. There are no laws governing the launch and positioning of satellites above the earth. But it has become a convention that agreement with the owners of adjacent satellites is reached through the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a Geneva-based United Nations agency that registers satellites. Industry executives said the Chinese launch of a commercial satellite 12 days ago was the first time that a country has launched a satellite without the agreement of other operators of satellites near the intended position of the new satellite. They believe that if the satellite is used as planned in coming weeks it will interfere with signals from a planned Japanese telecommunications satellite and a satellite operated by Rimsat, a US company, to beam television to India. They also say that some of the Chinese satellite's 24 transponders, or transmitters, may be inoperable because of interference caused by its proximity to the other satellites. In this case, the business strategies of some of the US's top broadcasters could be badly affected. Turner Broadcasting, Home Box Office, and Viacom, which owns MTV, have all signed up to use the satellite to further their ambitions in Asian broadcasting. In addition, the China Telecommunications Broadcasting Satellite Corporation has signed a lease agreement for eight of the satellite's transponders for both television and telecommunications. The Japanese government is believed to be angry about the Chinese government's behaviour. It had talks in Beijing last week which ended in failure. The state-of-the-art Chinese satellite, is owned by APT Satellite, a Hong Kong-registered company controlled by three Chinese government ministries together with investors from Singapore, Thailand and Macao. The company's seventh shareholder is a company owned by the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party. The satellite, known as Apstar 1, was launched from Xichang, Sichuan, on July 21. It is estimated to have cost APT about Dollars 130m to buy, launch and insure. Its twin, Apstar 2, is due for launch early next year. Of crucial importance to existing operators is the positioning of a new satellite. In general, the industry requires 2-2.5 degrees of separation - 1,488km - between satellites so that respective 'footprints' do not cause interference. The Chinese government last year registered Apstar 1's position, above the equator in geostationary orbit, at 131 degrees east with the ITU. However, at 132 degrees east is a planned Japanese communications satellite and at 130 degrees east is Rimsat1, which broadcasts for the Sun TV group of India. Mr Yang Xueming, director of marketing at APT, denies that Apstar 1 will cause other operators any difficulties. However, satellite industry executives in Hong Kong said they were concerned that Apstar 1 was launched without completing the industry's three-stage co-ordination process.</p>

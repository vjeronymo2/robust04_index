			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUIT AGAINST SON IN HANDS OF REGULATOR BUSH DISLIKES  </P> <P> If President Bush's son Neil is sued by the federal government over his  involvement in the collapse of a Denver savings and loan, his fate could be in  the hands of a government regulator who has often clashed with the President.  </P> <P> Government officials confirmed today that a $200-million federal lawsuit may be  brought against Bush and eight other former members of the board of Silverado  Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn., which collapsed in 1988 at a cost to  taxpayers of about $1 billion.  </P> <P> The suit would accuse the nine board members of negligence in the failure of  the Colorado thrift and could be one of the biggest ever brought by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp.  </P> <P> "The matter is still under consideration, but it's not uncommon to bring these  kinds of suits after an institution fails," said FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney.  </P> <P> The decision on whether to file the suit -- which could be a huge political  embarrassment for the President -- lies with FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman.  President Bush has made it clear that he does not care for Seidman and has  strongly hinted that he would like him to leave, although he has no power to  remove him before his term expires in October.  </P> <P> "Seidman has not decided when he will make that decision," Whitney said of  possible legal action, adding that any suit would likely be filed in Denver  federal court and could be a lengthy operation.  </P> <P> When asked if regulators were unfairly focusing on 34-year-old Neil Bush  because of his high-profile father, Whitney said, "I can assure you that's not  true."  </P> <P> The collapse of Silverado is just one of hundreds in the S &amp; L industry,  whose bailout is expected to cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 30  years.  </P> <P> Whitney would not confirm press reports that the civil suit would seek $200  million in damages but said if that is the price tag, it would be one of the  FDIC's largest.  </P> <P> Clashes between Seidman -- who is well-regarded in Congress and the banking  industry -- and the Administration have prompted unusual efforts by the  President to oust the regulator from his increasingly important post, banking  sources say.  </P> <P> But Whitney denied there is tension between the two: "That is flatly untrue.  They have a very good relationship."  </P></p>

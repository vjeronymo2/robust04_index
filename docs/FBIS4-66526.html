			<p>CSO     [Text] Barely a few hours had passed following the  "compulsory embrace" between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim  al-Bid in Amman on 20 February 1994 when battles erupted between  the North Yemen Army and South Yemen Army, thus giving rise to  questions on how serious the two sides are about implementing  the "covenant and accord document," which had been signed by  Yemeni figures under the sponsorship of King Husayn, and on  whether there really is a reasonable mechanism for  implementation.    A very resentful Jordanian official has said to AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI, "Why, then, did they come to us? Why all those  arrangements, debates, and mutual visits? Moreover, why did that  throng of 300 Yemenis representing all of Yemen's tribes,  parties, institutions, and intellectuals come to us? Why did the  security and military situation erupt even before the ink used  by 37 officials to sign the covenant and accord document could  dry up?" Another official was more realistic and less emotional.  He said, "It isn't like this. The document isn't a cease-fire  declaration. It isn't even a declaration of unity. The document  is a timetable to disengage in the political and economic clash.  Don't forget that this is the first time in Yemen's modern  history in which all Yemenis with all their factions have agreed  to such a broad dialogue. An opportunity must be given to people  to overcome the obstacles and implement the accord."  <H5>  Struggle Is Dominant </H5>   Regardless of what the two officials have said in their  contradictory assessments, struggle for power and for the  distribution of positions and wealth continues to dominate  Yemen's map. Those who scrutinized the face of President 'Ali  Salih and of Vice President 'Ali Salih al-Bid when they were  sitting to the right and left of King Husayn during the  accord-signing ceremony at Raghadan Palace, Amman, were able to  pick up signs of tension and of dissatisfaction. Even though the  spontaneous address which 'Ali Salih delivered, (and in which he  thanked Yasir 'Arafat and the United States!), did not betray  his fear that the document would face difficulty in  implementation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid was so frank and so reserved  that spectators expected him to upturn the table and end the  party suddenly! Al-Bid declared that he had reservations because  accords had been previously signed but not implemented. He then  proceeded to talk about the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] martyrs  who have fallen in the mutual assassinations between North and  South. Al-Bid went on to list the names of those assassinated,  and the audience imagined he was about to abandon the microphone  and depart from the hall. But al-Bid found the right way out  when he went on to add, "But Yemen is dearer than all of these  people."    From that moment, there has been strengthened belief that it  will be extremely difficult to implement the document and that  the path is not strewn with roses but planted with mines. A few  hours later, 'Ali al-Bid's fears came true when the first battle  erupted in a border area between units of the Southern Unity  [al-Wahdah] Brigade and the Northern Giants [al-'Amaliqah]  Brigade. Sanaa said that the YSP fabricated the confrontation to  reinforce its presence in al-Mukalla Province, whereas Aden said  that Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the First  Armored Division and President 'Ali Salih's half-brother, was  behind igniting the confrontation because of his opposition to  the covenant. On the following day, a broader and more serious  confrontation erupted. Thus, the chain of battles and of people  killed and wounded started.  <H5>  Far From Modern State </H5>   A member of the Yemeni delegation in Amman said to AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI, "We are tribal and we are still very far from the  modern state. Even I who sit with you here am tribal despite the  fact that I have studied in Europe. I talk about dialogue and  democracy and I defend the counter opinion. But when the moment  of truth comes, the tribal spark ignites within me and I forget  all I have studied." When we asked him if he expects the Amman  accord to fail, he said, "There are dozens of agreements which  haven't been implemented. We agreed previously. But the  difficulty has always been in implementation. Despite this, the  Amman accord is the most important to date. It has a timetable  and it has dealt with numerous details that weren't tackled by  past accords. We hope that whenever things get dark--and they  are dark in our country most of the time--we will seek guidance  from this accord!"  <H5>  This Is How Battles Erupted </H5>   Why did battles erupt and how do Northerners and Southerners  view the covenant? A Yemeni delegation member who requested that  his identity not be revealed has said, "Decades of division,  colonialism, tribal rivalries, backwardness, and poverty make it  impossible to move to a modern democratic state as fast as  intellectuals wish. It is a matter of legacy and of entrenched  concepts. What more than this massive arrival of Yemenis in  Amman would one ask for? But then the response to those who seek  unity has been a war declaration." He went on to add, "One must  acknowledge that our centers of power are infiltrated. There are  secret hands that strike from time to time and there are divided  loyalties. Moreover, the mentality of the Northerners who put  tribe above any party or social consideration is different from  the mentality of the Southerners who have had contact with the  British and the Soviets, who have been educated, and many of  whom have become politicized Marxists."    We asked him: "As a Southerner, what is your viewpoint?"    He responded, "Frankly, President 'Ali Salih controls most  of  the political and military positions through the tribe. His  immediate family rules Yemen. This condition doesn't please me  and doesn't please our people in the South. We are more educated  and more capable of management. Yet, our share of power isn't  compatible with our capabilities. It is true that the  Northerners exceed us in numbers. But even by this criterion, we  are done an injustice."    But what about the oil factor? He responded, "You are aware  that there are vast oil stores in the Southern territories. The  discovery of this wealth has stirred a sense of injustice among  our kinsmen, and they constantly wonder if unity with the North  is in their interest or not. They say that the North, which  dominates the decisionmaking, is capable of exploiting and  devouring the South's oil, and they demand a fair distribution  of wealth."    So, you aren't against unity? "No, not at all. We are only  opposed to concentrating influence in the hands of certain  people to the exclusion of others. We are against the North's  devouring of the South. We want an equal unity, not a unity of  annexation. However, people have to be educated and persuaded of  the benefit of unity. We are a single people. Our tribes are the  same and our roots are the same. But we are like two brothers,  each of whom has grown up in a different environment. When the  two meet, this environment makes each brother seem to be the  antithesis of the other."    But the document gives you more than what you have had,  doesn't it? In response, he said, "Even though the document  seeks to increase the South's share of power, which is our  right, it doesn't meet all our demands. Despite this, we have  accepted it. However, the percentage of Northerners who reject  it is higher than the percentage of Southerners who reject it.  The reason is that the document takes away some power and some  influence from the Northerners. The centers of power in Sanaa  seek to dominate Aden completely. This is what made al-Bid stay  in retreat in the South for six months."    Do you expect the battles to continue? Another Yemeni  delegation member said, "The situation is very tense and people  in both parts are very afraid. There are true efforts to defuse  the situation. But it is very difficult to tell whether these  efforts will succeed. The issue depends on how sincerely the two  sides have accepted the covenant and accord and how able they  are to implement it."</p>

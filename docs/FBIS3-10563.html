			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 8  March.    EL TIEMPO has conducted a poll in Santa Fe de Bogota and  Cali, determining "the cost of Colombians' basic basket  increased approximately 3 percent during the first 20 days of  February. This leads us to believe the increase will reach 3.5  percent by the end of the month and that the accumulated  increase for the first two months of the year could reach 6.7  percent. This is a high and alarming rate, because the  government expects to lull the cost of living increase at 19  percent by the end of the year." The newspaper survey has also  determined "meat, rice, coffee, lentils, and several fruits are  mostly responsible for February's inflation." (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 Feb 94 pp 1a, 1b)    The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane)  has reported the country's inflation rate amounted to 3.63  percent in February, "the highest February rate in the last 10  years." It has also reported "increased school tuitions and  supplies and strong increases in the prices of certain produce  prompted this month's increase in the cost of living."

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Clarke denies plan for more VAT Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday that he did not intend to use the lower 8 per cent value added tax rate - which now applies to domestic fuel and power - to broaden the VAT base in the tax system. 'I have no intention of building on the lower rate,' he told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee. He said he did not choose to have the lower 8 per cent VAT rate - which was forced on the government by last week's Commons defeat of its plans to lift VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent - and he did not plan to rush back into broadening the VAT base. He had not, for example, considered levying VAT on newspapers or magazines when preparing the Budget. The chancellor also said: He hoped that after the supply-side reforms of recent years, the economy could sustain growth at a faster annual rate than 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent without risking inflation. He had acted promptly last week to plug the hole in his Budget caused by the VAT revolt because it was dangerous for a nation to borrow heavily in financial markets. Political considerations had reinforced his decision last week to raise base rates to 6.25 per cent from 5.75 per cent. However, the rate rise had been justified on economic grounds. Mr Clarke stressed that he was pleased with the present monetary regime in which there was more openness over policy and the governor of the Bank of England played a more prominent role than previously. But in a cryptic remark, he hinted that the rate rise might be reversible if conditions warranted it. It was 'possibly one of the few reversible decisions I have taken', he said. Mr Clarke was upbeat about the economy. Britain as an industrial nation was 'now quite spectacularly good' compared with 15 years ago. He cited Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing president of the European Commission, as having said that the UK would be one of only three EU countries to meet the economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. The UK would meet them easily, while Germany would need 'good luck and a following wind'. This meant that Britain was on course for the 'ideal situation' of being able to decide if it wanted to enter the third and final stage of economic and monetary union with a single currency and European central bank. His main aim was to keep Emu as a 'genuinely open option' for the UK. He was less forthcoming about future tax policy and refused to name the conditions under which he would or would not cut taxes in a future Budget. He admitted that taxes could not be cut when the public finances were unhealthy but said that chancellors had to look at 'the overall situation' when making decisions on fiscal policy.</p>

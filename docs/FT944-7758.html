			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Lowndes Lambert lifted to Pounds 6m by rise in new business Despite increased competition in its sector, Lowndes Lambert, the London-based insurance broker, increased first half pre-tax profits by more than 15 per cent to Pounds 6m. The group attributed the rise to growth in new business. Profits were also boosted by a first contribution from Whiteley Henshaw Hindle, a UK insurance broker, acquired for an initial Pounds 4.65m in June. Excluding acquisitions, pre-tax profits for the six months to end September increased from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 5.8m. Total turnover rose from Pounds 37.2m to Pounds 43m. Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, said conditions in the group's main markets remained difficult, but he expected 'further steady progress' in the second half. The group announced a reorganisation to remove overlaps between businesses and to focus UK activity into three divisions: UK non-marine, marine and international. Mr Shaw said Lowndes would be well placed to take advantage of any shake-out in the insurance broking sector resulting from increased competitive pressures and the trend by many large companies towards buying fee-based, rather than commission based, services. Lowndes' growth was largely based on 'middle-tier' companies which continued to benefit from the broking services the group offered, he said. The group announced a 10 per cent increase in its interim dividend to 2.75p (2.5p). Earnings per share rose to 6.9p against 6.1p last time. The shares closed 9p higher at 168p, with analysts impressed at the group's performance in tough conditions.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 9 March  publishes a report on page A4 by Eytan Rabin which says:  "Several incidents took place in the territories yesterday.  Palestinian sources reported that seven Palestinians were  injured in the Gaza Strip" while "the Palestinian sources also  reported that one person was wounded during stone-throwing  incidents in Ramallah." The report adds that a resident of the  al-Burayj refugee camp "was injured yesterday by police gunfire  when he tried to avoid a police roadblock" in the Gaza Strip.    Another report by Shlomo Dror and Gabi Zohar on page A5 of  the same HA'ARETZ issue adds that "Palestinian sources reported  that 20 people were injured" in riots in Jerusalem yesterday,  "but East Jerusalem hospitals reported that only several people  came in for treatment and were discharged later." According to  the report, "police sources maintain that external elements have  been causing agitation in Jerusalem. Last week, messages were  sent to local leaders of Fatah, rejectionist front  organizations, and religious organizations saying that 'the eyes  of the world are currently on Jerusalem, which is why riots  there are to be encouraged.'"    The report goes on to say that "several hundred Golan Druze  yesterday staged demonstrations marking the Syrian revolution  day and the Ba'th Party coming to power. The demonstrations  ended quietly, and no arrests were made" as the police "avoided  entering the villages and clashing with the demonstrators."</p>

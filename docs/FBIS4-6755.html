			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bosnia: Lend Muslims a Hand"] </F>   [Text] The West has not only made a mess of the situation  in Bosnia, but also a mockery of its pledge to protect the  Muslim enclaves besieged by the Bosnian Serb forces. Why did  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, of which the United  States is a leading member, agree to use air power against the  Serb advance on Gorazde when it had no intention to do more than  engage sparingly in pinprick strikes? The military buildup by  the Serb forces last month showed that a major offensive was in  the offing. True, air strikes can not be expected to prevent  the Serbs from seizing Gorazde or any of the other Muslim  enclaves. But this misses the point, which is that no serious  attempt was made to deter the Serbs or punish them if deterrence  failed.    When the Serb forces moved into Gorazde on Saturday, all  that  was done was to order two fighters to attack tanks aiming their  guns at that town. It should have been clear when the first air  strikes were carried out 10 days ago that such limited attacks  would not stop the Serbs. That action should have been spelled  out to the Serbs as a warning of fiercer strikes to come if they  did not halt their aggression. It is possible that fear of  retaliation would have deterred them if a credible threat had  been made. In any case, the Serb forces should not have escaped  punishment. They lost only a couple of tanks and a few armoured  personnel carriers when the objective should have been to target  their ammunition and fuel storage sites as well as other  facilities that would erode their fighting capacity. NATO also  failed to retaliate when one of its aircraft was shot down by a  Serb missile. It caved in by calling off any further air  strikes.    The fall of Gorazde will embolden the Serbs to proceed  according to their plan of consolidating their territorial  conquests with the declared aim of carving out a Greater Serbia.  Having secured a major road link and a swathe of territory  connecting their possessions in eastern and southern Bosnia,  their next likely target is the large Muslim enclave of Tuzla,  which is one of the six safe havens designated by the United  Nations. Like Gorazde, it is inhabited mainly by refugees.  Already under siege, its capture would enable the Serbs to  tighten their grip over the northeastern region. They can also  be expected now to reactivate their pressure on Sarajevo.    With the Serb forces moving closer to achieving their goal  of  Greater Serbia, there can hardly be any prospect of a peace  settlement since that would require them to make territorial  concessions. Economic sanctions imposed on Serbia have hurt  that country, but with its ambition of becoming the centre of an  expanded Serbia, it will be able to cope with the hardships, as  seen over the past two years. Reportedly, under the recent  accord for a loose union between the Muslims and Croats, the  Serbs would have to concede at least 21 percent of the land they  control. That much is regarded by the Muslims and Croats to be  the bare minimum. Otherwise, they would not have enough  territory to accommodate each other's ethnic interests in a new  union.    The Western fiasco over Gorazde must have made it clear to  the Muslims and Croats that they would have to make a concerted  military effort to wrest those areas from the Serbs. Moves  towards a merger of their forces are underway. The West can  help that process by acting to lift the arms embargo that has  greatly disadvantaged them. The embargo was imposed on the  former Yugoslavia in 1991 before the conflict in Bosnia erupted.  Once the Muslims acquire heavy equipment, the Serb forces will  begin to lose the military superiority they enjoy. Unless the  ground situation begins to change, the Serbs will not engage in  any serious peace process nor will NATO air strikes make much  difference if they are resumed at all. The right of  self-defence, at any rate, is one of the fundamental principles  enshrined in the UN Charter. The West cannot continue to deny  it to the Bosnian Muslims.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- "It was back in 1974  that I felt that China would be a huge energy market. Now, my  prediction of 20 years ago is proving correct."    Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of the France-China  Committee and president of the GEC-Alsthom company, made this  point to XINHUA during a recent visit to Beijing.    An old friend of China who had visited this country many  times, Desgeorges contributed greatly to promoting Sino-French  cooperation.    He was proud to recall that GEC-Alsthom had established  business links with China in the 1950s, and in 1958 signed the  first contract with China for locomotives. The company sold  China 300 locomotives, which are still running well today.    Alsthom had also been involved in the construction of  China's  thermal and hydro-power electricity plants.    "China has been an extremely important market for Alsthom,"  Desgeorges said. "We earnestly hope to continue to cooperate  with China in the fields of energy and traffic now that  French-Sino relations have returned to a normal track."    Though the Alsthom-China contracts always cover huge  programs, Desgeorges was not satisfied.    As China needs to strengthen its infrastructure, such as the  energy industry, transport and telecommunications, in which  fields France is in the forefront, he insisted that the  contracts of large programs were not enough to give impetus to  the comprehensive development of French-Sino trade and economic  relations.    More numerous cooperation, that is contracts between Chinese  and French medium-size and small enterprises and collaboration  in medium-size and small programs, should be implemented, he  said.    The development of medium-size and small enterprises, which  offer large employment opportunities, was of great significance  to China, he noted, because it has a lot of medium-size and  small business concerns.    Desgeorges said the France-China Committee would investigate  the situation of French medium-size and small enterprises and  provide a list of those interested in China's market in various  trades.    Desgeorges was in April elected president of the committee  of  France-China, which was set up in 1979, to develop French-Sino  cooperation of industry and trade. It has 200 members,  including some big enterprises and groups.    The committee will select the best ones to make contact  direct with their Chinese counterparts.    Desgeorges added that they could cooperate in forms of  technological cooperation, trade exchanges, joint management and  even opening markets in a third country.    He suggested that China may establish a China-France  committee as well so as to find Chinese medium-size and small  enterprises willing to deal with the French ones.</p>

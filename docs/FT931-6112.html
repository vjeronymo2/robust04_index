			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Gummer admits error on eggs MORE THAN 100 farmers are to share about Pounds 600,000 in extra compensation for the compulsory slaughter of their poultry flocks in 1988. The slaughter was demanded after fears that eggs were contaminated with salmonella. The compensation comes after a report from the parliamentary ombudsman criticised the Ministry of Agriculture over its failure to 'devise and implement a scheme which complied with the legislation' to pay compensation. Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, said the decision to discount the value of slaughtered flocks by 40 per cent to reflect the taint of salmonella infection was 'incorrect'.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP!: READER MAY HAVE TO PLAY SECOND STRING  </P> <P> Mrs. H. S. Weir of Laguna Hills would like to find a bead-restringing kit for  her Venetian-glass and other costume-variety jewelry. Can you help with a few  pearls of wisdom, or will she feel she's being strung along because nobody  wants to draw a bead on a source?  </P> <P> Because of a medical problem, Alice Zrodlo of Valencia needs old-formula  Questran, as made by Mead Johnson. The changed medication, now manufactured  elsewhere, does not seem to do the job as well. Can you spell relief the old  way for Zrodlo, or perhaps even come up with the name of a laboratory that will  make the formulation, or will Zrodlo just have to grin and bear it?  </P> <P> Ann Shelton of Arleta cannot get her hands on Plasti-Tak, a reusable adhesive  that's used like putty and was manufactured by Brooks Manufacturing Co. of  Ohio; you roll it into a ball and press it between surfaces that you want to  join together. (If it's no longer on the market, she'll settle for something  similar.) Can you help without pressing the issue too hard, or will Shelton not  have a ball until she puts the squeeze on another manufacturer?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Mrs. Witman at (714) 984-7220 needs a Marsh Farms  Mini Incubator Model TX6 for hatching desert tortoise eggs; the company seems  to have moved. Please help before these tortoises take their place in the  pecking order, or else Witman will know she's laid an egg. . . . Speaking of  deserts, Claire at (619) 347-8656 wants a copy of "Desert, the American  Southwest," by Ruth Kirk, which has long been out of print. Please see to it  that Claire gets her just desert. . . . Frances at (818) 344-3685 needs several  Melmac dinner plates; because these are her everyday dishes, almost any pattern  will do. Because Frances is hungry for information, let this request be food  for thought. . . . Priscilla at (213) 863-3508 needs five books of Green Stamps  and is willing to exchange Blue Chip stamps for them. Please do something  colorful for Priscilla as soon as you've read this.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> For our many readers looking for all-cotton clothing, we have an additional  source: Deva, Box S-89, Burkittsville, Md. 21718, is an 11-year-old cottage  industry, with all-cotton products crafted locally by home-based stitchers who  sew their names into the garments they make. Everything is unconditionally  guaranteed. Send for a catalogue. The toll-free number is (800) 222-8024.  </P> <P> Virginia Lessing of Palos Verdes Estates got a letter from Maybelline, stating  that they expect to have their Cake Mascara in the stores this fall. For more,  contact Dianne Brunner, Maybelline Cosmetics, 3030 Jackson Ave., Box 372,  Memphis, Tenn. 38151.  </P> <P> Anitra Earle of the Perfumerie, who specializes in difficult-to-find and  discontinued fragrances, has moved. Her new address is 1026 K Street Mall,  Sacramento, Calif. 95814, telephone (916) 442-8338.  </P> <P> Hain cannot answer mail personally but will, space permitting, respond in this  column to readers who need -- or have -- helpful information. Write (do not  telephone) to You Can Help!, You section, the Times, Times Mirror Square, Los  Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

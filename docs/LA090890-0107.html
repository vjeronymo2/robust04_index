Vermont Ave., Hollywood  </P> <P>  Dang Nhat Minh's "When the Tenth Month Comes" (1984) is a film of pastoral  beauty, great sensitivity and subtlety. In a rural village, a young wife  conceals the news of her husband's death in battle from her elderly, ailing  father-in-law with the help of letters written in the dead man's name by the  local schoolteacher who, in fact, falls in love with her. Their ensuing, chaste  friendship, subject to gossip and criticism, gives way to the larger issue of  how to honor the war dead: Shall the wife mourn her loss, even after her  father-in-law's death, or has she the right to start a new life for herself?

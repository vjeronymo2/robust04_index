			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan may have to take steps  outside the United Nations to deal with the threat of North  Korea's alleged push for nuclear arms if the world body fails to  agree on a unified action plan, a coalition official said  Tuesday [7 June].    "We will first try as far as possible to discuss the issue  of  possible sanctions (against North Korea) within the U.N.  framework," said Hajime Funada, a ranking official in Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key  component in the ruling coalition.    "But... there is a possibility of our taking measures  outside  the U.N. framework in the event of an emergency," he told a  press luncheon. "I don't think we can give up that option."    But Funada, a protege of Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's  backroom political deal maker, said Tokyo will do all it can to  encourage Pyongyang to allay suspicions over its nuclear program  within the bounds of its Constitution, which bans the use of  force in resolving international disputes.    On domestic politics, Funada showed interest in Social  Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo's proposal  for voluntary resignation of the Hata cabinet after passage of  the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget through the Diet.    Kubo, the No. 2 man in the second largest opposition party,  made the proposal as a prerequisite for opening talks on the  SDP's return to the coalition.    "This is a rescue boat for us," Funada said. "Whether or not  a voluntary resignation is possible in real politics, we must  seriously weigh the possibility of taking some action close to  it," he noted, referring to a potential, full-scale cabinet  shakeup to bring the SDP back to the fold.    The SDP walked out of the governing alliance in late April  in  protest against the sudden formation by other coalition partners  of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, a move that  forced Hata to form the first minority government since 1955.</p>

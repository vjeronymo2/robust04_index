			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Hopes dwindle for new agreement on capital requirements - IOSCO Conference THE prospect of financial regulators agreeing on common capital standards for banks and securities firms has become dim and distant, write Robert Peston and Tracy Corrigan. Not only is there little chance of peace breaking out between securities regulators, who are negotiating under the umbrella of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), but they are also at loggerheads with their bank counterparts, grouped on the Basle Committee for banking supervision. The Basle Committee recently submitted a proposal to IOSCO's technical committee, which would exempt banks from the requirement to carry capital as a protection against possible losses on the bulk of bond holdings. Mr Richard Breeden, chairman both of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the IOSCO technical committee, said IOSCO members were united in opposing the Basle committee's stance. However, such unity between IOSCO members has not been the norm this week. In a dispute over the capital standard to be applied to equity holdings, the SEC has been leading one camp and the UK's Securities and Investments Board the other. The row hinges on the extent to which a securities firm or bank should be able to reduce the capital it carries as cover against the risk of losses on equities by hedging. In its simplest form, hedging consists of matching a holding of equities against contracts to sell equities, or short positions. The theory is that, if share prices fall, the value of the short positions will rise, offsetting the loss. Mr Breeden said that the SIB-backed proposal would allow a securities firm to carry capital equivalent to only 2 per cent of the sum of its long and short positions, if that firm had a perfectly hedged book as defined by the proposal. That compares with the SEC's current minimum of approximately 15 per cent and its counter-proposal to Iosco of an 8.75 per cent minimum. 'How does it serve our duty of protecting the public by cutting capital requirements?' Mr Breeden asked. He is intent on preventing IOSCO repeating the mistakes he believes were made by the Basle Committee, when its members agreed a capital adequacy standard for bank loans, which has been implemented over the past two years. Mr Breeden said the economic consequences of this standard have been disastrous. US banks have been providing too few loans to companies and investing their funds predominantly in government bonds, he said, because the standard imposes a high capital cost on loans and a zero cost on purchases of government bonds. He wants IOSCO to have more modest ambitions than the Basle Committee, which some securities regulators regard as the model for IOSCO's technical committee. He believes that IOSCO should be a 'clearing house of ideas', not a rule maker. Though other securities regulators may not agree, they cannot ignore him, since the US securities market accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the world's equity trading.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 18, BNS -- The Latvian National  Independence Movement's (LNIM) delegates of the movement's 7th  congress decided Saturday to change the movement's status,  stating that LNIM is Latvia's National Conservative party now.  As many as 223 of the congress delegates voted for this  decision, 12 voted against it, and 6 delegates abstained from  voting. As many as 270 delegates participate in the congress.    The LNIM board's head, Aristids Lambergs, said that, since  the movement's 6th congress, 796 members have joined the  movement, and 5 more departments were founded. Presently, the  LNIM comprises 2,373 members, which have to re-register  themselves again if they want to become members of the newly  formed political party.    LNIM Saeima [parliament] faction's Head Aleksandrs Kirsteins  said that LNIM supports the development of free market and  drawing in of foreign investments, but of most importance it  considers the getting back of property belonging to the citizens  of Latvia, coordination of proprietary rights, and developing of  agriculture.    The Saeima Deputy Chairman Andrejs Krastins noted that  LNIM's  main task is to win elections of the 6th Saeima and form a  government that defended the interests of Latvian people. The  delegates of the congress plan to accept LNIM's program and  statutes and elect new leadership for the party.</p>

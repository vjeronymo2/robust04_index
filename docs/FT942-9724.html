			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / IMF team to begin visit to Venezuela A team from the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to begin a two-week visit to Venezuela on Monday, just asthe country's international monetary reserves have fallen sharply and the government has restricted the sale of foreign exchange to the public. Mr Julio Sosa, Venezuela's minister of finance, said the government's liquid reserves stood at more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) and it would be 'precipitate' to discuss a standby arrangement with the IMF now. Mr Fernando Egana, an aide to President Rafael Caldera, who took office in February, said the IMF team's visit was a regularly scheduled one. But Mr Miguel Rodriguez, minister of planning and president of Venezuela's central bank under the government of President Carlos Andres Perez from 1989 to 1993, this week recommended that the government begin negotiating a standby arrangement with the fund immediately. Mr Rodriguez, the main architect of the Perez government's free-market programme, criticised the central bank's recent decision to establish daily auctions at which banks and exchange houses can buy limited volumes of US dollars. Venezuela has returned to this 'abominable' practice, while exchange controls have been abolished in other parts of Latin America, he said. The auctions, which replaced open sales of dollars to the public and were meant to reduce sales of foreign exchange, immediately led to the development of a dual-rate system. The differential between the central bank rate and the parallel market rate reached as high as 20 per cent in recent days. Venezuela eliminated a multiple-rate exchange control system in 1989, the same year it initiated an extended agreement with the IMF which expired in 1992. Breaking with recent practice, the central bank has not released complete figures on its international reserve position for the previous month. Gross reserves stood at Dollars 12.5bn at the end of 1993, but fell by 14 per cent during the first quarter of this year. Dollar sales by the central bank over the last several weeks are believed to have been unusually high, but no official information has been made public yet.</p>

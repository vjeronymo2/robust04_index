Robaina presented a message from President Fidel Castro to  the Ghanaian president during this meeting.    During his two-day stay in Accra, the visiting minister also  met with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah, with whom he  studied the international situation and, specifically, the  problems of their Third World countries.    Both officials agreed on the need to maintain the Nonaligned  Movement as an independent force to confront the neocolonialism  that governs the world's unipolarity.    During his talks with the Ghananian hosts, Captain Kojo  Tsikata, member of the state council in Ghana, asserted that  they greatly valued Cuba's efforts to maintain its dignity and  to make its own decisions.    Tsikata also emphasized Ghana is willing to continue making  its modest contributions to helping Cuba do away with its  current difficulties.    Roberto Robaina explained the measures adopted by his  country's authorities following the collapse of the socialist  bloc and the disintegration of the Soviet Union to the Ghanaian  officials.    Cuban delegation sources have reported the Cuban foreign  minister will now travel to Angola, a country with which the  Cuban Government and people maintain historic ties of friendship.    Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura asserted today, in  exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, that those ties continue  unaltered despite the ongoing changes and the war in Angola.    Da Moura highlighted Havana's cooperation with Luanda and  emphasized that the blood shed by their Cuban brothers to defend  the territorial integrity of this southern country when it was  invaded by South African forces in 1975.    Robaina is conducting his first tour to this continent,  which  will also include Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.</p>

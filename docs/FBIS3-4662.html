			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Trade ministers from Australia and New Zealand have  held their first meeting since last December's agreement in the  Uruguay Round of world trade talks. The two countries have  agreed the Cairns Group -- the Australian-led group of  agricultural trading nations -- will have an important future  role in monitoring the commitments given in the Uruguay Round.    New Zealand also backed Australia's concern over the  approach  taken by the United States in its trade dispute with Japan.  Camille Funnel spoke to Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan,  who is in Auckland, and asked him about the future of the Cairns  Group.    [Begin recording] [McMullan] We agreed today that there is a  very big role for the Cairns Group. It played a big part in  getting the agriculture enhancement through the Uruguay Round  that will be so important for Australia over the next few years.  We think the two big jobs that we have in front of us at the  moment are, one, to make sure that those agreements are actually  implemented and, secondly to work in the body that is going to  be established next year called the World Trade Organization to  make sure that those of us who are involved in fair trade in  agriculture -- us, New Zealand, Latin American countries, many  of our friends in ASEAN, and others -- that we work together in  that group to make sure that it continues as a forum that puts  pressure on the unfair trading practices of some of the bigger  players in agriculture so that we can build on the good  achievements we have made to get a better deal for our farmers  in the world market.    [Funnell] How can the Cairns Group effectively monitor  whether other countries stick to the letter of the Uruguay  agreement? I mean, you have no sort of big stick you can wield,  have you?    [McMullan] Well, the World Trade Organization does give us a  mechanism and a body of rules within which agricultural trade  should be implemented, and it does give us that capacity to take  disputes about whether people are complying with the treaty to  that organization through its dispute-settling mechanism.    That is why apart from the immediate benefits that will flow  to particular industries, the other benefit for Australia of a  multilateral agreement on trade is that it sets up a body of  rules that can protect the small and medium-size players from  what could otherwise be unilateral action by the bigger  countries and trading groups, like the European Union and the  United States.    [Funnell] And what about the future of APEC [Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation]? Did you discuss that with your New  Zealand counterpart?    [McMullan] Yes, we did. APEC is probably the biggest issue  for 1994 because of the very important leaders' meeting that is  going to be held in Jakarta toward the end of the year. And it  is important that it continue its momentum.    What we did discuss today was that when people launched the  APEC initiative four or five years ago, I think they would not  have envisaged it coming as far as it has as quickly as it has.  But we need to maintain that momentum and start to get some of  those benefits that start to make it easier for business to  trade in the region -- the trade facilitation, the things that  mean that more economic success and more jobs are generated by  activity in the region.

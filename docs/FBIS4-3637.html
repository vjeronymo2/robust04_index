			<p>BFN     [Text] While carrying out an inspection tour of our  province, Qiao Shi, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, stressed: We must  be firm and unshakable in implementing the various CPC Central  Committee measures for deepening reforms and soberly treat and  solve specific problems arising in practical work.    Between 13 and 18 April, accompanied by provincial party  Secretary Xie Shijie, provincial Governor Xiao Yang, Yang  Xizong, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing  committee, provincial party Deputy Secretary Song Baorui, and  other comrades, Comrade Qiao Shi inspected work in Sichuan. He  inspected medium and large state-owned enterprises and township  and town enterprises, listening to work reports by the Sichuan  Provincial CPC Committee and Chengdu City CPC Committee.    This is an important year for deepening reforms in our  country. Qiao Shi paid close attention to the implementation of  various measures for reforms and specific problems arising in  practical work. He said: Since the last quarter of last year,  more reform measures have been promulgated which carry greater  weight. This has been an urgent demand of the situation and a  demand for pushing forward our country's socialist  modernizations. We must seize opportunities both at home and  abroad which are favorable to our country's construction. Under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must conscientiously  implement the spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress, and the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to  firmly and resolutely implement those reform measures which have  been promulgated. We know that these reform measures have  played an important role and that they have achieved initial  results, receiving a favorable response both at home and abroad.  Of course, to carry out extensive and profound reforms in a big  country like ours, we are liable to encounter some problems. In  the face of them, we must be cool-headed and calm. If those  problems can be solved earlier, we must firmly grasp our work to  solve them as early as possible. If some problems cannot be  solved for the time being, we must actively create conditions to  solve them gradually.    Qiao Shi pointed out: In the course of implementing the  various reform measures, we must truly strengthen the party  leadership. Leaders and cadres at all levels must: Be clean and  honest and exercise self-discipline; oppose corruption and work  hard for the people; show concern for the livelihood and work of  the masses; lead them to overcome difficulties and solve  problems; and they must push forward with the various  undertakings.    During the inspection tour, Qiao Shi also issued important  instructions on enterprise reforms, rural work, and so on.</p>

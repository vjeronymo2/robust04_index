Andreas Nicklisch of the UN Information Centre in Prague  added that Prague Airport is being used by South American  businessmen in cahoots with Czech citizens to ship cocaine.    The economic and political power of drug cartels is  increasing, the report says. Drug trafficking is most active in  countries where there is civil war or where international  treaties either are being ignored or have not been accepted.    Nicklisch said that a UN team is operating in the Czech  Republic to work out an estimate of what countermeasures are  necessary to halt the spread of drugs. There is currently a  project, he said, supporting efforts in the Czech Republic  directed toward cutting the flow of drugs through the country  and limiting the establishment of supplies and markets.    He also said that Interior Minister Jan Ruml would meet with  the executive director of the UN programme, Giorgio Giacomelli,  on March 3-4 to discuss further cooperation between the UN and  the Czech Republic in drug control.</p>

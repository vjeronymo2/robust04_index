			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Miklos, deputy chairman of the </F> Democratic Party, by Maria Hluchanova; place and date not given:  "The Christian Democratic Movement Proposal Does Not Offer the  Possibility of Forming a Right-Wing Bloc"]    [Text] Representatives of five political parties held  talks yesterday on the possibility of forming a right-wing bloc  and on the implementation of the proposal of the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH] of so-called open KDH slates of  candidates.    [Hluchanova] Is it the Democratic Party [DS] that hampers  the implementation of the proposal for right-wing entities to  participate in the elections on KDH slates of candidates?    [Miklos] No. I see a problem in whether there will be  readiness to seek a better solution than the one proposed by the  KDH.    [Hluchanova] What is your idea of forming a right-wing bloc?    [Miklos] The Christian Democrats' proposal does not offer  the possibility of forming a right-wing bloc. There is to be a  ticket of a single party and not a common ticket of several  political entities with similar programs. A common ticket could  be far more successful from the viewpoint of both maximizing  electoral gains and minimizing the risk of votes getting lost.    [Hluchanova] Are there any differences of opinion between  you and DS Chairman Pavel Hagyari on this issue?    [Miklos] From the viewpoint of our present attitude toward  the need to seek other possibilities of uniting the right-wing  parties, our views are identical. However, this does not  necessarily mean the same standpoint in the event of a final  decision.</p>

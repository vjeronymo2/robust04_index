			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Fishing: Bridges over peaceful water THE FISHERMAN who is kept from fishing needs an occasional glimpse of water if he is not to slide into the slough. The odd sighting of sunlight on a gleaming surface, preferably accompanied by a weeping willow or two, provides balm to the soul oppressed by the daily grind. This is why we anglers treasure bridges. A thousand times, passing back and forth along the M4 near Reading, I have felt a spurt of irritation and frustration. It comes at the same spot, where the motorway crosses the River Loddon, the Berkshire stream on which a few miles lower down I learned my fishing as a lad. The bridge is an ugly thing, but one would expect that. Its unforgiveable offence, though, is that the grimy slabs forbid any view of the water beneath. I know the river is there, but I am denied its healing influence. That bridge is an ill-natured thing. Towards London, the motorway soars over the Thames. From the aesthetic point of view, this bridge is equally wretched - a flat, hideous intruder. But it has one immense saving grace. It is edged by railings which allow a brief but sustained sight of the broad waters of our greatest river. Heading to or away from the horrible metropolis, I am cheered by it. There is another Thames bridge which I love, although it is a good many years since I stood on it, rod in hand. It is a long, elegant affair in mellow red brick, which rises and falls over the river at Sonning (actually, only half the river, but I need not go into that). Just upstream of it, on the right bank, stands (or stood) a massive chestnut tree, with branches trailing to the water. A great bed of underwater cabbages extended from the foot of the bridge to those branches. In days gone by, this was the haunt of pike. We used to stand on the narrow pavement, leaning out over the water, and swing a livebait towards the chestnut. When the pike were on the feed, it was unusual for the float to travel more than a few feet before shooting under. Often we would see the pike rush from the weeds and grab the bait. Then it was a matter of dragging the beast across to the other side, where it could be landed from the towpath. They fought like fury, but rarely weighed more than 5lb although once I hooked a big one which broke me somewhere in the shadows. This fish, though, was nothing compared with the monster one of my brothers hooked off another bridge at Sonning; a legendary creature, this, which devoured ducks, snapped at swans, and broke his line as if it had been thread. My favourite bridge view of all is on to my favourite trout river of all, the Cumberland Eden. For 300 years or so, the road to the village of Langwathby crossed the river by a beautiful, humped red sandstone bridge. This, most sadly, was washed away by a mighty flood about 25 years ago, and replaced by dismal steel and concrete. But it remains a marvellous vantage point from which to survey the tremendous breadth of water, scanning it for swooping swifts and rings of rising trout. Fishing beneath bridges tends to be an awkward business. It is tricky to propel the fly to the right spot, and more so to see what is going on in the gloom. I remember expending much time and effort on a big fish which was feeding noisily in the darkness under a very low brick bridge on a Kennet sidestream. Eventually I shot the fly into the tunnel, struck when I heard a gulp, and pulled out a hideous hook-jawed horror of 3 1/2 lb which gave hardly a kick in protest. In contrast, there was a bridge on a surging mountain stream in Slovakia whose functional nastiness was mitigated by the snowy peaks of the High Tatras beyond. Wading up from below, I came across two pockets of trout, picking off olives with cheerful abandon in the shadows of the arches. I emerged the other side with a brace and a half of fat half pounders, which brought a huge grin to the mournful features of my friend Slavo, the local vet. I can see other bridges now: one in Romania which framed a setting sun and the rises of a cluster of good grayling; half a dozen sturdy stone ones in Ireland, irresistible invitations to stop and peer; a wooden footbridge at Wargrave, below which the barbel lurked. A bridge is a test. No true fisherman can pass one without lingering for that cheering glimpse. I have in my mind the denouement of a detective story. The detective hero, a piscatorial Morse, is with the chief suspect. The villain's hitherto unbreakable alibi depends in some way - the details are still sketchy - on him passing himself off as an angler. With our hero beside him, the villain drives over a supremely seductive bridge, with a glittering trout stream below. But he looks neither left nor right. Our man, having spotted a two-pounder rising by the willow on the left, grabs the murderer with the cry: 'Impostor'. Well, I think it has possibilities.</p>

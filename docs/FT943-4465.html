			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds remain bearish ahead of GDP data release German bonds made a half-hearted attempt to stabilise yesterday after six days of falls but analysts said sentiment remained bearish. Yields on 10-year bunds hovered around 7 1/2 per cent ahead of today's release of second-quarter GDP data. The data are expected to show quarter-on-quarter expansion of around 1 per cent which would bring the yearly growth rate close to 2 per cent. However, analysts said the quarter-on-quarter data could be misleading initially because they are rounded up or down to the nearest half-point. Dealers said a weaker-than-expected result could lift the market but that any gains would be limited because investors would use the strength to sell out. 'The bund market still needs to price in a greater risk premium,' said one bond salesman. Remarks by Bundesbank central council member Mr Hans-Juergen Krupp that there was room for a further cut in German interest rates were also viewed with some scepticism because of his doveish reputation with respect to inflation. Latest opinion poll findings which did not give a clear majority to the government and supply concerns also kept the lid on bund prices. About DM70bn worth of funding still needs to be done before the end of the year. The Bundesbank had a better-than-expected reception to its Treuhand auction, alloting DM4.19bn at an average weighted price at 99.91 and an average yield of 7.51 per cent. The Bundesbank retained DM2.81bn of the issue for market-tending operations, bringing the total volume on the issue to DM10bn, above market estimates of DM8bn. Gilts were little changed in thin trading yesterday as the market awaited the outcome of the monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. 'Eddie George will have a tough case persuading the chancellor that rates should go up now,' said Mr Robert Thomas at Natwest Markets. Mr John Shepperd at Yamaichi said the consensus was that there would be no change in interest rates. The speech in Leiden by Mr John Major, prime minister, addressing the future of Europe, came too late to affect trading. However, the yield spread between gilts and bunds widened to 137 basis points, against 132 basis points on Friday. A two-speed Europe would be negative for the gilt market because of the widely-held view that the UK would be relegated to the slow lane along with Italy and Spain. On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose  1/2 point to 100 3/8 in late trading. Italian bonds were largely unchanged in spite of government moves to cut spending on pensions. The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond was down 3 basis points to 12.26 per cent. The Spanish benchmark 10-year bond yield was unchanged at 11.38 per cent. US Treasuries posted moderate losses yesterday as traders adjusted their positions ahead of Friday's producer price data. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at 99 3/16 , with the yield rising to 7.562 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 6.198 per cent. The morning's economic news was marginally unfavourable, although traders did not view the data as especially significant. The Commerce Department announced a 0.4 per cent fall in July wholesale sales and a 0.8 per cent increase in inventories. In a more troublesome report, the Labor Department revised downwards its estimate of the decline in second-quarter non-farm productivity to 2.5 per cent, the largest drop since the first three months of 1989. It also said unit labour costs had risen 3.4 per cent last quarter, a red flag for inflation-sensitive bonds. The weak tone was more of a reflection of the market's shaky technical conditions in the run-up to the release of Friday's inflation data.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Light a torch of chaos in Christchurch HERE IS a tip for the media pundits as they hurtle down the motorway to the Christchurch by-election, which promises to drive another stake into John Major's heart: the number to concentrate on in Christchurch is not 23,015, the size of the Conservative majority at last year's general election, but 36,627, the number of wooden-tops in the constituency who voted Tory in 1992. It is such a large figure that it fills me with awe - so much awe that I raised the matter with Miss Lee, my executive assistant, a woman of Yorkshire origins and a flog-'em-and-hang-'em Thatcherite. Miss Lee was looking marvellous: hair expensively twirled, hemline heroically buoyant, new shoes and nails in the latest carnivore colours. I said: Did you know, Miss Lee, that the number of wooden-tops in Christchurch who voted Tory at the 1992 election was 36,627? No wonder the country is tottering if as many people as that, in just one constituency, voted for a party that they knew to be exhausted by all those years in office, and by the stress and indignity of sacking Margaret Thatcher. But here's a funny thing: you never meet anyone who admits to voting Tory. They keep exceedingly quiet, which is not, I suppose, surprising. Miss Lee glared. I could see she was in a hurry. She was beautifying herself so as to attend a gathering of the Blue Fuse Club. They meet in a winebar near Chelsea barracks where she and her cronies discuss fund-raising and fashion, and pick up young soldiers. Miss Lee said: I haven't got time for your musings. What happens at elections is a matter for individual conscience. That is how we do things. But you refuse to be satisfied. Because you're half balmy you would introduce referendums, tear down our institutions and sack the poor Queen, or at any rate circumscribe her. Why not abolish elections, do everything by lottery? I thought: Not a bad idea. So I pulled out a copy of The Dice Man, a novel by Luke Rhinehart from the early 1970s in which the protagonist, a bored psychiatrist, decides to let fate and chance - a throw of the dice - govern his life. His aim, he explains, is to discover freedom, exhilaration, joy, excitement. He becomes the Dice Man. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that a throw of the dice would be a far superior method for resolving the Christchurch by-election than placing our trust in the hands of the wooden-tops. So I hunted for a dice. I decided that if the 1 came up, the Tories would retain Christchurch; the 2 or the 5 would mean that Labour had won and the 3, 4 or 6, the Liberal Democrats. I ignored the minor parties. I threw the dice. Up came the 6: victory for the Liberal Democrats. Victory at a stroke  -no costly campaign, no monster raving loonies, no pundits or pollsters boring us rigid. Above all, no wooden-tops blundering into the polling stations, sightless, in their thousands. At the start of his book, Rhinehart quotes Chuang-Tzu: 'The torch of chaos and doubt - this is what the sage steers by.' And he quotes Nietzsche: 'I am Zarathustra the godless: I still cook every chance in my pot.' As the novel develops, the protagonist describes his two guiding principles: 'First, never include an option I might be unwilling to fulfil; second, always begin to fulfil the option without . . . quibble. The secret of the successful dicelife is to be a puppet on the strings of the die.' Naturally, someone has to decide what the numbers on the dice stand for, what options they represent. In the case of the Christchurch by-election it was I who decided that the Liberal Democrats should have three chances out of six and the Tories only one. But the result, you will agree, was considerably agreeable. I seem to have a gift for it. I ought to be the Dice Man. The morning after Miss Lee's attendance at the meeting of the Blue Fuse Club, she was subdued and wan. There were circles under her eyes. I said: Things are looking up, Miss Lee. The Liberal Democrats have won Christchurch. John Major has retired. Portillo leads the Tories. John Birt has been axed - literally, as it happens. Interest rates are zero. Diana will be queen. And Italy has invaded Serbia. Isn't life exciting?</p>

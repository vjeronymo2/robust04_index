			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- China has taken an  active part in international women's activities sponsored by the  United Nations, according to a document released by the  Information Office of the State Council here today.    The white paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women"  says that China is striving to develop friendly exchanges and  cooperation with women from all over the world, while making  unremitting efforts to realize the goal of worldwide equality  between men and women, women's participation in social  development and maintenance of world peace.    "Since resuming membership in the United Nations in October  1971, China has shown great enthusiasm in participating in U.N.  activities related to women," the document states.    China has been playing an active role in U.N. women's  organizations. Since 1974, China has been elected five times as  a member state in the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women.  "There, Chinese representatives have expounded Chinese women's  stand on world peace, participation in development and promotion  of sex equality, exchanged experience and information on  promoting women's conditions and giving full play to the role of  women with their counterparts from other countries," the paper  says.    Since 1982, Chinese experts have been elected four times in  succession as representatives on the Committee on Elimination of  Discrimination Against Women and participated in evaluating the  reports submitted by governments and made strenuous efforts to  eliminate discrimination against women, according to the  document.    The paper says that China was one of the first signatories  to  the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination  against women and has submitted timely reports on its  implementation in China as required.    "China supported and engaged in activities for International  Women's Year in 1975 and the U.N. Decade for Women, from 1975 to  1985. The Chinese Government sent delegations to the world  conferences on women held in Mexico City in 1975, Copenhagen in  1980 and Nairobi in 1985, and also to the five global  preliminary meetings and two regional preparatory meetings," the  document says.    "At these events, Chinese representatives gave full support  to exertions for the United Nations Decade for Women and  expounded China's stand and viewpoints on some major  international problems and strategies for the advancement of  conditions for women, thus making positive contributions to the  success of these conferences," the paper says.    The document continues that Chinese women have made vigorous  efforts to develop links with women's organizations and  individuals around the globe. "To date, the All-China Women's  Federation has established ties with nearly over 480  governmental and non-governmental women's and children's  organizations in over 130 countries and regions and received  more than 10,000 visitors in recent years," it says.    In the past 15 years, China has also sent 280 women  delegations abroad, according to the paper.    Over the past decade, the All-China Women's Federation has  cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund, United  Nations Women's Development Fund and other governmental and  non-governmental organizations in over 700 projects in 30  provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Over 300,000  women have taken part in these programs and the results have  been outstanding, the paper says.    "As the host country of the fourth world conference on  women," the paper says, "China will make positive efforts to  ensure its success."    "The Chinese Government is at present earnestly carrying out  its responsibilities as a host country and increasing its  contacts and cooperation with U.N. organizations, governments  and relevant non-governmental organizations in the world."</p>

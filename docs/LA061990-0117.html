			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE THEATRE OF HARLEM ON FIRMER FOOTING;  </P> <P> FUNDING: AMERICAN EXPRESS MAKES COMMITMENT IN CASH AND MARKETING.  </P> <P> As the Dance Theatre of Harlem approaches the midpoint of a six-month layoff,  it received some good news that points toward renewed activity and sounder  financial footing for the company, which was forced to suspend operations  earlier in the year.  </P> <P> American Express Travel Related Services Co. is making a major commitment of  both cash and marketing services to the company, American Express president and  CEO Edwin Cooperman announced at a press conference Monday. He described a  "unique alliance" between his corporation and the company -- a four-year  commitment that will involve a $1 million cash contribution and an in-kind  contribution of at least $250,000 in marketing expertise.  </P> <P> "We will also approach our partners in the business community to help us  sponsor DTH as they tour around the country and around the world," he said.  </P> <P> Arthur Mitchell, the company's artistic director, accepted an oversized check  representing the first of four $250,000 installments.  </P> <P> The company's 54 dancers, along with some technical and administrative staff,  were laid off at the end of March, following a highly successful national tour,  as the company faced a $1.7-million deficit. Mitchell said the dancers and  staff would return to work Oct. 1, at the start of the company's fiscal year,  and that they would regroup slowly following the layoff. "We have been through  the fire, and we have survived to become even stronger and with our sense of  commitment more firmly resolved than ever," Mitchell stated. His goal is to  establish a $2-million cash reserve for DTH, as part of his stated intention to  demonstrate fiscal responsibility. Noting the financial pressures faced by a  growing number of dance troupes nowadays, he observed that "companies cannot  continue on the way they have in the past. We need to think more like the  business community, in terms of insurance."  </P> <P> The American Express contribution follows a recent $1 million emergency grant  to the company from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund.  </P> <P> The company may perform in Boston in November, but will not begin full-scale  touring until 1991.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SABOTAGE IS SUSPECTED IN ORANGE GLEN CAP SCORES  </P> <P> Seniors at Escondido's Orange Glen High School are suspected of "flunking"  state academic assessment tests on purpose to express their anger at having  off-campus lunch privileges suspended.  </P> <P> The 12th-grade scores dropped precipitously in December tests, a few weeks  after the school instituted a locked parking lot policy.  </P> <P> Principal Ed Brand said Monday that he planned to get to the bottom of the  so-called sabotage, which, according to several teachers and students, was  common knowledge on campus.  </P> <P> Brand said he has asked the state Department of Education to send him  individual scores to determine if students purposely marked incorrect answers  on the multiple-choice test. The test is designed to assess the effectiveness  of the school's teaching program, not a student's individual achievement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Pattern?  </P> <P> Students reported that some of the seniors had "decorated" their answer sheets  with Christmas tree designs using random answer spaces as the outline. Others  allegedly marked their answers using A, C and D answer spaces to spell out  AC/DC, a popular heavy-metal band.  </P> <P> "I have no proof of any of this," Brand said, "but the state (Department of  Education) has promised me the information we need within a week to 10 days."  </P> <P> He said he doesn't plan punishment for students found to have participated in  the antic, but would work to assure "that a thing like this does not happen  again."  </P> <P> Scores on the California Assessment Program (CAP) test dropped Orange Glen to  below the state average in reading and math. In 1987, the high school won a  National Secondary School Recognition Award.  </P> <P> Orange Glen administrators angered the seniors last October by ordering the  gates to the campus parking lot locked during school hours, maintaining that  the measure would cut down on the vandalism that had plagued the parking area  last year and at the beginning of the school year in September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cut Down on Vandalism  </P> <P> Brand said the locked gates have cut vandalism but admitted that seniors view  the action as restricting their rights. Although most students are not allowed  to leave campus during school hours, seniors with satisfactory academic records  and parental consent had been allowed off campus during lunch breaks.  </P> <P> "I think it was sabotage, pure and simple," one Orange Glen instructor said.  "The scores reflect directly against the school, its teachers and its  administrators. The students were angry and they showed their anger."  </P> <P> Escondido High School, where reading scores dropped but math scores improved,  does not suspect a similar revolt.  </P> <P> Jackie Nichols, Escondido High principal, said that "it's not very likely that  our seniors skewed just one part of the CAP tests and not the rest." Escondido  High students don't have a locked parking area, she said, but students are  "monitored" to make sure there are no unauthorized comings and goings during  the school day.  </P> <P> Similar sabotage of the CAP test is suspected at West High School in Torrance,  where school officials said students apparently were "sending a message" to  administrators that the school places too much emphasis on the examination.  </P> <P> Orange Glen has been rocked by a number of tragic incidents during the school  year, including an arson, two student suicides and the arrest of three students  and a teacher's aide in connection with the slaying of the aide's estranged  husband.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Can't Get Much Worse'  </P> <P> "Things can't get much worse," Brand said. "We must turn things around."  </P> <P> A state accreditation team was visiting the Escondido school campus when the  suspected CAP test scandal became public.  </P> <P> Tom Fong, research analyst with the state Department of Education, said he has  received Brand's request for a review of the CAP tests but admitted that it  would not be easy to unmask the culprits.  </P> <P> The state has the raw data from the school CAP tests, he said, but it does not  include student names. If the school can trace the test-taker from his or her  birth date and other identifying data, "then I guess they can figure out who  should have done well but didn't," Fong said.  </P> <P> As a last resort, Fong said, "we could send for the actual test books, which  are kept by the test firm (Data Recognition Corp.) in Minnesota," to check if  there were actual Christmas tree designs or AC/DC answer patterns.  </P> <P> Even that proof would not change the school's ranking, Brand said. "We live or  die by what those students did in December."  </P></p>

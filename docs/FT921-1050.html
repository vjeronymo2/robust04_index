			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl sells papermaking business for Pounds 10.2m BUNZL, the packaging and cigarette filter group, is pulling out of its original papermaking business with the Pounds 10.2m sale of its hospital and medical papers operations to Arjo Wiggins Appleton. The group, which is due today to announce 1991 profits, is selling the assets of its Wycombe Marsh Paper Mills, Buckinghamshire, and Bunzl Speciality Materials in Atltanta, Georgia, for Pounds 7m in cash with a further payment of Pounds 3m to be phased over five years. Bunzl will retain the factory site and Arjo will move the equipment to its Palalda mill in south-west France over a period of two years. The disposal is the final significant asset sale indicated by chief executive Mr Tony Habgood at the interim stage in September. The group closed its US food services division, after just four years of ownership, and sold the assets for Dollars 4m to Albert Fisher of the UK. The papermaking activities were 'peripheral to our activities,' said Mr Habgood, who was appointed to his post last summer to refocus the group following its acquisitive binge in the 1980s. Mr Habgood said Bunzl retained an important distribution business in the US, while the cigarette filter operations were 'strong and competitive'. Altogether, disposals over the past six months represent just over Pounds 250m in sales, said Mr Habgood, although the effect would be less on the group's profit and loss account. Bunzl reported a 32 per cent decline in profits to Pounds 20.6m at the interim stage. Bunzl has been in papermaking since before the company's founding Czechoslovakian family came to Britain in the 1930s.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Belgian and Dutch bonds in favour after rate cuts THE Belgian and Dutch government bond markets were in favour yesterday as both countries cut key short-term interest rates, echoing a similar easing by the Bundesbank on Tuesday. The Belgian National Bank reduced its seven-day special advances rate by 10 basis points to 8.9 per cent, while the Dutch authorities cut their intervention rate to the same level. Both were reacting to the strength of their currencies, and followed the 10 basis point cut in the latest German repurchase agreement (or repo) tender. Money market rates in Germany have now moved down 30 basis points since the devaluation of the lira and 80 basis points since early September. Dealers said that a Belgian cut had already been factored into bond prices but there was considerable switching out of Germany, and the spread against the bund continued to narrow. One dealer said the spread had dropped from 112 basis points to 93 points since Tuesday morning and expected traders to start taking profits. The Belgian benchmark 10-year government bond firmed 30 basis points to 102.27, with the yield falling to 8.39 per cent. Dutch bonds opened slightly easier in sympathy with the German market, but speculation that Amsterdam would follow the Belgian rate cut encouraged demand. Then, in late trading, the Dutch central bank said it had lowered its special advances money market rate to 8.9 per cent from 9 per cent for a five-day liquidity pact it will launch at tender today. Subscriptions to the new special advances pact were expected to be open first thing this morning and allocations were to be announced shortly afterwards. The new liquidity pact will replace a three-day facility of Fl 2.5bn expiring before the start of trade today. The Dutch 10-year benchmark bond ended the day much as it had begun - it showed a slight fall of 8 basis points at 103.36. IN the German government bond market, cash bund prices slipped one-third of a point as traders took profits after the recent strong rally. There was also some drag on the government bond from an auction of new 10-year 7.25 per cent bunds which raised DM3.92bn. Dealers were said to be moving into cash, Dutch guilders or Belgian francs. There was some selling of longer-dated bonds and pressure in the futures market after a large German bank was said to have started unloading bund futures. The bund future on Liffe ended the day at 91.04, down from Tuesday's close of 91.38. LONG gilts bounced back after a protracted period of weakness, showing a one-point rise as the market pinned its hopes on a keynote speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer due today. Mr Norman Lamont is to address the Tory Party conference and, although conference speeches tend to be occasions for bland encouragement to the party faithful, dealers hope that the seriousness of the present economic situation will prompt a more pointed response. Nevertheless, dealers said the risks inherent in remaining outside the ERM, and the possibility of a jump in the inflation rate, ensured that it was unlikely the yield spread against bunds would narrow significantly from its present level above 200 basis points. There was also some switching out of shorter-dated gilts. The long-dated benchmark gilt gained over a point to 96 1/4 , while the long gilt future opened three-quarters of a percentage point higher and traded strongly all day, reaching a high of 95 13/16 . The December short sterling futures contract was steady around 91.82, with the market looking for interest rates of 8.25 per cent by the end of the year. FRANCE drew encouragement from hints by the Bundesbank's chief economist that Germany was working to ease rates. Mr Otmar Issing warned against placing too much reliance on near-term German M3 money supply data - hitherto the leading indicator used by the German monetary authorities. In addition, he said it was regrettable that financial markets had apparently underestimated the decline in short-term German rates over the past three weeks. French bonds firmed one-third of a point, and the spread against the bund had narrowed by 8 basis points by midday. However, a fall in bund prices in the afternoon caused OATs to shed much of their gains. US TREASURY prices fell sharply for the second day running yesterday on a poor seven-year auction and continued disappointment that the Federal Reserve had not cut interest rates. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 97 3/16 , yielding 7.480 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down  1/4 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.867 per cent. Expectations of an interest rate cut were high at the start of the week but, after the Fed failed to act following Tuesday's open market committee meeting, hopes for a rate cut dwindled rapidly, forcing many investors who had bought bonds in anticipation of a policy ease to unload their recently acquired stock. Prices were also depressed by unexpectedly weak demand for the Dollars 9.75bn of seven-year notes auctioned in the afternoon.</p>

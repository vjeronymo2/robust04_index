			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Engineers V.N. Leonov, A.G. Sila Novitskiy, V.S. </F> Smirnov, A.I. Filin, V.S. Tsikunov and Yu.M. Cherkashov (NIKIET)  under the ``S&amp;T Progress to Builders'' rubric]    [Abstract] Work on ``Nontraditional Concepts of AES With  Natural Safety'' is conducted within the framework of the State  S&amp;T Program ``Ecologically Clean Power'' under the auspices  of  the Ministry of Science, Higher School and Technical Policy.  Criteria of inherent safety of nuclear reactors (a new nuclear  power philosophy proposed by a well known American scientist A.  Weinberg) had been developed, and a contest of concepts of  nuclear reactors meeting these requirements was conducted. It  has been determined that of the five concepts presented for the  contest the concept of fast reactors with a lead heat transfer  agent (BREST [Russian abbreviation]) meets the requirements in  the most thorough way. A group of IAE [Atomic Energy  Institute] associates on the initiative and under the leadership  of V.V. Orlov had begun the development of such reactor more  than five years ago; the development then continued at NIKIET  [expansion not given] and OKB [Experimental Design Bureau]  ``Gidropress'', with the participation of FEI, VNIINM, TsNIIKM  ``Prometey'', NIIAR, VNIITF [expansions not given], NPO  [scientific production association] ``Luch'', MIFI [Moscow  Engineering Physics Institute] and a number of other institutes.  There are two directions of designing a reactor unit a three  and a two loop scheme for removal of heat from the reactor core.  The two loop scheme is deemed more promising. Conceptual designs  of reactors BRS (300- 1000 MW of electric power) and BREST 300  (300 MW) are described. As far as the cost of electric power is  concerned, it is lower for BREST reactors than for reactors BN  1600 and VTGR and comparable to reactors VVER. It is estimated  that an experimental demonstration reactor can be built in  approximately eight years, while construction of a pilot AES  with this reactor will take 12 to 15 years.

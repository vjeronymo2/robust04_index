These are the 1994 economic work guiding principles as  defined at the provincial economic work conference on 21  December.    Present at the conference were Wang Guofa, Quan Zhezhu, and  Wei Minxue, vice governors of the provincial government; and  Sang Fengwen, secretary general of the provincial government.    Comrade Gao Yan first divided the guidelines of the national  economic work conference into nine parts and relayed the  guidelines. The contents of these nine parts are the current  situation, the 1994 economic work principles and tasks, the  vigorous development of the rural economy, the increase in the  peasants' income, the stress on economic results, the efforts to  realistically grasp the industrial and communications  production, the several major reform measures as put forward in  line with the general targets for accelerating the setup of the  socialist market economic system, the efforts to grasp favorable  opportunities to further expand the scale of opening up, the  efforts to appropriately handle the relations of reform,  development, and social stability, and the enhancement and  improvement of the leadership over the economic work. After  that, Comrade Liu Xilin comprehensively arranged the 1994  economic work.    After analyzing the 1994 economic development trends and  defining the national economic development targets, he first  used conclusive figures to introduce the province's new  achievements in reform and economic construction. He said: The  14 managerial rights which are delegated to enterprises  according to the "regulation" are being delegated in a  step-by-step manner. Noticeable achievements have been made in  experimenting with the shareholding system. The state-owned and  civilian-run enterprises have been popularized on a large scale.  Simultaneously, the company system is carried out on a trial  basis. Key headway has been made in price reform, new headway  has been made in carrying out the social insurance system and  reforming the economic system, and new strides have been made in  reforming the planning and investment system and the housing  system and setting up the market system. Based on the 1992  rapid economic growth rate, in 1993, the province continues to  maintain the good faster development trend. The major targets  for elevating the economy to a new height have been fulfilled.  The GNP is expected to reach 5.5 billion yuan, an increase of  14.3 percent over 1992. Of this, the added value of the  tertiary industry is expected to reach 13.3 billion yuan, an  increase of 17.3 percent; the total agricultural output value is  expected to reach 22.4 billion yuan, the second peak year in  history; the total output value of town and township enterprises  is expected to reach 30 billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent  over 1992; the total industrial output value is expected to  reach 81 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent; the total  volume of retail sales of commodities is expected to reach 35.2  billion yuan, an increase of 17.9 percent; and the foreign  export trade volume is expected to reach $1.6 billion, an  increase of 23 percent. A total of 1,400 foreign-funded  enterprises of three types have been approved and $650 million  foreign capital has really been used, an increase of more than  200 percent over the figures of last year. The capital profit  and tax rate reaches 6.24 percent. (If calculated according to  comparable factors, the targets of elevating the economy to a  new height can be fulfilled.) The per capita labor productivity  of the independent accounting industrial enterprises at or above  the township level reaches 9,686 yuan. The turnover of the  working funds is 1.27 times. The energy consumption for per  10,000 yuan of industrial output value is 3.46 tonnes of  (standard coal.) The revenues are expected to reach 6.8 billion  yuan, an increase of 19 percent. The bank savings deposits  reach 48.39 billion yuan, an increase of 7.5 billion yuan over  the figure at the beginning of the year. The per capita net  income of the peasants reaches 864 yuan and the urban dwellers'  income for living expenses reach 1,735.6 yuan. The investment  in fixed assets of society reach 20 billion yuan, an increase of  33 percent over 1992. The investment in the fixed assets of  localities reach 14.07 billion yuan, an increase of 34.9  percent. Of this, the investment in technological  transformation reaches 2.8 billion yuan.    Liu Xilin said: The year 1994 is a year to implement the  "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee, to wholly promote the economic structural  reform, and to make key breakthroughs in the economic structural  reform as well as the last year to attain the three-year target  of elevating the economy to a new height as required by the  provincial party committee and the provincial government. The  1994 major national economic and social development targets are  defined as follows:    The GNP should increase by 12 percent and strive to increase  by 16.5 percent. Of this, the added value of the tertiary  industry should increase by 20 percent and strive to reach 28  percent.    The total agricultural output value should increase by 6  percent and strive to reach 7.4 percent. The total grain output  should reach 19 billion kilograms. The total output value of  town and township enterprises should increase by 33.3 percent.    The total industrial output value should increase by 15  percent and strive to increase 18.4 percent.    The capital profit and tax rate of the industrial front  should increase by 2 percentage point. The per capita labor  productivity of the independent accounting industrial  enterprises at or above the township level should increase by 14  percent. The energy consumption for per 10,000 yuan of output  value should be reduced by 3 percent. The turnover of the  working funds should reach 1.37 times.    The revenues should increase by 8 percent.    The bank savings deposits should increase by 8.5 billion  yuan, an increase of 17.5 percent.    The volume of retail sales of commodities should increase by  17 percent.    The foreign export trade volume should reach $2 billion, an  increase of 25 percent. A total of $750 million foreign capital  should really be used, and the use of foreign capital should  strive to reach $800 million foreign capital.    The per capita net income of the peasants should reach 910  yuan and the urbanites' income for living expenses should reach  more than 1,800 yuan.    The retail price index should be controlled within 10  percent.    The 1994 reform tasks are extremely arduous. Liu Xilin  pointed out: Setting up the modern enterprise system is an  effective way for realizing the public ownership form under the  conditions for exploring the market economy as well as a reform  orientation of the state-owned enterprises. According to  different actual conditions, enterprises should adopt different  forms to reform the property right system. First, develop the  shareholding system. Next year, we should strive to transform  50 to 100 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with  good foundation and good economic results into limited companies  or shareholding corporations. Second, reorganize, on a trial  basis, state-owned, wholly funded limited companies. Next year,  100 enterprises in the province should be changed into companies  of this kind. In addition, we should also carry out various  forms of property right systems, such as "state ownership and  civilian management," grafting management, shareholding  cooperative management, "separate management," management based  on reformed system, amalgamation, and bankruptcy.  Simultaneously, we should also positively reform the financial,  investment, planning, and foreign trade systems in the  macroeconomic spheres; positively and steadily promote the  reform of price, housing, social insurance systems; focus on  cultivating the markets for production factors; and vigorously  strengthen the construction of capital, land, labor, technology,  information, and property right markets.    In regard to the issues of speeding up the economic  development and striving to fulfill the task of elevating the  economy to a new height, Liu Xilin stressed: We should  strengthen agriculture's role as the foundation of the national  economy, vigorously develop the shareholding cooperative  economy, and cultivate and expand the mainstay of the markets.  It is necessary to ceaselessly perfect the responsibility  system dominated by the contracted responsibility on the  household basis with payment linked to output and the dual  management system of linking centralized management with  decentralized management and along with the setup of the  socialist market economy. We should stabilize the land contract  relations and extend the land contract periods. Under the  conditions of persisting in the collective ownership of the land  and not changing the purposes of utilization of land, the  peasants are allowed to sell the land utilization rights within  the contract periods. Barren hills and wasteland can be rent,  mortgaged, and used in exchange for stocks. In this way, land  resources will effectively be distributed and appropriately be  managed. The shareholding cooperative system is created by the  peasants in order to suit the new situation of developing the  market economy. Therefore, all localities should run and  transform town and township enterprises in the form of the  shareholding cooperation system and organize and set up  circulation organizations and socialized service organizations.    In regard to the industrial production, Liu Xilin set  forth: Next year, we should carry out our work emphatically in  line with the requirements for readjusting structures,  transforming mechanisms, grasping management, and increasing  efficiency. In the course of readjusting the industrial  structure, we should further expand such two pillar industries  as the petrochemical and vehicle industries; develop the  industries with advantages, such as food, medicine,  metallurgical, building materials, and paper-making industries;  and strengthen such basic industries as energy and raw material  industries. We should also positively develop the electronics  industry. We should emphatically grasp the construction of a  large number of key projects, such as the 300,000-tonne ethylene  project of Jilin Chemical industry Company, the sedan car  manufacturing project and its auxiliary projects of the  Changchun No. 1 Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, and the first phase  of the Shuangliao power plant project; and conduct technological  transformation among the "bottle neck" and weak links that  affect the economic development. The enterprises should  organize structural readjustment according to the requirements  for the market economy, further develop specialized and  integrated management, and adopt various forms to optimize the  reorganization of enterprises. The product mix should be  readjusted according to the principle of supporting the  production of the products with advantages, creating new  products, increasing the production of readily marketable  products, controlling the production of unmarketable products,  and limiting the production of ordinarily marketable products.  we should support the production of quality products in line  with the preferential policies. Next year, we should develop  2,400 new products and focus on developing 50 new products each  creating 2 to 5 million yuan of profits and taxes annually.    Keeping a proper scale of investment in fixed assets is a  key  condition for economic growth. Next year, the investment in  fixed assets should be 24 billion yuan. The total investment  will be used for key construction projects and technological  transformation projects.    We should speed up the economic development pace; vigorously  develop the collective, private, and individual sectors of the  economy; cultivate new national economic growth points; pay high  attention to science and technology and education; positively  develop the tertiary industry; organize market supply; and make  good arrangements for the people's livelihood.    Further expanding the scale of opening to the outside world  and vigorously developing the export-oriented economy is one of  the province's economic work priorities. Liu Xilin urged: In  the new year, we should positively expand the international  market and vigorously develop foreign trade. We should further  improve the export commodity structure; vigorously grasp the  export of additional-value machinery and electronics products  and complete sets of equipment with strong competitiveness on  the international market, high foreign exchange earnings, and  good export projects and new high-tech products. We should  expand the export of labor-intensive light and textile products.  We should accelerate the transformation of a number of  export-oriented town and township enterprises; gradually set up  a system where the production of grain, oil, meat, vegetable,  fruit, and timber is comprehensively developed; and establish  enterprise groups with foreign exchange earnings. We should  improve the environment of opening to the outside world and  positively and effectively use foreign capital. Next year, we  should approve 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises and strive to  use $800 million foreign capital. We should realistically  achieve the construction and management of development zones,  continue to run four state-class development zones, and strive  to gain approvals for setting up several provincial-level  development zones.    Liu Xilin urged: To suit the 1994 reform and development,  the leading organs at various levels and the leading cadres  should noticeably improve their leadership forms and work style.  Next year, the provincial, city, and county government organs  should conduct reform in succession. The reform targets are to  change functions, balance relationship, streamline  administration, and improve efficiency. The most urgent task  for changing the government functions is to realize the  transition from direct management of enterprises to  macroeconomic regulation and control, to grasp the setup of the  markets for production factors, and to create conditions for  sending enterprises to markets. He hoped that the cadres at  various levels should clearly understand the situation, have  firm faith, overcome difficulties, vigorously promote reform and  opening up, and fight for promoting a sustained, fast, and sound  development of the national economy.    Present at the conference were principal leaders of the city  (autonomous prefectural) governments, leaders of the  provincial-level and city (autonomous prefectural) departments  concerned, and plant directors (managers) of some large  enterprises.</p>

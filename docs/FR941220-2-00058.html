On Dec. 2, 1994, the Amex amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currency warrants, as used in this filing, may refer to warrants on individual currencies (or cross currencies) or to warrants on a specific currency index group (``currency index warrants''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex seeks to amend Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide to provide higher standards for index and currency warrant issuers than currently exists. In particular, such issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issuer price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are National Market securities traded through NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment requires that each warrant issuer will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities market) or upon expiration. Section 106 also will be amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m. settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine an index's settlement value where 25 percent or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary trading market is in the U.S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 462 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less the amount by which the warrant is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Part VI of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule 1100 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in part VI applies, the provisions of the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 1101 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant to Exchange Rule 921. Accordingly, the Exchange will rescind Commentaries .01 and .02 to Rule 411, its current suitability standard applicable to warrants, which currently provide that the Exchange ``recommends'' that index and currency warrants only be sold to investors whose accounts have been approved for options trading. Furthermore, proposed Rules 1102&hyph;1105 require that the option rules pertaining to suitability, discretionary account trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index an currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 1106 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 1107 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect to warrants on the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one-half million warrants covering all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not grater than ten dollars. The rule provides that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in the rule, and Commentary V to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 1108 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options and states that such limits are distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of stock index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

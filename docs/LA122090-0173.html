			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 21ST CHESS TITLE GAME ADJOURNED; OUTCOME UNCERTAIN  </P> <P> The 21st game of the world chess championship between reigning champion Gary  Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov adjourned Wednesday night after 40  moves.  </P> <P> Play is to resume this afternoon.  </P> <P> Kasparov, world champion since 1985, leads Karpov by 11 points to 9. He needs  one more victory or two draws for a 12-12 tie, in which case he would retain  the title.  </P> <P> Karpov, the world champion before Kasparov, must win three of the last four  games and draw the other to gain the 12 1/2 points he needs to win back the  title.  </P> <P> Karpov, playing white, had a pawn advantage when the adjournment was declared  after five hours of play, and he sealed his 41st move in an envelope. Analysts  said the outcome of the game remains in doubt, since Karpov's king appeared to  be more exposed to attack than Kasparov's.  </P> <P> Here are the moves:  </P> <P> Karpov-Kasparov 21: 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 Bg7 4 e4 d6 5 f3 0-0 6 Be3 e5 7 d5  Nh5 8 Qd2 f5 9 0-0 a6 10 Bd3 c5 11 dxc6 Nxc6 12 Nd5 Be6 13 Bb6 Qd7 14 Ne2 Rac8  15 Kb1 Qf7 16 Rhe1 Kh8 17 Bc2 Nf6 18 Bd3 Nd7 19 Bg1 Nc5 20 Nb6 Rcd8 21 Nc3 Nd4  22 Ncd5 Bxd5 23 Nxd5 fxe4 24 fxe4 b5 25 Rf1 Qd7 26 cxb5 axb5 27 Rxf8+ Rxf8 28  h3 Qd8 29 Bxd4 exd4 30 Qe2 Qh4 31 Rf1 Re8 32 Rf4 Qg5 33 a3 h5 34 Ka2 b4 35 axb4  Ra8+ 36 Kb1 Nb3 37 Kc2 Na1+ 38 Kb1 Nb3 39 Qf2 Qd8 40 Rf7 Qe8.

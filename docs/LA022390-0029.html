			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Art of the Odd: Steve Galloway's large, meticulously crafted new paintings are  loaded with odd objects and goings-on that yield morality tales or fantasy  scenarios of one sort or another. One or two are so obvious they fall flat: In  the dusty land of "Hungry Belly," three ceramic bowls grow on slender stems  that dangle labels reading "breakfast," "lunch" and "dinner."  </P> <P> In "Migration of Light," events are more quaint and curious. A Breughel peasant  drowses under a spreading tree, oblivious to a strange procession: A dog  carries a piece of architecture strapped to his back and pulls a cubic video  screen that broadcasts landscape views. On top of this portable entertainment,  a skeleton plays the xylophone. Mingling 20th-Century technology with  16th-Century imagery doesn't add any particular freshness to this scene,  however. It's as if Galloway's effortless technique and runaway imagination  make it too easy for him to embroider away to his heart's content.  </P> <P> A series of small carbon pencil drawings are mostly of vaguely threatening,  unnatural views of such things as eerily vast and empty architecture on stilts,  a "monument" created with a hulking stack of pipes and a trio of doors standing  mysteriously over potholes in a field. Less ambitious but more concentrated and  without the distractions of lovely color and immaculate rendering, these images  have a directness the other, more archly riddling images don't possess. (James  Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to March 17.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Hopeful hostage One of the reasons governors of the Bank of England are so reluctant to be interviewed on TV is an understandable fear that any incautious comment on their part could return to haunt them. Hence the interest in Robin Leigh-Pemberton's remarks about sterling on Channel 4 last week. 'There seems immediately no need to raise rates, and I hope in the medium term there won't be either.' The form of words bore an uncanny resemblance to a statement by one of the governor's more distinguished predecessors, Montagu Norman: 'We may well be thankful to have escaped war, certainly for a short, and, I hope, for a long period.' The occasion: a letter to Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, shortly after the signing of the Munich agreement in September 1938.</p>

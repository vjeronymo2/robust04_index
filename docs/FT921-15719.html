			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Siren voices on the ERM FT-SE Index: 2,482.9 (-10.3) Background noise about UK membership of the ERM is plainly not going away. Yesterday brought a fresh appeal from a group of UK monetarist economists to quit the system entirely and revert to domestic monetarist policies, presumably along the lines of the early 1980s. Such agitation is relevant to the markets insofar as it puts pressure on sterling. Beyond that, the question is how far it belongs to the realm of the practical. It is in principle self-evident that sound money is not desirable at any price: if, for instance, it were to reduce the UK to a permanently depressed region. But there are only four basic options. The UK can leave the ERM on the terms suggested by the monetarists, preferably with the addition of an independent UK central bank. But the monetarism of a decade ago remains deeply unfashionable; as for central bank independence, it is viewed with hostility by the Treasury. Second, the UK can revert to the older native tradition of inflation tempered by devaluation. But the stop-go policies of the 1970s are more unfashionable again. This leaves only two practical options, both of which involve staying in. The first is to tough things out at the original central rate, the logic being that since the ERM is designed to be painful it might as well get on with it. To devalue would be only to buy time until UK inflation brought the pain back. The second is to devalue anyway, on the grounds that time is worth buying until the mismatch between the UK and German economies is less extreme. The obvious snag about the second is that it weakens faith in sterling while retaining the obligation to defend it, thus raising the theoretical possibility of higher interest rates again. A possible way out would be the perception by other ERM members that German monetary stringency is here to stay, leading to an agreed revaluation by the D-Mark later in the year. But that has to be a matter of genuine consensus. The practical likelihood is that the Tories, for better or worse, will have to fight an election on the present terms.</p>

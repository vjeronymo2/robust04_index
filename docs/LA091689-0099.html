			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGASSI WITHDRAWS FROM L.A. EVENT  </P> <P> Andre Agassi withdrew from next week's Volvo/Los Angeles tournament Friday,  citing a strained muscle in his right leg.  </P> <P> The sore leg caused the No. 5-ranked Agassi to default to Tim Wilkison in an  exhibition at Amelia Island, Fla., in the second set of their match Wednesday  night. Agassi, who reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open, said he hurt his  leg in his quarterfinal match with Jimmy Connors.  </P> <P> Agassi also said he aggravated the injury when he played Mats Wilander in an  exhibition, Tuesday night at the new Assn. of Tennis Professionals headquarters  in Ponte Vedra, Fla.  </P> <P> "I've been told several times that it's the sort of injury that only gets worse  (with use)," Agassi said. "I don't want it to cost me four months of tennis."  </P> <P> Agassi, 19, was a finalist in last year's Volvo/Los Angeles tournament, where  he lost to Mikael Pernfors. He joins Johan Kriek (elbow), Dan Goldie (leg) and  Jim Grabb (back) as withdrawals because of injury.  </P> <P> Qualifying for four spots in the $420,000 event is this weekend at the L.A.  Tennis Center at UCLA. The Volvo/Los Angeles tournament, which awards $59,500  to the winner, has a field that includes Mats Wilander, Michael Chang, Brad  Gilbert, Tim Mayotte, Aaron Krickstein, Kevin Curren, Christo van Rensburg and  Pernfors.

The National Association of Open  Market Institutions claims that investment in bank deposit  certificates dropped by $2.2 billion, while according to the  National Association of Investment and Development Banks fund  investment dropped by $1.5 billion. In turn, savings deposits  grew by $1.5 billion. The investment drop was caused by  increased demand for black market dollars, which according to  the ING Bank accounted for a drain of $800 million in the first  half of June. Open market institutions themselves have also  increased their government security purchases. This drop in  traditional investment sectors, which amounts to 0.5 percent of  GDP, is considered to be a consequence of the currency change  scheduled for 1 July.

(Sao Paulo FOLHA  DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21 Jun 94 Section 1 p 10)  <H5>  IMPORT TAXES </H5>   President Itamar Franco has reduced to zero the 25 percent  of  the Financial Operations Tax that companies installed in Brazil  had to pay to import technology. Franco's decree was published  in the 22 June issue of the DIARIO OFICIAL. According to Jose  Roberto D'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the National Institute  of Industrial Property, this decree will stimulate the purchase  of foreign technology. The decision to reduce this tax to zero  was based on reports by the ministers of finance and of  industry, commerce, and tourism. Last year, Brazil paid $240  million abroad for patent permits, brands, technical assistance,  and technology transfer. Gusmao added that this amount is too  small for a country such as Brazil, and shows that the companies  were evading taxes.

In practice this represents stability in  the employment levels, with a 0.01 percent variation.

According to the Varig board,  Pluna will pay Varig for administering the company. Varig  President Rubel Thomas said that this proof of Varig's strength  in the Latin American market will make the Export-Import Bank  sensitive to the company's reorganization plan, which involves  leasing operations.

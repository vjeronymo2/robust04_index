The  new chairman declared that the Non-Party Reform Bloc was in  opposition to the government but not in opposition to all its  proposals.    The General Assembly granted the title of BBWR Honorary  Member to President Lech Walesa.    Addressing a press conference after the meeting Religa  declared that the BBWR association can be expected to become  before its first congress in May "one of the two strongest  political organizations in Poland". He announced that he will  present the bloc's political assumptions on January 22.    Religa also said that Lech Walesa will be the bloc's  candidate in the next presidential elections "if he decides to  run". If not, the bloc will try to put forth its own candidate,  too. Religa stressed that the BBWR association is not "a  presidential association for a concrete person but one of its  main features is the support for a presidential-parliamentary  system."    According to Religa the BBWR association may become  transformed into a political party in the future but at present  the formula of an association is the most convenient since it  allows to unite people of different views for the purpose of  reforming the country.    Religa announced that Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  declared his will to join the BBWR association but that he will  not hold any posts in it.    Asked by journalists whether his political activity did not  interfere with his professional duties, Religa replied that it  did but stressed that "in Poland it will not be proper for a  long time yet to avoid politics."    "I think it to be my duty and an absolutely justified thing  to engage in politics," he said. He said that the clinic in  Zabrze which he is heading performs some 600 open heart  surgeries and he himself makes some 150 surgeries every year.    The BBWR association's members are grouped in 121 circles  throughout Poland.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cho Se-hyon] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- As talks between North  Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on  nuclear inspection are making slower progress than expected,  senior South Korean Government officials are expressing concern  that the negotiations may break up.    Both the United States and South Korea had expected the  North  Korea-IAEA talks to proceed smoothly, if not rapidly, because of  the hopeful note sounded by the North Korean-U.S. working  level-contacts in New York last month. But as the North  Korean-IAEA negotiations go nowhere session after session,  senior U.S. and South Korean officials are running out of  patience and becoming increasingly restless.    Reflecting their feelings, perhaps, Washington and Seoul  urged Pyongyang in recent days to accept IAEA inspection of its  nuclear facilities and warned that time is running out for North  Korea.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday that  a decision will be made in two to three weeks by the United  States on whether it will hold dialogue with North Korea.    Han's remark, made at a public gathering, was seen by many  as  an indication that the situation has indeed become serious since  Han represents the body of opinion that was counseling continued  dialogue for a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.    The time frame of "two to three weeks" was apparently  mentioned with the Feb. 21 IAEA Board of Governors' meeting in  mind. The foreign minister must have been aware also of North  Korean "dear leader" Kim Chong-il's birthday (Feb. 16) when he  made the remark.    Han was understood to have hinted that the North Korean  nuclear problem has to be brought to the United Nations Security  Council unless IAEA inspection is carried out in two to three  weeks.    Given the time for the IAEA to prepare for inspection, Han  appeared to be stressing that North Korea and the IAEA could not  keep holding fruitless negotiations for much longer.    Many questions are being asked in Vienna, Washington and  Seoul as to why the North Korean-IAEA talks were not making any  progress, but few clear answers were emerging.    Judging by the statements made by responsible officials so  far, the main cause for disputes between Pyongyang and the IAEA  stems from the fact that the United States and North Korea  concluded their working-level contacts without firmly spelling  out the type and scope of the IAEA inspection on seven reported  North Korean facilities.    North Korea is said to be arguing with the IAEA, questioning  the connection between the IAEA's demand for an inspection of  all seven reported facilities and maintaining continuity for  nuclear safeguards.    At any rate, no one is sure why North Korea is delaying its  agreement with the IAEA as Pyongyang has nothing to gain by its  actions.    The prevailing opinion among South Korean Government  officials is that North Korea is reluctant to agree to the IAEA  inspection because of "internal necessity," or because it wants  to squeeze more concessions from the United States.    Others speculate that North Korea cannot afford to "use up  all of its nuclear cards" by accepting IAEA ad hoc and routine  inspections before it has managed to obtain a U.S. nod for the  establishment of diplomatic ties between Pyongyang and  Washington.    As for those who advance the theory of "internal necessity,"  they say North Korea might be taking its time to persuade  hardliners, especially the military, to accept outside  inspection.    By delaying negotiations with the IAEA, they say, Pyongyang  probably wants to boast, both at home and abroad, that it did  not succumb to foreign pressure and thus was able to obtain U.S.  agreements to suspend the Team Spirit military exercise with the  South and to hold a third round of high-level talks with  Washington for improvement of bilateral relations.    Those who argue that North Korea does not want to use its  nuclear card believe that Pyongyang is delaying its negotiations  with the IAEA in order to wrench from it as many concessions as  possible, while leaving unresolved questions for the third round  of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks.    Although South Korean officials watching the developments  are  running out of patience, they could still be described as being  "guardedly optimistic about the outcome of the North Korea-IAEA  talks," for they know it is North Korea's style to always push  an issue to the brink before making a dramatic turnaround at the  last moment.</p>

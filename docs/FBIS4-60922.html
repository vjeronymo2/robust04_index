			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Demidenko, Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 1 May TASS--leader of Ukrainian Communists Petr  Simonenko, running for the Ukrainian presidency, withdrew his  candidature following a two-hour confidential meeting with  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, a high-ranking official of  the Ukrainian president's administration told ITAR-TASS today.  However, he declined to give details of the meeting, saying  that it was "secret."    It was not ruled out that Simonenko's step was a result of a  thoroughly planned policy of opposition to the Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk and was aimed at consolidating voters  in favour of a leader of a Socialist Party, Aleksandr Morozov.  The move was apparently made to take advantage of the obvious  disappointment of the Ukrainian population in the present  leadership and its failure to ensure normal life in the country.    Apart from Leonid Kravchuk, taking part in the presidential  race are Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch, Prime  Minister Leonid Kuchma, Vice-Premiers Vladimir Lanovoy and  Viktor Pinzenik, Education Minister Petro Talanchuk and one of  the leaders of the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs, Valeriy  Babich.    Ivan Plyushch is said to stand the best chance of being  elected as a supporter of concentrating executive power in the  hands of one person within a system of soviets as a form of  state system.    If Kravchuk fails to postpone elections, he will find it  difficult to remain in his post.</p>

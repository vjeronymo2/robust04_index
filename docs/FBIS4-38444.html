			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The launch of the next Mir  crew has been postponed, as Colonel General Vladimir Ivanov,  commander of Russia's Military Space Forces, has confirmed.  According to unofficial information, the launch has had to be  postponed because of a hold-up in testing the nose fairing on  the Soyuz spacecraft: The fairing covers the craft during the  launch when the rocket is going through the Earth's atmosphere.  TM-19 was initially due to blast off on 20 June; now the  possibilities of carrying out a launch on the 29 or 31 June are  being examined. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: AG down 5% as UK sales fall AG Holdings, the Doncaster-based cable reel maker, reported pre-tax profits down 5 per cent at Pounds 2.76m for the year to July 31, against Pounds 2.91m. The company blamed a second half reduction in demand from the UK cable companies, its largest customers. The acquisition of a 67 per cent stake in EMS, the French cable drum maker, was completed in June, too late to have an impact. Turnover was Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 15.9m),including Pounds 1.37m from acquisitions. Earnings per share were 10.6p (11.4p). A final dividend of 3.25p is proposed for a total of 5.5p (2p). Mr Richard Battersby, chairman, said turnover for the first two months of the current year was up 9 per cent but margins had come under pressure.</p>

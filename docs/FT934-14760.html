			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Israelis urged to free Palestinians ISRAELI and Palestinian peacemakers hammered out a comprehensive agenda on security and civilian issues to implement a framework peace agreement yesterday and set up a sub-committee to decide the fate of up to 11,500 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners, Julian Ozanne reports from Taba. On the second day of talks at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, the Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, pressed the Israelis for the quick release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israelis agreed to establish a sub-committee to deliberate on prisoners, deportees and fugitives. Both sides agreed an agenda for the talks, which resume in Taba next Wednesday, but refused to make it public. Among the items known to be on the agenda are the smooth transfer of power from the Israeli military administration in the occupied territories to a Palestinian authority; the territorial delimiting of the Jericho area which Israeli troops will quit; and the timetable for Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Yakovleva report: "Can Russia Get By Without </F> Importing Grain? We Will Know the Answer in the Fall"]    [Text] Will Russia be buying grain abroad this year or  will it make do with its own resources?    Despite the frequent statements by Vice Premier Aleksandr  Zaveryukha to the effect that there are enough grain reserves in  the country to enable us to do without imports, this issue is  keeping Western business circles in a state of tension.    For example, the British weekly PUBLIC LEDGER has stated  that  "some Russians" made an appearance on the U.S. market at the  beginning of May and "intimated that they require grain  immediately" (250,000 tonnes of durum wheat and 150,000 tonnes  of soft wheat). These Russians were Leonid Cheshinskiy,  president of the "Roskhleboprodukt" RKK [expansion unknown], and  Aleksandr Belik, president of the "Eksportkhleb" Joint-Stock  Company.    Petr Tolstopyatenko, deputy director of the "Zerno" firm  (the  former Main Administration for Grain Purchases) confirmed that  this trip did take place, but it does not provide an answer to  the question of whether or not Russia will import grain. It is  impossible to give an answer to this question until spring  sowing has been completed, which will not be before 1 June at  the earliest. In his opinion, the prospects for the Russian  harvest are good: Crops sown in the fall have wintered well,  and the area sown in the spring is getting bigger without any  exhortations or goading, since the production of this sort of  wheat is highly profitable.    According to Tolstopyatenko, the country possesses both  "emergency" state reserves of grain (approximately 18 million  tonnes) and nonstate reserves. Thus, kolkhozes and sovkhozes  have been holding 700,000 tonnes of wheat in storage at their  elevators since last harvest. There are reserves of millet for  making course-ground millet, oats, and corn for making groats.  So rumors about the need for immediate supplies have been  exaggerated, most likely by the Western press. At least, Leonid  Cheshinskiy did not recognize himself in the story as it was  portrayed by the Western press.    Andrey Sizov, general director of the "SovEkon" research  center, explained that L. Cheshinskiy and A. Belik did indeed  visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the beginning of May  and asked the price of U.S. grain. But they were talking about  a commercial deal rather than state purchases. The independent  firm "Roskhleboprodukt," pursuing its private interests, wanted  to buy 400,000 tonnes of wheat for its own money without taking  out government loans to do so, which used to be the norm.    Asked why the corporation should wish to purchase grain  abroad when, according to A. Zaveryukha, reserves of home-grown  grain total 18 million tonnes and there is probably even more  stored away in kolkhoz barns, Andrey Sizov replied that the  corporation is doubtless making preparations for a coming grain  price war. This very day the Russian Agriculture Ministry  announced that agricultural producers are asking 180,000-200,000  rubles per tonne of grain. If the high cost of transportation  and storage is added to this, Russian grain could work out more  expensive than grain from overseas: The Russians were offering  the Americans grain at $100 a tonne (including freight). All  the indications are that "Roskhleboprodukt" is looking for a  cheap commodity to beat down the price of grain from the new  harvest on the Russian market.    It is true that the Americans did not sell their grain at  $100 a tonne, thinking this to be too cheap. But there is also  the European market, where grain is traditionally more expensive  while transportation is cheaper.    In Andrey Sizov's opinion, "Roskhleboprodukt's" emergence on  the world market as an independent commercial organization is  well timed: The state would be obliged to purchase U.S. grain  since it is bound by credit relations. But the fact that the  market can be exploited is in itself gratifying.    And so A. Zaveryukha's assurances remain valid, he is  responsible for state reserves and has the right to draw his own  conclusions. The "Roskhleboprodukt" corporation has announced  its presence in the world market on the basis of its own  commercial interests, the harvest forecasts will be clarified at  the beginning of June, and we will get a precise answer to the  question of whether our country can do without grain imports in  the fall.    According to data from "SovEkon," the chances of exporting  Russian grain abroad are not very great. For example, the  country has small rye reserves, but rye is not much in demand on  the world market.    Reorienting ourselves toward imports from CIS countries is  also an unreliable option: Last year our trading partner  Kazakhstan delivered 1 million tonnes of grain under the  intergovernmental agreement instead of the promised 3 million  tonnes. Judging by the weather and fuel problems that have been  dogging the Kazakh harvest, supplies are unlikely to increase  this year.</p>

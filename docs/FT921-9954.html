			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Private View: One woman's crusade for the world's dispossessed - Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, explains her mission WHAT can one small woman do for the 17m people in this world who are refugees from war, persecution or man-made disaster? Quite a lot, is the answer, if that woman's name is Sadako Ogata. Mrs Ogata, a Japanese professor of international relations, became United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees a year ago. It was a baptism of fire  -her first task in the aftermath of the Gulf war was to organise protection for Iraqi citizens, in their own country, from their own rulers. Born into the top drawer of Japanese society, she is well connected both at home - she is a friend of the Empress - and abroad. Her father and grandfather were diplomats. She was educated partly in the US. Her husband, Shijuro, was deputy governor of the Bank of Japan and of the Japan Development Bank and has just been appointed one of the first non-British directors of Barclays. Their son makes avant-garde videos and their daughter is a banker. I asked Mrs Ogata whether she felt she had got to grips with the job. 'Yes, I think I have. But it's been a very difficult year because the refugee problem's kind of burst out all over.' She arrived at the agency's headquarters in Geneva with the reputation of possessing a formidable intellect, a strict sense of obligation, determined self-effacement and a complete lack of political guile. It sounds an intimidating combination. Yet even during our short encounter her warmth and gentle humour floated to the surface. Her staff adore her. They like the way, when she is in Geneva, she eats in the cafeteria and encourages them to chat. They are impressed by her energy in the field, her attention to the smallest detail, her accurate memory, her stamina, her easy way with people. During her visit to the Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand she took the trouble to reassure families who were worried about being parted from their pet dogs during repatriation. Mrs Ogata sympathised: she has a dog herself, a Yorkshire terrier called Christopher, which she has had to leave behind in Tokyo. 'I travel, I go into the field because I have to get a sense of reality of what the needs are,' she told me. 'I personally have to have that sense of reality.' Was this a job you wanted? 'I was pleased to get it but I never wanted it. I thought after I got it about all the things I have done in the past and how I could bring them together. That I did think. But I never wanted the job.' What did you want to do? 'I'm a very practical person, and really I meet challenges as they come.' So you are not a long-term career planner? 'No, I've never planned anything.' I asked her whether her previous work on human rights for the UN had given her a strong sense of engagement, and whether the fact that she is a Roman Catholic was relevant. 'Maybe, yes. I think there is a Catholicness, a Japaneseness, there's a womanness, the fact that I am somebody who has lived through a big war, and a defeat. These are all big personal experiences. And my involvement in the UN with human rights . . . All these things come together. I cannot say any one is dominant.' Before your election your friends said it would be good for the UN to have a Japanese and a woman. Do you agree now? 'Yes, I agree with that.' What reasons would you give? 'In the first case, Japan has done a lot financially in contributing but somehow there has not been a Japanese person as much in the forefront as there should have been. This brings Japan much closer to international co-operation; it also brings the Japanese people into it.' Her appointment has encouraged a big increase in private donations for refugees from Japanese business and other groups. What about your being a woman? Does a woman bring something different to an organisation? 'You'd better ask my colleagues. I bring myself. I don't know if a woman necessarily brings something. I never thought of it that way.' But for the public to see a woman at the head of a humanitarian agency might make some sort of good connections? 'Maybe they think women are a bit more humanitarian.' As mothers? 'Motherhood, compassion, all those things.' What about male politicking in large organisations? Is a woman able to cut through a lot of that? 'I'm a pretty organised person and I like to run meetings in a rather structured way. Whether that is a manly way or a womanly way, I don't know.' Mrs Ogata hates talking about herself but was too courteous to say so. She was dressed in a smart tweed suit with several strands of little pearls around her neck. Although I had been told she scarcely ever had time to go to a hairdresser,, her grey hair was perfectly waved. She was quite unruffled. I asked her whether she had been able to bring a fresh analysis to bear on the refugee problem. 'I don't know whether I would claim that much. But we must be aware that there is a wide range of migratory movements. Refugees are just one of them. There is immigration, foreign workers, there are all sorts of reasons why people are moving. To understand the significance or the danger of what we are facing we have to know the whole range. We should also come up with much more diverse answers.' Was she was worried by resurgent racism in Europe? 'Right now most of the people who come to Europe come as asylum-seekers when their need is not necessarily asylum but getting jobs. We should clarify, otherwise the institution of asylum itself is affected and undermined. People are now talking about 'true refugees' and 'false refugees'. This is a very wrong way of dividing them.' You mean even the terminology can be damaging? 'The terminology is very, very damaging. There are refugees and there are other migrants. So long as they are all lumped together as refugees we can't get anywhere.' She is worried that a less liberal Europe, including Britain, could undermine one of her agency's strongest supports. She pointed out that Europe and North America still harboured only about 12 per cent of the world's refugees. Most of the burden was carried by developing countries. 'In that sense they are doing a wonderful job when they are poor themselves.' Heads of UN agencies are traditionally reluctant to point the finger. Are you prepared to take a higher profile? 'Well, I think I have taken some clear stands from time to time, yes.' (She has called for emergency aid for Albania and this week she reprimanded the US for sending back Haitian boat people.) 'But just pontificating is not what we should be doing. If we are going to criticise then we will have at the same time to offer some kind of help.' Do you find the UN inefficiently bureaucratic? 'Oh, it depends. But it doesn't affect my work. That is not a problem.' Is your agency free of it? 'No, I think there are some bureaucratic aspects to my agency, too, in the decision-making procedures. Clearing a position takes a lot of time. But I make sure that it's not for bureaucratic reasons that we do not act when we have to act. In emergencies we are pretty good.' We have heard a lot about a new world order. Has your agency benefited from this new reinforcement of the UN ideal? 'I think we have benefited in that a lot of work has come to us, even in Yugoslavia where there are half a million internally displaced people - in a European country. 'The international community expects the UN to do much more. The big wars have probably gone but there are going to be a lot of internal wars and unrest in which the UN is expected to carry out peacemaking, peace-keeping and humanitarian work.' So even if the situation is grim in many countries, the impetus behind the UN may be quite high? 'Quite high, yes. It is grim, but there are also some good parts. With the Cold War ending, many conflicts are entering into the solution phase, like Cambodia or Angola, South Africa, Afghanistan. 'Wherever there is peace, those who fled the conflict are ready to go back. So we are expected to play a very large role in repatriation.' (The agency is projecting that 3m people will be voluntarily repatriated this year alone.) 'I think in '92 and '93 there will be a concentration of repatriations of a kind we have never had before.' My half-hour was up. I remembered being told that Sadako Ogata, though 64 now and not much more than 5 ft tall, is a good tennis player. One last question, I said. How is the tennis? 'I play on weekends whenever I can. This job is a very - shall I say - hard job and you have to keep up your physical stamina. So I try to maintain athletic interests. Also,' she smiled sweetly, 'I like tennis.'</p>

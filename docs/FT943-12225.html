			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Second-term profits up strongly at Goodyear Goodyear, the US tyre group, lifted net earnings in the second quarter by more than 18 per cent to Dollars 163.2m, or Dollars 1.08 a share. The result represents a solid improvement on the corresponding period of 1993, when profit was Dollars 137.6m, or 95 cents a share, excluding a charge of Dollars 14.6m for the early retirement of debt. The company sustained its earnings momentum despite the continued sluggishness of the world economy, as reflected in its almost static top line. In the second three months of the year, revenues inched ahead to Dollars 3.05bn, up from Dollars 3bn in the year-earlier quarter. Unit sales of tyres climbed 3 per cent, compared with a 12 per cent growth rate in the first quarter of 1994. Sales to unaffiliated customers in Europe, the company's second biggest market outside the US, declined almost 4 per cent to Dollars 561.5m. Conditions in Turkey were cited as particularly difficult. The downturn was partly offset by modest gains in North America, Latin America and Asia. Revenues in the US, up 1.6 per cent, grew at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter, when North American motor vehicle output had expanded at an exceptionally rapid pace. In Asia, sales surged 15.8 per cent as new production capacity came on stream in Thailand. For the six months to June 30, net income reached Dollars 279.2m or Dollars 1.85 a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.96bn. The figures compare with profits of Dollars 138.4m, or 96 cents, on revenues of Dollars 5.81bn in the first half of 1993. Goodyear's stock closed down  7/8 at Dollars 35 1/2 in New York.</p>

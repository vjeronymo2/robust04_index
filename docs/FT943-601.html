			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Henkel to be president of German industry body Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel, who resigned unexpectedly three weeks ago as European head of International Business Machines, the US computer manufacturer, will be elected president of the Federation of German Industry in November. He is sole candidate for the post, considered to be the most important and influential in German industry. Mr Klaus Asche, chief executive of the Hamburg-based Holsten Brewery, had been the frontrunner for the job but stepped down when Mr Henkel declared an interest. Mr Henkel is believed to have been the unanimous choice of the Federation's seven vice-presidents, each representing an important sector of German industry. The Federation (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie or BDI), however, is smarting from what it sees as the indifference of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's administration towards German industry. The organisation has sought to get politicians to lobby harder for German companies on trips abroad, pointing to the contracts won by British and French companies who have enjoyed more political support. Mr Henkel's election is seen as a move to give the organisation a sharper edge. The appointment should also dampen speculation that he left IBM, recovering after several years of losses, because of disagreements with Mr Lou Gerstener, IBM chairman, over corporate strategy. Observers questioned whether IBM's new structure, which emphasises commercial sectors over country management, would have weakened his authority. Mr Henkel has told analysts that such speculation was nonsense, pointing out that he will remain chairman of IBM Germany after taking up the BDI presidency on January 1. Mr Henkel, 54, takes over from Mr Tyll Necker, who is stepping down after a third two-year term. Mr Necker, 64, came to the rescue of the organisation after Mr Heinrich Weiss, his predecessor, left - furious that the BDI was being paid so little attention. The BDI's determination to choose a leader with clout is underlined by Mr Henkel's atypical background. He has been neither head nor owner of a large German company and will be the first senior executive from an international company to hold the post. He has already built a reputation in Germany for decisive action by taking IBM out of the nationwide collective wage talks run by the IG Metall Union, and by introducing Sunday working, an example of workplace flexibility which is almost unheard of in Germany. In contrast, Mr Necker, head of a Mittelstand company making cleaning machinery, was known as a man who preferred a less confrontational approach. Yesterday it became known that Mr Henkel has also accepted the post of chairman of the Berlin airports authority, a job which will also wield considerable political influence.</p>

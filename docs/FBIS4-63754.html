			<p>BFN     [Text] Beginning 1 June and prior to the actual  unification of monetary systems of Belarus and Russia, all  settlements on the territory of Belarus will be implemented in  Belarusian rubles. A resolution of the Board of the Belarusian  National Bank on this issue indicates that such a step is  prompted by the length of the interim period in the unification  of monetary systems of both states. An official exchange rate  will be introduced for the Russian ruble, by which Belarusian  banks and other economic entities should be guided.</p>

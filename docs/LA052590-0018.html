			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT HOLDOUT, 79, RETREATS TO HANGAR NOOK  </P> <P> Roger Keeney, who has run Acme Aircraft Co. at Torrance Municipal Airport since  1945, on Thursday moved a splintered wooden propeller and some ancient airplane  manuals out of a small stucco building the city plans to tear down.  </P> <P> His aircraft scales and other equipment had been moved earlier. All that was  left was a telephone, a bare desk and two model airplane mobiles. Soon they  would be gone, too.  </P> <P> With resignation and more than a little nostalgia, the 79-year-old Keeney,  whose firm once occupied 2 1/2 acres and had 50 employees repairing and  refurbishing aircraft, has given up his struggle to keep operating out of his  office, now sandwiched between new city-built hangars.  </P> <P> "I just hit a stone wall and I'm bouncing off it," said Keeney, whose operation  over years was reduced to weighing aircraft, a procedure required by federal  aviation regulations.  </P> <P> "I had no choice. The city owns the property and the city wanted the property,  and my lease had expired."  </P> <P> Torrance and Keeney have been at odds since 1987, when the city put him on a  month-to-month lease and told him he eventually would have to make way for 74  hangars as the airport was redeveloped.  </P> <P> All but two of the hangars have been built for some time. The city lost  patience with Keeney, refused to accept his rent checks and sued to evict him  more than a year ago.  </P> <P> Keeney paid $4,670.64 in back rent Monday and agreed to move out. Still to be  settled is whether he must also pay for demolishing the office building and a  small shed.  </P> <P> If he wants to stay at the airport, the city told Keeney, he must either build  himself a new facility or merge with another airport business.  </P> <P> The cost of building is prohibitive for a small operation, he said, and while  he seems easygoing, Keeney is not the type to share his secrets with a  competitor. "I will not show them," he said.  </P> <P> The inventive Keeney may have found a third way.  </P> <P> When the city began its campaign to oust him, Keeney said, he increasingly took  his business on the road. He would fly or drive with his scales to other  airports to weigh planes, he said.  </P> <P> "I weigh very few of them here," he said. "Someone calls. I say, 'I'll come.' I  tack something on for travel."  </P> <P> All he needs at the Torrance airport is a desk, some files, a telephone and  storage space for the scales. Everything but the telephone has been installed  in a loft built into one of two hangars that he rents for his two Cessnas.  </P> <P> Because leases at the airport specify that hangars are to be used only for  aircraft storage, Keeney was reluctant to call his new setup an office.  </P> <P> "Not really," he said, "because the city says I can't have an office."  </P> <P> With a grin, he said all that is here "is a free-standing card table. . . . I  don't want to retire. It's too much fun here."  </P> <P> William Quale, Torrance assistant city attorney, laughed when he heard Keeney's  description of the loft space.  </P> <P> "Hangars are for storing aircraft," he said. "I hesitate to comment on that."  </P></p>

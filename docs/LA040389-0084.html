			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: SCUBA INSTRUCTOR HELPS THE HANDICAPPED DIVE RIGHT IN  </P> <P> Jim Gatacre of San Clemente once dreamed about having a scuba-diving school  where handicapped people -- amputees, the blind and quadriplegics -- could  learn the joys of the sport.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, people weren't accepting the idea and were saying that  paraplegics can't dive," said Gatacre, who became handicapped in a freak  accident.  </P> <P> He proved them wrong. In the past several years, his nonprofit diving school  has certified more than 40 handicapped students and nearly 140 diving  instructors in 14 states and nine countries.  </P> <P> Gatacre's life changed one morning in 1972 when his right arm suddenly was  paralyzed. After sleeping on it for 12 hours straight, he had damaged several  nerve endings.  </P> <P> After the injury, he said, "I was trying to decide who I was. I felt physically  unacceptable. Opening a can of soup was even hard for me. "  </P> <P> After 6 months of therapy, Gatacre, then a biology student, recovered about 60%  of the use of his arm. To help overcome the mental strain, he took scuba-diving  lessons and got his diving certification.  </P> <P> Soon after, in 1974, Gatacre came up with the idea of teaching scuba-diving as  a fun and therapeutic sport for other handicapped people. That year, he and a  UC Irvine professor organized a pilot project teaching diving to handicapped  students. The project continued for 3 years.  </P> <P> In 1981, Gatacre decided to form his own school, the Handicapped Scuba Assn.  Since then, he has taught scuba-diving to amputees, victims of paralysis and  cerebral palsy, the blind and the mentally handicapped.  </P> <P> Although he has a full-time job as a salesman for a small roofing company,  Gatacre now travels most weekends of the year teaching classes around the  country and world. In October, Gatacre and his wife Patricia set up a one-room  office in San Clemente, but they still find themselves working but still find  themselves working most of their nights at home.  </P> <P> The classes provide scuba instructors with specialized medical knowledge to  teach handicapped people to dive. The instructors also simulate various  handicaps, from blindness to useless limbs.  </P> <P> For Julie Mora, 30, who has been in a wheelchair since youth due to a  neurological disorder, Gatacre's encouragement made the difference between  success and failure.  </P> <P> Mora, of Santa Barbara, said she had a bad experience with another school  unfamiliar with handicapped people.  </P> <P> "I kept flipping over and swimming upside down. It was real hard," she said.  But when Gatacre "saw me start turning to one side, they knew to make some  adjustments and that I'd be OK.  </P> <P> "Jim said to me, 'You'll be able to do it, just give it time.' And I thought,  'Never.' But after giving it some time I was able to swim on my own."  </P> <P> John Cantrell of Eureka, who has had cerebral palsy since youth, also made  frequent trips from his home to a swimming pool in San Juan Capistrano and the  beaches in Laguna Beach to participate in Gatacre's scuba-diving classes  because he couldn't find other instructors who were equipped to teach him. His  wife, Julie, who is blind, also received instruction from Gatacre.  </P> <P> "Having Jim behind us was the only thing that helped us pull through all the  classes," said Julie Cantrell. "We spent so much money on phone bills (from  Northern California) to get advice, support and coaching from him. . . . We  couldn't have done it without him."  </P></p>

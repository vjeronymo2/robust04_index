			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STREET OF MANY CHANGES  </P> <P> A couple of decades ago, when Rodeo Drive was just another street, it contained  a coffee shop, a gas station and a hardware store, according to old-timers.  </P> <P> These are long gone, of course, but even over the last decade or so, change has  been constant on the street.  </P> <P> Many of the stores that were on Rodeo in the early 1980s have disappeared.  </P> <P> Among stores that have moved on are Right Bank Clothing Co. and Tea Room, Mr.  Guy, Gunn Trigere, Juschi, Elizabeth Arden and Kurt Geiger of Bond St. Ltd.  </P> <P> Some failed and some were driven off by soaring rents, which now range from $75  to $225 per square foot in the Two Rodeo/Via Rodeo development.  </P> <P> Two Rodeo itself made perhaps the most dramatic recent change in the street.  The 1.25-acre project, at the corner of Rodeo and Wilshire Boulevard, gobbled  up a savings and loan office, an exotic-car dealership and a few boutiques.  </P> <P> But, typical of Southern California, most of the site was a parking lot.  </P></p>

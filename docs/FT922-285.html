			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: EC pins blame on Serbia THE European Community agreed at the weekend to step up pressure on Serbia, called for the dispatch of observers to Kosovo and neighbouring countries, and moved a step closer towards granting full recognition to Macedonia. EC leaders, fearing that the war in Yugoslavia will spread to other Balkan countries, said they would not recognise the new federal republic of Serbia and Montenegro as the successor state of the former Yugoslavia until other international institutions had done so, and demanded the suspension of the delegation of the former Yugoslavia at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and other international organisations. At the same time they left open the possibility of force being used by the UN to re-open Sarajevo airport and allow humanitarian supplies to be flown in. In Washington yesterday, President George Bush, who again conferred with EC leaders by telephone, said the US 'will do its part' to see aid was delivered. He said Washington intended to handle the situation in accord with the UN and he declined to comment further on possible US actions. In a further development last night, Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said that the Bosnian-Serb leadership had handed over control of Sarajevo airport to UN peace-keeping forces. This could pave the way for humanitarian aid, although the UN commander in Sarajevo denied later that his troops had full responsibility for the airport yet. The EC declaration firmly pinned blame on Serbia for the continuing violence in Bosnia. 'Although all parties have contributed in their own way (to the fighting), by far the greatest share of responsibility falls on the Serbian leadership and the Yugoslav army controlled by it,' it said. Some EC states, led by France and Italy and followed by Germany, had wanted the Community to adopt more specific measures to ensure emergency supplies could be flown in. Italy argued that force should be used to reopen the airport, while France and Germany pressed for tough action, though they fell short of calling for direct military intervention. Others remained cautious. The British prime minister, Mr John Major, argued that a ceasefire would have to be in force before an airlift could be carried out. In the end leaders agreed the EC would not act alone but back any United Nations initiative. The Community also called for the immediate dispatch of international observers to the Serbian-controlled province of Kosovo and neighbouring countries, to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Under pressure from Greece, EC leaders said they were ready to recognise Macedonia's independence provided it chose a name which did not include the term Macedonia.</p>

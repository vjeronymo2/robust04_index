			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARROLL JUST BARELY THERE FOR NETS IN LOSS  </P> <P> When he played for the Golden State Warriors, Joe Barry Carroll, or J.B. as he  was known then, was referred to by a sportswriter as Just Barely Carroll for  his nonproductive play.  </P> <P> Carroll has switched cities twice since then, but he can't seem to shake his  critics.  </P> <P> Now even his coach is joining in.  </P> <P> New Jersey Net Coach Bill Fitch yanked Carroll after the first six minutes of  play Tuesday night when Carroll failed to produce a rebound, but the Nets still  lost on the road to the Washington Bullets, 110-96.  </P> <P> "As far as I know, he's not hurt," Fitch said of Carroll. "I didn't see any  need to see any more of him out there after the first quarter."  </P> <P> The Bullets also made a change at center, giving Mel Turpin his first start in  four years, replacing Mark Alarie. Turpin responded with 14 points to augment  the efforts of Jeff Malone (23 points) and Bernard King (20) as Washington  broke a five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> "It felt real good," said Turpin, whose last NBA start came in his rookie  season in Cleveland. "They told me this morning. I was surprised, but when they  call your name, you have to answer the call. If you don't think you can play,  you shouldn't be in the league."  </P> <P> Purvis Short scored 18 points, and Sam Bowie and Charles Shackleford added 14  each for New Jersey, now a loser of three in a row and six of its last seven.  </P> <P> Phoenix 113, New York 99 -- The Knicks' nine-game winning streak, matching the  Lakers' high for the season, ended as the Suns became the first team to beat  New York at home this season.  </P> <P> Phoenix guard Kevin Johnson scored 11 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to  help the Suns pull away.  </P> <P> Eddie Johnson scored 22 points and Jeff Hornacek 20 for the Suns, who have won  three of four road games after losing their first seven away from home.  </P> <P> Gerald Wilkins had a season-high 30 points and Patrick Ewing 21 for the Knicks,  12-1 at Madison Square Garden.  </P> <P> Atlanta 113, Milwaukee 107 -- People have been saying Moses Malone was slowing  down since Philadelphia got rid of him nearly four years ago. But here he is,  in the 1990s, still winning games.  </P> <P> He was a key for the Hawks Tuesday, scoring 31 points -- including hitting all  17 of his free throws -- along with 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> His four free throws in the last minute assured the Hawks of a victory at home,  ending the Bucks' five-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Teammate Antoine Carr had a season-high 21 points for Atlanta.  </P> <P> For Milwaukee, Rickey Pierce came off the bench to score 25 points, 19 in the  second half. Jack Sikma added 19 points and Alvin Robertson scored 18.  </P> <P> Detroit 115, Orlando 113 -- After playing surprising .500 ball through the  first month of the season, the expansion team in Orlando is losing some of its  magic and justifying shaky expectations.  </P> <P> The Magic, playing at home, lost for the sixth consecutive time and 14th in the  last 16 games when the Pistons won at the free-throw line. Detroit scored 15 of  its last 17 points on free throws.  </P> <P> The Pistons' Bill Laimbeer had 26 points and Detroit's only field goal in the  last six minutes -- a 15-footer that gave the NBA champions a 111-104 lead with  three minutes left.  </P> <P> James Edwards had 21 points and Joe Dumars added 19 for Detroit, a winner for  the sixth time in seven games.  </P> <P> Otis Smith scored 28 points and Reggie Theus and Terry Catledge had 26 and 22,  respectively, for the Magic.  </P> <P> Orlando put together a 13-7 run to make it close at the end. Smith's layup  trimmed the Pistons' lead to 112-110, but the Magic couldn't get any closer in  the final minute.  </P> <P> The game was marred by eight technical fouls. Orlando's Sidney Green was  ejected after picking up his second.  </P> <P> Dallas 110, Indiana 106 -- Indiana's five-game winning streak ended in Dallas  when Rolando Blackman scored nine first-quarter points and went on to total 29.  </P> <P> In winning for the fifth time in six games, Dallas was up by as many as 18  points before Indiana made it close.  </P> <P> Sam Perkins had 24 points and Derek Harper added 23 for Dallas.  </P> <P> Reggie Miller scored 36 points and Detlef Schrempf contributed 23 for Indiana.  </P> <P> Golden State 133, Utah 120 -- Terry Teagle scored 36 points in the first half  and wound up with a career-high 44 on his home court.  </P> <P> Teagle made 14 of 16 shots from the field in the first half, lifting the  Warriors to a 70-50 lead. At one stretch, Teagle made 12 field goals without a  miss.  </P> <P> The Jazz got 29 points from Karl Malone.  </P> <P> Portland 119, Miami 95 -- Clyde Drexler scored 25 points, including 15 in the  third quarter, as the Trail Blazers handed the Heat its seventh loss in a row.  </P> <P> Kevin Duckworth added 24 points to equal his season high for Portland. Glen  Rice led Miami with 16 points, and Rony Seikaly and Scott Haffner had 14 each.  </P></p>

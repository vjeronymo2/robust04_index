			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Postal staff morale 'at record low' MORALE among Royal Mail employees has reached its lowest level, with nearly 70 per cent of the workforce reporting that they are unhappy at work, according to the findings of an internal employee opinion survey. Uncertainty about jobs and concern about the future of Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, were given by employees as the principal reasons for poor morale. The government has yet to announce whether it will sell the Post Office as one business or split it into its constituent parts - Royal Mail, Parcelforce and Post Office Counters. Whichever course is picked, privatisation is to be delayed at least until the 1994-95 parliamentary session. Mr Jerry Cope, Royal Mail personnel director, said the main results of the survey had 'held up surprisingly well in light of the turbulence Royal Mail has been going through'. He said that, whatever the future held, the organisation 'would strive to avoid compulsory redundancies'. The Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, said poor pay was the root cause of dissatisfaction. In common with other public-sector groups, this year's pay increase for Royal Mail workers will be restricted to 1.5 per cent. The survey, one of the largest of its kind, was sent out to 90,000 employees in March; a further 90,000 questionnaires to the remainder of Royal Mail's staff will be sent out in September. Some 66 per cent of managers and 39 per cent of non-managers responded. While morale declined, satisfaction with Royal Mail as an employer rose 7 percentage points among managers over the past year to 78 per cent. The figure for non-managers remained the same at 70 per cent. Both groups said they thought the first-class letter service had declined in the past year. Management said the result was surprising because 'quality of service is at an all-time high'. A separate internal survey of 5,000 Post Office head office staff found that more than half were dissatisfied with appraisal and promotion systems. A quarter of women questioned said they experienced sexist comments, patronising behaviour and unwanted physical contact.</p>

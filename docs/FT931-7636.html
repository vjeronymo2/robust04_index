			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia-Ukraine gas row boils over THE RISING tension between Russia and Ukraine, by far the largest of the former Soviet states, has been further exacerbated by a bitter row over the payment for and supply of gas . The Russian state gas corporation Gasprom has alleged lack of payment of Rbs165bn (as of Feb 18) for gas supplied since last year - a non-payment which, according to Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gasprom's chairman, has left the company without sufficient funds to meet staff wages. It has threatened to cut off supplies, which would be serious not just for Ukraine but for the European countries - especially Germany - that are highly dependent on Soviet gas. Mr Vyakhirev, quoted by the Interfax news agency, said over the weekend that the gas exports to other countries would continue - though the gas pipeline through Ukraine is highly vulnerable and Ukraine has in the past taken the gas it has needed from it while it was in transit to third countries. More than 90 per cent of gas exported outside the former Soviet borders passes through Ukraine. The two sides have been talking about a new price for gas, but have been unable to agree. Russia has said it wants to switch immediately to world market levels (about Dollars 65 per 1,000 cu metres) but Ukraine has pleaded inability to pay. It has also retaliated by saying that it will charge world level transit fees for the gas crossing its territory. The battle between the two former Soviet states is shaping up to be more serious than that which drove them apart last year - since both are now suffering from increasingly harsh economic climates and have little room to compromise.</p>

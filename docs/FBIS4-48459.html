			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Affirmative action"] </F>   [Text] The device is not new. Directly or implicitly  threaten government intervention if individuals or businesses do  not voluntarily comply with a social engineering objective and  hope the threat alone is sufficient to get compliance.  Companies often give in, but grudgingly and with little  commitment to a strategy that might be necessary for the  national good.    So, when ANC economic adviser Don Mkhwanazi (speaking, of  course, in his personal capacity) threatened dire legislative  action unless business tackled the issue of affirmative action  within 18 months and when the Black Management Forum's Lovemore  Mbigi threatens that an ANC government will enforce racial  employment quotas, the ground is not being laid for a  cooperative approach to addressing the country's skills  shortages.    Well before the election, ANC loose cannons threatened or  promised all manner of things. The result was an understandable  confusion among businessmen trying to discern an ANC party line.  One point remains clear, however: coercion or its threat do not  work. Tangible incentives that benefit companies operating in a  bustling economy succeed more often than not.    Affirmative action is obviously needed if South Africa's  full  human potential is to be realised. But it cannot be achieved by  edict. Affirmative action in the business sector has to be  based on training appropriate, though less-privileged, people in  the skills needed by individual companies.    The main anecdotal drawback for many businessmen is that  trained people are readily lured away from their jobs by other  firms whose affirmative action training programmes have been  inadequate. An easy counter is to compete by paying more. But  when businesses have to comply with racial employment quotas or  under the threat of them, the cost of adding to black employee  numbers is often not of overriding importance.    The application of quotas becomes a certain route to  tokenism. And tokenism is the first step towards endemic  inefficiency.    As a matter of urgency Labour Minister Tito Mboweni must  establish affirmative action principles or guidelines in  discussion with industry and labour. Incentives for training  should be based on appropriate tax breaks even if that gives  rise to bleats from those who believe corporate South Africa is  paying too little tax. Incentives cannot be based on government  hand-outs, but must be designed to take into account the needs  of the individual firms involved in affirmative action  programmes.    Affirmative action, though, will be of little value if  closed  shot arrangements persist. Delivering appropriate training and  jobs to everyone will call for flexibility from unions to allow  jobs seekers to bid wages up or down to their appropriate levels.</p>

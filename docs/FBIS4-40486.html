			<p>BFN     [From the "Kray News" program]    [Text] The Khabarovsk Kray Committee of the Russian  Federation Communist Party adopted two announcements: The first  states that the communists, like all Russians, support friendly  and good neighborly relations with the PRC. At the same time,  the communists believe that the development of Russian-Chinese  relations should be developed while taking into account  interests of the Far East territories and the inviolability of  existing borders. Thus, they fully support the Khabarovsk Kray  administration's position and demand that the Russian Government  renounce the 1991 border agreement as incompatible with existing  realities and signed without coordination with Khabarovsk Kray.  They further demand full and profound talks with China with the  participation of kray representatives.    Another announcement states that lately, some mass media  have  been actively commenting on the situation of DPRK loggers  employed at logging camps in the Far East in accordance with an  agreement signed by the Russian Federation and the DPRK. This  coverage has especially intensified by several steps taken  lately by South Korean authorities and aimed at examining the  so-called human rights question. These acts go as far as the  kidnapping of North Korean loggers from Russian Federation  territory. The kray communist party believes that the South  Korean authorities' actions amount to no less that interference  in the internal affairs of sovereign states who have signed the  appropriate agreements, are completely impermissible in  relations between states, and constitute an attempt to sabotage  the mutually profitable economic relations between Russia and  the DPRK. According to the kray party committee, this  encourages ethnic hostility and confrontation on the Korean  peninsula, which is fraught with many negative consequnences.</p>

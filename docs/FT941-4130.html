			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa returns to black Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurer, rebounded to an operating profit of SKr1.72bn (Dollars 215.3m) in 1993 from a SKr5.14bn deficit the year before. The insurer has left behind huge losses associated with the country's banking crisis and begun to disengage from reinsurance. The result followed a similar turnround announced earlier this week by Skandia, Sweden's other big insurance group. It posted a record operating profit in 1993 of SKr2.01bn. Trygg is to pay a dividend of SKr3.00 per share after suspending the payout last year. The main factor in Trygg's turnround was the non-recurring SKr6.03 loss incurred in 1992, when the group's large holdings in Gota AB, the holding company of state-rescued Gota Bank, and two collapsed credit insurers were written down to zero. However, Trygg also benefited in 1993 from a 77 per cent improvement in its insurance result, which rose to a profit of SKr890m from SKr502m, and a leap in investment income to SKr1.1bn from SKr133m. Trygg said a significant factor in the insurance result was a drop in losses from reinsurance, reached SKr470m in 1992, in part due to the cost of its exposure to Hurrican Andrew. The group stopped writing new reinsurance business in October last year.</p>

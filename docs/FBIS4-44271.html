			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/Cuba: Pope Urges Aid </F> Organization To Break Embargo"]    [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, June 25 -- Pope John Paul II  today called on religious and international aid organisations to  exercise their "inalienable right to assist" Cuba despite the  23-year U.S. embargo against the island.    In a firmly worded appeal against the ban on all trade,  diplomatic relations and other contacts, the pope said it hurt  only the Cuban nation's poorest.    Receiving the Cuban bishops for their five-yearly ad limina  visit to the Vatican, the pope also cited a document written by  them in September urging a national dialogue with the Cuban  Government to steer the country out of its present crisis. In  their document, the prelates urged a liberalisation of Cuba's  politics and economy and also demanded respect for religious and  civil liberties.    The document was published after insistent rumours that the  Cuban Government was seeking Vatican assistance to end the  embargo, offering concessions to local Catholics or even  permission for a papal visit in return.    In June, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina visited Rome  for talks with his Vatican counterpart, Jean-Louis Tauran, but  the Vatican later denied all speculation that he was pressing  for Vatican aid in stopping the embargo in exchange for a visit  that the Pope had said he was keen to make, but the Cuban  Government had previously termed "premature."    The Pope also cited a document approved by the Second  Vatican  Council asserting the church's right to go about its work among  the peoples and to pass moral judgement on political systems as  part of its mission to save souls and defend fundamental human  rights.    The Vatican never broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba  despite difficulties with government policy. When the bishops'  report was published last year, the Cuban Government accused the  Vatican of "betrayal" and "counter-revolutionary action," later  complaining that the church had ignored warnings against  consequences should the report be made public.    Speaking to the bishops today, the pope reiterated his  desire  to visit Cuba and reported on the increasing strength of the  church there without directly mentioning the political situation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a provincial township and town enterprise work  conference convened yesterday, provincial party committee  Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphatically called for actively exploring  new ways of ensuring sustained and high-rate township and town  enterprise growth across the province.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out: Since 1993, the province's  township and town enterprises have extricated themselves from  protracted stagnation and slow growth and started embarking on a  multilevel rapid growth, with the result that their total income  topped 21 billion yuan in 1993, up by 71 percent over the year  before. Moreover, in the January-April period of this year, the  province's township and town enterprises still witnessed  sustained and high-rate growth, with the result that their total  income in the period registered a 67 percent increase over the  corresponding period of last year. The province's total  township and town enterprise income is expected to have topped  33 billion yuan by the end of the year.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: Nevertheless, we should not be  overly optimistic about the existing achievements. Rather, we  should make continued efforts to work hard to secure an average  annual increase of 50 percent or more in the province's township  and town enterprise income. Only by so doing will we be able to  narrow the gap between the country's economically developed  regions and Yunnan Province and bring about a comparatively  comfortable livelihood across the province.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu put forth the following four specific  views on ensuring sustained and high-rate township and town  enterprise growth in the province:    1. It is imperative to further emancipate the mind and  acquire a clearer understanding of the strategic importance of  township and town enterprise development. To this end, all  levels and departments concerned across the province should  strengthen coordination, cooperation, and determination with a  view to securing high-rate township and town enterprise growth  across the province for several years to come and raising  township and town enterprise output value to over 70 percent of  the province's total rural output value. Under no  circumstances, Pu Chaozhu noted, should we err in this regard.    2. It is imperative to seek truth from facts and suit  measures to local conditions. To this end, the province should  first and foremost concentrate on developing several primary  industries with an eye on building about 10 backbone local  industries with output value exceeding 100 million yuan each  over the next seven to 10 years.    3. Deep-going reforms have all along been the motive force  behind sustained and high-rate township and town enterprise  development. The township and town enterprises across the  province should first try to implement a joint-stock system on a  trial basis; ensure compensated transfer to peasants or  collectives of such rights as exploiting, managing, and using  exploitable barren hills, slopes, shores, and fields without  altering the existing ownership system; actively readjust the  ownership system structure; push ahead with individual economic  and private enterprise development; bring about a balanced  growth of state-owned, collective, and individual economies; and  sell, lease, amalgamate, or privatize small state-owned  enterprises in various counties, thereby invigorating this group  of small enterprises and turning them into private enterprises  in terms of ownership and management.    4. It is imperative to strengthen leadership over township  and town enterprises. To this end, party committees and  people's governments should be bold in taking risks, undertaking  responsibility, and proceeding from actual conditions. All  areas across the province should take township and town  enterprise development as an important criterion for appraising  work done by party and government cadres; establish a  responsibility system under which party and government cadres  are required to attain clear-cut goals regarding township and  town enterprise development; award cadres who have contributed  to such development and punish cadres who have failed in pushing  such development forward; and strive to mobilize enthusiasm  among the broad masses of cadres and people of all nationalities  across the province in promoting township and town enterprise  development.</p>

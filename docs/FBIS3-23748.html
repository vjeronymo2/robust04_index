The Novo-Yezhovskaya mine  has been closed, and the end of mining at Degtyarskaya and  Gumeshevskaya is not far away. True, there are promising  deposits in the northern part of the Urals, but geological  prospecting there has been suspended for lack of money.    Against this background, all the more unexpected is the  opening of a new Safyanovskaya mine near the city of Rezh, where  full-scale mining operations have already begun. It is envisaged  that by the end of this year the first tonnes of minerals will  be produced in the new mine.    Not too many people dare these days to begin development of  new deposits. The Safmed AO [joint-stock company], among whose  founders are the Rezh nickel plant and Krasnoyralskiy  Copper-Smelting Combine, several St. Petersburg and Podolsk  enterprises, and the British Mardima company, also have certain  concerns in this regard. As is known, due to rising copper  prices on the domestic market, exports are becoming  unprofitable, while domestic demand at this point is  insignificant.    The Safyanovskiy deposit, however, is one of the biggest.  There are enough deposits of copper and zinc ore there to last  50 years. The mine contains 1 million tonnes of copper alone.  Although in terms of reserves the deposit is smaller than the  famous Udokan, half of the ore can be strip-mined, and at some  sections it is as close as 11 meters below the surface. Besides,  the average content of copper in Safyanovsk ore is 3 percent, in  places as high as 28 percent, although even 1 percent is  considered normal. The deposit is located in an inhabited area  with developed communications. In addition to copper it contains  zinc, sulfur, gold, and silver. The Safmed AO is counting on  delivering to the consumer up to 350,000 tonnes of copper-zinc  ore in 1995. In time the Safyanovskiy pit may replace  Degtyarskiy--the largest deposit, which has been depleted over a  century of exploitation.</p>

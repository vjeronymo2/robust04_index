			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS MARK $26 BILLION FOR CHERNOBYL AID  </P> <P> The Soviet government, allocating $26 billion in additional funds to help the  victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster four years ago, acknowledged on  Sunday that thousands upon thousands of people are still living in areas  dangerously contaminated by radioactive fallout, and even more are eating food  grown in those areas.  </P> <P> Acting amid mounting criticism that it was doing too little too late and thus  compounding the Chernobyl tragedy, the Soviet Council of Ministers approved an  emergency program focused on protecting the safety and health of those in the  affected areas, as many as 3 million to 4 million people, the official news  agency Tass reported.  </P> <P> The new program provides for the urgent resettlement of some of those living in  contaminated areas, improved medical care for those suffering from radiation  illnesses, provision of "clean" food to replace that still being grown in the  radiation zone and greater welfare benefits to the Chernobyl victims,  particularly children and the elderly.  </P> <P> Under the program, which was approved by the Council of Ministers over the  weekend and is scheduled to be submitted this week to the Supreme Soviet, the  country's legislature, a major effort will be made to improve medical services  throughout the affected area and combine them with advanced research on the  treatment of radiation sickness.  </P> <P> Nearly 100,000 people have been resettled as a result of the radiation and the  fallout from the April 26, 1986, explosion. However, many more still live in  the contaminated areas, including 118 villages where radiation levels are eight  times or more greater than the level defined as acceptable by the Soviet  government and some so dangerous that livestock, trees and plants have been  grossly deformed.  </P> <P> Responding to growing criticism here over its estimation -- now regarded as  shockingly low -- of the danger posed by Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear  disaster, the government has also ordered that a comprehensive set of plans be  drawn up by Soviet and foreign specialists for dealing with the accident's  aftermath. The areas include the Ukraine, Byelorussia and neighboring parts of  the Russian republic, according to Tass.  </P> <P> Although larger than anything the government has undertaken since the rescue  and cleanup operation that immediately followed the disaster, the new program  falls far short of what Soviet environmentalists believe is required.  </P> <P> As if to underscore that point, tens of thousands of Ukrainians marched through  the republic's capital of Kiev on Sunday demanding greater efforts.  </P> <P> Speakers at a closing rally called for Ukrainian officials to be put on trial,  including Valentina Shevchenko, now the republic's president and its deputy  premier four years ago, for failing to tell people of the danger and for  failing to take broader emergency actions that both Soviet and foreign  radiation specialists are said to have recommended.  </P> <P> But the march and rally, which drew an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people,  quickly became an expression of resurgent Ukrainian nationalism. Protesters  demanded independence for the republic, chanting "Down with Bolshevism!" and  "Down with Leninism!" and singing the anthem of the Ukrainian forces, which  were defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1920 in the wake of the Russian Revolution.  </P> <P> Further demonstrations are planned for Thursday, the fourth anniversary of the  Chernobyl accident, and a nationally televised charity appeal is planned for  the day to raise funds for its victims.  </P> <P> Concern is growing here that the contamination from Chernobyl is spreading --  with radioactive particles of metal, of dirt, of debris carried by wind,  through the region's rivers and lakes, even through the food chain.  </P> <P> "Radiation struck everything -- food, water, the forests," Alexander Yablokov,  a deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's ecology commission, said after  hearings last week on the aftermath of Chernobyl.  </P> <P> Winds spread the radioactive dust, as did forest fires, he added. Migrating  birds and wildlife carried the radiation and radiation-generated diseases even  farther.  </P> <P> The government's maps of the fallout areas, showing concentrations of strontium  90 and cesium 137, proved inaccurate, Yablokov said, but the real problem was  simply that each element had the rather long half-life, or period of decay, of  about 30 years.  </P> <P> Yuri Shcherbak, another vice chairman of the Supreme Soviet's environmental  commission, estimated earlier this month that more than 4 million people still  live in dangerously contaminated areas and that a 10-year program of medical  care for them, rehabilitation of the environment and further decontamination  would cost a total of $320 billion.  </P> <P> More than 200,000 children are also believed to be living in seriously affected  areas, according to medical officials, and their fate is an increasing worry  for the central government, which fears for the future of the Soviet Union as a  Slavic nation. In March, 51 Ukrainian children were sent to Israel for  treatment of radiation sickness, and more are scheduled to go as part of the  new campaign to focus on the children affected by the fallout.  </P> <P> But the number of people affected is far greater than originally estimated, and  that worries officials attempting to cope with the aftermath and ecologists who  fear even greater damage to the environmental system than now seen.  </P> <P> According to official figures, 31 people died as a result of an explosion and  fire at the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station in the Ukraine in the first few  hours after the blast. But some Soviet officials have suggested that the number  of dead is now more than 250, though this estimate has not been verified by  pathologists.  </P> <P> In Byelorussia, an estimated 118,000 more people must be evacuated from  contaminated areas, according to governmental officials there, and 17,000  should be moved immediately. Only 25,000 people have been resettled since the  disaster.  </P> <P> Lev Maksimov, the ambassador of the Byelorussian republic to the United  Nations, said earlier this month that $28 billion is needed urgently to help an  estimated 2.2 million people in Byelorussia who were directly affected by  Chernobyl's fallout. The Ukrainian government, in a similar appeal for  international assistance, said that 1,614 settlements on its territory should  be evacuated and the residents resettled because of the large concentrations of  radionuclides that have been found in the soil.  </P> <P> According to Shcherbak of the environmental commission, an estimated 1.5  million people, including 160,000 children, received large doses of radon  likely to affect their thyroid glands. Also, there was a sharp increase in  cases of fibrosis, bloated thyroids, cancer of the thyroid and leukemia. And an  immunity deficiency similar to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) has  been found in recent months.  </P></p>

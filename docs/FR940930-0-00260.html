			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Homeownership Counseling Responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before a mortgagor's participation in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure can be approved by the mortgagee, either a HUD-approved counseling agency located in the mortgagor's geographic area, the mortgagee, or the local HUD Office will be available to do the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide mandatory ``homeownership counseling'' to the mortgagor considering the pre-foreclosure sale option. This will include explaining the alternatives available to the mortgagor, including a payment plan negotiated with the lender, foreclosure and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the assignment program (if still an option), and changes in household income, expenses, or composition that might have a bearing on the ability of the mortgagor to retain ownership of the property. The homeownership counseling and certification requirement is contained in &sect;203.370(c)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Advise mortgagors considering a pre-foreclosure sale that they may wish to contact a financial or tax counselor to assess the specific tax consequences (if any) to them of a pre-foreclosure sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Assist in executing certifications for the mortgagors to sign before they can be permitted to participate in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure. These certifications shall include statements that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Homeownership counseling has been received;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The mortgagor understands that any proposed pre-foreclosure sale must be an ``arm's length'' transaction; i.e., a sale between two unrelated parties that is characterized by a selling price and other conditions which would prevail in an open market environment, without hidden terms or special understandings between any of the parties connected to the transaction, including the appraiser, sales agent, closing agent and mortgagee; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the mortgagor has not made application for mortgage assignment, that the assignment program has been explained to him and that he desires to waive any right he has to apply for the program. The provision regarding consideration of (and for) mortgage assignment is contained in 24 CFR 203.370(c)(3). (This waiver applies to assignment rights arising only from his present mortgage default, and only if he is permitted to participate in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Responsibilities of the Real Estate Broker or the Mortgagor's Attorney  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The real estate broker or the mortgagor's attorney should forward to the mortgagee a copy of the contract of sale made conditional upon approval by HUD or the mortgagee, acting under the Secretary's instructions. The contract package should identify the sales commission, and include the necessary certifications (if they are in the broker's or attorney's possession) that have been signed by the mortgagor. The mortgagee will review the package and render a decision within five (5) days of receiving the completed package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Monitoring Responsibilities of HUD Personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The determination by the mortgagee of the mortgagor's eligibility to pursue a pre-foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu, as well as the mortgagee's final approval of a proposed sale, shall be reviewed by the appropriate HUD personnel. These reviews may occur at any time, and will be performed on-site by local HUD office or Headquarters personnel. Mortgagees' submission of data pertaining to individual participants in the PFS procedure, as well as monthly Single Family Default Monitoring System (SFDMS) reports, will also be subject to review. The speed and effectiveness with which mortgagees incorporate the pre-foreclosure sale procedure into their overall servicing techniques will be evaluated on-site during mortgagee reviews conducted by HUD staff. A pre-foreclosure sale component will also be incorporated into HUD's regular claim reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Responsibilities of Mortgagees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Mortgagees will be responsible for implementing correct notification procedures (in particular, sending appropriate notices to defaulting mortgagors and providing information as requested to mortgagors about the PFS procedure).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Mortgagees will be responsible for determining the eligibility of mortgagors to participate in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure, including those whose assignment applications are turned down or for whom the opportunity for assignment has expired or been waived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Mortgagees will be responsible for responsive and timely servicing in taking the necessary steps for, and cooperating with all aspects of, the PFS procedure, including the expediting of sale transactions; the processing of deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure from qualified participants who did not close a pre-foreclosure sale despite a good faith effort; and the timely resumption of appropriate servicing of those loans when participation in the PFS procedure ends and neither a sale nor a deed-in-lieu has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The mortgagee will have the authority, on a case-by-case basis, to determine the mortgagor's participation deadline (up to four months to obtain a signed contract of sale, or up to six months to go to closing) when it determines that granting that period is in the best interest of the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

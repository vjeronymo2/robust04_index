			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Electricity distributors merge retail activities EAST MIDLANDS Electricity and Yorkshire Electricity, two electricity distributors with adjoining markets, are to merge their retailing and appliance servicing operations. The new company, a further sign of consolidation in the electrical business, will be equally owned by the two distributors, and will have a turnover of more than Pounds 125m. It will operate as an independent company based in Normanton, West Yorkshire, with Mr Martin Watts as managing director. The site belongs to Yorkshire and East Midlands will make an undisclosed compensating payment. Mr John Harris, chairman and chief executive of East Midlands, said the merger would yield significant economies of scale with increased distribution efficiency and the centralisation of head offices. He also forecast 'an excellent opportunity to increase margins' thanks to the larger company's stronger purchasing power. But the merger will entail an unspecified number of job losses. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire, said the company would operate through seven out-of-town superstores and more than 100 high street shops. The merger comes shortly after the decision by Midlands Electricity to join the retailing operation formed by Eastern Electricity and Southern Electricity. That business, with 311 shops and a combined turnover of about Pounds 250m, ranks as the UK's third-largest electrical retailing business. Although regional electricity companies are keen to diversify into retailing, many of them have had difficulty making a profit. Yorkshire's business made a modest profit last year after recovering from loss. East Midlands' business made Pounds 1.3m in its last full year.</p>

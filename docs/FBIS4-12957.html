			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F> Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP,  by 'Abdallah al-Yamani; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Yamani] You have announced in the past that  you were being hunted by Sanaa. Do you still have that feeling  or has anything emerged from the accord document?    [Muhammad] Of course. The forces and elements that carried  out bombings and assassinations are still free and unbridled.  They are still tampering with the safety of the citizens. Our  elements are being killed in Ta'izz, Sanaa, and some northern  governorates.    [Al-Yamani] How do the Yemeni people regard the delay in  implementing the document?    [Muhammad] The people are greatly worried because of the  military conditions and tension and because of the security  problems that have not been solved yet. The economic life has  been paralyzed. Work at development projects and elsewhere is  at a standstill. Frankly, the conditions are unsatisfactory to  all.    [Al-Yamani] What are the causes of the armed confrontation?    [Muhammad] The other side's intransigence and the  influential  forces that do not want any satisfactory solution for Yemen.  This intransigence and this mentality has harmed Yemen, the  Yemeni unity, and the supreme interests of the Yemeni people.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Yamani] It is rumored that the Jordanian-Omani role in  pursuing efforts to implement the accord document has been  abandoned now that other Arab sides have entered the arena.  What do you say to that?    [Muhammad] The role of these countries has not been  abandoned  but there is an intensive Arab presence and the Arab brothers  are asked to continue this effort because Yemen is part of the  Arab homeland and Yemen's problems are the problems of the Arab  nation. Helping us is a pan-Arab responsibility and it is the  duty of all the Arab brothers to extricate Yemen from this  crisis which threatens its democratic, unionist march.    [Al-Yamani] Will the resignation of the president solve the  Yemeni crisis?    [Muhammad] The question is not under discussion now. We have  not proposed the resignation yet. No political group has  proposed this because we are looking for common denominators  now. These things could be discussed when such thing happens.  [passage omitted]</p>

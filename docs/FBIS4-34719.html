			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe  Subieta, who will today hear the sentence of their impeachment  in Congress, yesterday announced an international campaign to  file a request for their acquittal before the San Jose de Costa  Rica Human Rights Court.    During a news conference the Supreme Court justices asserted  that a struggle for the "dignity and complete independence of  the judicial branch" has begun, and at the same time they  accepted "serving their imprisonment sentences [as published]  humbly, in the certainty of winning awareness in the Bolivian  court."    The justices, tried by the national Congress' Special Court,  were yesterday feted and honored by the La Paz District Court  alternate members, judges, and administrative personnel in a  simple ceremony that ended in a news conference.    Both Oblitas and Poppe admitted this was the last public  event they would attend in their capacity as justices, as they  announced that the government has decided to sentence them to  the highest penalty established by the Impeachment Law that is  sponsored by the U.S. Embassy.    Oblitas said: "The justices and their lawyers have shown the  country, irrefutably and clearly, that neither of the two have  committed any crime, and that this is an irrational impeachment  seeking only to replace the Supreme Court justices with  subservient justices who will obey the government's orders."

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . . : ELECTRONIC SHORTCUTS TO THE COOK'S RESCUE  </P> <P> One of the microwave oven's hidden bonuses is that it simplifies so many  once-tedious meal preparation and cooking jobs.  </P> <P> The clearing of murky honey, for example. The last-minute ripening of green  avocados. The flaming of spirits. And these are just the beginning.  </P> <P> With a microwave, you can increase the amount of juice in lemons and limes,  oranges and grapefruits so that you get more per squeeze. You can even simplify  the shelling of nuts.  </P> <P> Clear Crystallized Honey or Preserves: Uncap jar and if it's more than half  full -- or if honey or preserves are in plastic container -- empty into bowl  twice its volume. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power), allowing one to 1  1/2 minutes per cup and stirring or rotating container 180 degrees when half of  time time has elapsed until all sugar crystals are dissolved. Cool and use  within one to two days.  </P> <P> Warm Pancake Syrup: Place one-half cup syrup or honey in microwave-safe,  one-cup measure or jar and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 30 seconds. For one  cup syrup, use two-cup measure and microwave 45 to 55 seconds.  </P> <P> Melt Semisweet Chocolate Bits: Arrange one to two cups chocolate bits  doughnut-fashion in microwave-safe 9-inch pie plate and microwave, uncovered,  on MEDIUM (50% power), allowing two to 2 1/2 minutes for one cup and three to  four minutes for two cups until bits are glossy (they'll hold their shape). Let  stand, uncovered, one minute, then stir.  </P> <P> Shell Nuts: Place one pound unshelled almonds, Brazil nuts, filberts, pecans or  walnuts in three-quart, microwave-safe casserole. Add two cups hot water, cover  with lid or vented plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH four to five minutes  until boiling. Let stand, covered, one minute. Drain, dry on paper towels, cool  and crack -- nuts will be easy to extract. Shell nuts over bowl as some may  contain water. Spread shelled nuts on paper towel and dry overnight.  </P> <P> Butter-Brown Nuts: Place one tablespoon butter or margarine on  wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe 9-inch pie plate and microwave on HIGH 25 to  30 seconds. Stir in one-half cup nuts and toast as directed above. For one cup  nuts, use larger pie plate, two tablespoons butter and microwave 35 to 45  seconds to melt. For two cups nuts, use four tablespoons butter and microwave  55 to 65 seconds to melt.  </P> <P> Increase Juice of Citrus Fruits: Microwave whole refrigerator-cold fruit,  uncovered, on HIGH just until warm, allowing 40 seconds for one fruit, 60  seconds for two and 1 1/2 to two minutes for four. Halve times for  room-temperature fruit. Roll fruit on counter with palm, then cut and squeeze.  This technique also makes citrus fruits easier to peel.  </P> <P> Thaw Frozen Fruit Juice Concentrates: Remove one end of can and microwave,  uncovered, on MEDIUM, allowing two to 2 1/2 minutes for six-ounce can, four to  4 1/2 minutes for 12-ounce can. Stir well. Juice liquefies but doesn't heat.  </P> <P> Plump Dried Fruits: Spread one pound dried fruit in microwave-safe pie plate  and sprinkle with three tablespoons water. Cover with vented plastic wrap and  microwave on HIGH 2 1/2 to three minutes, stirring at half time. Let stand,  covered, two minutes to plump fully. Drain or not as recipe directs.  </P> <P> Plump Raisins and Dried Currants: Spread one pound seedless raisins or currants  in microwave-safe casserole at least 10 inches across. Sprinkle with two  tablespoons water, fruit juice, brandy or rum. Cover with vented plastic wrap  and microwave on HIGH two to 2 1/2 minutes. Let stand, covered, two minutes to  plump fully. Drain before using in baked goods.  </P> <P> Macerate Candied Fruit: Microwave one-quarter cup brandy, Grand Marnier or  other fruit liqueur in uncovered one-quart microwave-safe bowl 30 seconds on  HIGH. Stir in one cup finely diced candied fruit, dried currants or raisins and  microwave, uncovered, on HIGH two minutes. Let stand, uncovered, until all  liquid is absorbed. Use as directed in fruit cakes or steamed puddings.  </P> <P> Soften Under-Ripe Avocados: Pierce avocado once or twice, place on upside-down  saucer and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 30 to 60 seconds, turning over and  rotating 180 degrees at half time, until warm. Cool and peel.  </P> <P> Flame Liquor: Microwave one-quarter cup brandy, Cognac, light or dark rum in  uncovered one-cup measure on HIGH 15 to 20 seconds until warm. Remove from  oven, blaze with a match and spoon, flaming, over dessert, or pour warm spirits  over dessert and then flame.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

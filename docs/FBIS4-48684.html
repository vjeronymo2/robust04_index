			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>   [Text] The Angolan peace talks have not yet resumed. The  leadership of the negotiating team from the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is still in Huambo.  Eugenio Manuvakola, Jorge Valentim, and Elias Samakuva are  expected to return to Lusaka only tomorrow afternoon. We  learned from a reliable source that the UN plane will leave for  Huambo tomorrow morning to bring back the leadership of the  UNITA negotiating team.    Today, the leadership of the government negotiating team  held  an informal meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye, special  representative of the UN secretary general in Angola.    If the leadership of the UNITA negotiating team returns to  Lusaka tomorrow, the talks will only begin after tomorrow,  because tomorrow is Africa Day and it is a national holiday here  in Zambia.</p>

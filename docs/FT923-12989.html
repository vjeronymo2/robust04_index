			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Deposits are protected THE DEPOSITORS' PROTECTION FUND v DALIA AND ANOTHER Chancery Division: Sir Donald Nicholls, Vice-Chancellor: July 3 1992 AN ASSIGNMENT of whole or part of a deposit in an authorised bank, made before presentation of a petition for its winding-up or before July 30 1991, entitles the assignee to be treated as the depositor of the assigned sum for the purpose of claiming compensation under the statutory deposit protection scheme. The Vice-Chancellor so held when giving judgment for the defendants on a claim for a declaration by the Depositors Protection Fund, against Mrs Varsha Dalia representing the assignees of deposits in the Bank of Credit and Commerce SA (BCCI), and Barclays Bank plc representing the authorised institutions who contributed to the fund. THE VICE-CHANCELLOR said that to alleviate hardship when a bank became insolvent the Banking Act 1979 set up the deposit protection fund. Money from the fund was payable to depositors on the insolvency of a recognised bank or institution. A depositor was paid three-quarters of his deposit, limited to Pounds 10,000. The fund was continued under the Banking Act 1987. The maximum amount of a protected deposit was increased to Pounds 20,000. BCCI was an authorised institution. On July 5 1991 the Bank of England presented a petition that it be wound up on the ground inter alia that it was insolvent. Provisional liquidators were appointed and BCCI ceased trading in the UK. A firm of accountants wrote to BCCI depositors telling them of a scheme by which a depositor should assign part of his deposit to family members or close friends who could be trusted. Each assignee could look to the fund for maximum compensation payable. Depositors were urged to hurry 'for you only have until July 29'. That was because the winding-up petition was due to come before the court again on July 30. Some 50 depositors or more signed transfers in July in respect of sums totalling several million pounds. There were over 200 assignees. The scheme was quickly stopped in its tracks. On July 30 the Banking Act 1987 (Meaning of Deposit) Order 1991 was made. It provided that in future the definition of 'deposit' in the Act excluded a sum to which a person became entitled otherwise than by operation of law, after presentation of a winding-up petition. The question was whether the assignments had their intended effect for compensation purposes. The deposit protection scheme was regulated by Part 2 of the 1987 Act. Section 58 of the Act provided for payment of compensation. Subsection (1) provided that if an authorised institution became insolvent, or was subject to an administration order, the fund should pay 'each depositor who had a protected deposit . . . three-quarters of his protected deposit'. The Act contained no definition of 'depositor'. It naturally read as meaning the person who made the deposit. To qualify for compensation the deposit made by him must be a 'protected deposit'. Section 59 defined when a company became insolvent for the purposes of section 58. Under 59(1)(a) the relevant event in a winding-up case was the making of the winding-up order, not presentation of the petition. Section 60 defined 'protected deposit' as referring to the institution's total liability to the depositor 'immediately before' it became insolvent or the administration order was made, limited to Pounds 20,000. The assumption made by the section 60 wording was that the depositor who made the deposit would be the same person as the depositor to whom a compensation payment was to be made. Section 61 addressed the problem of trusts by modifying sections 58 and 60 in certain cases. Two important points were discernible in its provisions. First, one thread running through them was that where A was the person who made the deposit but B was the person beneficially entitled to the deposit, B was the material person for the purposes of the protection scheme. Second, section 61 was concerned with the beneficial interests existing when a payment fell to be made. There was nothing in the section to suggest that the trust provisions applied only if the trust existed at the time the deposit was made. Where A assigned the whole of his interest to B in a deposit, in writing and with written notice to the bank under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925, he made a statutory assignment and the person to whom compensation was payable under section 58 was B. The expression 'depositor' was apt to embrace him as A's assignee, and the 'protected deposit' was the bank's liability to him in respect of the UK deposit to which he was entitled. To confine 'depositor' in all circumstances to the person who made the deposit would be inconsistent with the object of section 61. The natural meaning must give way to the extent necessary to enable the Act's underlying purpose to be achieved. It was inconceivable that Parliament intended that an assignee of the whole deposit under a statutory assignment should be in a worse position than the beneficiary under a declaration of trust. In each case the entire beneficial interest in the deposit belonged to B to the exclusion of A who made the deposit. The essential purpose was to pay compensation to those entitled to deposits in an insolvent bank. If the original depositor had assigned his interest, achievement of the legislative purpose required the assignee to be the person entitled to compensation. That was necessarily implicit in the legislative scheme, and section 58 must be so read and understood. Where part only of a deposit had been assigned it could not be a statutory assignment, but was equitable only. For compensation purposes the position was the same as with regard to a statutory assignee. There was no reason in principle why, for the purposes of the deposit protection scheme, an assignee of part of a deposit should be treated any differently from an assignee of the whole. In the present case the assignors had declared themselves trustees of the assigned parts of the deposits if BCCI was unable to designate separate deposit accounts in assignee's names. There was no reason why equitable assignments with that fall-back declaration of trust should be treated differently for compensation purposes than if, in place of assignments, there had been simple declarations of trusts. The 1991 Order provided that 'deposit' excluded any sum to which a person became entitled 'after a petition is presented for the winding-up of the institution, or in the case of an institution in respect of which such a petition has been presented before  .. this Order comes into force, July 30 1991'. The Order excluded an entitlement arising otherwise than by operation of law, after presentation of a winding-up petition. It deliberately left untouched a deposit to which a person became entitled pre-presentation of a winding-up petition. The inevitable conclusion was that pre-petition assignments were not intended to be outlawed. The Order was content that pre-petition assignees should still qualify for compensation. The Order applied to interests arising under assignments and under trusts. Both were stuck down if entitlement arose after presentation of a winding-up petition. In both cases they were left untouched for compensation purposes if entitlement arose pre-petition. For the purposes of Part 2 of the 1987 Act an assignee of part of a deposit was to be treated as entitled to the assigned part and as having made a deposit equal to that part.

For Barclays Bank: Michael Brindle QC and Bankim Thanki (Lovell White Durrant).</p>

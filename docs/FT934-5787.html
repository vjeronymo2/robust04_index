			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Protests at Russian bank curbs The European Commission has complained to the Russian government about its restrictions on foreign banks licensed to do business in Russia. The Commission sees them as going against the grain of a partnership agreement due to be endorsed next month. The complaint, in a letter from the European Commission, which has been negotiating the partnership agreement, comes just before Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels on December 9 to initial the agreement. Part of the purpose of the trip, just three days before parliamentary elections on December 12, illustrates the dilemma over Russia faced by the European Union. Eager to support Mr Yeltsin and pro-reform parties in the election with this public relations boost, they are limited in how much they are able to complain. 'We have to be careful about making threats,' said one EU diplomat. 'The political situation does not allow it. But. . . we cannot accept that Mr Yeltsin should get away with anything he wants just because of the election.' The diplomat also said the EU was alarmed by a draft decree, which Mr Yeltsin may not sign, limiting the activity of foreign lawyers in Russia. The partnership agreement grants Russia trade concessions - such as the right to be consulted before the EU takes anti-dumping action against Russian exports - while setting a favourable regime for each other's service industries. The banking restrictions, reversing the terms of licences already given to banks to operate in Russia, are in open conflict with Russia's law on foreign investment and a presidential decree which last month promised to protect foreign investors. In Brussels, a European Commission trade official described the banking curbs as 'a bit of a spanner in the works' which 'makes it a lot more difficult' to get a partnership agreement by December 9. He said the Yeltsin government's move placed 'a fairly severe restriction on our banking operations, until 1996 at least' and wondered whether Moscow was as anxious for the partnership arrangement as it was last spring, when Mr Yeltsin was facing a referendum on reform. But there is suspicion that the restrictions could be a negotiating ploy to force the Commission's hand on the few remaining items to be resolved in the agreement, such as Russian nuclear fuel exports. 'We're also aware that the Russians are very tough negotiators,' the official said. A last attempt to solve the dispute will be made during negotiations next week. Deputy prime minister Alexander Shokhin, who has been negotiating the treaty and is a candidate for the rival Party of Unity and Accord, has said the presidential decree containing the restrictions contradicts the treaty. On banking, all the treaty does is set limits for flows of capital out of Russia, and on foreign banks' right to deal with smaller depositors.</p>

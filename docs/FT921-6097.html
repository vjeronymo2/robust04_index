			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Dealing with the deficits FIGHTING the general election campaign is, by now, the all-consuming passion of every UK politician. But none but the most superstitious will be able to resist the temptation to peer past polling day at the economic challenges they might face in government. Yet those who dare to raise their heads above the parapet are in for a nasty shock. Things could hardly get worse than they have been over the past eighteen months; but the immediate future looks none too rosy. For Mr Major and his chancellor the next few weeks of economic news will provide quite enough gloom. If they can survive the longest recession since the second world war and win an election with no recovery in sight, they can probably survive any nasty shock that the post-recession period can throw up. But Mr Major must still be dreaming of the autumn days when he was able, briefly, to contemplate an early election. The recovery promised by the Treasury then has failed to materialise. Indeed, the economic outlook has, if anything, deteriorated since. Consumers have suffered a discontented winter, burdened by high real interest rates and unprecedented debts that are being deflated, not inflated, away. They have refused to start borrowing and spending again, depressing domestic output and provoking companies into a second phase of retrenchment and job-shedding. January's unemployment tally sent shivers down the spines of nervous southerners and Tory pollsters. But the recent rash of redundancies  -at Ford, BT and Jaguar to name just three - suggests that February's total will be similarly bad. To make matters worse, the world economy has also turned decidedly sour, depressing exports and making a mockery of the Treasury's forecast of an export-led recovery. The unexpectedly sharp rise in the trade deficit has simply added to the air of general economic malaise that currently engulfs the UK economy. It may have strengthened Mr Major's mis-placed claim that the world economy is to blame for the absence of recovery. But few are fooled. Advance warning Yet perverse as it may seem, this latest rise in the trade deficit provides an advance warning of economic problems of a very different hue: it is now possible to imagine the day when too much, not too little, growth will again be the bugbear of UK economic policy-makers. When the recovery does come, it will be consumer spending, not investment or exports, that leads the way. But the propensity of UK consumers to buy foreign goods, and the seeming inability of UK manufacturers to compete with them, means that imports will soak up much of the new demand for manufactured goods. Even at the bottom of this recession, with import demand at its most depressed, the UK trade account has remained in deficit. Once growth resumes, the deficit will also start growing. Higher unemployment The UK will be able to finance this deficit by borrowing from abroad, but the question is at what price. The higher the deficit, the larger the interest rate differential with Germany within the exchange rate mechanism that will be needed to reassure nervous foreign investors that they will not be repayed in devalued pounds. The consequence of higher interest rates could be yet another cycle of below-trend growth and higher unemployment. The Institute of Fiscal Studies, for example, estimates that annual growth will be around 2 1/4 per cent up to 1995, half a percentage point below trend. Yet slow growth means deficit problems of a second, fiscal, variety. Lower than expected growth this year and the likelihood of pre-election tax cuts mean that whoever wins the election will inherit a budget deficit that exceeds 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the coming fiscal year. But the public spending plans announced in last year's autumn statement were based on a trend growth rate of 3 per cent a year. Below trend growth to 1995, unless accompanied by spending cuts or tax increases, will mean a fiscal deficit over the economic cycle. This twin combination of current account and fiscal deficits, familiar both to the US in the 1980s and to many developing countries, cannot be sustained for ever. The IMF, if asked, would in all probability recommend fiscal retrenchment combined with an exchange rate devaluation, neither of which appear in the manifesto of any British political party. The alternative is high interest rates, slow growth and rising government indebtedness. None of which makes attractive dreaming for any party hoping for power. For the Tories, further tax cuts would appear increasingly irresponsible. For Labour, re-distribution would have to be matched with higher taxes. None of this will reduce the politician's appetite for power. For the victor, the electoral chalice may not be poisoned; but it will be a bitter draft.</p>

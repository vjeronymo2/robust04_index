			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "What Kind </F> of State in Sovereign Russia?"]    [Text] During the celebration of Russia's sovereignty I  have become extremely alarmed by the increasingly deep-rooted  trend in our country of using the slogan of the state's  interests to adopt decisions which are contrary to the laws and  common sense.    In parliament there is an increasingly widespread idea that  it would be no bad thing if deputies were to extend their own  powers and perhaps those of other institutions of authority.    The Federation Council is examining questions which it has  no  right to examine and is trying to give advice cum injunctions to  the State Duma (just try to imagine that sort of thing happening  in relations between the Senate and the Congress or the House of  Lords and the House of Commons!).    Many questions that fall within the competence of parliament  are being decided by decrees and edicts.    A vast number of laws, edicts, and decrees are being  implemented only partly or not at all.    The components of the Federation are adopting laws which  conflict directly with the laws of the Russian Federation and  sometimes conclude what are, to put it mildly, bizarre  agreements with the "center."    What is there in common between all these and many other  facts from our life? It is the fact that in all these cases the  laws are being violated but everyone is pretending that nothing  has happened and that nothing special is going on. But everyone  is sitting in his own corner demanding benefits, subsidies, and  aid for himself, his region, or his enterprise. And no one  gives a damn for Russia.    The impression is being created that there are no citizens  of  Russia, there are only citizens of the military-industrial  complex, the agro-industrial complex, Metrovagonmash [plant  building subway cars], and the like. No one particularly wants  a conflict: The protection of Russia from collapse in the  direct and indeed any other sense of the word is not a topical  issue.    At the time of the collapse of communism and the USSR there  was much talk about the creation of a rule-of-law state and the  final departure from the arbitrary rule and lawlessness which  existed for decades.    Today, however, neither the democrats nor the lawyers say a  word when the laws, beginning with the Constitution, are broken.  No one is particularly bothered. An incredible toleration of  lawlessness has developed.    Can you imagine the deputies of even one parliament in the  civilized countries which might vote for an extension of their  powers beyond those for which the electors voted? No matter how  bad the electoral rules are, this is unacceptable.    No matter what the circumstances are, I personally will  regard 12 December 1995 as the last day of my lawful mandate as  a deputy. Especially since, given the absence of a real majority  in parliament today, the elections should be brought forward,  not put back. Otherwise the state will mark time.    The Federation Council, the State Duma, the government, and  the president must operate strictly according to the  Constitution and the laws, no matter how bad they seem. If  unlawful legal acts are adopted in the components of the  Federation, the state is obliged to repeal them, not to sign  bizarre agreements. If individual parts of the country are,  essentially, in revolt and declaring sovereignty, you cannot  close your eyes to that fact.    Four years after the proclamation of its sovereignty, Russia  is still not a rule-of-law state from the purely human  viewpoint. Hence the absence of order, the crime, and the  corruption, for which no one wants to bear responsibility. I  hope that Russia will be able to celebrate both the fifth and  the 10th anniversary of the restoration of its sovereignty.</p>

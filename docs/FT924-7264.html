			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (14): Reward schemes cut - Are travel perks on the way out? asks David Churchill IN THE tough economic conditions of the 1990s, have the corporate conference and incentive travel trips of the 1980s had their day? At a time when companies are having daily to face up to the harsh realities of recession, the exotic sales conference to Florida or the Far East may seem in bad taste and provide the wrong public relations message to staff and customers. Yet, while there is no doubt that companies have cut their conference and incentive programmes during the recession, there are still some who believe that a motivational conference or incentive trip (often the two are very similar) is the best way to win business. 'Where there's a will there's a way,' points out Mr John Fisher, managing director of motivation company Page &amp; Moy Marketing. 'Companies that want to keep their conferences and incentives will usually come up with a reason for it.' Nowadays, he adds, many incentives are termed as 'educational' or 'factory' visits rather than straightforward travel rewards. Operators in the conference and incentive travel business - one of the most important parts of the overall business travel market - insist that the motivational need for such travel is more important now than ever before. 'Conferences motivate people,' insists Ms Janice Eagelson, marketing manager for the De Vere Hotels group whose portfolio includes the refurbished Grand Hotel in Brighton. 'This is particularly important for sales staff who spend most of their time on their own.' Mr Paul Swan, managing director of conference production company Spectrum Communications, adds: 'Sales staff need even more reassurance in times like the present and a good conference can take care of this. The sales executive can look round and see tangible evidence of the size and strength of the company. 'With business disasters all around them every employee needs reassurance that he or she is led by a winning team that has a strategy to get the company through.' The conference and incentive travel market is split into several distinct sections. At their grandest are the international conventions when people arrive from all over the world to discuss a particular subject. Then there are company conferences which provide a platform for staff from one company to meet in pleasant surroundings to communicate and discuss corporate objectives. But the most popular area is the incentive travel trips, often thinly disguised as conferences. They are really rewards for staff or dealers and distributors who have performed well. The motor, life assurance and computer industries are all heavy users of these type of incentives even in the present recession: the benefits to the companies are too great to stop such travel entirely, although the type of reward is changing. 'While group incentive travel remains an important motivational tool, the number of reward schemes targeted at individuals are increasing very rapidly,' points out Mr Nick Bender, general manager of Thomas Cook's incentive travel business. 'There is no doubt that travel is used as an incentive simply because it works best.' Thomas Cook has, therefore, introduced worldwide travel vouchers which can be given as a reward to individuals. What is also changing as a result of the recession is the length of conference and incentive travel trips as well as the destinations. Events are often shorter and the places visited less exotic. 'Some companies are becoming a bit wary of taking their top performers off for at least a week away from their business,' points out Ms Barbara Crawley, managing director of the Motivtravel incentive house. Short-haul trips, therefore, are increasingly used as rewards. Mr John Lawson, chairman of the Incentive Travel and Meetings Association and managing director of Motivational Travel Management, suggests another reason for short-haul's popularity. 'Companies are less willing to book business class seats, so while two to three hours in short-haul economy seating is acceptable, most people find seven to eight hours in economy to a long-haul destination is not so much fun, especially when they have been used to a higher grade,' he suggests. Out of the UK, therefore, Paris is still the top short-haul conference and incentive destination. Moreover, in a bid to capitalise on this, Eurodisney is launching a scheme to attract conference and incentive business to the resort, especially during the winter months. Paris's popularity, however, may be hindered by the recent devaluation of sterling against the French franc which makes it more expensive as a destination. Within Europe, therefore, the trend may be towards better value for money destinations such as Spain and Portugal. But while short-haul conference and incentive travel is the name of the game, some companies still believe that long-haul travel is a better motivator. The problem, however, is finding sufficiently new and exciting destinations. 'There is no doubt that some companies want fresh ideas and high quality,' says Mr Lawson. 'Whether it's short haul or long haul, the over-riding demand is for an incentive experience that works well and is better than they have had before.' Hong Kong is cited by conference and incentive travel organisers as pushing hard for business out of the UK. But the 'hot' destinations to watch over the next few years are Venezuela, Boston, Vancouver and Buenos Aires. The one drawback to the growth of the conference and incentive travel market, however, remains the tax implications. Mr Fisher from Page &amp; Moy points out that the acid test for tax is whether or not there is a qualification element. 'If delegates have to qualify to attend, then it is taxable, including costs for partners,' he says.</p>

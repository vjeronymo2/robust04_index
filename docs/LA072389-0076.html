			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TIAN AN MEN SQUARE;  </P> <P> IN THE TRADITIONAL VIEW IT IS CENTER OF BEIJING, CHINA AND THE UNIVERSE  </P> <P> For Chinese citizens, few places mean as much, in history or in symbol, as the  Gate of Heavenly Peace (Tian An Men), the massive vermilion wall that guards  the southern entrance to Beijing's Forbidden City.  </P> <P> Hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesting students died in the shadow of the  gate early in June, before the tanks and rifles of the 27th Army. It was no  accident the youths chose Tian An Men Square, which lies before the gate, as  their stage.  </P> <P> Even before the creation of Communist China 40 years ago, Tian An Men was known  as the place where government and the governed met. After the Ming emperors  built their capital at Beijing in the early 15th Century, Tian An Men became  the focus of the dynasty's most elaborate public ceremony, "The Gold Phoenix  Issues an Edict," in which court officials announced imperial policy from a  rostrum on the gate, long before written copies of the mandate were conveyed to  the provinces.  </P> <P> The emperor's benevolent power, subjects believed, flowed southward from the  throne room, past the walled fortress of the Forbidden City, and through Tian  An Men like a calming river that branched into the far reaches of his empire.  </P> <P> When the People's Republic of China was founded Oct. 1, 1949, this was the  place where Communist Party leader Mao Tse-tung raised the country's new flag.  </P> <P> "In the traditional Chinese view, Tian An Men was not only the center of the  capital, but the center of the country and the center of the universe," says  Anthony J. Kane, director of the China Council of the Asia Foundation, a New  York-based educational institution committed to the study and understanding of  Asian culture.  </P> <P> The gate remains a symbol of central authority. An image of the long, low  building, with its sweeping roof upturned to fend off evil forces, is stamped  on Chinese coins, currency, airline tickets, and policemen's badges.  Schoolchildren learn to sing "I Love Tian An Men Square," much as others learn  "America" or "La Marseillaise."  </P> <P> Tian An Men Square is, at 98 acres, the largest city square in the world, a  pancake-flat expanse of paving stones inspired by Moscow's Red Square. Tian An  Men was created by the Communist government, which cleared away a rat's maze of  gray houses, walls and alleys that used to squat outside the imperial compound.  </P> <P> Thousands of tourists from the provinces flock to the square to see museums and  monuments to the revolution and to have their pictures taken by vendors in  front of the old gate. In normal times the atmosphere is easy, with vacationers  gawking, licking flavored ice, and pointing at the sights, while staid Beijing  residents drift to and from work on their black Flying Pigeon bicycles,  accompanied by the festive tinkling of thousands upon thousands of bike bells.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mao Still Haunts  </P> <P> Although more than a decade has passed since Mao's death, the late chairman  still haunts Tian An Men Square. At the plaza's south end, hundreds of the  reverent and the curious line up daily, hats in hand, to visit the Chairman Mao  Tse-tung Memorial Hall, a gray mausoleum built in the same heroic proportions  as the emperor's quarters. Here the founder of modern China lies on view under  glass.  </P> <P> At Tian An Men Square's northern end, Mao's portrait peers down from Tian An  Men Gate, where he liked to review thousands of marching Red Guards, the  radical youths who held his little red poetry books aloft and greeted the Great  Helmsman with a chant once reserved for emperors: "Ten thousand years! Ten  thousand! Ten thousand and ten thousand!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Site of Testing  </P> <P> Along with the worshipful, Tian An Men has also drawn the disaffected from all  parts of China. Traditionally, the capital gates have been a forum for testing  the limits of political speech.  </P> <P> Even before there was a China, a legendary king named Yao encouraged his  subjects to carve their criticisms of government officials on wooden pillars  outside his palace, so he would know of commoners' concerns. The wooden columns  are gone now, but they are recalled by two pairs of white marble huabiao that  support the gate at Tian An Men.  </P> <P> Perhaps with that tradition in mind, Chinese gathered before the columns of  Tian An Men to press the Qing emperor for reforms in government and education  between 1895 and 1900. It was here the last dynasty collapsed in 1912 and here  that guards shot and bayoneted 47 students to death in 1926, while the youths  were protesting what they considered undue foreign influence in Chinese  affairs.  </P> <P> Even Mao's Cultural Revolution, which began in Tian An Men, finally ended  there. A million students poured into the capital to mourn the death of Premier  Chou En-lai in 1976, and their mourning swiftly turned into a riot, aimed at  the repressive Maoists then in power. Police brutally beat hundreds of the  youths and made mass arrests, but the students eventually prevailed.  </P></p>

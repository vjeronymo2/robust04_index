It Is Up to the Duma To Decide"]    [Text] At a closed session on 2 June the Federation Council  adopted, as a basis by an overwhelming majority of votes, the  Decree: "On the Course of Forming the 1994 Federal Budget."    It was recommended to the State Duma that defense  expenditures be increased up to R55 trillion, of which R12  trillion is for arms procurement, up to R5.5 trillion for  RDT&amp;E,  and up to R8 trillion for capital construction. It was  recommended that expenditures for upkeep of the Armed Forces be  reduced from R28 to 25.8 trillion.    Thus, the Federation Council proposed to the State Duma that  the defense budget be increased by R18 trillion.    Commenting on this decision at the request of a KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA correspondent, Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Federation  Council Security and Defense Committee, directed attention to  the fact that 55 trillion is that subsistence minimum which  permits keeping the Army and military-industrial complex from  collapse. As a comparison, 55 trillion do not make up even a  third of the defense item of the 1994 U.S. budget.    Against the background of these calculations, some  politicians' assertions about excessive appetites of the Army  and military-industrial complex sound unconvincing. Meanwhile,  even with 55 trillion there will be no fat, as is customarily  said in such cases.    The decree is viewed rather critically by certain heads of  administrations. In a talk with journalists about expenditures  for military capital construction, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast  Governor Boris Nemtsov came out in favor of creating personal  accounts that are closed for consumption expenditures, with  funds for individual construction transferred to them. According  to his estimates, 400,000 officers would be able to build  themselves "decent houses" for R8 trillion.    Common sense must win out in the argument about R18  trillion,  and I will give the reminder that it was proposed to reduce  initial appropriations for defense by that much. The Federation  Council is recommending that the State Duma not increase, but  restore the amount of the "subsistence minimum" for the Army  that was proposed in drawing up the budget message. Of course,  there can be divergences of views, but a place also must be  found for compromises. Judging from the familiar statements of  its chairman, Vladimir Shumeyko, and the reaction of deputies to  the decision to cut off the defense item of the federal budget,  the Federation Council will stand its ground firmly.    It is important in itself that the Federation Council  position is clear to the State Duma on the eve of the second  reading of the 1994 draft federal budget.    In a situation where President Boris Yeltsin, Government  Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Federation Council  unequivocally came out in favor of a defense budget of R55  trillion, the State Duma also finally has to settle on its  choice.    Probably now Duma deputies should take into account that  they  assume a special responsibility for possible consequences of  their decision.    In the final account it is not a question of the Army's  interests, but of the interests of the state, of Russia.</p>

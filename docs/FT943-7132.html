			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Barclays to launch complaint initiative Barclays Bank will today launch an initiative directed at improving the way it deals with complaints from customers, Alison Smith writes. The new approach is intended to bring greater consistency in individual branches' handling of complaints. The announcement comes two weeks after Barclays' record pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1bn for the first half of this year provoked anger from customers and the Consumers' Association. It also follows an attempt by Midland Bank last month to target the personal customers of its high-street rivals by promising a payment of Pounds 10 for every error it made in transferring a current account. Under Barclays' 'national complaints initiative' any of its 7m personal customers who complains in person at a branch will be given a written record of the complaint by the member of staff to whom they talk. This will act as a 'receipt' for the complaint and the staff member will take responsibility for seeing that it is resolved. The bank's central complaints unit will monitor all complaints to build up a picture of the overall standard of service provided. Barclays said work had started on the initiative last year and not because of recent criticism.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish on 12 May  1994 on page 7B reports that the Ministry of Agriculture and  Livestock [MAG] is projecting a 4.3 percent increase in  production for 1994-95 compared to the previous cycle.  Approximately 660,000 manzanas will be planted in basic grains,  including rice, corn, beans, sorghum, and soybeans, while  226,000 manzanas will be planted in products for export. Coffee  will remain at the same level as last year -- 105,000 manzanas.  Although the price of cotton has risen from $58 to $82 per  quintal, only 5,000 manzanas of cotton will be planted, yielding  32 quintals per manzana. The article explains that production  results will depend on timely government financing, estimated at  $260 million from international financial organizations; respect  for private property; and international market prices for  exports.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pure genius needed to maintain growth - The problems faced by Guinness in a changing market GUINNESS'S slipping growth rate this year has aroused the sort of alarm with which a character in one of its old advertisements watched his glass of stout slide down the neck of an ostrich. A comment this week about the testing prospects for 1993 by Mr Tony Greener, chief executive and chairman-elect, compounded already gloomy expectations this year. Guinness shares tumbled 9 per cent and analysts downgraded forecasts, predicting a 4 per cent fall in 1992 profits. To some City observers, the setback is more significant than a simple reflection of the impact of recession on the international drinks group's most profitable markets. They consider it suggests that the sources of organic profit growth are running dry after a compound growth rate of more than 23 per cent a year since 1987. Guinness's five-year performance under Sir Anthony Tennant, who retires at the end of this month, is almost worth a place in its own book of records. Profits soared from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m while earnings per share and dividends doubled. Market capitalisation rose from Pounds 2.8bn to Pounds 10.9bn as its shares outperformed the rest of the FT-SE 100 companies. The platform for the launch of this spectacular display was the acquisition of Distillers Company in 1986. DCL's huge brand assets, including Johnnie Walker, White Horse and Dewar's Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin, had been under-exploited. There was immense scope for rationalisation of production and distribution and significant rewards to be earned from implementing a cohesive marketing strategy. The opportunities were seized. Operating management was reorganised and focused on regional markets. Control over distribution was increased from 25 per cent to 85 per cent through acquisitions and joint ventures. Brand portfolios were rationalised, and brands pushed up-market with hefty price increases, redesigned packaging and new-look advertising. More than a score of peripheral businesses were sold to concentrate resources on the core spirits and beer activities. Spirits, particularly Scotch whisky, with margins of more than 30 per cent, now account for 76 per cent of profits. But having squeezed so much value out of DCL some analysts have been questioning whether Guinness can sustain its profits growth. Volumes are declining in the US and UK, the largest Scotch markets. A premium pricing policy will be more difficult to pursue as global inflation rates fall. Consumers in developed countries are becoming more value conscious and less susceptible to aspirational advertising. 'In the largest global spirit markets, it could be the demise of the de-luxe decade,' said Mr David Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson. Nor can the brewing division be expected to compensate with a substantial boost to its 24 per cent contribution to group profits. 'Margins are already high by comparison with brewing companies generally,' he added. Mr Greener, who carried out the restructuring of the spirits business, said: 'It is quite clear that we are not going to get the sort of profit growth that we have had in the past five years.' But that, he added, 'is a reflection on the state of the world economy not of the company'. Guinness, in his view, is positioned for a long run of consistent profits growth which worldwide recession has only temporarily interrupted. Ms Michelle Proud, analyst at County NatWest, agreed: 'We believe that growth will resume in 18 months or so, possibly even sooner, with the pace accelerating within a year or so, thereafter to a sustainable rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent above the underlying rate of inflation.' The case against the pessimists rests firmly on the belief that trading-up is a basic human instinct. 'Wherever people become better off, they will spend to improve their standard of living, their way of life,' said Mr Greener, 'and they will want to demonstrate their achievements to their peers. 'Recession may affect the rate at which people spend, but it does not put an end to their aspirations.' Guinness's long-term growth would depend, he added, on its ability to persuade spirits and beer consumers to continue to trade up to its premium brands. It has a geographical spread of markets which minimises the effects of recession and multiplies the opportunities. It earns 30 per cent of its profits in continental Europe, 21 per cent in Asia/Pacific, 18 per cent in North America, 16 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the rest of the world. There are ample financial resources to extend the range of the group's distribution and expand its drinks portfolio. About Pounds 2.5m, of which half has been internally generated, has already been spent on establishing its alliance with LVMH, the French champagne and cognac group; and on acquiring such brands and sales networks as IW Harper bourbon and Scoresby Scotch in the US, Asbach brandy in Germany, Bundaberg rum in Australia, and Pampero rum in Venezuela. 'But it would take a very big acquisition to shift the profits needle significantly,' Mr Greener said, 'and such opportunities are limited. 'It is the organic growth of our international brands that will drive us forward. The ultimate test for us is the management of our brand marketing.' Guinness has put together a largely new management team for the task. Of 31 operational directors, only 10 were with the company in 1986, and only three are doing roughly the same jobs. But they are internationally experienced, and they have a marketing budget, estimated at Pounds 400m a year, for strengthening their already formidable brands. In declining spirits markets, such as the recession-hit US and UK, the group has gained market share and sustained high margins. 'Strong brands always emerge from recession even stronger,' says Mr Greener. 'It is the weak brands that give way.' In fast-emerging growth markets such as Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico; in Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan; in Greece and Portugal; Guinness's spirits brands lead the premium and de-luxe sectors. Targeted advertising and promotion encourages consumer aspiration. Brands positioned at successively higher price points offer opportunities to fulfil them step by step. Thus the Johnnie Walker brand - the world's best-selling Scotch which accounts for 40 per cent of Guinness's profits - has been extended to cover a duty-free price range of Dollars 10 to Dollars 225 a bottle. Trading up from two bottles of Johnnie Walker Red to a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black, according to Ms Proud, represents a 24 per cent increase in profit. 'Building brands, ensuring they remain relevant to the consumer, is a progressive, cumulative exercise,' said Mr Greener. 'It takes time, but we shall be doing it better five years from now and I see no reason why we should not achieve relatively strong rates of growth.'</p>

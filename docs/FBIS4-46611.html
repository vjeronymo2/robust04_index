			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television and Dubl  Networks in Russian at 2310 GMT on 4 June 94 carries its regular  "Aty-Baty" program. This segment is dedicated to the economic  plight of Russia's military industrial complex, and carries  interviews with P. V. Romanov, deputy of the Federation Council  and general director of Yenisey Chemical Combine Production  Association in Krasnoyarsk, and A. A. Piskunov, deputy chairman  of the State Duma Defense Committee. The interview starts with  Romanov describing the situation in the country as a "threefold  economical, political, and social dead end," and calls for an  urgent review of the market policy to prevent unpredictable  consequences.    Video cuts to show footage of an unidentified plant  manufacturing engines while announcer compares Russian military  production, which shrunk 42 percent in the last three years, to  that of the United States and European countries.    In answering a question on the military industrial complex's  economic situation, Piskunov says that soaring armament prices  cause increasing tensions in both military units and the defense  industry. Outlining national defense expenses, Piskunov says  that pay for military personnel and expenses for energy,  transportation, maintenance, and housing construction amount to  about 70 percent of the defense budget, while expenses for  purchasing arms and for research and development are close to 31  percent.    Romanov then criticizes the privatization program as ill  planned and too headlong, and says: "Three years ago, our  economy was grinding to a halt, to put it mildly. Today the  Russian economy is close to collapse. The difference between a  collapse and a halt is while we used to have plants, factories  and working crews, today all of this is entering a stage of  dissolution." He goes on to say that an industrial system built  around central state control cannot be converted to a market  economy overnight, without a transition period.    Commenting on the possibility of strikes in the military  industrial sector, Romanov says that the labor unions are  "completely passive" and do not protect the interests of  workers, who get no pay for several months on end. He says:  "Proudly looking the Russian people in the eye from television  screens, we say that we have lowered the inflation rate. But we  lowered it by withholding pay and lowering the production rate."    Video cuts to show more shots of unidentified machine plant  production line while announcer says that while several years  ago the lives of about 30 million people were connected with the  defense industry, today the number has fallen to 14 million.    Piskunov then further comments on defense expenses, saying:  "We have reduced expenses for arms purchases sevenfold or  eightfold in the last two or three years. While we used to buy  thousands of units of certain categories of weapons, today we  buy single units." He then cautions that the virtual stoppage of  production at military plants causes irreversible processes,  such as loss of specialists and cutting edge technologies.  Piskunov then says: "In complex production spheres, such as  plane building, missile building, and ammunition chemistry, we  are close to finding ourselves in a situation where we are no  longer able to produce armaments."    In speaking of workers' pay, Romanov tells of the inability  to attract skilled personnel, who leave for better paying  enterprises, some of them abroad, thus channeling military  technologies there. He concludes his interview by emphasizing  the need for a clear economic plan and the determination to  carry it out.</p>

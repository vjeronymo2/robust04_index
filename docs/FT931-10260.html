			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Bundesbank aims to give Frankfurt markets a lift: David Waller analyses the latest cut in German banks' reserve requirements THE German interest-rate cut announced last Thursday was only third among items on the Bundesbank's press release. Higher up the list - and more important, in the view of Mr Johann Gaddum of the Bundesbank council - were the move to cut reserve requirements for German banks and to introduce DM25bn (Pounds 10bn) of short-term government securities. Given the international implications of the interest rate move, Mr Gaddum's tongue must have been partly in his cheek. Still, from the point of view of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre, the importance of the other measures should not be under-estimated. They are the latest in a series of moves in which the Bundesbank has lifted restrictions on German financial services with the aim of strengthening Frankfurt's competitive position in the battle against other European financial centres. Two such initiatives in recent years have helped create a flourishing futures and options market - the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) - and a successful commercial paper market. Thursday's decisions are at least as important. For years, bankers have complained that the Bundesbank's reserve requirements have acted as a brake on profitability and played into the hands of bankers in Luxembourg, London and Paris. For every DM100 that a German bank took as a deposit, it was obliged to place between DM4.50 and DM12.10 with the central bank, interest free. From the Bundesbank's point of view, this was a useful way of keeping control of monetary developments. For the commercial banks it meant that they could not pay as much interest to depositors as banks in other countries where reserves were non-existent (as in Luxembourg) or small (as in London, where they are 0.35 per cent). Interest rates on deposits in Luxembourg have traditionally been 150 basis points higher than in Germany. By some calculations, more than DM200bn is deposited in D-Mark accounts outside Germany, driven abroad because of the impact of reserve requirements on marginal interest rates. Last year alone more than DM60bn left Germany to be deposited in Luxembourg, often with local branches of German banks. Reserve requirements are an important contributor to this trend (though Germany's withholding tax is probably the main impetus.) The Bundesbank has not, in its latest move, gone so far as abolish all minimum reserves: they were cut from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent on time deposits and savings deposits. They were left unchanged on sight deposits, where the reserve can be as high as 12.5 per cent. In total, however, the cut has liberated DM32bn of reserves currently lodged interest-free by banks with the Bundesbank. This meant a windfall gain for Germany's big banks, reflected in strong share gains last week. It has also 'removed some of the competitive differential with Luxembourg and other financial centres', says Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at the Dresdner Bank - and raised the possibility of further easing in the requirements in the future. The second item on Thursday's list is the announcement of DM25bn of new short-term government securities - Bubils as they have already been christened. These are to be issued next month with maturities of three, six and nine months, and fill an important gap in the range of investment products on offer. Corporate treasurers will be among the most enthusiastic purchasers of the new securities, but they will be issued in minimum denominations of DM100,000, so they will be attractive to wealthy individuals as an alternative to bank savings accounts. At present the only way for investors to buy short-term risk-free investments is to buy commercial paper issued by the Treuhand, the government's privatisation agency for eastern Germany, which is the biggest issuer on the German CP market. The shortest maturity for bunds is one year, but the bulk of the government's lending is conducted with longer maturities. 'It rounds out the range of products you will be able to invest in in Germany in comparison to the US,' says Mr Mark Houghton-Berry at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. The new instruments are likely to be of interest to institutional investors and to central banks which hold D-Marks as reserves. Taken as a whole, last week's measures reflect the fact that money market operations - conducted at the moment through regular auctions of security repurchase agreements (repos) and other instruments - are more important than reserves in the battle to contain inflation. The new instruments will round out the Bundesbank's armoury of money-market tools used to fine-tune German interest rates and monetary developments. 'Compared to minimum reserves, the new instruments will give much more sensitivity to the central bankers in their steering of monetary policy,' said Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank. 'The money market is too narrow and does not have enough instruments.' The new paper is not just a convenience; it also marks an important shift in the way the Bundesbank deals with German liquidity, by giving it the ability to influence the holdings of German companies. 'For the first time it will allow the Bundesbank to influence liquidity outside the banking system in the corporate sector,' said Mr Friedrich at Dresdner Bank. 'It will be able to go right to the heart of non-bank liquidity.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     BUNDESBANK'S KEY CHANGES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- DM25bn of new short-term instruments roughly doubles amount of Federal paper available in money markets.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Switch of emphasis from minimum reserves to money market will raise importance of day-to-day Bundesbank operations to influence rates.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- German banks will now earn interest on DM32bn of money that was previously tied up interest-free with the Bundesbank.  Helps them compete for D-Mark deposits with offshore centres.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

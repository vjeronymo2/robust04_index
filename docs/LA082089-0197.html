			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING FUNDS FOR THOSE WHO HELP ILLEGAL ALIENS  </P> <P> Well, three cheers for good ol' Costa Mesa! Imagine any city having the courage  to put its citizens' rights ahead of the freeloaders who not only come  uninvited to the table, but demand dessert as well.  </P> <P> Outraged, indeed. Many of us have long been outraged at the gall and greed of  the interlopers who expect us not only to support them, but also whine when we  don't love them.  </P> <P> Our homeless problem can be attributed directly to the law-breaking illegals  who grab all the low-cost housing, thus depriving our own people of the  facilities.  </P> <P> Let other cities take heart and follow suit by denying taxpayer funds to the  illegals, and maybe they will stay home and help their own country.  </P> <P> ALICE SLUTZ  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

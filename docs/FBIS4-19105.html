			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Condemnation of Speech by Arzalluz, </F> Who Is Accused of Isolating Basque Country"]    [Excerpt] Bilbao -- Several political leaders yesterday  harshly criticized the remarks of PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]  Chairman Xabier Arzalluz, who referred on Aberri Eguna [Basque  fatherland day] to those who "talk a great deal about ETA  [Basque Homeland and Liberty], when they have headings and  articles in their Constitution, designed for Reds and  separatists, in which they entrust their fatherland's unity to  the Army, weapons, and violence." The leaders of the nationwide  parties in the Basque Country accused Arzalluz of isolating the  Basque Country through his radicalism, which, in the opinion of  both the PSE [Basque Socialist Party] and the People's Party of  the Basque Country, stems from the proximity of the Basque  autonomous community elections.    The harshest criticisms yesterday came from the Basque  Socialists, of whom Aznar said a few days ago that they are not  Basques. Nicolas Redondo Terreros, secretary general of the PSE  of Vizcaya, said that Arzalluz' remarks are "intolerable" and  show "separatism," although he specified that the problem is not  between the Basque Country and the rest of Spain "but among the  Basques themselves, because there are many of us Basques who do  not share Mr. Arzalluz' idea of the Basque Country and Spain at  all."    PSE Deputy Secretary General Jose Luis Marcos Merino also  criticized the remarks by Arzalluz, whom he called a "crank,"  and said that his remarks are "nonsense" and have no  justification, because "to compare ETA with the Army and Article  8 of the Constitution is an act of total cynicism and a lie."  Marcos Merino added that "so many foolish remarks and in such  close succession are inexplicable, unless the PNV leaders are  suffering from delirium and hallucinations."    In Marcos Merino's opinion, Arzalluz' statements do not help  the Basque Country to surmount the economic crisis which it is  suffering, "but isolate us increasingly."    Jaime Mayor Oreja, chairman of the People's Party in the  Basque Country, spoke in similar terms, accusing the PNV  chairman of isolating the Basque Country through statements such  as these, "which are the best demonstration of a political  fiction which has been so damaging and counterproductive for the  Basque Country." In Mayor Oreja's opinion, "those statements do  not further the quest to resolve the Basque Country's real  problems, and are a political fiction."  <H5>  Regain Prominence </H5>   In the opinion of the People's Party of the Basque Country,  what the PNV leaders are seeking through statements such as  their chairman's is to "regain prominence and increase the  political justification of the nationalist parties and, more  specifically, of the PNV," in view of the elections' proximity.  In Mayor Oreja's opinion, what Arzalluz is attempting to this  end is to "divide deeply the Basque people" and "cause a scandal  and reaction throughout Spain through radicalism," although he  said that the questioning of the Army's role in the defense of  Spain's unity did not surprise them.    On relations between the People's Party and the PNV  following  the meeting with Arzalluz, he said that "meeting points must  always be explored within the substantial and very considerable  differences," and added that "there is no possibility of  agreement" on these matters.

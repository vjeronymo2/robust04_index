			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's Illinois Physician and Surgeon License expired on July 31, 1987. He continued to practice medicine but did not renew his license until December 1988. In April 1990, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation (IDPR) issued an order finding that Respondent had practiced medicine without a license, reprimanded him, and imposed a $1,000 fine. At the hearing in this matter, Respondent admitted that he had a made a mistake by not renewing his license immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent filed an application for registration with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DEA on June 8, 1990. At that time, a DEA investigator conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a pharmacy survey for the period 1988&hyph;1990. The investigator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found that five prescriptions for controlled substances had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called in to local pharmacies, allegedly by Respondent, after his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DEA Certificate of Registration was revoked. Some prescriptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  contained the names and DEA registration numbers of other doctors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and had Respondent's name crossed out on the prescription. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescription contained Respondent's retired DEA registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number and another contained Respondent's revoked DEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration number. Respondent testified during the hearing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this matter that he may have authorized the prescriptions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  explained that he mistakenly thought that he was permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribe controlled substances. Respondent added that in late  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990, after consulting his attorney, he ``completely stopped''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizing prescriptions for controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An investigator with IDPR testified that in 1991 he began an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation of Respondent after receiving a complaint from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  local pharmacist. The pharmacist was concerned about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's use of the non-controlled substance Stadol. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacist found Respondent's purchases of Stadol unusual for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatrician. Testimony was presented at the hearing regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's alleged misuse of Stadol. However, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative law judge correctly noted, Stadol is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance. Therefore, these allegations were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted great weight by either the administrative law judge or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Deputy Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Deputy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deny an application for registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances: (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks, M.D. 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly found that all these factors were relevant to a determination of whether Respondent's registration would be in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that the Illinois licensing board, IDPR, has taken action against Respondent on more than one occasion. IDPR summarily suspended Respondent's controlled substance license based on his felony conviction and later reprimanded him for practicing without a license. The Deputy Administrator also finds that Respondent's past conduct indicates a cavalier attitude towards the dispensing and prescribing of controlled substances. Providing the undercover officer with Seconal for no legitimate medical purpose reveals a serious lack of judgment, as does Respondent's explanation for his continued prescribing of controlled substances following the revocation of his DEA Certificate of Registration. Respondent's felony conviction for distribution of cocaine again evidences a dangerous indifference for the law. This conviction, along with Respondent's failure to abide by DEA regulations, proves that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Respondent cannot be trusted to comply with laws relating to controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator agrees with the administrative law judge that, after considering the applicable factors pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and adopts her recommended decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that Avner Kauffman's application for registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective August 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dated: July 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

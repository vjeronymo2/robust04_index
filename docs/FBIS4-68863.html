But unfortunately so since, as  specialists believe, Ukraine could lose in it more than it finds.    Well, judge for yourselves. We offer for your attention  our correspondent's interview with Pavel Petrenko, chief  specialist of the Department of Foreign Economic Relations of  the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.    [Oleynik] So Ukraine is an associate member of the CIS  Economic Union. May it be hoped that many problems of economic  disintegration will now be overcome more successfully?    [Petrenko] If we attempt to avoid emotions and operate only  with facts and intellect based on strict economic realities, the  situation is defined as follows. The development of the CIS  Economic Union in the interests of all its participants, as the  treaty declares, will depend primarily on the possibilities and  readiness for cooperation of the participants, first and  foremost on the national systems of the management of foreign  economic relations.    An analysis of the treaty testifies that the majority of its  articles do not, to put it mildly, coincide with the interests  of the people of Ukraine. In the legal respect, for example, the  treaty is not adjusted and requires an enormous amount of  supplementary exegesis and clarification. This state of affairs  automatically enables one of the strongest parties to the treaty  to immediately avail itself of these lacunae, which promise  Ukraine nothing but losses.    The rights and obligations of Ukraine in the treaty are not  balanced or weighed. It is not at all clear how Ukraine's banks  will participate in the shaping of currency-financial and  banking legislation of the Economic Union. It may be forecast  even now, therefore, that realization of the treaty will  undoubtedly have ambiguous consequences for Ukraine and its  trading partners not only on a CIS scale. This applies primarily  to the spheres of the so-called "four freedoms" which were  determined by the Treaty of Rome of the countries of the  European Union: free movement of goods, services, manpower, and  capital.    [Oleynik] Does it not seem to you that realization of the  terms of the treaty in the deformed space of the CIS, hopelessly  backward in the legal and technical-economic respect and not  even remotely reminiscent of the former Union space, is simply  unrealistic?    [Petrenko] I am sure it is, unfortunately. The preamble to  the treaty even speaks of the formation and development of a  common economic space. And an attempt is made even to decipher  these terms.    Article 3, say, specifies the free movement of goods, a  coordinated tax, price, foreign economic, and customs policy,  and the harmonized economic legislation of the Contracting  Parties. But what is meant by this free movement of goods,  primarily for Ukraine? If we are guided by the treaty, Ukraine  is required to provide for the unimpeded transit across its  territory of goods from the customs territories of other  countries of the Economic Union or any third country. That is,  Ukraine will once again be left with precious little, as it was  in the times of the USSR.    Free trade does not, incidentally, prevent the importation  into Ukraine of commodities exerting a negative influence on its  environment. No provision is made together with the abolition of  tariff and nontariff regulation and the lowering and elimination  of duty, taxes, and charges for the preservation of  quota-determination for commodity imports and exports. For  Ukraine such a state of affairs--Viktor Pynzenyk is absolutely  right here, incidentally--is unequivocally disadvantageous  inasmuch as it has a negative balance of payments with Russia.    [Oleynik] The treaty provides for concerted tariffs on  materials-handling operations. As experts maintain, it is in  fact a question of regulation of the rate of profit of Ukrainian  transport enterprises. They note the improper formulation of the  question of the parties' "common customs tariff" and the  "coordination of the participants' foreign economic trade."    [Petrenko] The disastrous consequences for Ukraine, as an  independent subject of foreign economic activity which is only  just attempting to plug its national economy into the system of  the world economy, are obvious in this respect. If we keep to  the letter of the treaty, the doors to the market of European  states will be closed even more tightly to Ukraine. And, believe  me, we will be guaranteed technical and technological  backwardness even longer.    According to Article 7, the parties "will pursue a  coordinated policy in the sphere of the development of transport  and communications geared to the efficient transportation of  freight." It is a question, of course, of freight that is  shipped via Ukraine. It is reasonable to ask: Why is particular  emphasis being put (for the umpteenth time) on the transport  system? The answer lies right there on the surface--thanks to  exploitation of Ukraine's transport systems and enterprises and  the elimination of taxes and charges on freight (Articles 5 and  6) that is conveyed across our borders, the parties to the  treaty will strengthen the economy of their states at our  expense.    And what price the explanations in Article 9 to the effect  that the parties "will undertake without mutual concordance  unilateral actions of a noneconomic nature to restrict access to  their markets." How is the term "of a noneconomic nature" to be  qualified? Economics, just like nature, does not have things  that are purely independent of something or other or of  consequences. Who has computed what restricted access to CIS  markets of its rolled metal and machine-building and chemical  products would cost Ukraine? Thus Ukraine is on the one hand a  subscriber to the treaty, on the other, sanctions of a  "noneconomic nature," which would inevitably entail not only  financial but also social difficulties, could be applied to it.    [Oleynik] How are we, from the viewpoint of an independent  state, to understand Article 13, which says that "...The Parties  will coordinate their investment policy... in sectors of mutual  interest."    [Petrenko] We could agree to this were we to forget that the  imperial system of management in Ukraine bled the national  economy white, leaving us a deformed structure of industry. But  we would then have to forget about the main assignment of the  current and prospective development of the economy of Ukraine--a  reorganization of its economic structure for the needs of the  populace.    Articles 14 and 15 speak of the creation of an interstate  free trade association, according to which the Ukrainian  currency would belong to a multi-currency system, and the  Russian ruble would be detached as something intermediate  between multi- and mono-currency systems. We are talking about  the formation of a currency union which is to provide for mutual  settlements based on a common (reserve) currency. It is not hard  to foresee that the functioning of the currency union will  ensure only the stability of the ruble, and the national  currencies of the other states will be working concertedly for  the accomplishment of the goals identified by the "ruble"  currency union.    And Article 16 proposes the creation of a payments union,  which would provide for payments in the national currencies via  multilateral clearing in the Interstate Bank of the CIS. This  union is intended for the achievement of the full convertibility  of the currencies as integration processes intensify and would  necessarily be transformed into a unified currency system. It is  clear even to the nonspecialist that we are talking about the  restoration of the Soviet settlements system.    [Oleynik] But perhaps these are, indeed, merely proposals?    [Petrenko] An analysis of the treaty testifies that the  ultimate goal of the Economic Union is gradual deprivation of  the independent states first of economic, then of political  levers. The proposed methods and principles of the formation of  a currency and monetary system among the states of the CIS are  not news, incidentally. They existed at the time of the Council  for Economic Mutual Assistance, but in this case the authors of  the treaty took account of the CEMA omissions. The mechanism of  mutual settlements and influence on the economy of the  participants in the CIS Economic Union which has been created  blocks as much as possible the structural reorganization of  Ukraine. This is evident from the content of Articles 17 and 18,  which "guarantee" for the Ukrainian currency a Procrustean bed  until such time as the Russian ruble becomes fully convertible.  Only after this, if we have not lost the state by this time,  will it be possible to commence structural transformations of  the economy, but this will be many times harder to do than now.    [Oleynik] And what will guarantee the standardization of the  tax system of the participants in the Economic Union, which  presupposes a common mechanism of taxes and tax rates?    [Petrenko] Harmonization of tax policy based on a unity of  methodology of consideration of production costs is required of  the parties to the treaty. Article 29 proposes for this the  creation of common executive and coordinating institutions. What  does this mean? That we have, in fact, to give up our own tax  system, which is essential for strengthening our economy, and  hand over the planning of all processes of economic life to  supra-state executive and coordinating institutions.    In addition, the Economic Union specifies that within the  framework of the treaty the leadership of the states' foreign  economic relations shall be exercised by a discrete organ of  administration. It should be expected that it will in time be  accorded the functions of central organ of planning of the CIS  states in the sphere of foreign economic activity. The  performance of the said functions will inevitably entail the  creation of a vast bureaucracy, and a great deal of money will  be spent on this. At the same time, on the other hand, Russia  has thus far blocked all questions concerning the shareout of  assets earned together, the gold and currency reserves, the  Black Sea Fleet, and such.    Thus the Economic Council in the form in which it exists  today and in which Ukraine has already agreed to participate  with associate-member status will accomplish the intentions of  the neo-allies and deliver a crushing blow to the sovereignty of  Ukraine. Following which it will take us a long time to approach  even today's level of political and economic independence.</p>

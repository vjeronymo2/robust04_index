			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- For the first time in 10 years  Indonesia's non-oil exports have declined, rising concerns in a  cabinet meeting on economy at the Bina Graha Presidential Office  here yesterday.    "President Suharto ordered related ministers to study the  causes of the decline in non-oil exports in January and learn  why the changes in demand were taking place." Minister of  Information Harmoko made this announcement after a limited  cabinet meeting on economy.    Harmoko said that Indonesia's export of non-oil products  fell  by 11.7 percent to US$1.89 billion in January from $2.14 billion  in the same month of 1993, while export of oil and gas declined  by 10.9 percent to $763 million from $856.31 million.    Indonesia, however, enjoyed a trade surplus of $597.2  million  in January despite of the export decline, he said.    The January imports fell by 3.9 percent to $2.05 billion  from  $2.14 billion in the same month last year.    The country's exports have already fallen by 4.9 percent to  $3.19 billion last December from a year before due to a sharp  decline in oil prices on the world market.    "The government will soon take concrete measures to boost  the  country's non-oil exports," Harmoko said. [passage omitted]    Harmoko said that the cabinet meeting also dealt with  inflation which fell to 0.7 percent last month from 1.76 percent  in February and 1.25 percent in January.    "The inflation of 3.71 percent in the first three months of  this year is far lower than 6.44 percent in the same period of  last year," he said.    According to the government, the high inflation rate in the  first quarter of last year was caused by increases in fuel  prices, electricity billing rates and transportation fares,  while the high rate in the January-March period was caused  mainly by floods and increasing demand for goods prior to last  month's 'id al-fitr holiday.    The government, under its State Policy Guidelines, is  committed to keeping the rate of inflation to a maximum of five  percent per annum.    The information minister said that last month's inflation  was  caused by increases of food prices in the capitals of the  country's 27 provinces by an average of 1.6 percent. The prices  of housing increased by only 0.07 percent and other goods and  services by 0.04 percent.    Even though the food prices rose by an average of 1.6  percent, The prices of rice fell by an average of 2.44 percent  to Rp [rupiah] 609.29 (28.4 U.S. cents) per kilo last month from  Rp 624.58 in February due to the start of the harvest season in  the country, he said.    He said the money supply increased by 8.9 percent to Rp  40.35  trillion as of January from Rp 37.03 trillion as of last  December.    Harmoko said the meeting also discussed the damages of rice  and secondary crops caused by floods in Java, Sumatera, Sulawesi  and West Nusa Tenggara.    "The president wants a delay for the repayment of credits by  farmers whose crops have been damaged by floods," he said.</p>

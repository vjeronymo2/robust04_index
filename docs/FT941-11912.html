			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan braced for US pressure on trade Japanese officials were braced for more pressure from the US over contentious trade and economic issues with the arrival in Tokyo yesterday of two senior US government officials. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy, arrived in Tokyo yesterday evening for a series of high-level talks with senior Japanese officials aimed at breaking the impasse in the bilateral negotiations to open Japan's markets to foreign goods and services. They are scheduled to meet Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and the heads of the foreign, trade and finance ministries in a search for progress in trade negotiations which have been hampered by big differences over the setting of numerical indicators to measure progress in increasing access to Japan's markets. That Mr Kantor and Mr Cutter have come to Tokyo with no staff - an unusual step - also reflects US hopes that an agreement is more likely to be secured on a political level, rather than through negotiations with the Japanese bureaucracy, whose staunch resistance to numerical targets has already tried the patience of the US negotiating team. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, said the government should look to the private sector to break the deadlock in bilateral talks on trade in vehicles and parts, one of the most contentious issues in the framework negotiations. The government can only act as a go-between in the car talks, which would best be resolved through private-sector negotiations, Mr Hata commented. Meanwhile, Mr Hosokawa met Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, over the weekend. According to Japanese press reports, he asked Mr Toyoda if there was anything the industry could do to take the negotiations forward and was reminded of the private sector's stance against setting numerical indicators. Nevertheless, despite reassuring signs from politicians, there is some concern in the car industry that Mr Hosokawa could cave in to US pressure. 'Politicians look at it from a different perspective from bureaucrats, who think mainly about what is good for the industry. If the politicians decide that it is important enough for US-Japan relations,' they might just agree to US demands, one industry official said.</p>

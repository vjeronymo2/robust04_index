			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke rally The recovery in Ladbroke shares continued, following denials that Mr Michael Hirst, the director whose share sale last week triggered a dramatic fall in the stock, had sold the remainder of his holding. Mr Hirst, who runs Ladbroke's Hilton hotel division, had around 150,000 shares left after selling just under half that amount last month. That sale was accompanied by speculation that Mr Hirst would leave Ladbroke which was fuelled by admission that his position with the company was under review. Ladbroke yesterday denied that Mr Hirst had made any further disposals. The shares added 5 1/2 to 161 1/2 p in brisk turnover of 7m. There were suggestions in the leisure sector that Forte was considering putting its motorway service stations up for sale. Analysts estimate such a move could raise around Pounds 300m for the hotel group but most are dismissive, pointing out that Forte has recently invested heavily in French service stations. Forte shares advanced 2 to 248p. The sale of 5.6m shares in Greenalls Group by Greenall family trusts rattled the drinks sector as questions were raised over the motives for the disposal. The move took the family interests down from around 12 to 9 per cent. The shares, sold at 396p, were placed with institutions by Cazenove at 400p. The stock retreated sharply on the news, but recovered as the company placated the market over the sale, closing 6 down at 409p. Exceptionally heavy trades in Goal Petroleum hit the Seaq ticker in early trading, prompting some expectation that a large corporate move could be in the offing. Closer scrutiny showed that the deals, involving almost 39m shares traded at 30p a share reflected Norwich Union, the big insurance group, carrying out a bed and breakfast or tax-related trade involving its 29 per cent stake in the company. Goal settled a penny off at 51p. The oil majors suffered from growing worries that US investors have been reducing their holdings. BP, roughly handled by the market in recent sessions as many of the big US investment banks have been offering stock in the company, fell a further 5 1/2 to 315p on turnover of 11m shares. Shell was resilient ending 2 cheaper at 693p on 4.7m traded. Burmah Castrol closed 16 lower at 799p, after one broker cast doubts on the benefits to Burmah and highlighted the impact a a weak world steel market on Burmah's Foseco subsidiary. The banks sector came in for a hammering as a leading marketmaker unloaded stock acquired in a programme trade on Thursday and Kleinwort Benson was said to have downgraded NatWest. Earlier this week, the sector had been one of the market's best performing areas, as a build up of institutional demand uncovered a series of big short positions on marketmakers' trading books, Abbey dropped 15 to 466p, Barclays 19 to 611p, Lloyds 20 to 621p and NatWest 21 to 594p. Pharmaceuticals stocks were badly hit yesterday as US investment funds sold heavily in the afternoon. There was a transatlantic tussle over Glaxo with UK investors supporting the stock but losing out and seeing it fall 15 to 682p. SmithKline Beecham dropped 7 to 375p in the 'A's and Wellcome lost another 29 to 627p following investor concern over the company's top-selling anti-herpes treatment, Zovirax. Television group Yorkshire Tyne Tees slipped 11 to 161p ahead of full-year figures next week. Analysts are looking for a loss of around Pounds 8.5m although one said: 'The real worry is not the exact level of the loss but the implications of air-time sales prospects for the current year.' There have been suggestions that LWT might try and ward off the bid from Granada by forging a link with YTT. But the mechanics of a tie-up are complex and the market was happy to wait and see. LWT rose 7 to 592p. Granada lifted 12 to 496p. Building group AMEC announced it had sold its stake of 10.6m shares in Trafford Park. The shares went to the market at 89.5p and were sold on at 90p. Trafford shares stayed steady at 96p, AMEC gained a penny to 117p. An upgrade in Cadbury Schweppes by house broker Hoare Govett helped the shares gain 19 to 479p as other analysts prepared to do likewise in anticipation of a round of meetings with the company next week. Geest has also been visiting brokerage analysts and is in upbeat mood. The shares added 12 to 336p. Powerscreen International climbed 11 to 283p after issuing a statement denying any knowledge as to why the shares had fallen so rapidly and refuting allegations of a tax probe.

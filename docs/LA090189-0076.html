			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PACKED CSUN HALTS SPRING ENROLLMENT;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS WEIGH PENALIZING SENIORS WHO DON'T GRADUATE  </P> <P> Officials of Cal State Northridge clamped the lid on spring enrollment  Thursday. They also described a proposal to make getting into classes harder  for seniors who stay at the university long after becoming eligible for  graduation.  </P> <P> Packed classrooms have forced CSUN officials to limit the number of students by  moving up admission deadlines. "We're trying to bring down the number of  students and to prevent classes from being overcrowded," university spokeswoman  Ann Salisbury said in announcing that CSUN is accepting no more undergraduate  students for the spring semester.  </P> <P> There is no formal deadline, but officials generally have been closing spring  enrollment in the fall.  </P> <P> When fall classes begin Tuesday, CSUN will have 29,400 students, about 600  fewer than the first day of the fall semester last year, said Lorraine Newlon,  director of admissions and records. The school's capacity is about 30,000, she  said.  </P> <P> To allow more students a chance to attend CSUN, Newlon said, campus officials  are talking about giving longtime seniors last choice of classes during  registration. Making registration difficult for seniors who have at least 60  units more than the 124 needed for graduation might encourage them to graduate,  she said.  </P> <P> Now those students are given first choice.  </P> <P> "If they are just playing around, it's not appropriate that they have high  registration priority," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eligible Students Don't Graduate  </P> <P> Newlon said several hundred students are eligible but choose not to graduate.  </P> <P> The average CSUN graduate has taken 140 units, she said. "That suggests that  some of our students are not making the fastest progress toward graduation."  </P> <P> The plan would not penalize students who take more than four years to graduate  because of full-time work or because they have changed their area of study,  Newlon said.  </P> <P> Statewide, students at Cal State campuses are taking longer to graduate than in  the past, said Ralph Bigelow, director of analytic studies for the university  system. In 1980 about 44% of the senior class graduated in its senior year, in  1986 only 35%.  </P> <P> It is not known whether the explanation lies in students' working or choosing  to take extra classes, he said.  </P> <P> This summer, CSUN officials considered starting to penalize longtime seniors  this fall. Instead, they postponed action to create a program to reward seniors  who have filed for graduation. Those who have applied to graduate in the spring  are being granted priority over other students registering for fall classes  under a new computerized registration procedure.  </P></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: British Steel in talks with Swedes British Steel and Avesta, the Swedish stainless steel group, are close to agreement on creating one of the world's largest stainless steel producers with annual turnover of about SKr13bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and production of 700,000 tons. Avesta said it hoped the deal would be completed by early next month, although British Steel said that discussions about possible collaboration were at a preliminary stage. British Steel said it was not possible to provide any details about the nature of any partnership as the talks had not yet reached that stage. Any new conglomerate is likely to be jointly owned by the two companies, though Avesta added the talks were based on the assumption that it will remain an independently listed company. Sir Robert Scholey, chairman of British Steel, is understood to be playing a leading role in the talks.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / People: Lucas recruits from customer Lucas Industries, the Midlands-based motor and aerospace components manufacturer, has found a senior executive from its biggest customer, Ford, to fill the finance director spot left vacant when David Hankinson resigned unexpectedly in March. Belfast-born John Grant, who joined the US motor giant in 1967, has worked his way up through the treasury side of Ford in both Europe and the US, becoming treasurer of Ford Europe in 1985. Later appointed executive director of corporate strategy of Ford based in Detroit, he had been a key player in the acquisition of Jaguar in 1990, and hence was drafted in, as deputy chairman and number two to Bill Hayden, by Ford after the purchase. With his planning and finance background, his job was to map out a fresh business plan for the luxury car-maker that fitted in with the style and expanded resources of the new parent. While some saw him as the heir-apparent to Hayden, who retired in the spring, he clearly did not have the strong engineering and manufacturing background - the areas Ford had identified as priorities for attention at Jaguar. After the appointment of Nick Scheele to the top job, Grant stayed on in the UK with a 'special assignment' to Jaguar Sport for a few months. By the time his next assignment emerged, executive director of international financing at Ford Financial Services Group, Lucas had already made the approach - although Grant still took up the Detroit job before the Lucas offer was finalised. Sir Anthony Gill, Lucas chairman, believes 46-year-old Grant, with his auto industry and international financial experience, will complement well the skills of Tony Edwards, 47, the former head of the aerospace division, who is now group managing director and chief executive designate. Grant's predecessor, Hankinson, also came from a car manufacturer - in his case Rover. Grant joins at the beginning of September, about six weeks before Lucas, which has been hard hit by the recession, unveils its results for the year to July 1992. ***** Barry Gibbons has taken another step towards GRAND METROPOLITAN's boardroom with his appointment as chairman of Burger King. Gibbons, 46, former chairman and managing director of GrandMet Retailing, was sent out to Florida from the UK as chief executive of Burger King to mastermind the restructuring of the US fast food chain soon after it came into the group with the 1989 Pillsbury acquisition. 'He has achieved an exceptional record of accomplishments in management and improved profitability,' said Ian Martin, GrandMet's chief operating officer, whom Gibbons succeeds as head of Burger King. Gibbons, already a member of GrandMet's group operations committee which deals with development policy and strategy, will now function 'as Burger King's link to GrandMet,' Martin added. At the same time, James Adamson, president of Burger King's US retail arm, has been promoted to the new post of chief operating officer, worldwide. Adamson, 44, who has overseen improvements in service, marketing, and profitability in the company-owned US outlets, will be responsible for operational standards of the business throughout the world.</p>

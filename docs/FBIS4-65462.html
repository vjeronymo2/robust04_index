			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F> Georges Potriquet, place and date not given: "Growth Will Be  Stronger Than Expected"]    [Text] [Potriquet] Brussels has just raised its economic  growth forecast for 1994. Will you do the same for France?    [Alphandery] We should indeed exceed our initial 1.4-percent  growth rate forecast. Three indicators are encouraging. First  of all, there is the European Commission's decision to raise its  projected growth rate for France. The Commission had only  credited us with a mere 1 percent this year. Today, it  anticipates a 1.6- percent increase in France's GDP. According  to this forecast, we should do better than our German and  Italian neighbors this year, and reach a 2.8-percent growth rate  in 1995, a performance better than Great Britain's. Mention  must also be made of the manufacturing industry's index, which  rose by 2.2 percent in the first two months of the year. To be  sure, measures taken last January have given a boost to the car  industry. But things have improved in all other sectors as  well. Last, the third encouraging indicator is the fact that  the economy as a whole has started creating new jobs: 20,000 in  the first quarter, which is more than expected. We had only  expected such results to occur during this years's second  quarter. Furthermore, the service sector has created 53,000  jobs. And this is the sector in which progress is likely to be  the strongest.    [Potriquet] So will you revise official figures soon?    [Alphandery] We do not change our figures on a daily basis.  Our new projections will be elaborated this summer as part of  the 1995 budget exercise.    [Potriquet] Economists did not expect a very moderate growth  to have any positive impact on employment. However, recent  figures show an improvement. What is it that has changed in the  French economy?    [Alphandery] A major factor early this year were the  measures taken by Edouard Balladur in favor of the car industry,  which were based on our proposals. We achieved our objective as  those measures had the intended impact. Should we be satisfied  with this in a country that still has 3.5 million unemployed?  Obviously not. All we have achieved so far is two out of three  goals. The first one is a substantial decline in the rate of  increase in unemployment. Currently, the average monthly  increase is only 4,000 to 5,000. The second goal is getting the  economy to start creating jobs again. This is where we now  stand. However, we shall only reach our objective when the  curve reverses, that is when net new job figures are enough to  absorb the natural increase of the active population, an  increase estimated to be 120,000 persons this year. What is  encouraging is that activity is likely to increase while  cyclical unemployment should decline. Moreover, we note that  structural measures taken in the spring of 1993 have begun  producing their intended impact: qualification contracts,  employer-supported apprenticeship contracts, lower charges on  unskilled labor, etc.    [Potriquet] Will such evidence of recovery make you abandon  any further support measure this year?    [Alphandery] The government remains highly attentive to  economic activity. Again, we are headed in the right direction.  We need to look at this performance in the European context.  Two days ago, for example, the Bundesbank lowered its discount  rate to 4.5 percent.    Pressure is being decreased with care being taken not to  harm  monetary stability, which is all in our economies' interest.  But is not this also a consequence of a "French-style,"  recovery-oriented economic policy, initiated by Edouard  Balladur? This policy consists of three components. First,  renewed confidence through gradual restoration of economic and  social equilibrium.    Second, savings consolidation, which funds economic recovery  through increased short-term savings.    This was the goal of the various measures taken to redirect  funds invested in monetary open-end funds toward private  housing, and to support economic activity through the bond  issues and privatization, which have already brought in 95  billion francs over 10 months.    The third component is a series of temporary measures meant  to stimulate the real estate market last year, and the car  industry in January 1994.    [Potriquet] Will there be more stimulating measures this  year?    [Alphandery] In the current situation, we have every reason  to be confident that the French economy's outlook is good.    However, we remain pragmatic and attentive. When you have  had your head under the hood every day in order to get the  economic engine running again, it is quite stimulating when  first results begin to appear.</p>

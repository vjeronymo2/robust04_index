			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: A new bout of ERM tension AFTER a two day lull, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was the scene of new tensions yesterday, with the French franc falling towards FFr3.40 to the D-Mark while the Irish punt remained at the bottom of its ERM bands, writes James Blitz. The speculation against the French franc and other European currencies remained weak compared to the tensions of the early autumn. However, a comment from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Deputy President of the Bundesbank, that German interest rates 'are not too high' confirmed the view that ERM pressures are unlikely to be eased soon by a fall in the Bundesbank's official rates. A principal beneficiary of yesterday's tension was the dollar rather than the D-Mark. The US currency rose to a high of DM1.6060, helped by the impression of it as a safe haven currency. It later closed slightly higher on the day at 1.5980. Inside Europe, the focus of interest was the Irish punt. Some dealers think the currency may be devalued this weekend. The punt continued to hover a shade above its floors against the Belgian franc and the guilder, but there was no selling pressure with overnight interest rates at 100%. Otherwise, the day was marked by another setback for the French franc. Mr Tietmeyer's comments and a rise in French unemployment to 2.93m combined to bring the franc down to a close of FFr3.393. The prospects of a devaluation of the French franc seem slim. The devaluation of the French franc would be the end of the ERM, the Bonn-Paris axis, and the basis of the policy of Presidents Kohl and Mitterrand. But there are gloomy views this weekend about the forthcoming prospects for the currency. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, says that there is an increasingly probability that the French will succumb to a devaluation. He believes that yesterday's rise in unemployment will again focus the attention of Mr Beregovoy's government on whether short term interest rates can remain above 9 per cent. 'In the run-up to the national assembly elections in France, the government will do its best to cut rates,' says Mr MacKinnon. Mr Brendan Brown, chief economist at Mitsubishi in London, believes that France's recent intransigence over the US/European trade deal may blossom into serious tensions in the Franco-German relationship. 'How could the Bundesbank be persuaded to help out the French again, as they did in September ?' he asks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "`Situation Room' Will Also Be </F> Set Up in Moscow"]    [Text] Another sphere of cooperation has emerged in  Russian-U.S. relations -- between the National Security Council  in Washington's White House and the Russian Federation National  Security Council.    The "Memorandum on Cooperation in the Sphere of National  Security," the draft of which Security Council Secretary Oleg  Lobov has submitted to the [U.S.] White House, and of which we  have a copy, notes that the following will be considered  top-priority areas: "National security in the economy, ecology,  and in the sphere of preserving the health and gene pool of the  nation, and the fight against crime, international terrorism,  and the drugs mafia."    If Washington finds the draft acceptable, the memorandum  will  be signed within the next few months during a return visit to  Moscow by Anthony Lake, assistant to U.S. President for national  security affairs.    The memorandum, which typically contains at least two  references to the fact that the implementation of the  cooperation programs will depend on the availability of  sufficient funding in rubles and hard currency, regrettably does  not give a clear idea of how specifically these programs will  supplement those already being implemented by the Foreign  Ministry and the Department of State, the defense ministries,  and other U.S. and Russian departments.    Oleg Lobov's delegation was impressed by the so-called White  House Situation Room, where the U.S. top leadership convenes in  crisis situations and where, in ordinary situations, information  about events in the United States itself and abroad is amassed  and systematized. It emerged from a conversation with the  Russian National Security Council secretary that there are  already plans to set up a similar situation room in Moscow in  one of the former Central Committee buildings on Staraya  Ploshchad.    "How much will the project cost?"    "There are no figures as yet regarding cost," Oleg Lobov  replied, "but the expenditure will undoubtedly pay off."    The expenditure will presumably be considerable, given that  the room will be equipped with the same computers and other  modern equipment as that in Washington -- if not better.</p>

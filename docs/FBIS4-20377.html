			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Molin (2799 1075 2651): "A Correct </F> Understanding and Application of the Statistical Data `Net  Farmer Income'"]    [Text] "Net farmer income" is an important indicator for  the degree of prosperity of the peasants and for the degree of  development in the rural economy. It is an important basis for  an accurate analysis of rural affairs and for the determination  of strategy and economic policy in rural development. How are we  then to accurately understand and effectively apply the  statistical data "net farmer income"? The following points will  have to be paid attention to and to be fully mastered:    First, sampling network points have representative character  but are not the same as having sample households all over the  area. Investigation by sampling is a scientific investigative  method done by first subjecting only one portion of all the  units within a whole to investigation, and to infer therefrom  the properties of the whole. The selection of the 20 sample  counties and 1,600 sample households of Jilin Province was done  as required in the uniform scheme of the State Statistical  Bureau. It used the average per capita income of the preceding  three years, lined it up upward and downward, compiled it into a  framework, and adopted the method of random starting points and  symmetric equidistances. Scientific tests have shown that this  set of network points enables a better than 95.45 percent  control, and that error in per capita income is limited to below  3 percent. Its representative character is not adversely  affected by the way the samples are distributed. Therefore, when  using "net farmer income" in analyzing problems, one may have  confidence in the representative character of the "net farmer  income" gained from the sampling carried out by the [official]  statistical agencies.    Second, peasant income is not the same as cash income.  According to the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau,  "net farmer income" comprises two components: all cash income of  the peasant household (deducting what has to be deducted) and  all agricultural and sideline products produced and consumed by  the peasant himself, converted into money. For instance, the per  capita income of a peasant in Jilin Province in 1992 was 807.41  yuan, of which 411.84 yuan was cash income--making up 51 percent  of his net income--while the remaining 395.57 yuan were material  income converted into money. Therefore, when using "net farmer  income" in the analysis of certain problems, it is necessary to  distinguish between cash income and material income converted to  money, and to then deal with the proportions of each part, so as  to gain accurate control of the level of commodity production  and the purchasing power of the peasants.    Third, the net farmer income level is not the same as actual  degree of prosperity. Net income of peasants is an important  indicator for the evaluation of the peasants' prosperity, but it  is not the sole indicator. The peasant's income is the  comprehensive result of the peasant household's income from  productive operations and from nonproduction-related income,  while poverty or prosperity of the peasant household depends on  many historically related factors. Therefore, when using "net  farmer income" in the analysis of poverty and prosperity of  peasant households, it is necessary to simultaneously include in  the analysis many other conditions, such as financial claims,  financial obligations, ready cash, deposits in banks and credit  cooperatives, and production-related or nonproduction-related  fixed assets.    Fourth, the average level of net farmer income is not the  same as equality of levels. For instance, in 1992, a peasant's  average net income in Jilin Province was 807.41 yuan, which  shows, in the overall view, that the living standard of the  broad masses of peasants in Jilin Province has gone up from  subsistence level to a comfortably well-off level, but that does  not mean that every peasant household has reached that level.  There have been almost 30 percent with incomes of over 1,000  yuan, and 11 percent under the poverty level (at per capita 400  yuan). Therefore, when using "net farmer income" in analyzing  the overall level of the production and living conditions of  peasant households, attention must be paid to the imbalance  among the various units under the cover of the average figure.  Attention must also be paid to the fact that basic data control  be established as regards the differentials among the units, so  that guidance is given in a classified way, and that common  prosperity for all be promoted in order to achieve it as early  as possible.    Fifth, the cash proportion in the peasant's net income is  not  the same as actual buying power. Purchasing power of the peasant  (comprising purchases of means of production and means of  livelihood) is indeed manifested in the cash portion of the  peasant's net income, but not all cash income constitutes actual  purchasing power. Some money is needed by the peasant to repay  debts, some money is needed for other than commodity-related  expenditure (for instance, for school and sundry expenses,  travel expenses, etc.), some money is saved to be later used for  other purposes, etc. Therefore, when using "net farmer income"  for analyses in the problems of purchasing power, it is  necessary to pierce the outer appearances and effect specific  analyses. The question what proportion within the cash income  constitutes actual purchasing power must be investigated and  researched in a thoroughgoing and meticulous way, according to  market situation and the consumption psychology of the peasant  households.    Sixth, "net farmer income" is not the same as actual output  value. If we compute "net farmer income" from products of animal  husbandry, it would comprise income from actual sales and  products produced but consumed by the peasant himself, converted  to money. Livestock on hand and increases due to breeding, as  long as not sold and also not consumed by own household, are all  not counted as income of that year. However, in some localities  when testing and verifying "net farmer income" large livestock  on hand, life pigs and poultry are all converted to money and  included in that year's income. That is a case of mixing up the  computation of "income" with the computation of "output value."  Therefore, when computing and verifying "net farmer income," it  is absolutely necessary to first clarify the concepts of  "income" and "output value," and to master the scope and methods  of measuring each of these different factors, so as to  accurately use these two indices.</p>

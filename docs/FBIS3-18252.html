The four  planes had been shot at only after two warnings had been given,  Vogel told journalists in Bonn today. NATO had adhered strictly  to the UN resolution on the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The shooting down was the "bitter, but necessary" consequence  of the conduct of the downed pilots and their commanders. The  federal government was confident that the peace process in the  former Yugoslavia would not be held up by the incident.    A spokesman of the Federal Defense Ministry confirmed that  German servicemen were also aboard the AWACS reconnaissance  aircraft that coordinated the NATO operation. At the same time,  he stated that the deployment of German servicemen on AWACS  aircraft had been declared constitutional by the Federal  Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.</p>

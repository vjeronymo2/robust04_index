			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Danger and decadence go to rot - Fine arts Of all the artists who achieved an international super-stardom in the 1980s, the German painter, Anselm Kiefer has, until now, seemed one of the more interesting and substantial. Through all those febrile neo-neo years of figurative expressionism revived, his work, darkly histrionic and angst-ridden as it was, had at least the merits of a singular and consistent vision, founded in the actual, integrated working of image, material and surface. Those brooding, portentous edifices, monumental interiors, devastated landscapes, black and umber, dense with matter worked into the paint itself, caught and held the imagination as true images and reflections of the times we live in, fraught with the imminent possibilities of danger, decadence and decay. And now, with this latest show, filling Anthony d'Offay's three galleries, he reveals himself as being as shallow and vacuous as the rest of them - Baselitz, Chia, Clemente, Schnabel, such names to conjure with - standing on the conviction that to strike an attitude is enough. No question now of the practical need to resolve and realise an image, to engage and develop an idea, with all the difficulties and contradictions inherent in the labour itself: the only imperative is to propose the image. Clearly he has come to believe his own critical myth, that his every mark, his every gesture, indeed whatever he cares to lay hands on and cast arbitrarily upon the floor like runes, are thus of the deepest significance. How else to explain these slack and empty canvases, these perfunctory terraces and colonnades of a sub-Piperian theatricality, indifferently over-laid with dried stalks and drooping leaves and sunflower heads: how else to make any sense of these little heaps of assorted rubbish, all so beautifully presented in their glass cases? The kindest thing is to be like the sunflower oneself, and turn the head away. Saddest, or perhaps most cynical of all is the installation that is given one whole gallery to itself. Women of the Revolution consists of 27 more or less identical institutional metal-frame single beds, the mattresses and sheets of lead, and each with a slight hollow and puddle of water in the middle. They are set out around the room, casually out-of place as in a long-abandoned dormitory. A rough label on the wall gives each bed to a particular woman associated in some way with the French Revolution - Marie-Antoinette, Charlotte Corday, Madame Roland: victims, heroes, villains? Who would say? A large photograph shows a man walking away down a muddy track between the fields. And there are more sunflowers, hanging upside-down, and a few gardening tools here and there. This, we are told in an explanatory text, 'is probably Kiefer's most complex work to date . . . Every one of these elements has a complex role to play . . . But knowledge of all the . . . references is not essential . . . this is a work illuminated by the spectator. Like the moon (it) is a mirror. The lookers may not like what they see there, but that is the force of the work . . . It is about individuals and . . . about society. It is about history and memory, but most of all it is . . . about human psychology.' It is, in short, about everything and about nothing at all, a pretentious, sub-theatrical, pseudo-historical presentation that, as Humpty Dumpty would say, 'means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.' If we dislike it, or take issue with it, we have missed the point. Heads he wins, tails we lose. The question remains to haunt us still. Was he always like this, and we mistaken, or this but a passing phase and aberration? The point is made the more forcibly by the direct comparison now possible with the work of the Spanish painter, Antoni Tapies. He is now nearly 70, but the work at the Serpentine dates from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the years of his early maturity and burgeoning reputation. Even so the work has been too seldom seen here, and the reputation more taken on academic trust than openly acknowledged. A generation has grown up to whom this rich, romantic expressionist abstraction must come as a considerable and, I hope, salutary shock. So: you would have thick, encrusted paint swept across the canvas, would you, and dark hints of old and decaying surfaces, and of the earth itself, nostalgie de la boue? Well here it all is, and done with such simple, rapid command and magisterial authority as to take the breath away. How rough and radical it all once seemed, and how seductive and convincing now. The format is simplicity itself, the canvas large but not enormous, still able to accommodate the natural scope of hand and arm, the image barely more than a simple block, vertical set upon horizontal. The colour is dark, the tone deep - umber, ochre and sienna, grey upon grey, differentiated as much by texture as by hue. The pigment is laid on in thick impasto, the thickness exploited or violated by vigorous jags and scorings. The imagery hints at ancient doorways, lintels, paving, monumental city walls, and yet seldom flirts with any direct reference or representation. The painting is what it is, to be taken or left for what it is. It is all beautifully done, and, at the Serpentine, beautifully shown. The moral too, should we choose to point it, is simple enough: that the work, having been proposed, is then engaged, resolved and sustained. The artist engages in no polemic, sets out no programme of half-baked social or historical concern. He relies on no list or label to confer significance. He accepts his responsibility to the work itself, working the surface directly until, intuitively, it comes right by the measure of his own experience and imagination. The work is the work is the work. Anselm Kiefer - Women of the Revolution - Anthony d'Offay Gallery , 9, 21 and 23 Dering St, Wl until July 24. Antoni Tapies - Writing on the Wall: The Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens, W2 until August 9</p>

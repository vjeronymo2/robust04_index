			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  has denounced the fact that the Land Transfer Program [PTT] for  former guerrillas is at a standstill. Meanwhile, the United  Nations has appealed to the government to resolve issues pending  in the peace agreements.    Antonio Alvarez, of the FMLN's Secretariat of Agrarian  Affairs, questioned President Cristiani's announcement regarding  the deadline to fulfill this point of the peace agreements.    [Begin Alvarez recording] The current problem is that the  implementation of the PTT remains at a standstill. Some 100  properties from the first phase have not been legalized. These  properties would benefit 5,000 landowners and former guerrillas.  To date, the first phase has not been completed and the second  phase has not begun; it has not even begun.    In the second phase, there are 1,879 properties located  primarily in Morazan and Chalatenango Departments. The  properties in the second phase would benefit 20,000 landowners  and former fighters who are still awaiting the legal transfer of  lands. I am talking about 111,000 manzanas.    The government pledged to guarantee the transfer of 1,300  properties in Morazan and Chalatenango after noting it had  encountered judicial and legal difficulties in registering them.  Their registration would require an exceptional judicial, legal  decree which the government promised that the Legislative  Assembly would approve, but to date this has not happened.  Therefore, it is impossible for these 1,300 properties to be  legalized.    The delays in the first and second phases involve 1,989  properties and 20,000 landowners and former fighters.  Therefore, I would characterize as incredible and unrealistic  President Cristiani's remarks to the effect that by 31 May the  PTT will have concluded. He knows perfectly well that this  assertion is neither true nor realistic. We believe this  program will take much longer. [end recording]    Alvarez said the government's land transfer proposal does  not  take into consideration the UN's stipulations regarding the  number of beneficiaries.    [Begin Alvarez recording] We maintain that the government  must adhere to the figure established in the UN General  Secretary's 13 October 1992 proposal, which is 32,500. The  problem is that the government has registered less landowners  than the 32,500 stated in the UN secretary general's proposal.  Therefore, there are 6,500 landowners who are living on  properties that have owners whose names can be verified, who  have not been registered by the government, and who, therefore,  have been excluded from the government's lists. [end recording]    To this end, the FMLN representative gave assurances that  this situation will foster social unrest. He added that to date  the government has not provided any loans to the former  fighters, which will hinder the country's next agrarian cycle.</p>

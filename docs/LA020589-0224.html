			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BILLBOARD AD FOR LAGUNA AUDUBON  </P> <P> Have you noticed the billboard on the Santa Ana Freeway as you approach Laguna  Canyon Road (California 133)? It depicts various wildlife on a hillside  silhouetted against the night sky. It is an advertisement for Laguna Audubon, a  development project by Katherine Thompson Land Developers.  </P> <P> It gets pretty tiring being taken for a fool by these developers and their  advertising tactics. How dare Thompson depict on her billboard the very life  her company has destroyed? This sign is supposed to give us a sense that the  Audubon is one with the land and animals.  </P> <P> Are the developers really any different than the power-crazed governments that  send us into war? No. Because developments such as Laguna Audubon, Laguna  Laurel and Irvine Coast (to name a few) benefit only the developers and their  "generals," i.e., Harriett M. Wieder. They are not solving any existing  problems in our country, state, county or towns. They are not housing the  homeless or providing truly affordable housing for our hard-working,  middle-class American families.  </P> <P> Fortunately we have groups like the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and citizens  working for slow growth to balance the scales of justice.  </P> <P> DIANA MATTMANN  </P> <P> South Laguna  </P></p>

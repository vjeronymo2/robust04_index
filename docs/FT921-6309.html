			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Slight upturn augers well The first set of monthly figures produced in 1992 by Investment Property Databank, a property research group, shows signs of a slight improvement, following a shaky end to last year. The total return for January was 0.3 per cent, which resulted in a year-on-year total return of 0.4 per cent. This was the first positive year-on-year return since July 1990 and an increase of 1.2 per cent on the previous month. The year-on-year figure for capital value growth also increased, from -7.9 per cent in December to -6.9 per cent. The decline in rental value for the year to January was 4.2 per cent, a less pronounced drop than in previous months. A comparison between the sectors showed that industrial property mustered the highest return in January, 0.9 per cent, followed by retails with 0.5 per cent and offices at -0.2 per cent. Retail property made a poor showing in January with a fall in both rental and capital growth to -0.1 per cent and a fall in total returns to 0.5 per cent. Yields moved outwards by 0.11 percentage points to 8.8 per cent. In January, the office sector registered a -0.9 per cent fall in capital values and a total return of -0.2 per cent. Yields moved out to 'within a whisker' of 10 per cent. The industrial sector made a total return of 0.9 per cent for January, giving a total return for the year to January of 8.0 per cent.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Canada draws up plan for welfare reform Canada's Liberal government yesterday issued a discussion paper on reforming the social safety net, aimed at getting all 10 provinces to help improve work skills and move the jobless away from reliance on unemployment insurance. But Mr Lloyd Axworthy, minister of human resources, left his proposals vague and without cost estimates to try to head off a gathering storm of provincial opposition. The government is committed to pruning the social welfare system by several billion dollars. It now accounts for nearly CDollars 40bn (Pounds 18.8bn) a year of federal spending. The proposals include limiting child tax credits to lower income families and redesigning unemployment insurance, a solely federal programme, to limit benefits. Federal funding for university education would also be reformed, while retirement savings could be tapped to finance university education.</p>

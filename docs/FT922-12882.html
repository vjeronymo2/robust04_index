			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Panguna mine to remain shut for some time THE PANGUNA copper mine on Bougainville island in Papua New Guinea is likely to remain closed for some time, Bougainville Copper said after the annual meeting in Port Moresby yesterday, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Bougainville Copper, which is 53 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian resources group, said studies indicated the mine would cost up to kina 450m (Dollars 470m) to reopen. Panguna has been closed since it was attacked in 1990 by pro-independence guerrillas of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, which is fighting for secession.</p>

Attention has been  drawn to the fact that Saudi King Fahd refrained from receiving  King Husayn, who visited Saudi Arabia for the first time for  four years. Our correspondent in Amman, Randah Habib, has this  report on the interpretations heard in Amman today on this lost  opportunity to normalize relations between Amman and Riyadh:    [Begin Randah Habib recording] The meeting, which did not  take place between Jordan's King Husayn and Saudi King Fahd  during the former's visit to Mecca, echoed Saudi Arabia's  refusal to normalize its relations with Jordan--relations that  deteriorated during the Gulf crisis. The Jordanian officials,  however, emphasize that King Husayn's visit was confined to  performing the minor pilgrimage in a holy place that is open to  all Muslims and that Jordan has not requested a meeting with any  party. Nevertheless, Amman, according to the same officials,  would have appreciated some cordial gesture by the Saudis.    Diplomats in Jordan had expected a Saudi-Jordanian summit  during the king's visit, the first in about four years. A  Western diplomat today said the failure to hold a summit was  considered an insult, which is not characteristic of Arab  tradition, nor is it common for a head of state. He described  King Husayn's visit as an outstretched hand, extended to shake  the hand of the Saudis. [end recording]</p>

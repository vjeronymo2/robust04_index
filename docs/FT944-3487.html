			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: China and 1997 It is in everybody's interest that the UK's handover of Hong Kong should be a success. Britain needs a dignified exit from its colonial past; China requires a prosperous and peaceful Hong Kong if it is eventually to reintegrate Taiwan. As 1997 gets closer, China will increasingly be calling the tune. The question is how it plans to use that influence. Last weekend's meeting in Beijing of China's preliminary working committee, which is examining details of the handover, was not encouraging. China plans to install a provisional Legislative Council in 1997 in place of the body elected next year under Governor Chris Patten's reforms. It has now made clear it intends that council to run for at least a year. It is also prevaricating about the shape of the court of final appeal which is to be the territory's supreme legal authority after 1997. This is unsettling, not only because Britain thought the arrangements were already agreed. Without some guarantee of judicial continuity, Hong Kong's future looks deeply uncertain. China will damage its own interests if it lets rancour over electoral reform impede practical progress on the handover arrangements. There is a pressing need to ensure that Hong Kong can remain an economic and social success after 1997. Civil servants need to be sure their careers will continue after that date. The business community needs to know that the provisional LegCo will not be used to impose capricious and repressive legal changes that will undermine confidence in the economy. To prevent a legal vacuum, China should agree quickly to the establishment of the court. It may be unable to go back on its LegCo plans. But when Chinese officials meet their British counterparts in London this week, they could at least make a categoric commitment to limit the scope of the provisional council's mandate to passing essential legislation, rather than allow it to enact more far-reaching changes. For its part Britain should leave the door as wide open as possible to practical co-operation, allowing formal contacts between government officials and the preliminary working committee and taking more care to consult on policy. One problem is China's apparent obsession with the notion that, since it will not recognise the Legislative Council elected under the Patten reform, it will also not recognise any laws it passes. That only makes for maximum uncertainty. A more constructive approach would be to work for a good showing by pro-mainland parties in next year's elections. The world would then see that Hong Kong's Chinese citizens did not all view 1997 as a threat. Many are deeply patriotic and would welcome reversion to mainland rule were it not for their fear of the Communist party. Beijing cannot succeed in this enterprise unless it tries harder to win the hearts and minds of the Hong Kong people.</p>

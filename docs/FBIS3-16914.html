Replying to criticism directed against the Polish-Lithuanian  political treaty that was initialed in Warsaw last Friday,  Brazauskas suggested his political opponents to think whether  "we are moving toward the future, or do we live only in memories  of the past."    The treaty is sharply criticized by certain political forces  in Lithuania because it does not mention the 1920 occupation of  Vilnius and its region by Poland.    The Lithuanian president expressed hope that "our nation  will  have enough common sense and vital strength to go beyond this  limit.    "We must see the future instead of choosing only historical  evaluations and trying to determine our relations with a  neighboring state through that prism." Brazauskas noted,  however, that "nobody will forget history."    The president recalled the post-war experience of Western  Europe where former enemies started to create the EU only ten  years after World War II. Brazauskas said people in these  countries and their leaders tried to be tolerant and to  cooperate with neighbors. "Our policy is the same and we will  adhere to it."</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: How well is your portfolio doing? - Barry Riley considers a test of its strength Did your professionally-managed portfolio achieve a total return before tax, but including both income and capital growth, of 26 per cent in 1993? If so, says Robert Brown, you can be satisfied. If not, you might want to hear the excuses of your investment manager. Private clients of investment managers and stockbrokers have, for too long, been fobbed off with inadequate information about how well their investments have performed, says Brown, who is deputy managing director of Cantrade Investment Management. To fill the information vacuum, he has devised the Cantrade Calculator: a three-part test of portfolio performance. In effect, he is proposing what professional investors - such as those who run company pension funds - call a benchmark, a measure of reasonable performance. There are both good and bad reasons why private client portfolio managers have been so coy. They will probably argue that their clients have such diverse requirements that any comparisons would be unfair and misleading. After all, the clients may range from aggressive gamblers to the fabled widows and orphans, with all shades of temperament and financial circumstances in between. Comparisons of individual portfolio figures with averages or benchmarks could create discontent if some clients have done worse than others in a particular period. It is widely suspected, however, that investment managers are inhibited mainly by their wish to cover up poor and fluctuating performance. In the ultra-competitive world of company pension fund management, where the figures are widely available, there has been a ruthless concentration of business in the hands of a relatively few successful managers. Dozens of others have lost out. In private client management, the sleepier firms do not want the same competitive climate to develop. Cantrade is a London offshoot of Union Bank of Switzerland, and emerged from the private client side of stockbroker Phillips &amp; Drew. It manages about Pounds 800m for private clients and charities and provides them with a comprehensive quarterly report, much on the lines of those which institutional managers give to pension funds. He has, therefore, developed a three-part test: Compare the results against the risk-free alternative of simply leaving all of the money on short-term deposit. There is no point in taking the additional risks associated with stock market investment unless there is a superior return. Compare the portfolio's total return with the rate of inflation. Is its value being preserved in real terms? Look at performance against the market. Cantrade says UK performance should be measured against the FT-SE-A All-Share index; overseas assets against the FT-Actuaries World index (in sterling); and defensive assets against the FT-Actuaries Over 5 Years Index-Linked gilts index. The first two yardsticks were scarcely very demanding in 1993 when inflation and interest rates were so low and market returns so high, but they might be more testing in other circumstances. A key aspect of the Cantrade Calculator is the benchmark provided by the model portfolio. This holds 50 per cent in UK equities, 20 per cent in overseas equities, and 30 per cent in defensive assets. The latter may include fixed-interest gilts and overseas bonds, together with cash, but Cantrade regards index-linked gilts as the 'definitive' defensive asset category. On the basis of the underlying index figures, the benchmark returned 8 per cent during the final quarter of 1993 and 26 per cent for the year as a whole. Brown claims this is a fair measure of how a typical private client portfolio should have performed before tax and costs, including management charges. 'Capital gains tax means that active strategic switching is not economic,' he says. 'This underlines the importance of a balanced core strategy.' Calculations made on the basis of historical figures show that the model portfolio would have returned 18 per cent a year on average in nominal terms over the past two decades, or about 9 per cent in real terms. The Cantrade Calculator will be updated quarterly and published for private investors holding diversified portfolios.</p>

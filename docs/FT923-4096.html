			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Athens strikers clash with police POLICE and striking workers clashed outside parliament in Athens yesterday a few hours before the introduction of a law reforming the state pension system. Bystanders fled as police fired tear gas at the strikers, but there was little chance of escaping the fumes. A traffic jam, the result of a traffic light failure across central Athens, added to the chaos in the city centre. A two-week strike by electricity workers, demanding to be excluded from the pension reform, has led to twice daily power cuts in the capital. Transport, banking and postal services are also affected by intermittent walk-outs. The new pension law, to be debated over the next week, is seen as the severest test yet of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis's resolve to carry through the toughest economic programme since the second world war. With state pension payments this year forecast to reach Dr2,172bn (Pounds 6.3bn), equivalent to almost 40 per cent of government spending, the system is in dire need of an overhaul. In addition, the government must cover an expected Dr250bn shortfall in contributions to the National Welfare Foundation, the main state pension organisation, as well as servicing its accumulated debts of Dr205bn. Reducing pension obligations is seen as an important part of attempts to cut government borrowing from almost 14 per cent of gross domestic product last year to the Maastricht requirement of 3 per cent. The new law calls for increasing contributions, cutting special allowances and gradually raising the retirement age to 65. Under present rules, Greek workers are eligible for a full pension after 35 years, while women can retire after only 15 years. The strikes seem set to continue, partly because resentment has been fuelled by austerity measures in the summer. These included price rises and the firing of 8,000 Athens bus company workers when the government decided to privatise the bus service after walk-outs by drivers.</p>

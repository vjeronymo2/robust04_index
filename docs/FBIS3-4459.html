He pointed out: rectifying unhealthy  tendencies in government departments and in various professions  and trades is one of the three tasks in combating corruption in  an in-depth, lasting, and effective manner. As it has a direct  bearing on the personal interests of a vast number of people, on  the image of the party and government, and on the overall  situation of reform, development, and stability, all government  departments, professions, and trades are urged to attach a high  degree of importance to work style rectification, to consolidate  work style rectification achievements, to exert greater efforts  to deepen the work, and to score even better results in work  style rectification.    On 24 and 25 March, Comrade Wei Jianxing presided over the  work style rectification forum attended by some ministries and  commissions of the State Council with a view to implementing the  CPC Central Committee's and the State Council's arrangements for  combating corruption this year and to studying main issues,  setting up goals, and adopting necessary measures in this year's  work style rectification. Attending the forum were responsible  persons from the Agriculture Ministry, Railways Ministry, Public  Health Ministry, Construction Ministry, Public Security  Ministry, Power Industry Ministry, Posts and Telecommunciations  Ministry; the State Education Commission; the People's Bank of  China; the General Administration of Customs; the State General  Administration of Taxation; and the State Administration for  Industry and Commerce. Also attending the meeting were State  Councillors Li Guixian and Luo Gan; and responsible persons from  the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and from the  Ministry of Supervision.    At the conclusion of the forum, Comrade Wei Jianxing  stressed: The key for carrying out in-depth work style  rectification lies in leaders of professions and trades  attaching importance to the work. Practice has shown that  leading comrades in party and government departments and in  professions and trades who personally take charge of the work  style rectification, who are good at integrating work style  rectification with reform and administrative tasks in their  departments, who are skillful at integrating  clean-administration building with honest performance of  official duties, always produce good results with work style  rectification in their departments and in their professions and  trades; failing that, it will be impossible to achieve  anticipated goals and the arrangement and the call for work  style rectification will end up as a haphazard and uninspiring  one.    Comrade Wei Jianxing stressed the need for leading cadres to  attach importance to work style rectification and to adopt  proper methods in profoundly carrying out work style  rectification. He called on all to pay attention to the  following four areas. First, stress important points and set  clear and definite goals. He said that as work style  rectification is a long term task, setting too many and too  sweeping tasks to be accomplished in one stage should be  avoided; instead, one should first select one or two important  issues, then set clear and specific goals, and go on producing  results in a down-to-earth manner. Second, explore a full set  of scientific methods for verification. Comrade Wei Jianxing  pointed out that ideological and political work, corruption  combating work, and work style rectification are like economic  work, scientific and technological work, and administrative  work; they not only require quality analysis but also quantity  verification; some of the work results may be verified; measures  to ensure the success of the work and conditions needed to  accomplish the task may also be verified. If we fail to explore  a full set of scientific methods, and if we limit ourselves to  making uninspiring calls and to presenting unimpressive reports,  then we will be unable to provide suitable guidance in various  areas of work. Third, show how the policy works. Units which  do an excellent job in work style rectification must be  commended and their experience promoted; units failing to  perform well in work style rectification must be criticized and  be given time for improvement. Fourth, treat the root cause and  symptoms of the problems at the same time. To deal with  problems which have emerged in the course of work style  rectification, efforts should be increased to raise ideological  level, to improve administration skills, and to constantly raise  the working level.    Comrade Wei Jianxing called on leading comrades at the CPC  Central Committee organs to do an even better anticorruption and  clean-administration building job and to take personal charge of  work style rectification in their own departments and in their  professions and trades. To further deepen the nation's work  style rectification, he also called on them to set specific  goals; to explore scientific verification methods; to work out  rational policies; to adopt sound systems; and to employ  scientific methods.</p>

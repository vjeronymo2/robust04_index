			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Brierley sells stake in CHH Brierley Investments has sold an 8.5 per cent stake in forestry group Carter Holt Harvey (CHH) for NZDollars 518m (USDollars 298m) cash to International Paper of the US. CHH was controlled by a joint venture of International Paper and Brierley Investments, with each partner owning a 16.5 per cent stake. Brierley will continue to hold 8 per cent of CHH through the joint venture company, and has no plans to sell further shares. It became a shareholder in CHH in 1990, when the group faced a liquidity crisis. Mr Paul Collins, Brierley chief executive, said the company had been a significant contributor to the substantial 'enhancement' of CHH's value. Brierley had stabilised the ownership structure, underwritten two capital issues which together raised NZDollars 855m, and set up the joint venture holding company with International Paper. CHH, now managed by International Paper, has large forests in New Zealand and Chile.</p>

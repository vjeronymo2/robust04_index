The report was prepared in  the short period of three months, thus making it inevitable that  it is lacking in terms of concrete policy direction. I would  like to examine the Hiraiwa report in terms of its content,  covering "economic reforms emphasizing consumer interests" and  "deregulation" as a means of enhancing its feasibility.    The final report (Hiraiwa Report published on 16 December)  issued by the Economic Reform Research Council, reflecting the  direction of Japan's medium- and long-term economic structural  reforms that were announced in December 1993, has met with many  negative evaluations such as "a report lacking specific ideas  and strong appeal." However, it should have been obvious from  the very beginning that, hobbled by an inadequate support staff,  it would be difficult to develop specific numerical goals in a  short period of three months.    The Hiraiwa Report is often compared with the Maekawa Report  of 1986, but both reports were prepared with the main objective  of clarifying basic policies for economic structural reform in  the midst of expanding imbalances between domestic and  international economies. In contrast to the fact that the  earlier Maekawa Report reflected the main objective of  international cooperation through alleviation of external  imbalances, the recent Hiraiwa Report reflects the main  objective of structurally converting the Japanese economic  system from one dedicated to "catching up with advanced nations"  to one that "emphasizes consumer interests." Further, a major  feature of the report is that it takes a positive approach  toward deregulation as a basic policy for attaining the goals of  the report.    However, the content of the recent "final report" gave the  impression that it "lacks specifics," not only because it lacked  numerical goals, but most likely because it provided inadequate  specifics about policy measures that were necessary to attain  the report's original objectives. Let us examine the specifics  of "economic reforms emphasizing consumer interests" and  "deregulation" presented in the Hiraiwa Report.  <H5>  Why Is Deregulation Necessary? </H5>   Logical expectations are that deregulation like  liberalization of trade will inspire comments from various  sources reflecting "agreement in principle, but disagreement on  specifics." Implementation of deregulation under such conditions  will require specific guidance.    First, we must clearly establish awareness of why  deregulation is necessary. The interim Hiraiwa Report limited  itself in this respect to "government controls have thus far  contributed to industrial growth and the stability of national  lifestyles, but they now obstruct changes in the economic  structure." However, establishment of national consensus on the  specifics of deregulation will probably require greater  clarification as to why once logical government controls have  come to intensify the rigidity of the economy.    In general, the influence of individual consumers on big  business is much weaker in terms of the ability to gather  information, raise funds, or have an impact on politics. The  resulting situation is one in which government is asked to  exercise control over business as a representative for consumers  in opposition to big business (New Industrial State  by John K. Galbraith). Accordingly, more than a few consumers  would probably feel insecure if the government's role in  supervising such businesses were to be reduced.    In response to such concern, a need exists to explain that  government controls have certain limitations in protecting  consumer interests. As an example, consistent with consumer  interests, government control of railway fares that are strongly  monopolistic regionally were intended to prevent unilateral  price hikes by railways. However, in reality, as long as a  standard for "appropriate fees" cannot be established in the  absence of market competition, government-controlled rates are  determined by adding a prescribed margin to cost. Under such  circumstances, railways are subject controled fare levels  regardless of their business efforts and it becomes more  advantageous for them to devote themselves to influencing  regulators rather than improving productivity. Under government  controls, businesses tend to "seek economic rent" rather than  "seek profit," which is a primary cause for consumer interests  to be sacrificed.    What means are available to protect consumer interests in  lieu of government control? The answer is the perspective that  "a true ally of the consumer is free competition among  businesses rather than government control" (Capitalism and  Freedom by Milton Friedman).    An important factor causing an increase in the demand for  deregulation has been that technical innovation, progress in  computerization, and economic internationalization have all  combined to provide for quantum advances in the effectiveness of  the competitive mechanism in the market place.    Regional monopolies are destroyed in areas such as  communications, thanks to the arrival of new technology or an  unanticipated new competitor. Further, the speed with which  information flows among consumers accelerates, enhances the  presence of potential competitors, and imposes difficulties in  attempts to raise prices. And, as the scale of Japanese markets  expands, sales efforts of foreign firms intensify and collusion  among Japanese businesses becomes difficult.    The foregoing thought process clarifies the priorities which  should be assigned to specific deregulation measures. At this  point, we can introduce the arguments contained in the Hiraiwa  Report calling for priority implementation of the "deregulation  in principle" relative to economic controls in areas where it is  easy to attain competition among businesses and intensify  cautionary measures relative to relaxation of social controls  which are not susceptible to easy attainment of such  competition. However, at issue is the fact that a distinction  has not been established between economic controls and social  controls.    Examples are the vehicle inspection system, which is a major  burden on consumers, and the Fire Prevention Law, which  prohibits self-service gasoline retailers common in both Europe  and the United States, which are both social controls and in  principle are designed to protect the safety of consumers.  However, in reality, they accomplish the role of economic  controls protecting the interests of the business world.  Accordingly, in the absence of a perspective which identifies  the beneficiary of deregulation, it would be difficult to  specify the effectiveness of deregulation measures. In this  respect, we could take the approach of uniformly implementing  economic deregulation on a nationally uniform basis, while  examining relaxation of social controls by regional government  entities on the basis of local conditions.  <H5>  What Do We Mean by "Emphasizing Consumer Interests"? </H5>   One of the four goals for economic reform envisioned by the  Hiraiwa Report is an "economic society that gives priority to  consumer interests." However, the reports fails to provide a  definition for the important term, "consumer." In general, all  people are concurrently producers and consumers. Accordingly,  unless we define who "consumers" can enjoy "priority" over, we  would probably be unable to develop an effective policy.    A concrete image of the "consumer" that can be built from  the  content of the "final report" is reflected in the three aspects  of consumer, employee, and local resident. First, consumer  interests can be protected by inter-business competition, as  discussed earlier. Opening of domestic markets will lead to more  active competition in the domestic markets, including foreign  firms, and will be compatible with consumer interests.    However, many consumer organizations have opposed from the  standpoint of safety the liberalization of certain products such  as agricultural commodities. The original purpose of such  consumer organizations was to seek abolishment of economic  controls such as import restrictions while seeking reinforcement  of social systems that ensure the safety of foodstuffs, but one  wonders why, in reality, they dedicate themselves to stressing  restrictions on the import of agricultural products. We believe  that such an approach is inspired by the fact that there is no  such thing as a pure consumer, that there is the duality that  consumers are concurrently producers and their actions reflect  unspoken antipathy for the increased competition that  deregulation would release.    If that is the case, it would probably be more useful to  take  the abstract issue of defining consumer interests and replace it  with something of more practical significance such as "the  interests of new market entrants." Increases in the number of  new market entrants in the market place threaten the rights of  existing businesses and require businesses to put more effort  into providing better service to the consumer in terms of price  and quality. Further, establishment of product safety would have  to represent the highest level of consumer service. Accordingly,  as long as consumers have appropriate information, existence of  new market entrants that threaten existing businesses should be  compatible with the interests of the general consumer.    At this point, we can identify traditional Japanese policies  about "protection of smaller businesses" as having a trade-off  relationship with consumer interests. Until recently, assertions  were made that farmers, small merchants, and financial  institutions were "economically disadvantaged" and that there  was social value in protecting the survival of such small and  midsized businesses from the oppressive competition of big  business. Such logic served as the reason for existence of the  Large-Scale Retail Stores Law which protected the interests of  smaller stores and served as a basis for frequent charges that  price competition occasioned by the entry of big business in the  market place violated the Antimonopoly Law in the form of  "dumping."    However, in reality, the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law was  useful in regulating new market participation by large retail  stores not only against small stores, but against existing large  supermarkets. This is a major reason why large supermarket  operators are not necessarily eager to see the abolishment of  the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law. Moreover, various financial  market controls designed to prevent the failure of small  financial institutions in the cause of maintaining confidence  and order have functioned to create excessive profits for the  leading banks.    Such measures reflected in government controls have caused  an  increase in consumer prices and a transfer of income to  producers. Considering such conditions, as long as we adhere to  policies that protect the existing inefficient existing rights  of small and midsized businesses, we will be unable to dispose  of a major portion of erstwhile government controls.    In the future, as downsizing of businesses progresses under  technical innovation and computerization and as  internationalization of business activities progresses, the  ability of small and midsized businesses to fine tune their  activities will increase in significance. Deregulation will  expand opportunities for new businesses, enhance the vitality of  new small and midsized businesses, and will play an important  role in expanding the job market. In that sense, the true value  of the Hiraiwa Report will depend on its ability to divorce the  so-called disadvantaged small and midsized businesses from the  sphere of the "consumer" which should be emphasized from a  policy viewpoint.  <H5>  Interests of Employees and Local Residents </H5>   Preserving employment is a major objective of government  controls, as is maintaining consumer safety. This fact is  increasingly important in today's recessionary period. At one  time, the government's role in the labor market was to dedicate  itself to restraining discretionary actions of big business  through government controls as a means of protecting employee  interests. An especially significant example was the Labor  Standards Law, which regulated occupational sectors and working  hours for females, who were once considered disadvantaged in the  work place.    However, continuing to regulate labor markets where advanced  education is stressed through the same regulations that  prevailed in the days of excess labor and the tragic history of  female factory workers will not necessarily promote employee  interests. Restricting potential work categories for females can  lead to excuses to discriminate between male and female workers,  and administrative guidance against cash payments for unused  leave with pay can result in a bonus for employers.    Of special note is that once the working-age population  begins to drop after 1995, the labor supply will tighten despite  a medium-term drop in the economic growth rate. Once that  situation arises, competition among businesses will function  more effectively than government controls in the interests of  consumers and employees. Increased competition among businesses  will require workers to be able to resign at will from their  current jobs.    The policy of Japanese employment practices that called for  preserving employment under all circumstances deprived, as  compensation, from employees their "job rights" on which  greatest importance was placed by European and U.S. labor  unions. As a result, many Japanese salarymen are subject to long  working hours, frequent reassignments, and transfers, and, once  they leave work represent impotent company employees who are  totally alienated from the local society in which they  physically reside.    Moreover, under Japanese employment practices encompassing  lifetime employment and promotions based on seniority, women  workers, who must deal with high career interruptions because of  child-bearing and job transfers by the husband, are handicapped  and must face large pay differentials between the sexes compared  to other advanced nations. In this sense, the terms "flexible  labor markets" and "jointly participating society of the sexes"  must have identified the employee's position as a "consumer."    Assurance of "job rights" enabling the individual to select  a  job for which he is best suited and the ability to acquire  skills that will not be degraded upon departure from a given  employer will serve as a most effective tool in coping with  mandatory retirement during recessions. Further, if the scope of  individual duties for white-collar workers were clearly defined  as is the case in Europe and the United States, paid leave could  be used on a programmed basis and adequate time could be  allotted to local volunteer activities through departure from  work at predesignated times.    Although little is said in the "final report," the  implementation of decentralized government authority should also  be a major goal in terms of promoting consumer interests. Under  current practice, local governments without financial backing or  substantial authority to establish budgets and tax systems and  the regional tax allocation system that which compensates for  losses function to significantly obstruct the growth of  autonomous local government (quoted from Escape From  Bureaucratic Concentration of Authority by Kazuo Yoshida).  Restoration of "consumer" interests for consumers, employees,  and local residents will probably become specific parts of the  basic "policy emphasizing the consumer."  <H5>  Misconception of a "Minor Government" </H5>   The "final report" also treats financial restructuring as a  major goal. In the past, Japan has been treated as a "minor  government" in comparison with those of European nations.  Certainly, a comparison of Japanese government expenditures and  ratio of government employees to the overall population  indicates that they are half those of principal European  countries. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the  Japanese Government is backed by a variety of industrial  protection policies that do not involve government  disbursements. In that sense, abuses which "exceed those of a  big government" backed by government spending actually exist.    As an example, policies protective of the farm sector are  broadly practiced not only in Japan but throughout Europe and  the United States. However, the major feature of Japanese farm  protection emphasizes the existence of a consumer burden calling  for stabilization of farm commodity prices at a high level  rather than a taxpayers' burden in the form of farm subsidies.  According to an OECD survey that quantifies and makes an  international comparison of costs associated with farm  protection using means other than government funds, consumer  burdens associated with price-support policies in Japan are  conspicuously higher than those of Europe and the United States  as shown in Table 1.    International Comparison of Farm Subsidy Burdens as a Percentage of GDP in  1992                  Percent of Burden                  Taxpayer         Consumer         Other         Total   Japan          0.5              2.0              0.4           2.1   United         1.1              0.5              0.0           1.5  States   EC             1.6              2.1              0.0           3.7   OECD           0.8              1.0              0.1           1.8   Data extracted from OECD Agricultural Policies, Markets, and Trade Report  of 1993.      Farm protection policies of this nature not only obscure  related costs in comparison to European and U.S. methods  involving government funding, but the economic costs imposed on  consumers relative to the variance in domestic and international  price differentials of farm products has become much larger than  those associated with subsidies.    The same circumstances prevail not only in agriculture but  are also common in all business protection policies, including  transportation and marketing. In other words, government funding  agencies have quietly established price and market participation  restrictions to prevent increased government funding burdens  associated with business failures, but the result has been the  creation of consumer burdens which exceed potential government  funding burdens. Further, such regulated industries tend to  pursue selfish interests and corruption becomes a routine matter.    If a major factor in the "success" of past government  funding  restructuring policies were attributable to automatic increases  in tax revenues and the transfer of burdens to consumers such as  discussed above, we must direct greater attention to the  trade-off relationship between deregulation and government funds  restructuring.    Future deregulation measures in individual sectors will  probably require temporary government subsidies for small and  medium businesses which will be adversely affected.    Such measures must encompass means that provide for lower  economic costs for consumers such as tariffs for rice imports  even if we speak of protective policies of the same nature.  Although such "subsidization of economic controls" are contrary  to the major objective of restructuring government funding  programs, they represent important procedures that cannot be  avoided in the effort to discontinue government controls which  are deeply involved with consumer lifestyles. In this sense, a  review of not only tax reforms, but the merits of past  government funding policies should serve as a major premise for  government funding reforms.  <H5>  Measures Necessary To Realize Structural Reform </H5>   According to the "final report," the Hiraiwa Report reflects  the strong "intention" to implement economic structural reform  and the basic direction of reform, but assigns responsibility  for development of concrete recommendations concerning  deregulation to an "influential third-party agency" to be  established in the future.    However, a sector that should be handled with priority by  such an agency is the quantification of costs for current  government controls. Generally, serious structural reforms  require not only the expression of strong intentions to realize  such reforms, but the indispensable task of detailed  quantification.    In the background of curtailing protective farm measures in  connection with the Uruguay Round were the political efforts of  the respective nations and long-term efforts of the OECD  administrative bureau to quantify agricultural protection costs.  Further, the Chekini [as transliterated] Report which outlined  the major plan for integration of Europe encompassed detailed  estimates of profits to be derived through economic integration.  Each of those estimates used macro indices to express the  benefits of economic structural reform.    Each of the government controls of the past were based on  individual reasons and once we enter into a discussion of  specifics concerning relaxation of controls, many opposing views  are confronted. Overcoming such opposition requires the detailed  quantification of the social costs associated with the  individual controls to the maximum degree feasible. Such  calculations can serve as a basis for estimating subsidies  required as compensation for deregulation measures.    A permanent agency which has the capability to conduct such  detailed quantitative analyses is the Economic Council. Further,  examination of medium-term macro policies and numerical goals  are the basic missions of the Economic Council, and the active  use of its services would be desirable. The expressed need to go  to the extent of organizing a "strong third-party agency" as  described in the "final report" could be the result of the  belief that the Economic Council cannot function properly in the  face of jurisdictional disputes existing among government  ministries and agencies. However, if that were the case, one  wonders how a newly established agency could overcome  interministerial and agency jurisdictional disputes.    Generally speaking, if the political leadership of the prime  minister is weak, the impact will be the same no matter the  nature of the new government agency established. Contrariwise,  if political leadership is strong, the issue can be adequately  handled through the use of an existing administrative agency. We  should learn from past experience with the former Domestic  Government Consultation Council and Foreign Relations  Consultation Council about to the disadvantages of establishing  a new "strongly integrated coordinating agency" for every  government reform project undertaken.    Finally, the "final report" has a phrase added which is  identical to that contained in the government reform  consultation report which reads, "Reinforcement of integrated  coordinating functions of the cabinet." However, we should  probably consider why reinforcement of integrated coordinating  functions could not be realized in connection with government  reform efforts of the past.    Generally speaking, the means for integrated coordination of  policy matters by a bureaucratic system are found in the  budgeting, organization, and programming functions. Of those  functions, coordination through budgeting is handled by the  Ministry of Finance, organization and personnel affairs by the  Management and Coordination Agency and National Personnel  Authority, and programs by the Economic Planning Agency.  However, in reality, the influence of the Budget Bureau of the  Ministry of Finance is overwhelming, and that bureau handles  integrated coordination functions on a de facto basis.    Albeit with a variety of stipulations, success attained in  the difficult project to restructure government financial  programs in Japan in the 1980's--considered rare even among  advanced nations--was largely attributed to the formidable  coordinating capabilities of the Budget Bureau. However,  although the strong integrated coordinating function of the  Budget Bureau which is not a part of the cabinet but a mere  bureau of a single ministry was effectively used in connection  with the limited objective of restructuring government financial  programs, it did not give adequate consideration to the  immensity of economic costs to the consumer. One result of that  failure is the expansion of the burden imposed on consumers  through controls which substitute for burdens imposed by  government funding programs as was typical with agricultural  protection policies.    Whether or not he succeeds in reversing such policies of the  past and allow for temporary government funding burdens to  promote a variety of deregulation measures--even after setting  aside objections of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance  for the sake of economic structural reforms--will serve to test  the political leadership of the prime minister.</p>

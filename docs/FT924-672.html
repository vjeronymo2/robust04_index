			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Russia's ousted reformer takes it all in his stride THE man President Boris Yeltsin called the cleverest Russian prime minister in decades was yesterday viewing his removal from the 'worst job any man could want' with equanimity and good humour. Although he never expected to stay in the job as long as he did, Mr Yegor Gaidar wishes he could have remained longer. The man who headed Russia's drive to reform its economy on market lines believes this would have allowed him to safeguard the mass privatisation campaign. In his first full interview since being rejected by the Congress of People's Deputies and abandoned by President Yeltsin last week, Mr Gaidar said the privatisation programme was at a crucial stage. 'It is very, very easy to destroy it . . . through just a few careless movements.' The granting, for instance, of any additional rights to workers would shatter a delicate compromise struck between the interests of the workforce, directors, and efficiency. Speaking in his new office as head of the Institute for Economic Problems in the Transitional Period, he admitted that his repeated attempts at financial stabilisation had amounted to improvisation. But he had little time for the sort of pro-inflationary policy likely to be embraced by his successor, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, saying it would probably make co-operation with the International Monetary Fund 'difficult for some time'. Unlike his foreign advisers, he refused to attack the west for not providing more support for his reforms - 'I never expected anyone to solve our own internal problems' - even though he admitted that he had used western promises of assistance as a political weapon to defend his reforms. He denied he could have done more to cultivate the powerful state enterprise managers. Mr Gaidar said he had no political ambitions in the foreseeable future, even though 'life is very long'. For now he would focus on writing a book and running the research institute he abandoned when he joined the government as deputy prime minister with a team of like-minded young economists in October last year. But among his bank of telephones is a direct line on which President Yeltsin, whose adviser he remains, can contact him at any time.</p>

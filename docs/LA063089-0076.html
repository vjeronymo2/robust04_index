			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE SHIP KILLER GETS REDUCTION OF SENTENCE IN CANADA  </P> <P> An American who beat his elderly employer to death with a whiskey bottle while  the two were on a cruise ship near here was sentenced Thursday to life  imprisonment on a reduced charge of second-degree murder.  </P> <P> Robert Frisbee, 62, will not be eligible for parole for 10 years, the minimum  for second-degree murder, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled.  </P> <P> Frisbee was convicted in January, 1987, of first-degree murder and sentenced to  life without eligibility for parole for 25 years in the slaying of Muriel  Barnett, 80, of San Francisco.  </P> <P> At Frisbee's trial, the British Columbia Supreme Court judge did not give the  jury "adequate direction on the question of whether there was proof of planning  and deliberation as distinct from intent," Appeal Court Justice W.E. Esson  wrote in reducing the charge.  </P> <P> Barnett's body was found Aug. 19, 1985, in the $2,000-a-day stateroom she  shared with Frisbee, her traveling companion. Prosecutors argued that Frisbee  killed Barnett because she was going to cut him out of her $3.7-million will.  </P></p>

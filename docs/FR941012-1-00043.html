			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The upper, lower, extreme left, and extreme right borders of the windshield are outside areas A, B, and C. The minimum percentage of required wiped area described in the RP decreases from the central to the outer zones. If installed as proposed, that is, within the upper windshield border, the transponder should be located well outside Areas A, B, and C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed transponder location would be near the top center of a one-piece windshield or on the passenger side of a multipiece windshield. This would place it well outside the area swept by wipers pivoting from below the windshield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAE RP J382, Windshield Defrosting Systems Performance Guidelines_Trucks, Buses, and Multi-Purpose Vehicles, provides a defrosting system performance guideline. Among other things, it notes that the windshield area to be defrosted ``was developed to be compatible with vision requirements necessary to operate trucks, buses, and multi passenger vehicles.'' This windshield area is based on SAE RP J941, March 1981 (Eyellipse), and SAE RP J826, April 1980 (Devices for Use in Defining and Measuring Vehicle Seating Accommodation). In a fashion similar to RP 198, this RP defines two areas: a central zone, Area C, and a surrounding zone, Area A. Angles up, down, left, and right are also defined, as in RP 198. The upper, lower, extreme left, and extreme right borders of the windshield are outside both of these areas. If installed as proposed, that is, within the upper windshield border, the transponder should be located well outside Areas A and C, as defined in this RP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) incorporate SAE Recommended Practices similar to those discussed earlier in this notice. FMVSS 103, Windshield defrosting and defogging systems, references SAE RP J902, Passenger Car Windshield Defrosting Systems. FMVSS 104, Windshield wiping and washing systems, references SAE RP J903a, Passenger Car Windshield Wiper Systems. Both of the FMVSSs apply to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses. (While the FMVSSs themselves have this broad range of applicability, they do not reference the truck and bus versions of the SAE RPs.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Research on Driver's Field of View  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four recent research papers discuss the issue of a driver's useful field of view (FOV). The first, ``A Study of Driver's Forward Fields of Direct View for Large Trucks,'' (N. Nagaike and Y. Hoshino,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> JSAE Review, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  January 1989, pages 74&hyph;76), reviewed factors governing the visible area directly ahead of large trucks. The research determined necessary visibility areas, depicted by vertical and lateral angles in a driver's forward field of view. Factors for determining these areas included locations of traffic lights and directional signs, the driver's ability to recognize stationary and moving objects, and the braking deceleration of large trucks. Data were collected from traffic accident records in Japan and from direct observation. While the visible area for traffic signals and road signs was recorded at angles above the driver's eye level, stationary objects, moving objects in the vicinity of intersections, and oncoming vehicles and vehicles in front of the CMV were shown to be located in visible areas below the driver's eye level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second paper, ``Research on Forward Field of View of Trucks,'' (Y. Siosaka and N. Nagaike, 14th Annual Technical Conference on Enhanced Safety of Vehicles, Munich, Germany, May 1994), presented a study undertaken to determine the minimum forward field of view required for driving in a straight line, in order more clearly to define the area swept by windshield wipers. Data on braking distance and merging behavior (specifically, gap acceptance) were collected from drivers driving on Japanese rural roads, urban streets, and expressways. The results indicated a ``driveable field of view'' extending from 5 degrees above horizontal to 5 degrees below horizontal, referenced to the driver's eye point centerline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

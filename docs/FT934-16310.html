			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: What they had to say 'Harold Macmillan once said 'exporting is fun'. It was one of his more Edwardian remarks.' William Waldegrave, public services minister 'As Conservatives we should be proud of wanting to turn the clock back.' John Patten, education secretary 'It is obviously no part of our purpose to compete with low labour costs elsewhere in the world.' Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury 'It's time to recognise that even the Conservative government has contributed to the perception that local government doesn't count.' Bernard Zissman, Tory group leader, Birmingham City Council 'She finds it difficult to come to terms with the man that has succeeded her.' Lord Lawson on Baroness Thatcher 'I became famous for being unknown, but over the last year I've been called a lot worse things than faceless: heartless, ruthless, even fatherless.' Peter Lilley, social security secretary 'At least John Smith has achieved something: he made Neil Kinnock look decisive, Michael Foot look electable, and John Prescott look like a statesman.' Peter Lilley 'If someone has 17 previous offences for robbery, it might just be a clue that while out on bail they'll do it again]' Lord Archer</p>

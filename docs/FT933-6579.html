			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Parts makers feel effect of German motor crisis THE EFFECTS of the crisis in the German motor industry showed up yesterday in poor first-half results at two leading parts suppliers. VDO Adolf Schindling, part of the Mannesmann group, recorded a loss, while Varta, the battery maker, saw net earnings shrink 75 per cent to DM5m (Dollars 2.9m). VDO said first-half sales had fallen 1.3 per cent to DM1.17bn, despite a 27 per cent rise in foreign turnover. Unofficial estimates put the loss at around DM50m. The group said it expected a deficit for the full year after a 15 per cent fall in turnover, although 1994 should show a marked improvement. It blamed the poor performance on lower volumes, price pressure and restructuring costs. Numbers employed fell by more than 800, and a further 1,000 German jobs are scheduled to go by April next year. Meanwhile, VDO is continuing to shift capacity abroad. Current projects include a possible joint venture in China. Works will be opened soon in South Africa and Indonesia, and negotiations are under way for a plant in the Czech Republic. Fichtel &amp; Sachs, another Mannesmann components maker, reported mounting losses earlier this week. Its deficit rose to DM98m during 1992, compared with a loss of DM68m a year earlier. New orders in the early months of the current year were stubbornly low, and the company suggested losses could increase again. Varta, a leading supplier of car batteries, said half of its 8 per cent fall in first-half turnover to DM1bn was a result of currency fluctuations. Recession had hit industrial sales, with car battery turnover dropping 13 per cent to DM363m. Turnover from power units for portable appliances was unchanged at DM403m. In the year to the end of June the company had cut its payroll by 8 per cent and reduced capital expenditure by 22 per cent. On the basis of 'modest' prospects for the rest of the year Varta said full-year earnings would be significantly lower than last year's DM50m.</p>

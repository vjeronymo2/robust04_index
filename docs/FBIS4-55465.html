			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "dos": "Idea of Union of Hungarian Parties Is </F> Not Feasible Before Elections"]    [Text] Bratislava--Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian  Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], considers the idea of  establishing a union of the four ethnic Hungarian parties,  proposed by the Coexistence movement, "not feasible before the  elections." As Bela Bugar said in an interview for SME, "The  Hungarian parties had a chance to prove that they are able to  cooperate. They have been unable to accomplish this in four  years." The process of approving the formation of such a union  by the political bodies of the participating parties cannot be  completed by the time of the elections, in his opinion. In view  of the fact that the Hungarian People's Party does not engage in  any activity, according to Bugar, the MKDH proposes the  formation of a coalition of three partners:  MKDH-Coexistence-Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]. According to MOS  spokesman K. Petocz, MOS is open to talks on any alternative and  positively assesses the fact that Coexistence proposes something  common for all ethnic Hungarian parties. As Petocz went on to  say, however, MOS "does not consider it fortunate to come up, a  few weeks before the elections, with proposals that are legally  vague and the practical implementation of which is unclear."  According to Petocz, the union would be the sole legal entity  within which the present parties could operate only as some kind  of factions. "We do not advocate the liquidation of pluralism  within the framework of the Hungarian minority and do not  consider it necessary," the MOS spokesman added.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Budget shopping Mr Norman Lamont continues to give every impression of succumbing to short-termism. When the last set of retail sales and unemployment figures turned out disappointing, his knee-jerk response was a full point cut in interest rates. Yesterday's improved retail sales figures for January prompted a quick assertion that there is now no room for more. Perhaps today's employment data will support that stance. But it will be awkward if next month sees another run of poor figures. Mr Lamont cannot easily change his mind again. It is not as if business on the high street is booming. January's 1.6 per cent rise in retail sales after December's 1 per cent fall points to faulty seasonal adjustment. The underlying trend shows only modest growth. Sales in the three months to January rose only 0.2 per cent over the previous three months. The main advance came from department stores able to offer large discounts and from food stores. If last Friday's inflation figures are anything to go by, demand was not strong enough to allow the latter to raise their prices much despite the devaluation. The basic message remains the same: consumers are prepared to spend, but not on credit and only if there is a price incentive. That should not tie the chancellor's hand. The real constraint is self-imposed. After a succession of warnings from the Bank of England, Mr Lamont has felt obliged to play along. But he may have deprived himself of the opportunity to announce a rate cut in the budget - unless he is also planning some painful fiscal tightening.</p>

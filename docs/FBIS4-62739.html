			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 14 May HOMMIKULEHT, p. 3, 16 May RAHVA HAAL, p. 1; </F> "News Bulletin" No. 93/94]    [Text] Further defence projects with Israel are possible,  Defence Minister Indrek Kannik announced in a telephone  interview during his visit to Israel.    Kannik announced that the Israeli company "El-Bit" has  expressed its interest in participating the contest for  suppliers of radar and surveillance systems for the border  guard. The Israel Aircraft Industries had mentioned possible  supply of aircraft, but Kannik stressed that both military and  financial aspects of the issue must be considered, due to  Estonia's limited resources.    The company TAAS Israel Industries had expressed its  interest  in the privatisation of the Estonian electronics factory Tarkom  in order to organise the production of telephones there. Kannik  also hoped that an agreement could be made, enabling to replace  the unusable weapons by fit ones. The Estonian General  Headquarters will have to present a list of equipment that needs  to be replaced, Kannik said.    Kannik met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Friday  [13  May] and discussed mostly general political issues, including  the Estonian-Russian negotiations.</p>

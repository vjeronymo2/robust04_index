			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Private sector joins TB fight AS a tuberculosis epidemic spreads in the US, the New York Public Health Research Institute yesterday announced an unusual collaboration between the public and private sectors to research the most deadly strain of the disease, multiple drug resistant TB. A new centre, devoted to TB research, will concentrate on this strain, looking at DNA fingerprinting, DNA patterns and drug resistance. New cases of TB, which seemed close to eradication in the US in the mid-1970s, increased more than 40 per cent between 1985 and 1990, and the growth rate shows no signs of slowing. Factors contributing to TB's spread include drug addiction, homelessness, overcrowded prisons with antiquated ventilation systems and the susceptibility of HIV-positive patients. According to the New York City Department of Health, nearly 25 per cent of first-time TB patients were resistant to one or more drugs, and nearly 50 per cent of previously treated patients were resistant. Participants in the centre include Pfizer, Hoffmann-La Roche and Lederle Laboratories.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal--recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel is suggesting that the Taba talks be  held on a continuous basis. The talks will resume on 10  January. Heads of both delegations, Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major  General Amnon Shahaq, will discuss the two drafts Israel and the  PLO have formulated. Several of the disputed issues in the  drafts are not at all simple: For example, control over travel  axes in Gaza, the size and authority of the Palestinian council,  the manner in which civilian authority will be transferred, and  other issues. [passage omitted]    A senior political source said today that it is worth paying  attention to the fact that the compromise formula makes no  mention of the demands Yasir 'Arafat presented in the documents  faxed to Israel over the last week. These demands deviated from  the Cairo understandings and even from the Oslo document of  principles.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> INJURY KNOCKS DUFF FROM STARTING ROLE  </P> <P> Jamal Duff, a freshman linebacker from Tustin, was one of the few defensive  players singled out by Coach Al Luginbill as having had even an adequate game  Saturday against Oregon. But only four days after playing what Luginbill called  "a tremendous football game," Duff learned that he lost his starting outside  linebacker spot to junior Lou Foster.  </P> <P> The circumstances were beyond Duff's control. He was kneed in the right  quadriceps by a teammate during the second half Saturday, forcing him to miss  practice Monday and Tuesday. And Foster, a transfer from DeAnza Community  College, is about 90% back from the hamstring injury he suffered early in camp.  </P> <P> Duff, who also has a chipped fracture in his right hand, practiced Wednesday  and is expected to play Saturday against Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate, but that's the game," Duff said. "I'll just have to work  hard to get my job back."  </P> <P> Duff, 6-feet-7 and weighs 225 pounds, said he could have played better against  Oregon. "I don't really feel like I was on my game. I missed too many tackles."  </P> <P> Other than the change at outside linebacker, Luginbill said all other starting  positions will probably remain the same. He said, though, that that could  change as late as Saturday night. "I won't be afraid to make changes  immediately during the game," he said. "The players were made aware of it." . .  . Luginbill said the intensity level has been "very good" in practice all week.  "We didn't have this kind of intensity in practice until the seventh game last  year. But I said that last week and look what happened in Oregon." . . .  Defensive end Steve Matuszewicz (left ankle) and free safety Zac Stokes (left  shoulder fracture) are out of Saturday's game. Luginbill said he is leaning  toward redshirting Matuszewicz.  </P></p>

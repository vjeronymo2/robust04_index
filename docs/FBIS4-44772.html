The special properties of these materials, such as  high temperature resistance, hardness, corrosion and wear  resistance, make sample digestion difficult. The Max Planck  Institute (MPI) for Metal Research (Bunsen-Kirchhoff-Strasse 13,  44139 Dortmund) has developed an alternative digestion method,  which works with fluorine gas as digesting agent.    As reported by Rainer Garten of the MPI, gaseous fluorine is  suitable for many reasons for digesting resistant materials. The  gas reacts with many materials as early as temperatures between  400 and 600 C, and it can be purified by distillation. The  fluoridation products created in the digestion are volatile and  can therefore be studied with gaseous analysis systems. Despite  these advantages, sample digestion with fluorine has been little  used so far. This is due to the difficult handling of the  elements which reacts very easily and to the so far still  limited availability of pure fluorine. Now, however, the element  can be produced in sufficient quantity and purity.    The digestion takes place in an apparatus made of pure steel  and monel. The reactor, in which the fluorine gas reacts with  the sample, is of pure nickel. Fluorine combines with the nickel  into a nickel fluoride protective layer resistant up to a  temperature of 700 C, which protects the reactor material.    The fluorine gas, condensed through cooling with liquid  nitrogen, is added to the reactor through vacuum pumps.  Subsequently, the reactor is heated to between 400 and  600 and the sample digested. In so doing the pressure in  the reactor increases up to 12 bar. The fluorine-containing  reaction gases are drawn off through a titanium dioxide  absorber. The fluoridated reaction products can then be analyzed  according to the degree of their volatility. Fluoridated  nonmetals and semiprecious metals are often volatile and can be  analyzed with spectrometry methods. Most fluoridated metals are  not volatile and are analyzed after dissolving them in mineral  acids.    Digestion with fluorine has proved itself particularly for  analyzing content materials. Studying purity is especially  important for this group of materials, since the properties of  the ceramics is greatly influenced by impurities.    Conventional digestion methods are either very  time-consuming  or falsify the analysis through impurities which occur during  the digestion process. But other materials, such as glasses,  ferobor, cast iron, plasma spray powder and tantalum silicate,  can also be successfully digested with the Dortmund method, it  is reported.</p>

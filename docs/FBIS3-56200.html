The </F> Federation Council in Figures"]    [Text] Like the upper chamber in the parliament of the  Russian Empire (the State Council), the Federation Council is  characterized by greater conservatism than the State Duma --  naturally so, of course. The typical Russian senator is a man  (95.3 percent) and a nonparty person (84.8 percent), aged  between 40 and 50. Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of North Ossetia, and Yuriy Chernichenko,  writer and leader of the Peasant Party, which is part of the  Russia's Choice bloc, (both born in 1929) can lay claim to the  title of the oldest members of the Federation Council, while the  youngest is Sergey Levitan, president of the "Nostromo" concern  (born in 1963).    Representation of the electoral associations and other  political organizations in the Federation Council is very  limited: Just 26 Council members (15.2 percent) indicated  membership of them. The undoubted leaders in this respect are  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (10 seats) and the  Russia's Choice bloc (eight Federation Council members). The  Agrarian Party of Russia, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord,  the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, the Labor Party,  the All-Russia "Renewal" Union, and the  Constitutional-Democratic Party (Party of People's Freedom), the  Union of Communists of Karelia, and the "Peoples' Cocreativity  in the Name of Life" association, which are little known to the  voter, each got one deputy into the upper chamber of parliament.  It seems that for the majority of "party" senators, as distinct  from State Duma members, membership of a particular pressure  group is secondary and unimportant.    The largest group of members of the Federal Assembly's  Federation Council is made up of heads of executive and  representative power in the components of the Federation.  Presidents, council of ministers chairmen, administration heads,  and governors make up 34.5 percent of the Federation Council (59  people). It is noteworthy that in a number of components of the  Federation two representatives of the top executive power were  elected simultaneously to the Federation Council -- such as, for  example, Kabardino-Balkaria, where both the president and the  prime minister became members of the upper chamber of parliament  (in this case we have placed the prime minister in another  category -- that of representatives of the local executive and  legislative power). Heads of soviets are represented  considerably more modestly -- 19 people, or 11.1 percent.  Members of the Russian Government, employees of the federal  executive, representatives of the president, and representatives  of components of the Federation under the president make up just  5.8 percent of the Federation Council (10 people). This enables  us to speak of the Federation Council as an organ representing  the executive and local elites. The total number of "senators"  in the categories we have enumerated is close to a qualified  majority (64.3 percent). The main thing in doubt is the  capacity for work of this section of the Federation Council and  the possibility, if only purely technical, of blocking State  Duma decisions with which a majority of Federation Council  members disagree.    Precisely 23 entrepreneurs were elected to the Federation  Council (13.5 percent). Their composition is substantially  different from those elected to the State Duma -- they are, as a  rule, leaders of major joint-stock companies and top managers of  giant state enterprises like Sergey Korepanov, director of an  office of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint-Stock Company. The  Federation Council does not have many jurists who were  professionally engaged in jurisprudence at the time they were  elected; in fact there are five (2.9 percent). There is the  same number of higher educational institution principals and  lecturers. There are three journalists in the upper chamber of  parliament (1.8 percent) -- as distinct from the State Duma,  they are not mainly party publicists but editors and creative  employees of popular local newspapers.    To judge from the initial characteristics of the membership,  one of the main tasks of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly's Federation Council will be to coordinate widely  understood local interests. I would like to hope that the  Federation Council members, Russia's senators, will proceed from  Russia's national interests in their approach to assessing the  State Duma's draft laws.</p>

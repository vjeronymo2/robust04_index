			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Foreign aid as vote winner - The UK general election has put overseas development back on the agenda of all political parties 'I was thinking,' I said to the lady in the Conservative party's research department, 'of writing something about the different parties' policies on overseas development - sort of, on the margin of the election campaign, as it were . . .' She bridled. 'I don't think it'll be on the margin. There's going to be quite a substantial passage in our manifesto.' This is interesting. Concern for the Third World, after all, is hardly a central feature of the Conservatives' brand image. One of the first things you learn, on opening the new Labour policy document on the subject1, is that 'since 1979 the Conservatives have cut the aid budget by 17 per cent in real terms - and by nearly half as a proportion of our national wealth, from 0.51 per cent to its present 0.27 per cent, its lowest ever on record'. These figures do not seem to be disputed by the Conservative party but the interesting thing is that it is not proud of them. What the party's research department wishes you to know is that 'Britain's aid programme is the sixth-largest among western donors - and growing2'. Both parties assume, in other words, that British voters, unlike their American cousins, like the idea of their money being spent on foreign aid. I need hardly tell you that the same assumption is made by the Liberal Democrats. Like Labour, they propose 'an increase in UK official development assistance to 0.7 per cent over five years' (a target set by the UN, which the government 'accepts in principle' although 'like its predecessors, it has no set timetable to achieve it'3). But the Lib Dems go further, recommending a further increase to 1 per cent over the succeeding five years (something stated by Labour as an 'aim' in 1987, but now dropped). The Green party takes the same position, while the Scottish National party, belying national stereotypes, is even more generous with the money of putative Scottish taxpayers: 'Scotland will accept as an immediate target for the aid budget the UN figure of 0.7 per cent of gross national product, but would aim at 1 per cent of GNP by the fifth year after independence.' Plaid Cymru, more prudently, confines itself to the statement: 'It is only when this minimum target (0.7 per cent of GNP) is achieved that we can show our real commitment to genuine development'4. These figures are inevitably quoted, because they are the simplest quantitative indicator of how much importance a country (or a party) attaches to overseas development. But all parties are quick to point out that such a crude total means little by itself. Aid nowadays is judged by its 'quality' as much as its quantity, and there are various ways that quality can be assessed. Does the aid reach the people who need it most, and does it address their 'basic needs'? Does it help to promote human rights, democracy or, more broadly, 'good government'? Does it promote development that is 'sustainable', in the sense of not wrecking the environment or consuming irreplaceable resources? Does it help people to become self-supporting, rather than turn them into permanent basket-cases? All those objectives are accepted by all parties as desirable, but they do not necessarily all point in the same direction. Giving priority to the poorest countries does not automatically benefit the poorest people, and targeting the poorest people will not always be the most effective way of stimulating development. 'Good government' may indeed be good for development, but bad government is often at least as much an effect as a cause of under-development, so that to withhold development aid from a country which has a bad government may simply help to perpetuate the vicious circle. It is often very difficult to know whether the potential benefit of a given project or programme outweighs the harm it may do by strengthening an oppressive government, or not. Such decisions need to be based on expert knowledge and detailed information, which implies a relatively large staff, possibly absorbing too large a share of the total aid programme. The present government has put 'good government' at the top of its list of priorities, while in the Labour document 'democracy and development' come second, after 'putting the poor first'. In the words of Mr Ed Mayo, head of campaigns at the World Development Movement, a cross-party pressure group: 'Although both parties do paint these two issues into their policy strategy, with their own emphases, the contrast is still strong enough for one to caricature what is on offer to voters as a choice between less poverty (Labour) and less tyranny (Conservative).' Labour perhaps strains credulity by promising to put 'development at the heart of government', but backs it up with a pledge to create a department of state, the Department of International Development, to be headed by a cabinet minister. The idea is to give development interests a direct voice in the cabinet, and help them to resist the distorting pressures of the Treasury, the Foreign Office (to which the present Overseas Development Administration is subordinate) and the Department of Trade and Industry. It has to be said, however, that the record of previous Labour governments is not encouraging. In 1964 and 1974 the development minister started off with cabinet status, only to lose it within three years as public spending came under heavier pressure. Moreover, while Labour is critical of the Conservatives for using the 'Aid-Trade Provision' to support British companies competing for contracts overseas, 'with virtually no meaningful attempt to impose development criteria', it no longer promises, as in 1987, to replace this provision with a Trade and Development Fund outside the aid budget. Instead, it merely says the option of transferring responsibility for it to the DTI 'will be considered'. Labour agrees with the Conservatives that 'trade has a bigger impact on developing countries than aid ever could or should have'. Yet it still leaves discussion of trade issues till last. Indeed the Tories themselves persist in using 'overseas aid' as the overall heading for their development policies. The arrangement of the Liberal Democrat green paper is more logical, starting with a discussion of the notion of sustainable development; discussing in more detail the environmental dimension, the people dimension (population, education, health, refugees) and development strategies; then a long section on trade policies and a shorter one on debt before it gets round to aid. No party seems to dissent from the view, expressed by the prime minister at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Harare last October, that 'there is little point in the developed countries providing aid for economic development if the developed countries then deny access to our markets for those very same countries'. The trouble is that, for all too many products, that is precisely what the developed countries do. The European Community is one of the worst offenders, and the chances that a Labour government will succeed in changing that, whatever the outcome of the Uruguay Round, seem fairly slim. 1 A world of difference: Labour's programme for aid and development (Labour party, Pounds 2.50 or Pounds 5). 2 Overseas Aid: the new agenda (Politics Today No. 2, Pounds 2). 3 Shared Earth: Federal Green Paper No. 15 (Liberal Democrats, Pounds 4.25). 4 Where the Parties Stand: WDM Guide for the General Election (World Development Movement, 25p).</p>

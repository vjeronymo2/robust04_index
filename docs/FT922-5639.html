			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities steady after political turmoil / Putting a week's events into context After a few days of rough and tumble, Brazilian stock markets have recovered since Wednesday, when President Fernando Collor de Mello's brother said that he had no proof of earlier charges of high level corruption, and drug abuse against his presidential brother. On Monday, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa index dropped 7.4 per cent, its sharpest fall this year, partly in response to allegations made by Mr Pedro Mello (as he prefers to be called) in an interview in a leading weekly news magazine. Equities then levelled off, in spite of rocky trading, on Tuesday, as the president ruled out the possibility of resigning or impeachment, and moved on to the offensive by launching a police inquiry, and legal proceedings against his brother for 'moral damage'. On Wednesday, the Bovespa rose 7.5 per cent to 25,388, and yesterday it put on 2.2 per cent by early afternoon. 'It was a good ending,' said Mr Alvaro A. Vidigal, Bovespa president. Other observers are more reluctant to put the lid on the Collor brothers episode. 'Right now, everyone wants to downplay these events,' said Mr Roberto Teixeira da Costa, director-president of Brasilpar Financial Services. 'With the meeting of the decade coming up (next week's environmental summit), we have got plenty of problems, and we do not need any more.' The medium term effects on the market are hard to predict, he believes. This week's events may serve as a cautionary sign to some investors, who had been stepping on the accelerator to push more money into Brazil. The prospects were, and probably still are, enticing: during the first four months of 1992, the Bovespa index had chalked up a 90 per cent surge in dollar terms and steady volumes of Dollars 100m or more. Last week, the central bank announced that Dollars 1.4bn entered Brazilian stock markets from abroad in the first four months of this year. With remittances of Dollars 359.9m, net investment was Dollars 990.6m - already topping the Dollars 570.8m registered last year, most of which entered after institutional investors were allowed to invest directly in Brazilian equities last June. Given enough confidence, there is room for more, say analysts. In Brazil, foreign investment accounts for about 4 per cent of equity market capitalisation, against 20 per cent in Mexico and 8 per cent in Chile. But the number of companies traded (570) in Sao Paulo is far more than for any other Latin American market. The enigma of Brazil's market is that it began catching foreign eyes before the country had completed the economic house cleaning that other countries in the region undertook at an earlier stage in their stock exchange development. Brazil has benefited from Latin America's improved image abroad, partly thanks to moves in other countries, where the structural reforms are more advanced and inflation is considerably more modest than Brazil's 20 per cent monthly average. 'Sure, Brazil is hitching a ride,' said Mr Julius Buchenrode, director for investments of the local subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank. 'But if it weren't giving off the right signals, the money wouldn't be coming in. With all of Collor's problems, he has made it clear that he will pursue structural and fiscal reform at any cost.' So far, most investors, both foreign and domestic, have found their opportunities in a handful of state-controlled blue chips. The four most traded issues account for three-quarters of Bovespa's activity. Telebras, the public telecommunications company, is alone responsible for more than half of trading. The next most active stocks are: Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining group; Petrobras, the state-controlled petroleum concern; and Eletrobras, the state-controlled energy company. These stocks have long been considered bargains, but the scene may be changing. Not long ago, traders habitually called attention to what they believed was a low price for Telebras stock in comparison with other Latin American telecommunications companies, such as Mexico's Telmex. Now many believe that Telebras is reaching its level. Mr Teixeira says: 'There is a saying: 'When you don't know companies, you buy names.' That also happened in Mexico and Chile.' He believes the early, 'smart' money gave the market an initial boost, but that now serious macroeconomic reform and company profitability should begin to weigh in more on market performance. Chase's Mr Buchenrode thinks foreigners are prepared to take the plunge into second line stocks. To date, low liquidity has been an additional deterrent to buying into the second line. 'There is concentration in blue chips. That's where the liquidity is,' Mr Buchenrode says. 'But when there is an offering of good paper, people snap it up.' Many 'second line' companies are industry leaders in Brazil, but nearly all have been hit hard by the current recession. Mr Buchenrode expects more new issues in the second half of this year, with greater use of underwriting. 'But companies won't want to make offerings when stock prices are below book value,' he warns.</p>

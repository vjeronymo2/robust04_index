			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 10 Mar [date as received] (ACAN-EFE) --  Honduran Army Chief General Luis Alonso Discua has ordered the  reinforcement of the nation's border with Nicaragua and ordered  troops to answer "with force" any armed groups of Nicaraguan  recontras.    A clash with these groups left three people dead on 8 April.  A Honduran corporal and two Nicaraguan guerrillas died in the  clash between a recontra group and the 9th Infantry Battalion  headquartered in Ojo de Agua in northeastern Honduras.    Colonel Hernan Seaman, 9th Infantry Battalion commander,  told  ACAN-EFE: "At dawn, the border had an increased military  presence because of Gen. Discua's orders. He ordered us to use  force and to repel the recontras to guarantee the safety of  people residing along the border."    The officer said the armed Nicaraguans who entered the  country "are criminal contra fighters who hid their weapons  following their 1990 demobilization." He added: "They are  currently attacking small businessmen, whom they targeted when  the contras were in Honduras, and are murdering peasants, raping  women, and raiding border towns."    According to a Honduran military report, some 12-15 men  brandishing "AK-47's, FAL rifles, and RPG-7 grenade launchers"  opened fire on an Army patrol on 8 April in the area of  Chilamates along the Nicaraguan border. Seaman pointed out that  Cpl. Santos Armando Dominguez, 21, died during the clash, as  well as two "recontras"; other attackers were wounded and  returned to their country. Cpl. Rodriguez was buried today in  the eastern city of Danli with honors corresponding to a "hero  who died while carrying out his duties." He was posthumously  promoted to sergeant.    Seaman also said that two weeks ago, two recontras attacked  a  Buenos Aires woman, whom they murdered by shooting her in the  mouth after stealing her television and radio. They later fought  with one of the victim's sons, who wounded one of the recontras  with a machete. The other recontra then shot the son.    Col. Seaman added that Nicaraguan authorities were notified  and that the two recontras were apprehended at a Nicaraguan  border town. He said that thanks to the Nicaraguan authorities'  cooperation, relatives of the slain woman will now be able to  take the alleged perpetrators to court.    The Nicaraguan Sandinist People's Army (EPS) has already  been  notified of the 8 April incident between Honduran military  personnel and an armed group that, according to Seaman, could be  linked to the recontras' 3-80 Northern Front led by Jose Angel  Talavera, a.k.a. "El Chacal." The armies of the two Central  American countries are carrying out joint exercises along their  common border to counter movements by armed groups in the area.</p>

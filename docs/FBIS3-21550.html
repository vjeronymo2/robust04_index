			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with chief of staff Anatoliy Lopata; </F> place and date not given: "Not Operational"]    [Text] Are the nuclear missiles stationed in Ukraine a  threat to international peace? Moscow says they are. For a  long time Washington also stuck to its anti-Ukrainian course,  while the Kiev government feels that it has been wrongfully  branded as the scapegoat. FOCUS talked about the background of  the missile controversy with Ukrainian Chief of Staff Anatoliy  Lopata. The 53- year-old former Soviet commander sees himself  as belonging to the new generation of the Ukrainian Army.    FOCUS: General Lopata, what is going to happen  with the 1,800 nuclear warheads and 176 missiles?    Lopata: We regard the nuclear arms as a legacy  from the Soviet Union. The missiles are under Ukrainian control  only in the administrative sense, while operationally they are  controlled by Moscow. We have no control over the guiding  systems, which means they are not operational for us. Ukraine  only services and maintains the missiles. They are rather like  red-hot coals that were put into our hands. We may turn them  round and round but they will always burn our hand.    FOCUS: How safe are the missiles?    Lopata: This question is one of our main  challenges. The SS- 19 are quite outdated systems. Each  missile base has exact rules for servicing. Both, the Russian  Defense Ministry and Ukraine are responsible for their  maintenance. Our joint responsibility has been settled in  treaties.    FOCUS: But there were problems with the Russian  specialists....    Lopata: You are right. Russia can use this lever  to exert political pressure. However, the supervisory guarantee  lies with the Russian specialists, and we have to pay them for  their services.    FOCUS: But they can also refuse to....    Lopata: No, they are bound by contract. As far  as the nuclear warheads are concerned, we must not forget that  all combat components were produced in Russia. Ukraine set up  the missiles, provided the bases, while the production center  was always in Russia. Hundreds of enterprises used to be  involved in one missile and its warheads. That is why the  treaty establishes that the very enterprise that assembled the  components is responsible for its return. Each missile has  certain dates for inspection. Sometimes the deadlines for  certain components are missed as a result of the political  insecurities. Nevertheless, we have so far carried out all  necessary work.    FOCUS: It has been said that the lifespan of some  warheads will expire in 1994.    Lopata: This year it affects only an  insignificant part of the warheads, 10 percent may have to be  inspected. Yet, next year it will be more, and so it will  continue year after year. The lifespan of most missiles does  not expire before the year 2000.    FOCUS: Does this means that the nuclear threat  remains?    Lopata: I would like to emphasize that Ukraine  does not regard the nuclear missiles on its territory as arms.  They are mainly of significant material value. Our objective  is to return the fissile material that is produced through the  destruction of the missiles, to Ukraine -- for our nuclear power  plants. The United States, Russia, and Ukraine have agreed  that, with the help of the Americans, Russia will take care of  dismantling the warheads and reprocessing the fissile material  and returning it to Ukraine. Of course, Russia would like to  keep its secrets.    FOCUS: Are there still any real secrets between  the major superpowers in this day and age?    Lopata: The greatest secret remains the  technology for the production in the individual enterprises.  The United States does not have systems such as our SS-24, and  will not have them in the near future, either. These are  absolutely new and powerful systems with a very high accuracy.  It is almost impossible to destroy these missile bases, even if  their location is known. After each strike the missile starts  automatically and carries out a counterstrike.    FOCUS: Yeltsin has promised that the missiles  would no longer be targeted at the United States. How can he  say that, considering that the missiles start automatically?    Lopata: When the program is removed the missile  cannot start. There is one program block that contains various  targets. Each target can be automatically selected, even during  flight -- yet if this block is removed all that remains is a  missile that is only potentially operational. I prefer not to  tell you for how long, though.    FOCUS: What is the nationality of the missile  personnel?    Lopata: The soldiers and sergeants are all  Ukrainian citizens, while at the level of officers it is about  50 percent. They all can choose their place of living and work  -- either in Ukraine or in Russia. This is the personal  decision of each individual. A large part was ready to swear to  defend Ukraine. Another part -- mostly Russians -- opted for  Russia. According to our estimates some 70 percent remain in  Ukraine. All this is taking place in a very friendly atmosphere.    FOCUS: Yet, in the Crimea things are different....    Lopata: True, but we are trying to solve the  problem with great caution. One condition is not to raise  mutual territorial claims. The future of the Black Sea fleet  and the Crimea are closely linked. It is not just a question of  dividing up the fleet but also of the territory of the Crimea  for the infrastructure of the fleet.    Communication systems, energy supply, and infrastructure of  the Crimea are organically connected with Ukraine. The Crimea  does not contribute anything to the state budget, but only  causes expenses. Tourism does not yield any profits, the water  and energy supply is paid for by Ukraine.    FOCUS: There are many countries in the Third  World that are interested in the production of nuclear missiles.  Do you know cases of Russia or Ukraine having supplied material  to such countries?    Lopata: No, no, and no again.    FOCUS: But there have been most lucrative offers  -- a great temptation for scientists who only earn some $20 a  month.    Lopata: This danger will always exist. Besides,  we only have limited possibilities to verify whether a scientist  does not also works for somebody else. Every single one is  personally responsible for one component or for a certain piece  of information. It is necessary to create prospects for these  people here.    FOCUS: Have there been cases where other  countries wanted to buy nuclear arms or nuclear technology?    Lopata: I suspect that such attempts have been  made.    FOCUS: How big is the military-industrial complex  in Ukraine?    Lopata: Taking into account that the main part of  the complex of the Soviet Union was shared between Russia and  Ukraine, then Ukraine comes second today, after Russia. We used  to have two academies, including one for missile technology, 34  military schools, research institutes, and test laboratories.    FOCUS: How many plants are there?    Lopata: Well, not even we ourselves know that  exactly. Nobody ever thought of counting them. You must  understand the system. In the Soviet Union each plant, each  enterprise fulfilled tasks even for the military complex. Today  we are using no more than 15 percent of the former armament  enterprises for military purposes. We gave up financing the  huge complexes. Ukraine no longer places any arms orders.    FOCUS: So who still buys the arms that are still  being produced?    Lopata: We hardly produce any more arms. If we  do not order tanks they are not produced. For economic reasons,  we have been forced to embark on the path of disarmament. For  the future we would need research to launch our new Ukrainian  tank on the market, for example. Yet, we do not have the money  to produce it.    FOCUS: If somebody from Syria or Iraq were to  ask, would you sell him something?    Lopata: If the offer were worthwhile, the  government would examine it. We must look for customers.    FOCUS: Ukraine has demanded security guarantees  against its powerful neighbor, Russia. Still, you do not have  any troops at your eastern border.    Lopata: The creation of new structures along our  eastern border is currently impossible for money problems.  Ukraine does not need large armed forces but mobile reaction  forces to protect its borders.</p>

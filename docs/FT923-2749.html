			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: African drought takes toll on Linton Park The drought in Africa and consequent decline in tea production in Kenya and Malawi left Linton Park, the tea producer, food processor and engineer, with a 6 per cent fall in interim profits. Mr Haughton FitzGerald, chairman, said it was unlikely that the shortfall in production would be made up in the second half, although prices for higher quality Kenyan teas had recently improved. Turnover for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 58.7m, down from Pounds 60.3m. After a reduced interest charge of Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 1.58m), pre-tax profits came to Pounds 2.34m, compared with Pounds 2.49m. Earnings per share dipped to 7.1p (7.8p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p.</p>

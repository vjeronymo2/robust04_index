			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ion Botnaru, acting foreign minister of </F> Moldova, by Boris Marian; place and date not given: "`Moldova Is  Condemned To Be Independent'"]    [Text] On New Year's Eve the Foreign Ministry  displayed an interesting initiative, initiating, perhaps, a new  tradition. It is hard to select an appropriate term for the  occasion, but what we are talking about is this: Mr. Ion  Botnaru, acting foreign minister, invited to his office for  conversation over a cup of coffee the chief editors of a number  of Moldovan newspapers, press agencies, radio, and television.  He described in confidence Moldovan diplomacy's first steps and  its successes, failures, and problems, listening to the  journalists' observations, proposals, and, of course, impartial  questions and responding to the majority of them. He was  assisted by Mr. Cubuk, deputy minister, together with the heads  of leading departments and the press office.    This relaxed roundtable conversation served as the  basis for this interview with Mr. Ion Botnaru.    [Marian] Mr. Minister, what, from the viewpoint of the head  of Moldovan diplomacy, was characteristic of the past year of  1993, the year of the rooster?    [Botnaru] The fact that the rooster quite often sang out of  place--and he has now ended up as New Year's jelly. And the fact  also that the reaction of the disintegration of the former  USSR--this colossus on the world map--continued, that is,  serious interethnic conflicts, regional wars, and dangerous  friction, but as did also a meshing between many of the states  that arose on the ruins of the Union. Europe's most dangerous  political volcano, in Yugoslavia, continued to erupt.    Moldova, despite all the complexity of its domestic  situation, managed to secure for itself peace, albeit fragile,  and also to progress along the path of self-assertion in the  world arena. In this respect, if compared with other former  Soviet republics, we finished more successfully.    The all-European economic crisis continued to intensify.  There was a redistribution of spheres of influence along the  entire diplomatic front. Relations between blocs deteriorated,  and some states increased their economic pressure for the  purpose of deriving political benefits. All the former socialist  countries, including the European Soviet republics, endeavored  to make their way into Europe--more precisely, into its  international structures, where quite a line and crush have  already formed. We managed to open certain doors a little.    [Marian] On which, as can be seen, the springs had been too  tight. Can you, Mr. Botnaru, point to the miscalculations of  Moldovan diplomacy?    [Botnaru] We have weak points, but we will not tell you  them--find them yourselves and tell us! It should be borne in  mind, however, that, as a state, we are still at an early age,  and there have for this reason been many mistakes, and they are  inevitable. I would mention in this sense the current notion of  West and East, of political blocs, of the near and far abroad.  We inherited it, as it were, from the former regime. Thanks to  this, we would set off for conferences or negotiations with our  Western partners in more self-disciplined and responsible  fashion and more ready to ward off any unpleasantness than at,  say, meetings within the framework of the CIS. Out of habit,  perhaps, we consider these partners "our people," relaxing our  diplomatic vigilance, and at times we would let slip a good  opportunity and yield "in our own way" an important position. We  forget that there is now no difference between countries of the  near and far abroad--each defends its own interests, seeks its  own advantage. We also should do the same.    [Marian] About the CIS, incidentally. May it be considered  that, following a certain period of vacillation, our policy in  respect to this bloc has been determined? And that the attacks  of the opposition demanding a reorientation toward close  economic cooperation with West Europe and Romania--just as long  as it is not with the "CIS Empire"--are not confusing our  diplomacy?    [Botnaru] I will use the words of Krylov's fable: "How many  times have we told the world".... But many remain deaf to the  official explanations as regards the CIS. Their essence,  confirmed also at the recent Ashgabat meeting of heads of state  of the CIS, is as follows: Moldova is participating merely in  the economic programs of the Commonwealth, and the final  decision on its affiliation to the CIS has been left to the new  parliament. But, if you like, my colleague, Mr. Cubuk, deputy  minister, will tell you about this in more detail and more  precisely inasmuch as he is in charge of CIS matters with us.    "I do not understand why we have so often to justify  ourselves in connection with participation in the CIS if, as  they say, there is no other way and there is evidence of  economic benefit," Mr. Cubuk began. "It is common knowledge that  both the Europeans and the Americans are endeavoring to conquer  this eastern market, the Russian market, in particular. We, on  the other hand, should, apparently, abandon it to them,  demolishing industrial and economic and purely human relations  which evolved long since in deference to someone's ideology. Is  this not foolish?"    [Marian] For what percentage of Moldova's foreign trade  turnover does the CIS account, for all that?    [Cubuk] Seventy-two percent altogether--Russia for 35  percent  plus the remaining CIS countries for 37 percent.    [Marian] Thank you, Mr. Cubuk. Now a question to you once  more, Mr. Botnaru: Is it true that virtually no one in the world  knows our Moldova? If this is so, what has your department done  to create a picture of it, an "image," as we say today, and  convey it to the world community?    [Botnaru] I would ask you not to rush to conclusions, Mr.  Editor! Who told you that the world does not know Moldova? Some  apology for a businessman or a serious politician? Who does not  know of the existence of Moldova? Once again, the petty Hong  Kong tradesman or the senior statesman? I will tell you  something else: Our republic has been recognized by 133  countries, and our tricolor flutters atop the UN building in New  York. President Snegur has traveled round half the world, and  the news media have notified the world of this. Aside from this,  we participate actively in various international forums, and,  finally, in connection with the Dniester conflict, all the top  newspapers have written about and all television and radio  stations have broadcast on Moldova.... And as far as the  republic's image is concerned, this is a difficult question. We  have along our lines done a great deal, of course, to convey to  the world community the truth about our republic and its  situation and policy. But our enemies have not been slumbering  either, distorting its image. The so-called patriots have done  their bit in this case also. And the former parliament, which  was unable in the wake of fruitless debate to untie the Gordian  knot of the Dniester region or release the Gagauz problem from  deadlock, did a poor job of enhancing Moldova's prestige.    [Marian] I understand that in the broad and true sense a  country's image is not created by diplomats alone or just the  president and members of parliament but by all of us--from the  academician through the janitor. In this respect I agree, Mr.  Botnaru, that we have done insufficient work. But what are your  complaints about the media? What, in your view, are the most  annoying "gaffes" of my writing brethren in presenting the  international theme?    [Botnaru] It is regrettable that not one newspaper and not  one channel or program regularly covers international life in  general and the work of our diplomacy in particular. All confine  themselves mainly to information concerning official visits to  Moldova or from Moldova to other countries or to infrequent and,  as a rule, sharply worded, barely indicative commentaries on the  overseas travel our leadership and the government agreements  that have been reached. Our press lacks, unfortunately,  journalists who are specialists in international affairs and  permanent columns on this subject. Articles are written by  whoever and however. And the generally respected "Messenger"  program, for example, is in the habit of cutting our reports,  which are concise as it is. This frequently shifts the emphases  and distorts what has been said. In my opinion, it is  impermissible to edit texts of an official nature. The  emendations could be coordinated, at least. After all, your  brethren, to use your term, frequently confuse an ambassador  with a consul and a consul with a consultant, and what is meant  by a treaty, what is meant by an agreement, what is meant by a  protocol is all the same for some of them.    In addition, according to the rules of a civilized press,  reports of official receptions should follow in a particular  order. It is impermissible that information on the president's  reception of the ambassador of a foreign state, say, follow a  report on the opening of an agricultural exhibition, even if the  ambassador of another state was in attendance. I could give  examples.    [Marian] In order to close the subject, as they say, tell us  what efforts should be made by all of us, diplomats  particularly, to achieve true independence, "please" the West,  and be accepted in the European family?    [Botnaru] We need to take as our reference points here the  priorities and values of Western democratic society. The  permanency of the Helsinki principle of the inviolability of the  postwar borders is a cornerstone of its policy. Consequently, a  peaceful solution of the Dniester and Gagauz problems, the  transition to a market economy, the adoption of a constitution,  the democratic arrangement of the national minorities, and the  conflict-free transition to a Western-type society with the  preservation of a strong executive--this is what Europe expects  of us, and it is on these terms that we can become integrated in  its structures.    [Marian] Thus there is just one solution for us: sticking to  the chosen sovereign path of development, in which we are  supported by West and East?    [Botnaru] Yes. This is what fate has ordained: Moldova is  condemned to be independent.    [Marian] I highly appreciate your modesty, Mr. Minister, but  would ask you, all the same, to list the achievements of  Moldovan diplomacy in the past year.    [Botnaru] In 1993 our ministry channeled its main efforts  into a strengthening of international confidence in Moldova and  the creation of an attractive image for it. Diplomatic missions  were opened in Minsk, Kiev, Brussels, and Washington. Work  continues on the formation of new embassies and consulates.  Treaties and agreements on cooperation in various fields were  signed in this period with Romania, the United States, France,  the CIS, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  and other states.    Via the United Nations, the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and  other international organizations our diplomats notified the  world community of the sociopolitical situation in Moldova and  the negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the  eastern parts of the republic and also aroused world public  opinion in connection with the inhuman treatment of political  prisoners in Tiraspol and their illegal conviction by an  anticonstitutional Tiraspol court.    A priority concern was increased cooperation with the  permanent mission of the CSCE on the question of a settlement of  the Dniester conflict and the withdrawal of the Russian 14th  Army from the territory of Moldova. As a result of our  participation in the Rome meeting of foreign ministers of the  CSCE members on 30 November of last year, new prospects for a  solution of the above-mentioned questions with the support of  this organization were revealed.    The purpose of all these efforts is to become firmly  established in the international arena as a civilized state  which has conclusively opted for democracy and political  pluralism and as a dependable partner and peace-loving neighbor.    [Marian] It remains merely to thank you for your initiative  and this interview.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / British Gas to freeze prices for householders: Move comes a week before MMC delivers verdict BRITISH GAS will freeze prices for its 18m household customers this year even though the formula which governs its domestic prices shows room for a 1 per cent increase. Mr Norman Blacker, managing director of British Gas's UK gas business, said the company would await the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the gas industry before deciding the next move on prices. The commission's verdict is due to be delivered at the end of next week and British Gas does not want to become involved in a price wrangle before that. Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, said: 'Only British Gas would boast about holding monopoly prices steady when the MMC is within a week of delivering its report. Any other decision would have been universally condemned.' A complex formula keeps gas price rises 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. This would suggest a price cut, but British Gas said the other part of the formula, which is based on North Sea gas and other energy prices, allowed the company to raise prices by 1 per cent. Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, the regulator, said the 1 per cent price increase would have amounted to less than  1/2 p a therm, which probably would have been swallowed up in administrative costs. British Gas said it was unlikely to change its prices before the end of the year. The company normally reviews prices in April and October. British Gas also published the results of a study by Mori and Gallup researchers which found that consumers were opposed to standards of service being jeopardised by price cuts. The company was forced by its regulator to cut prices twice last year. Ofgas said the company should have known without commissioning a survey that customers were very satisfied with the service package conceived by the regulator and agreed by British Gas. Sir James said: 'Value for money is a combination of price and standards of service. British Gas cannot now trade service standards at the expense of price.' The survey found that 93 per cent of customers oppose cutting spending on providing instant responses to gas leaks. It found that consumers would be prepared to pay more to maintain British Gas's responsibilities to the community as a whole. British Gas said that a third of its industrial market was supplied by competitors who served 34 per cent of industrial users - up from 28 per cent at the end of last year. Rivals had also captured 15 per cent of sales in the commercial market, which was opened to competition last year.</p>

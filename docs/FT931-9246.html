			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Monday Interview: France's comeback kid - Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president, talks to David Buchan and William Dawkins Since he was ousted from the Elysee presidential palace in 1981, at the relatively tender age of 55, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing has been trying to claw his way back. His chances seemed slim, until last autumn's Maastricht referendum campaign gave him a second wind. The question is how far this second wind will carry him. To the prime minister's office if, in next month's parliamentary elections, his Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF) becomes the largest component in the probable new conservative government? Or even back to the Elysee, if Mr Giscard d'Estaing can keep up the momentum until the 1995 presidential contest? Rocking back on one of the gilt chairs in his stately Paris house, Mr Giscard d'Estaing laughingly dismisses any suggestions that he is a political has-been. He was almost the only leader to emerge with political credit from the battle for Maastricht. Co-founder (with Helmut Schmidt) of the European Monetary System during his time in the Elysee and keen member of the European Parliament since, he put heart and soul into the Maastricht campaign, and may have tipped the balance in the treaty's favour. Yet the real importance of the Maastricht campaign to Mr Giscard d'Estaing was psychological. It gave him back a political gusto he had not shown since his successful 1974 run for the presidency. And it put him back into serious contention with his long-time rival on the right of French politics, Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, to succeed Mr Francois Mitterrand. This rivalry faces France with a double 'cohabitation' in government over the next two years, and promises to make French politics especially volatile over that period. 'The real question is not who is going to win (in March),' says Mr Giscard d'Estaing. All the opinion polls point to a landslide for a centre-right government which will have to cohabit with the Socialist president, Mr Mitterrand, whose second term has two more years to run. 'The real question is what are we going to do with our victory.' This will be largely determined by how the UDF and RPR, which have reached non-aggression pacts in 496 of the National Assembly's 577 constituencies, cohabit in government. Despite agreeing to field a joint candidate in most constituencies, it is vital to the UDF and RPR to beat each other in March. President Mitterrand has indicated he will appoint as prime minister the leader of the party that makes the strongest showing in seats. 'I am not a candidate' for the prime ministership, says Mr Giscard d'Estaing aloofly. But some UDF deputies have suggested that their leader would be happy to move into the Hotel Matignon, the prime minister's house. Mr Giscard d'Estaing says: 'My role is to get the maximum number of candidates elected -  personal questions will follow later.' This cageyness is not just the pride of someone who, having once been number one, does not want to appear to be scrambling to be number two. Mr Giscard d'Estaing says that cohabitation could be even more dangerous for the opposition than it was in 1986, when Mr Chirac became prime minister only to be soundly defeated in the 1988 presidential election by Mr Mitterrand. True, Mr Mitterrand will not stand again. But, says Mr Giscard d'Estaing, 'the economic situation which was relatively easy in 1986-88 is now worse . . . The reform of the common agricultural policy has been badly managed from the viewpoint of French interests . . . while the majority (for the opposition) will probably be much bigger.' Parliamentary discipline will therefore be more lax than in 1986-88 when the centre-right sometimes had a majority of only three. 'Will the new government have the margin of manoeuvre to take the strong measures needed?' he queries. He doubts it, because of the divisions that bedevil the right in France. 'I suffered as president from the absence of a united centre-right party in France,' says Mr Giscard d'Estaing. He finds this absence all the more curious 'when the political culture of France is basically of the centre-right. French people are for a market economy but one with a social conscience . . . They are not free-market fundamentalists.' But this centre-right majority remains split, he says, by the legacy of General De Gaulle and by the electoral system. Two rounds of voting, with the first round functioning a little like a US primary election, tend to 'divide the parties', he says. But this gulf -  between the populist-nationalist RPR and the UDF, which is more conservative on economics but more progressive on social issues -  is beyond Mr Giscard d'Estaing's power, and maybe inclination, to heal. He claims 'honestly, the press has exaggerated' the personal frost between himself and Mr Chirac. 'He was my prime minister (1974-76), and we worked in conditions that were not at all bad. Certainly, there were differences of culture and temperament, but these were not greater than exist within the British Conservative party or between the CDU and CSU parties in Germany.' However, the two leaders of the opposition keep their meetings to an absolute minimum, studiously avoiding each other, for instance, throughout the Maastricht campaign. When Mr Giscard d'Estaing claims his UDF is in tune with the national mood, he makes a contrast as much with the Gaullists as with the Socialists. 'People want a clear change, but not intolerance. They want improvement of the country, but not authoritarianism. They are preoccupied by certain aspects of European construction, but remained attached to a European Union.' With much fanfare, the RPR and UDF last week announced a common platform on which they will fight the March election under the banner of the Union Pour la France (UPF). The 22-page document is a considerable negotiating achievement, reflecting in part the opposition's general desperation to see off the Socialists. Mr Giscard d'Estaing admits that it merely papers over certain differences between the two opposition parties. Some of these differences concern the detail, but not the principle, of privatisation, social charges and tax incentives for job creation. Others have roots going back to the French revolution. The UDF has a 'Girondin' preference for devolving power to the regions that is anathema to the centralising 'Jacobin' in many a Gaullist. Not surprisingly, the UDF was the first to produce a draft statute to make the Banque de France independent of government. Significantly, too, the ex-president also wants to change the presidency itself. He would like to see presidential terms cut from seven to five years and made to coincide with parliamentary elections. Would not that reduce the president's powers? 'Yes -  these powers are a bit excessive,' Mr Giscard d'Estaing says from personal experience. More important, simultaneous elections would make it unlikely that voters would choose presidents and government of different parties. 'At present, France runs on a kind of two-stroke motor -  first one system for five years, then another for a further two years and so on.' Four years' membership of the relatively powerless European Parliament has made him more sympathetic to boosting the clout of France's national assembly, the weakest national legislature in Europe. 'Once Maastricht is ratified, there won't be a great deal left to do (in Strasbourg),' he says. To implement economic and monetary union, 'one can do more in France', he adds. He hopes for Emu on the shortest timetable allowed by Maastricht, by 1997, and seems to have more or less written off Britain  - though not Italy  - as a member of that first currency union. Next year, says Mr Giscard d'Estaing, is decision year -  for EC states to start preparing for Emu, and for himself to decide whether he wants to lead France into Emu. He is coy about another presidential bid. But he concedes that he will have to come off the fence in 1994 -  either to head the UDF list again in next year's Euro-elections or run for the Elysee. 'That,' he says,'will be the moment of choice.' PERSONAL FILE 1929 Born Cerny, Seine-et-Oise.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulations contained in 33 CFR part 151, subpart C, issued under the Act, cover vessels entering the Great Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ and require the retention of ballast water or the exchange of ballast water beyond the EEZ, by vessels subject to the Act. Further, as authorized under the Act, those regulations permit the use of environmentally sound alternative ballast water management methods that the Coast Guard determines are as effective as ballast water exchange in preventing and controlling infestations of aquatic nuisance species, thereby providing the needed flexibility to approve additional ballast water management methods that, in the future, may prove to be even more effective than ballast water exchange. These requirements, as well as the other requirements contained in subpart C of part 151, will satisfy the requirements of the amendments to the Act if applied to vessels navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. Therefore, few changes to the regulations issued by the Coast Guard on April 8, 1993, covering vessels entering a U.S. port on the Great Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ, are required to implement the requirements of the amendments to the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides for civil and criminal penalties (16 U.S.C. 4711 (c) and (d)). Any person who violates the regulations shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000. Each day of a continuing violation will constitute a separate violation. A vessel operated in violation of the regulations will be liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for that violation. Any person who knowingly violates the regulations will be guilty of a class C felony. A class C felony is punishable by imprisonment of not more than 12 years (18 U.S.C. 3581(b)(3)) and a fine of not more than $250,000 for an individual or not more than $500,000 for an organization (18 U.S.C. 3571(c)(3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard received no public comments on the proposed rule. This final rule adopts the proposed regulations without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received on the draft Regulatory Evaluation. A final Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Evaluation is summarized as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

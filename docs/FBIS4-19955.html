			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> political staff]    [Text] There are "encouraging" signs about the situation in  Gorazde, although it remains tense, Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd said today.    His comments came after a United Nations spokesman confirmed  that while Bosnian Serbs were still in their positions around  the Muslim enclave, it had been largely quiet since a 1am  deadline for them to withdraw or face air strikes.    No immediate NATO air strikes were ordered against Bosnian  Serb forces around the UN-designated safe area because they were  complying with the ultimatum to withdraw, said the UN.    Mr Hurd told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It is obviously still a  tense  situation, but the signs this morning are a bit more encouraging  as to what is actually happening on the ground.    ``Air strikes are not an end in themselves. The threat is  there to bring about a result, to stop the killing in Gorazde by  the Serbs and to get the Serbs out.    ``We have got a ground effort run by the UN with British  troops, we have got an air effort run by NATO with British  planes. Those two efforts clearly have to work together.''    But he conceded: "There was a failure at Gorazde, we are  seeking to retrieve that failure by the joint efforts of NATO  and the UN."    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said any decision  to  withdraw troops would have to be taken by the UN Security  Council.    "I am in favour of maintaining our presence, to continue to  work on the ground until we find a solution to this problem," he  told the BBC TV Breakfast with Frost programme.    He admitted the UN been humiliated in Gorazde, adding: "But  this is one setback -- you must see it in the context of  situations where we have been successful, in Cambodia, El  Salvador and elsewhere."    Meanwhile, the UN relief agency was today planning to  airlift  600 wounded people from the town, as 400 British and French  troops were due to set out from Sarajevo to join a 200-strong  contigent already deploying along the Gorazde confrontation  lines.    Elsewhere, General Andre Soubirou of the UN Protection Force  was holding meetings with Bosnian Muslim and Serb military  commanders in and near Gorazde.</p>

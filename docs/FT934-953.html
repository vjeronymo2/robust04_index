			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Net sales of unit trusts fall to Pounds 407m Net sales of unit trusts in November dropped to Pounds 407m, the lowest monthly figure this year, figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds show. The association said the drop was due to institutional holders, who accounted for net repurchases of Pounds 43m. Retail demand, at around Pounds 450m of net sales, was still strong. The monthly figure still represented the best November total since 1986 and net sales of trusts for the year, at Pounds 8.2bn, are the best ever. Investment trusts have also had their best year for raising new money. The Association of Investment Trust companies said new issues had so far raised nearly Pounds 1.49bn. The total reaches Pounds 2.19bn when the new Lloyd's trusts are included.</p>

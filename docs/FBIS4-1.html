			<p>SUMMARY                                         Recent commentaries on state-owned Russian Television's (RTV)  Vesti news broadcasts suggest growing disillusionment with U.S.  policies towards the nations of the former Soviet bloc,  portraying the United States as a self-interested meddler along  Russia's periphery, willing to undermine Russian national  interests in areas which Russia has traditionally viewed as its  exclusive sphere of influence.  The cynical view of U.S. motives  exhibited in these commentaries contrasts sharply with previous  commentary from Vesti, a staunchly pro-reform news program.                                     END SUMMARY   Vesti commentary on the controversial visit to Moscow by former  President Richard Nixon, which blasted Nixon for meeting with key  political foes of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and presented  his visit against the backdrop of what it viewed as U.S.  negotiations with Ukraine and Georgia behind Russia's back, was  the first commentary observed to exhibit this strongly critical  tone (Russian Television, 9 March).  Setting the scene for  Nixon's diplomatic contretemps, Commentator G. Shakhov asserted  that the results of Ukrainian President Kravchuk's recent meeting  in Washington with President Clinton had to such a degree  superseded the agreement signed on 14 January in Moscow by  Yeltsin, Clinton, and Kravchuk on the withdrawal of strategic  nuclear weapons from Ukraine that they forced one to ask: "was  there really a Moscow meeting" of the three leaders?  Similarly,  Shakhov continued, a visit by Georgian President Eduard  Shevardnadze to Washington revived the possibility of "bringing  UN peacekeepers to Abkhazia" when previously, Tbilisi and Sukhumi  had agreed to disengage their armed forces "at Russia's  initiative," presumably making the introduction of UN forces  unnecessary.  Shakhov lamented that "earlier agreements reached  with Russia's participation" had been "effectively revised in  both cases" and questioned whether this represented merely "some  kind of maneuvering" by the U.S. or a fundamental "change of  political direction."   A subsequent Shakhov commentary revived cold-war rhetoric to  describe the NATO Partnership for Peace, decrying the initiative  as an attempt to place "arsenals of American weapons" along  Russia's periphery (Russian Television, 24 March).  This  initiative is disturbing, he said, because the weapons making up  such arsenals are made not to "adorn pompous parades" but "to  shoot."  Shakhov also invoked the cold-war bugaboo, the U.S.  "military-industrial complex," whose Incentive in Partnership for  Peace is, he asserted, "the more arms exported, the more money  imported."  He then cited other examples of alleged U.S.  military-industrial complex mischief.  "Even today" he claimed,  all sides to the Afghan conflict are using "the latest U.S.  missiles," and in other "hot spots" around the world "it is not  difficult to find the widest assortment" of U.S. weaponry.  Every  year, Shakhov charged, Washington earns from $5 to $7 billion via  production of the "weaponry of death."   A third commentary, by A. Goncharov, following the recent visit  to Kazakhstan by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry,  returned to the theme of alleged U.S. attempts to undercut  Russian relations with neighboring states.  The commentary  suggested that the U.S. was attempting to deal behind Russia's  back with the Kazakhstanis to develop the Baykonur space facility  (Russian Television, 28 March).  According to Goncharov, Perry  held discussions "behind closed doors" with the Kazakhstanis on  the creation of a joint U.S.-Ukrainian-Kazakhstani aerospace  venture which would operate "without Russian participation."  Goncharov asserted that "Kiev was in favor" of the deal, but that  the U.S. did not succeed in "enticing" the Kazakhstanis, who,  "after much delay" realized that their "real partner" in  aerospace activities is Russia.   These commentaries contrast sharply with past Vesti depict ions of  the United States.  A commentary by N. Svanidze on the eve of the  June 1992 Yeltsin-Bush summit in Washington, for example, spoke  in deferential tones of the West as a potential benefactor "from  whom real money is wanted," but who might be scared off from  providing needed aid by opposition "reactionaries" (Russian  Television, 14 June 1992).  Another Svanidze commentary,  following the April 1993 Vancouver summit, placed Russia and the  U.S. on equal footing and asserted that the two countries  "consider themselves partners in the name of democracy, security,  and peace" and praised U.S. President Bill Clinton as a new "John  Kennedy" who brought "fresh blood" to U.S. foreign policy  (Russian Television, 5 April 1993).   Implications   RTV's airing of three critical commentaries in quick succession  suggests that at least some influential officials in the Yeltsin  administration approve of Vesti's recent change in tone, possibly  as a demonstration that Russia will pursue what it sees as its  own interests, particularly in what it judges to be its exclusive  sphere of influence, even in opposition to U.S. positions.  Being  state-owned and being in the throes of a major financial crisis,  RTV would be unlikely to pursue such a change against the wishes  of its official patrons.  RTV has since its inception in 1990  been among the most strongly pro-reform media in Russia, and has  both helped to form and reflected the views of ardently pro-  reform Russians.  The sharp criticism of the United States in  these commentaries suggests an attempt to prepare this most pro-  Western segment of Russian society for a move from the quite  friendly relations of recent years to a much more adversarial  climate in U.S.-Russian relations.

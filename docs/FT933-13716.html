			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Crucial debut for Swedish model  -The 900, to be launched next week, is vital to Saab MAKING a play on his country's national emergency telephone number, a Swede joked last week that the long-awaited new model that Saab Automobile will launch next Wednesday should be called the Saab 90000, not the Saab 900. Few in Sweden would fail to appreciate the wisecrack. Saab, 50 per cent owned by General Motors of the US since 1989, is widely perceived to be relying on the new 900 to secure its future after a succession of losses that have raised a question-mark over the company's survival. It is not just the fate of Volvo's local rival that is at stake: GM has seen Saab losses rebound with painful effect on the results of its overall European operation. Saab's other 50 per cent owner, Saab-Scania, is in turn 100 per cent held by Investor, the chief industrial vehicle of the Wallenberg family, itself battling against losses and high debts. Not least, the demise of Saab would deepen worries in a country proud of its industrial heritage that it has become too uncompetitive to sustain such a large-scale business as motor manufacturing. With so much seen to be riding on the success of the new 900, it is not surprising that Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, a Briton who has been in charge of Saab since last September, tries to play down the 'make or break' tag that has been pinned on the car. 'It is the beginning of the process of rejuvenation,' he says at Saab's headquarters and assembly centre just outside the western city of Trollhatten. It is clear, however, that rejuvenation is well-nigh impossible unless the new model is a hit. Apart from a 900 convertible, Saab has only one other model, the luxury 9000 range, on the market. The new car is replacing the old 900 model, which was launched in 1979 - and that was based on the 1968 Saab 99. Saab last made a profit in 1988. Since then it has run up losses of more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn). Since mid-1991, GM and Saab-Scania have together pumped in SKr8.3bn in two capital injections to keep Saab going. Sales have slumped from 109,483 cars in 1989 to 86,800 last year. In the first half of this year, sales in the US and western Europe were down by 29.6 per cent and 28.8 per cent respectively. The new 900, competing in the same market segment as the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80, is hitting falling markets in most of Europe, while demand for this type of vehicle in the US is still weak. 'Yes, it is very tough,' says Mr Butler-Wheelhouse. 'I would just say we are lucky in one respect: we are launching a car the size of which and the price of which are still within the reach of many people. I would far rather replace the 900 now than the 9000.' Mr Butler-Wheelhouse was brought in by GM, which has effective management control at Saab, from South Africa where he had led the management buy-out of GM's local business in the 1980s. He has pressed on with the task of drastically restructuring Saab to increase productivity and win the cost advantage from the link to GM. Since GM came in, the workforce in Sweden has been halved to 7,300 and the number of plants cut to three. Productivity of 56 hours per car for the 9000 is still high, but compares with the 110 hours of three years ago. Moreover, the figure for the new 900 will be 35 hours per car at launch and will come down to less than 30 hours next year - approaching market-leading figures for Japanese plants in Europe, according to Mr Butler-Wheelhouse. Break-even point is now around 80,000 cars a year sold. The GM link has also enabled Saab to reduce the time and cost of developing the new 900 model by around 30 per cent, says Mr Stig-Goran Larsson, Saab's product development chief. The car, which industry analysts estimate cost less than SKr5bn to develop, shares a number of base components with the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier. But a key element of the strategy behind the car is that it is a Saab, not a GM product. Mr Larsson stresses that his development team includes only one person from GM - a financial officer. 'There has been a concern that we keep our identity,' says Mr Larsson, clearly speaking for his Swedish colleagues at Saab. 'If we lose that, what is Saab then? Then it is lost.' Much effort has been put into ensuring that the new 900 'looks like a Saab and feels like a Saab'. This extends from quirks like keeping the ignition on the gear-stick console, to making the body design as reminiscent of the highly individualistic old 900 as possible. This is not for sentimental reasons. GM readily agrees that it bought into Saab in order to reach a market niche that its mainstream cars could not. Whatever tensions there might be between the top management GM has put in place and the Swedes below them, GM agrees that Saab must retain its place as an individualistic car known for its responsive drive and its 'Swedish' qualities of safety and reliability. 'There is absolutely no sense in GM doing anything to negate the equity in Saab's name,' says Mr John Fleming, Saab's American marketing chief. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse says that it will take about six months before it will be clear if the new 900 has been a success. In the meantime, he will make no forecast about a return to profit, beyond pointing out that first-quarter losses were cut by 50 per cent to SKr138m. Design work is going ahead on a new 9000 planned for sometime in the next five years. Earlier talk of a third top-of-the-market model been supplanted by discussion of a model smaller than the 900. But for now it is no more than discussion. Everything hinges on the 900. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse says that GM and Saab-Scania have patience. However, he acknowledges: 'What they don't need right now is a lame duck.'</p>

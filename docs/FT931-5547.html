			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology: Shedding new light on cancer - A breakthrough in treatment on the brink of commercial exploitation Light-based cancer treatments are on the brink of commercial exploitation - after 90 years as an experimental procedure. Photodynamic therapy (known as PDT) uses a drug which is non-toxic until activated by light. It accumulates in cancer cells and kills them when the tumour is illuminated. The first crude attempt to cure skin cancer by PDT was carried out in Germany in 1903. More systematic experimentation started in the 1970s, using lasers to activate porphyrins - photosensitive compounds derived chemically from the haemoglobin molecule that carries oxygen in the blood. Clinical trials since 1976 have involved several thousand patients with tumours of the skin, bladder, throat, stomach, bowels and elsewhere. The normal PDT procedure is to inject the drug into the patient a couple of days before the laser treatment. This gives the drug time to accumulate in the cancer cells and clear from the rest of the body. The tumour is then illuminated for 15 to 30 minutes with a laser emitting light at the wavelength absorbed most efficiently by the drug. Skin cancer can be exposed directly to the laser but for internal tumours the light has to be guided down an optical fibre attached to an endoscope to reach the cancer. The power of the laser is too low to harm cells directly. Its purpose is to activate the drug, which then produces a highly reactive form of oxygen (free radicals) to kill cells. Although PDT has apparently cured some people with early cancers and given relief to those with inoperable late cancers, the results were not sufficiently spectacular to lead to rapid commercialisation, in view of the technique's disadvantages: its high cost compared with conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and the fact that some normal tissues also become light-sensitive so that patients have to stay indoors for several weeks after treatment. This year, however, the first commercial PDT drug, Photofrin, is expected to receive marketing approval in Canada. It has been developed by Quadra Logic Technologies of Vancouver and will be sold worldwide in collaboration with American Cyanamid, the large US chemical company. Quadra Logic expects Photofrin sales to reach Dollars 95m (Pounds 65.5m) to Dollars 375m within three years of its launch. Photofrin is being chased by a group of more selective second-generation PDT drugs, designed to cause fewer side effects. They will be helped by the simultaneous development of cheaper lasers. Quadra Logic is already starting clinical trials of its own follow-up compound, Benzoporphyrin derivative, on skin cancer. Ciba-Geigy, the giant Swiss group, has a promising PDT drug, zinc-phthalocyanine, in the final stages of pre-clinical testing. Other companies active in the field include Nippon Oil of Japan, Deprenyl of Toronto and PDT Systems of California. But the second-generation drug furthest advanced in clinical trials is EF9, a porphyrin derivative developed by Scotia Pharmaceuticals in the UK. It has been tested in 25 patients at the Royal London Hospital and the universities of Lausanne and Geneva in Switzerland. Norman Williams, professor of surgery at the Royal London Hospital, is pioneering the use of PDT in conjunction with the surgical removal of tumours. He is carrying out a clinical trial in which patients with colo-rectal cancer are allocated at random into two groups. Half have orthodox surgery. The other half are given Photofrin or EF9 and, immediately after the tumour has been removed, the cavity is illuminated by laser while the patient is still under general anaesthetic. The aim is to eradicate the microscopic traces of cancer that are sometimes left behind when the tumour is removed. These are responsible for the recurrence of cancer at the same site, which occurs within two years of surgery in 10 to 15 per cent of the 27,000 cases of colo-rectal cancer recorded every year in the UK. Mutaz Abulafi, surgical research fellow at the Royal London, says that after more than a year of monitoring 58 patients, there have been no recurrences of cancer among those receiving PDT and three recurrences in the control group. But it is too soon to draw a clear statistical conclusion about the effectiveness of PDT. If controlled clinical trials do prove that PDT is safe and effective, then Williams would favour its routine use after cancer surgery. Even a modest 10 per cent reduction in the recurrence rate of colo-rectal cancer would prevent 200 deaths a year in the UK, he points out. The lasers used today cost tens of thousands of pounds - too much for their routine installation in general hospitals. But cheaper solid-state lasers will soon be available. For example PDT Systems and McDonnell Douglas of the US recently signed an agreement to develop diode lasers for PDT. Indeed, Williams believes the next generation of PDT drugs will be sensitive enough to be activated by non-laser light. 'We're in the process of developing a much cheaper and more robust light source that could be taken into any operating theatre,' he says. 'It might then be possible to give this treatment in any hospital anywhere with equipment costing only Pounds 5,000.' Although cancer is likely to be the main application of PDT, the technique is applicable to other diseases that give rise to abnormal cells in which the photosensitive drug can accumulate. Quadra Logic has started a clinical trial of BPD for psoriasis, a skin disorder. The company has also carried out animal tests which suggest that the drug might be able to clear the Aids virus HIV from the blood stream. This would require a machine somewhat like the one used for kidney dialysis, in which blood is removed from the patient and exposed to light in a tube before returning to the body.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, April 17 (AFP) -- Funeral services were  held here Saturday [16 April] for Burundi president Cyprien  Ntaryamira and two of his cabinet ministers who died in a plane  crash April 6 that also took the life of Rwandan President  Juvenal Habyarimana.    The crash of the Rwandan presidential jet occurred as the  aircraft was approaching the airport in the Rwandan capital  Kigali on a flight from Tanzannia, where the two leaders had  discussed efforts to end friction between the Hutu and Tutsi  groups afflicting both countries.    Rwandan authorities charged that the plane had been shot  down, although officials here have spoken only of an "accident."    While Burundi remained calm after the incident, inter-ethnic  fighting erupted in Rwanda and has now left at least 20,000  people dead and caused thousands of refugees to stream into  neighboring countries.    The Burundi cabinet members who perished in the crash were  Communications Minister Cyriaque Simbizi and Planning Minister  Bernard Ciza.</p>

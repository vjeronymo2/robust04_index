			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: ABB wins turbine parts deal ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's leading power engineering group, has won a Dollars 150m (Pounds 101.3m) order to supply spare turbine parts over a nine - year period to Midland Cogeneration Venture (MCV) of Midland, Michigan, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. MCV is a limited partnership formed in 1987 to acquire the useable part of an unfinished nuclear power plant at Midland and to complete it as a gas-fired combined heat and power plant. The plant, which started up in 1989, is powered by 12 ABB gas turbines producing 1,370MW of electricity and up to 0.6m kilograms per hour of process steam. MCV is 49 per cent owned by CMS Energy, the local electric utility, with smaller stakes held by industrial companies in the area, including Dow Chemical and Fluor, and ABB. ABB said the order was signed last week and so would be booked in 1993.</p>

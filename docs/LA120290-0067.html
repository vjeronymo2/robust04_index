			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY BATHROOMS  </P> <P> After reading "Hot Property" over the last few months we have a question.  </P> <P> Why is it these (so-called) celebrities always seem to buy homes that have more  bathrooms than bedrooms? Is it possible these wealthy celebrities all have  bladder problems?  </P> <P> In these days when there are so many people sleeping in the streets, it seems  obscene and disgusting for anyone to own such huge homes. These people could  try to help others more and spend less on their ridiculously huge homes.  </P> <P> CONNIE GIERMAN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bed and breakfast I HAVE A holding in Jardine Matheson which I am considering 'bed and breakfasting.' My mother has a similarly-valued holding in North West Water, for which she is considering doing likewise. Could we avoid the cost of these deals by swapping the shares via the completion of stock transfer forms? How would a value then be determined for CGT purposes (in the absence of contract notes)? If (as we assume) you are hoping to establish allowable losses, then you would be frustrated by section 18(3) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992: '(1) This section shall apply where a person acquires an asset and the person making the disposal is connected with him.' (3)' . . . If, on the disposal, a loss accrues to the person making the disposal, it shall not be deductible except from a chargeable gain accruing to him on some other disposal of an asset to the person acquiring the asset mentioned in sub-section 1 . . .' By virtue of section 286 (2&amp;8) of the act, you and your mother are connected with each other. The market value of listed shares is (generally speaking) determined on the quarter-up basis, by virtue of section 272(3) of the act. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

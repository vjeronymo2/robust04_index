			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Khmer Rouge attacks town KHMER ROUGE guerrillas firing automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked a provincial capital in northwest Cambodia yesterday, AP reports from Phnom Penh. Guerrillas were firing on the airport runway at Siem Reap, said UN officials. The Kampuchea Airlines commercial flight which many foreign tourists take from Phnom Penh to visit the famed temples of Angkor just outside Siem Reap was cancelled. UN military observers in Siem Reap, 225 km northwest of Phnom Penh, had long been preparing for an attack, building bunkers and installing razor wire around their compounds. A UN interpreter said the Khmer Rouge attacked at 5 a m and fighting was continuing at 9 a m. The Bangladeshi infantry battalion, which is posted there to protect UN workers, did not answer their phone. The Khmer Rouge has boycotted the UN operation to guide the country through democratic elections this month.</p>

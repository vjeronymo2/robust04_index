			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CAMBODIA PEACE TALKS BREAK DOWN  </P> <P> Talks among Cambodia's four warring factions broke down at their first session  today with the resistance coalition saying it will not return to the  negotiating table.  </P> <P> "The division is more serious than ever," resistance leader Prince Norodom  Sihanouk said after he and his two allies met with Vietnamese-backed Cambodian  Prime Minister Hun Sen.  </P> <P> "There is no point coming back tomorrow. . . . We said everything we need to  say to each other," he added.  </P> <P> Negotiations have been blocked by demands from the ultra- leftist Khmer Rouge  for a share in running the country where an estimated 1 million people died  during its previous rule from 1975 to 1979.  </P> <P> The four factions met in an effort to resolve internal Cambodian problems  before a French-sponsored, 20-nation peace conference this weekend.  </P></p>

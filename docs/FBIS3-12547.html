The popular and trade union organizations also continued to  condemn this massacre. The Nasirite Arab Democratic Party  staged a peaceful demonstration at noon today and issued a  statement condemning the barbaric massacre and savage acts by  gangs of Jewish settlers against the Palestinian people. The  Party addressed a statement to Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, calling for an emergency Arab summit to  take a firm stand and confront the Zionist (?aggression) against  the Palestinian Arab people in Palestine.    The statement stressed the need for all Arab countries to  adhere to the resolutions of the Arab boycott of Israel. It  called on the Arab League to pass a resolution demanding that  the current peace talks, which have become a cover for criminal  actions, be stopped. It called on the Arab League to declare  practical and binding measures to bolster the Palestinian  people's steadfastness in the occupied territories and to  support their valiant intifadah for the liberation of all  Palestinian territories.    The statement emphasized the need for the Arab League to  exert efforts to restore Arab solidarity, unify the nation's  efforts, and lift the blockade on Iraq and Libya. It called for  putting all forms of pressure on the Security Council to pass a  resolution providing for international protection of the  Palestinian people, explicit condemnation of the massacre,  dismantling the settlements, and disarming the settlers.    In Alexandria, the lawyers syndicate freedoms committee  condemned the heinous crime and massacre committed in the  Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In a statement it released, the  committee said that the Jewish settlers committing this crime  and the killing and injuring of dozens of Muslims praying during  the holy month of Ramadan demonstrate that Arab blood has become  [words indistinct] for experts in genocide who have committed  the massacres of Dayr Yasin, Sabra, and Shatila.    The social arts and science committee in Alexandria  condemned  the massacre, saying that it was carried out under the slogan of  arms. It said that Israel let its settlers behave crazily,  foolishly, and conceitedly. Israel, the statement said, refuses  to disarm the settlers, which makes us unsure about the security  of the Palestinian people and discredits Israeli claims. It  stressed that this incident robs the peace process of its  credibility. In the meantime, the Alexandria University campus  was the scene of student demonstrations. The students shouted  slogans hostile to Israel and condemned the horrific massacre  committed against the Palestinian people. The lawyers, doctors,  and engineers trade unions staged a huge march in Alexandria  yesterday evening to condemn the massacre.    The al-Mansurah University board issued a statement  condemning the bestial crime committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque,  saying it shows savagery, barbarism, and violation of the  sanctity of a divine religion. It called on the international  community to take action quickly to ensure security and peace in  this vital part of the world. It appealed to world public  opinion to put an end to double standards in the application of  international law.</p>

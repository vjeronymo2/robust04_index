			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Presiding over period of tumultuous change: Manfred Worner - Obituary Manfred Worner, who died on Saturday aged 59, presided over the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation during the end of the cold war and the beginning of its unpredictable aftermath. It has been a period of tumultuous change, raising questions about the whole purpose and future of the alliance. His recent claim that these uncertainties had been overcome was not fully convincing. But there can be no doubt that his own stature increased as the job of Nato secretary-general became ever more challenging. It was unimaginable when he was appointed to the Brussels post in 1988 that a Nato leader should come to spend much of his time visiting and receiving visits from what was then the Warsaw Pact. It was equally inconceivable that Nato - any more than its cold war adversary - should be thought of as a suitable instrument for peacekeeping or peacemaking outside its frontiers. The criticism now directed at Nato for the absence of decisive action in Bosnia is a measure of how much has changed. A long debate about 'out of area' action is now over. It has moved from being a virtually taboo subject to the centre of Nato business, to the extent that the phrase 'out of area' has fallen into disuse. Worner felt strongly about the tragedy of former Yugoslavia but was defensive about Nato's record there. He looked at it from the viewpoint of Nato as an organisation, which indeed has performed all the tasks the UN has asked of it, rather than as a collectivity of nations which between them have much to answer for in the Bosnian catastrophe. His appointment was controversial in the early stages, but he grew into the job and proved equal to the momentous changes the alliance had to undergo. Some found him brash and vain, but he earned their respect. At the Nato summit last January President Bill Clinton paid him tribute as 'a genuine statesman', praising his 'great vision and discipline'. Although he had previously had a successful political career in Germany, his reputation was higher outside his own country than within it. Born near Stuttgart in 1934, Worner attended university at Heidelberg and Paris and undertook further legal studies in Munich and Stuttgart, devoting his doctoral thesis to defence relations between allied countries. After working as an adviser to the Christian Democratic Union in Baden-Wurttemberg, he was elected in 1965 to the Bundestag, where he became chairman of the defence committee. From 1982 to 1988 he was minister of defence, a period which included the launching of the Eurofighter project. He is credited with coining the phrase Burger in Uniform, or citizen-soldier, as the expression of the new face of the German military. When he went to Nato in July 1988 he was not only, at 53, the youngest man to do the job but also the first German. Germany was at the heart of Nato in the military sense - on the front line and still with troops from five other Nato countries on its territory - but was becoming a more awkward ally, particularly over nuclear weapons policy. Doubts were expressed whether this suave former fighter pilot in the German air reserve had the political pull in Bonn, particularly vis-a-vis the then foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, that other allies felt was badly needed. He did not seem to have the clout of his predecessor Lord Carrington. One senior Nato diplomat commented at the time: 'It was right that it should be a German. But the question is: was it the right German?' However, his intelligence, honesty and sheer commitment shone through. At the end of his four-year term, unable to agree on a successor, the allies extended his tenure by another year and then by another three years. Sadly, the principal candidate to take over from him, Norwegian foreign minister Johan Jorgen Holst, died in January. Worner knew in 1992 he had cancer of the colon and underwent a series of operations, but was determined to complete the job of overseeing Nato's transition and its moves towards incorporating the countries of eastern Europe. He referred only once in public to the disease, joking that he had become, like Nato's much-reduced forces, 'leaner and meaner'. On the eve of the January summit he told the allies he had been declared free of cancer and intended to go on to the end of his term in mid-1996. He was a distinctive figure, with a fixed stare, accentuated by his recent gauntness, a sometimes ponderous manner and a penchant for hyperbole which led him to describe almost any Nato gathering as 'historic'. But without his passionate belief in the transatlantic alliance Nato would be in a worse state than it is. Replacing him will not be easy. His widow, Elfie Reinsch, was his second wife. He had a son by his first marriage. David White</p>

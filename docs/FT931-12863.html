			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Stiffelio' launches Verdi venture - Opera The Royal Opera has planned a great Verdi adventure: a season-by-season conspectus of all the operas, intended to be complete by 2001. On Monday the company launched it in properly adventurous style, with the first professional British staging of a Verdi rarity. In the complete list of his operas Stiffelio (Trieste, 1850) comes just before Rigoletto, and is probably the finest of all those Verdi works that continue to remain little-known - a stark piece, notably original in form and subject matter. For contemporary tastes the story must have been unpalatably gloomy. The unwilling adultery of a travelling Protestant minister's young wife has preceded curtain rise, which then reveals, in a succession of economically unfolded scenes, his return and discovery, her abasement and - probable sticking-point for an 1850 audience - eventual forgiveness. Themes of guilt, dishonour and personal-versus-public morality are examined with a disquieting unvarnished directness of dramatic diction. As in so much 'early' Verdi, the lack of wasted notes, and the sudden short spells of formulaic rum-ti-tum side by side with the composer's radical overhaul of form, are at times almost disconcerting. For these reasons, and also because of the censorship difficulties experienced by Verdi right from the start, failure seems to have been as inevitable as it was undeserved. Once he had determined on re-making the opera - as Aroldo (Rimini, 1857) - into a less troublesome, though also less interesting, tale of a revenant crusading knight in 13th-century Kent, he abandoned the original. Its autograph is lost; until the Parma revival of 1968, Stiffelio was thought of as a marginal episode in the long epic of Verdi's compositional career. Since then, fringe revivals and a good Philips recording have rectified the impression. At the start of 1986 the Fenice in Venice presented a series of Stiffelio and Aroldo performances (short operas, both) on a single evening: a fascinating clarification-by-comparison of the dramatic strengths of the former and the many musical enrichments and improvements of the latter. Now, at Covent Garden, Stiffelio gets what is probably its first front-rank revival in modern times. The company has risen to the task with admirable seriousness - indeed, its leading Verdian, Edward Downes, is not only conductor but editor of a new, carefully scrutinised and corrected Stiffelio performing edition. The result is a remarkable occasion. The re-instatement bid has been boldly made. By ideal (no doubt hopelessly unrealistic) standards of measurement, its goal is still not entirely achieved, since the Royal Opera cast is in each of its three principal parts a notch or two under the strength implied by Verdi's extraordinarily demanding, and expressive, vocal writing. But in Elijah Moshinsky's production (designed by Michael Yeargan, sets, and Peter J. Hall, costumes) the work's dramatic 'modernity' - a quality of operatic Ibsen avant la lettre is so precisely evoked that everyone on stage and everything in the plot is presented in a powerfully affecting light. The production team have exchanged the Austria of the original for a bleaker location, non-specific 19th-century northern; the influence of heavy naturalistic painting styles on the material shape and dramatic focus of each scene is apt and purposeful (apart from an erratic Act 2 lighting plot). Sobriety of demeanour rules. Small gestures betray large inner struggles; the 'community ethic' is shown to be both tightly binding and terribly oppressive. In Moshinsky's treatment the great closing scene of forgiveness  -musically one of Verdi's fieriest and most tautly evolved constructions - may end with a late-20th-century question mark rather than a mid-19th-century full stop, but the 'woman's issue' is quietly, not crudely, raised. This seems to me one of Moshinsky's most impressive Verdi stagings. It elicits a similar quality of plain-speaking authority from Downes and the orchestra and chorus; Monday's performance had not quite the over-arching sweep of that never-to-be-forgotten 1990 Attila, perhaps because the Stiffelio cast seemed to need much more vigilant nursing, which Downes managed with his usual unfussed mastery (the prompter likewise, much in evidence). The woozy trumpet solo that sets off the opera's curiously commonplace overture was an exception to the general rule of fine playing. The title role comes first in the line of Verdian studies of dramatic-tenor obsessiveness. Jose Carreras does not carry its big guns; nor does he possess - has he ever possessed - in his operatic persona the necessary forcefulness of declamatory fire a la Martinelli or Vickers. This being so, it is wonderful to find him so much strengthened in voice, so determined to give every phrase and statement fullest possible measure, so honest at every moment. In the finale his rapt concentration of address proves deeply moving; this is likewise the peak of Catherine Malfitano's performance. A singer of lustre and an actress of controlled eloquence, she works unceasingly - and often surprisingly successfully - to fill out lines intended for a much grander and more expansive category of soprano voice. Gregory Yurisich's coarse-toned delivery of the father's role was harder to accept, although he too is a presence on stage. In smaller roles Gwynne Howell and Robin Leggate (the seducer, faintly drawn in the opera) do very well. In sum, while not the last word on Stiffelio, this affords the house's Verdi cycle a notable start. Sponsored by the Friends of Covent Garden; in repertory until February 18</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS / AFTER THE HATCHET JOB;  </P> <P> CAN'T LIVE WITH MONEY -- OR WITHOUT;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL SQUABBLING GUTTED AN EARLIER PROPOSAL; IT CAN REDEEM ITSELF BY  SENDING THE REFORM PACKAGE TO THE VOTERS.  </P> <P> Last month's debate on ethics reform did not show the Los Angeles City Council  at its best. A debate that began in 1989 with Mayor Tom Bradley's  conflict-of-interest problems somehow degenerated into a squabble over the  integrity of council members who were not in any way involved with the mayor's  troubles.  </P> <P> When the smoke cleared, the proposed ethics reform package had been butchered,  with the heart of the package -- campaign finance reform -- torn out of it.  </P> <P> Today the council will have the opportunity to reverse its direction. I intend  to ask my colleagues to bite the bullet and give voters a chance to enact a  political reform package combining strict limits on campaign spending and  limited public financing as an alternative to raising campaign money from  special interests.  </P> <P> Money is the root of the problem. Politicians can't live without money because  the cost of reaching out to the voters in a contested campaign is outrageously  high -- and continues to grow.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it's becoming increasingly clear that politicians can't live  with the need for money, either, as evidenced by the current scandals in  Washington, Sacramento and City Hall. In order to reduce the lure of  corruption, we have to reduce the need for money.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court has ruled that it is a violation of the First Amendment to  arbitrarily limit campaign spending. Instead, we must create an incentive for  candidates to do so voluntarily. The only incentive the Supreme Court accepts  is matching public funds.  </P> <P> In the ordinance I am proposing, a candidate can only receive matching funds  for contributions of $250 or less that he or she receives from individuals --  not corporations. Further, in order to qualify, a candidate must agree to a  schedule of legitimate public debates with his or her challengers.  </P> <P> That means candidates would be free to appeal directly to the voters they hope  to govern -- not the people who hope to influence the political process with  their contributions. It also means that the voter can be assured that a  substantial amount of the money raised by a candidate is public money,  untainted by private interests seeking to influence the decision-maker.  </P> <P> But it does not mean that any lunatic off the street can use tax dollars to  finance a campaign. To qualify for funds, a council candidate must first raise  $25,000 -- and a citywide candidate must raise $100,000 -- in individual  contributions. If a Nazi or Klan member can do that in Los Angeles, we have  bigger problems than ethics reform can solve.  </P> <P> As for the argument that public financing is too costly, I can only ask how  much the recent ethics scandals have cost this city. That cost should be  calculated not only in dollars but in the confidence of the people in their  elected officials. And how much has it cost us to elect politicians who serve  private interests before the public good?  </P> <P> In order to further limit the cost to the public, my proposed ordinance caps  matching funds at $2 million a year. Given a total city budget of $3.2 billion  a year, this amount is less than 1%.  </P> <P> Essentially, campaign finance reform is a relatively inexpensive way to make  public office attainable for serious candidates who don't have the backing of  moneyed interests seeking to influence government for their own gain. It  increases the likelihood that the voters would be able to choose candidates who  are not indebted to private interests.  </P> <P> The experience in Seattle is a good example. When public financing became  available, more women ran for office, more minorities ran for office. In fact,  there were more candidates, period. And they spent less per race. As a result,  people in Seattle had real choices in the voting booth, and they were confident  the candidates represented them and not some unnamed bankroller.  </P> <P> People in Los Angeles deserve the same confidence. They deserve the most  ethical government they can elect.  </P> <P> The council's last pass at the ethics reform package was a hatchet job, but  today we have the opportunity to redeem ourselves and take the high road to  campaign finance reform.  </P></p>

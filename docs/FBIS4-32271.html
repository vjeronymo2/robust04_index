			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Keith Damsell: "Czechs and Canadians Expand </F> Trade Opportunities"]    [Text] More Canadian dollars and Czech crowns may soon be  crossing the Atlantic, thanks to two recent trade programs  linking the two countries.    Fifty-four executives from some of Canada's largest  corporations studied business opportunities here, while 22 of  their Czech counterparts learned about exporting opportunities  to Canada during the week of May 9-13.    "We've seen some good opportunities here," said David Lambe,  head of the consulting firm David Lambe &amp; Associates, based  in  Ottawa, Ontario.    Lambe is a member of the University of Ottawa's first  Executive MBA graduating class. During the intensive program,  executives from the private and public sectors work at their  regular jobs and commit an additional 30 to 55 hours per week  attending classes and studying. The two-year program, which  focuses on strategic and multinational management skills,  culminated this year in a trip to the Czech Republic. For their  final school project, small working teams put together Czech  market entry strategies for Canadian firms.    In cooperation with the Canadian system-integration company  SHL Systemhouse, Lambe's six-member team met with local  communications experts and analyzed potential business  opportunities here. In a detailed 35-page report, the group  concluded the company should enter into a joint-venture  agreement with a local Czech partner. After returning to Canada,  the team will meet with SHL's senior management and present  their findings.    "We believe there is an opportunity for SHL Systemhouse to  make some impact in the integrated technology sector here," said  Paul Murphy, a senior manager with the Ottawa-based  Bell-Northern Research Ltd.    Another MBA exec team looked at the potential Czech market  for the atomic energy company AECL-Candu. The four-member team  visited AECL's nuclear reactor construction project in Romania  and held high-level meetings with officials at the Czech state  energy company CEZ.    "We're not hidden away in a classroom in downtown Ottawa,"  said Gerard Lewis, senior marketing advisor at the Canadian  Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec. Lewis' team considered  how Canada Post could improve its distribution and marketing  system in comparison to the Czech postal service. "The course is  a bridging of academic models with business practices. It's a  chance to take those 10 to 15 years of business experience and  put a new framework around it and then take it back out into the  business community."    While the executives considered how Canadian firms might  muscle into the Czech marketplace, the Trade Facilitation Office  of Canada (TFOC) conducted a seminar for Czech entrepreneurs  keen on exporting their wares to Canada.    The three-day seminar in Prague was the first of its kind in  Eastern and Central Europe, said David Taylor, TFOC European  program director and former commercial counsellor for the  Canadian Embassy in Czechoslovakia.    "We decided to try it here first because we knew the Czech  Republic had a strong industrial base," Taylor said.    Representatives from Czech companies as diverse as cheese  producer Mika and forklift manufacturer Desta learned the  intricacies of Canadian tariff and trade laws, distribution  channels and risk management.    Canadians are sure to buy Becherovka, the popular Czech  herbal liqueur, if it is available at their local liquor store,  said Jaroslav Pokora, seminar participant and sales manager at  SVP, a Prague-based distribution company. The company  distributes the famous spirit in Slovakia, Hungary and Italy.    As a result of the seminar, Pokora is planning a future trip  to Canada to find an export partner.    "When Canadian tourists visit the Czech Republic, they buy  lots of Becherovka and take it home with them," Pokora said.  "I'm persuaded that Canadians will like it. They know Czech  crystal and they know Becherovka."</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY  </P> <P> Salerno, 220 Beach St., Laguna Beach. Open 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday  through Monday. (714) 497-2600. Owner Tony Manzi's accent is nearly as thick as  his meat sauce, and his menu is just as hearty.  </P> <P> Try the gnocchi, baked mostaccoli with Italian sausage or, if you happen to be  dining with understanding friends, the fettuccine with garlic and oil.  </P> <P> Las Barcas Mexican Restaurant, 21032 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. Open daily,  11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 536-2616. Oversize portions, the hodgepodge decor and a  colorful variety of local folk make this tiny eatery a beachside winner. The  food is good and cheap, featuring ranchero sauce-covered burritos, fresh  snapper tacos and homemade tortilla chips. Be prepared to take out, though, as  there's always a crowd.  </P> <P> Sonic Drive-In, 15640 Brookhurst St., Westminster, and 1632 N. Lemon St.,  Anaheim. Both open Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to midnight; Friday and  Saturday till 1 a.m. (714) 531-8000. Nearly every aspect of this drive-in is  perfect. From the Texas-size drinks (even the straws are big) to the  bodaciously hot-to-handle onion rings and juicy hickory burgers. Pull in  underneath the turquoise-and-white canopy, park next to a squawk box and order  up. APRIL JACKSON  </P></p>

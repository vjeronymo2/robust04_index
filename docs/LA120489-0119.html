			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PORTRAIT OF JESSE AS WHITE MAN  </P> <P> Jesse Jackson, viewing for the first time the controversial painting that  depicts him as a blond, blue-eyed white man, said Sunday, "It's not the picture  that's the insult. It's the reality behind the picture: That's the insult."  </P> <P> The portrait, entitled "How Ya Like Me Now?" by artist David Hammons and part  of the Washington Project for the Arts "The Blues Aesthetic" exhibition, was  placed on a street corner Wednesday evening. Just as three white WPA employees  completed the installation, a group of about 10 black men took a sledgehammer  to the work, knocking a major portion down.  </P> <P> Sunday afternoon, Jackson saw the bottom section of the work, which shows his  face from eyebrows to chin, when he toured the exhibition. He came, he said, to  encourage the gallery, encourage artistic expression and put both the portrait  and the reaction to it "in context."  </P> <P> The "reaction is an extension of the art," he said. "You drop a big rock in the  water -- the issue is not just the rock. It's also the ripples. This is a big  rock."  </P> <P> Jackson said he did not personally find the work insulting "because I  understand it. My response was interpretation and intent. But I understand  those that reacted violently. We must appreciate the source of their pain. They  must not be painted out of the equation."  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Observer: Vestey takes the helm It says something about the paucity of talented admirals in Britain's sinking shipping industry that Edmund Vestey, shy chairman of the family's Blue Star line, has been refloated as president of the Chamber of Shipping. It is 11 years since he last held the job and he had to be press-ganged into serving again. After all, his own business is wallowing somewhat, not to mention the distraction of being chairman of the Masters of Foxhounds Association. There simply aren't enough British shipowners to go round these days. At least Vestey's fleet is near 50 ships and still expanding, whereas rivals such as Ben Line, Port Line, Shaw Savill, Ellerman and Blue Funnel have sunk from sight. The UK-owned and registered fleet has shrunk from 36m dwt to 3.6m dwt since Vestey was last president, and the number of seafarers has fallen by two thirds. Presumably Vestey will follow his predecessors by angling for tax breaks, albeit probably with no more success. Indeed, the fact that his own shipping business has prospered undermines the case for tax perks. Far better to seek a few entrepreneurial recruits for the chamber's declining membership. And how about abolishing separate messes for officers and other ranks? That might catch the PM's eye and ensure Vestey's elusive knighthood.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bourne End Props Bourne End Properties achieved a return to profit in the first half of 1994, with Pounds 231,000 before tax. The figure would have been higher but for professional costs of Pounds 300,000 connected to its planned joint venture to acquire a large property portfolio. The previous first half carried a Pounds 145,000 loss, but a small profit in the second half resulted in a reduced pre-tax deficit of Pounds 55,000 for 1993. Rental income in the six months advanced to Pounds 7.44m (Pounds 2.19m). The company said that a Pounds 103m portfolio acquired last December had been fully consolidated and a further Pounds 30m of property had been purchased. Earnings per share were 0.42p (1.25p losses). The interim dividend is reduced to 0.5p (0.75p) to reduce disparity.</p>

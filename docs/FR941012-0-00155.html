Training costs, which include safety and first-aid training as well as monthly safety and health meetings, account for 32 percent. Personal protective equipment accounts for about 21 percent of total annual costs. First-aid kits for 1.9 percent. Replacement of operator manuals or instructions accounts for 1.5 percent and replacement of seat belts removed from machines and vehicles accounts for about 0.6 percent of total costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Benefits of the Revised Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The record shows that injury rates in the logging industry are high. In 1991, there were 15.6 injuries per 100 workers in the logging industry as compared to an injury incidence rate of 7.9 and 11.2 per 100 workers in the private industry and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Lost workday rates are especially high in the logging industry, indicating that most logging accidents are serious. Based on the data in the record, OSHA estimates that there are approximately 158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries annually in the logging industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised standard mandates a variety of methods of control to reduce hazards in the logging industry. Included in the standard are provisions for personal protective equipment, machine protective devices, equipment inspection and maintenance, work practices, and training. The revised standard is expected to significantly reduce the number of accidents, and, consequently, fatalities and injuries that occur in the logging industry. The ability of the revised standard to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities depends largely on this integrated program of controls to deal with the range of hazards that exist in logging operations. For this reason, the effects of the overall standard on workplace safety is expected to be greater than the effects of the elements of the standard when considered individually. OSHA estimates that compliance with the final standard will prevent 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday cases, and 2,639 nonlost workday cases annually (Table 23). These estimates were developed based on the comprehensiveness of the standard in dealing with the range of workplace hazards in logging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 5,L2,b2,i1,s25,6,6,6,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 23._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Reduction in Fatalities and Injuries From Compliance With the Logging Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Fatalities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Total injuries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Lost workday injuries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Non-lost workday injuries <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Baseline cases  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 158  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10,568  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 6,798  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3,770  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cases avoided by compliance with standard  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 111  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 7,398  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4,759  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,639 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=2 --> Source: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

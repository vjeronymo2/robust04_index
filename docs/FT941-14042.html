			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Brazilian scandal inquiry concludes The committee investigating a corruption racket in Brazil's congress yesterday recommended the expulsion of at least 18 congressmen, including two of the country's most senior politicians. The committee's report also highlighted the role in the scandal of nine construction companies. This is likely to add to pressure for a new inquiry into links between politicians and the companies, among Brazil's most powerful. In an exhausting session which was set to last until late last night, and which was tinged by security fears in case any accused politicians reacted violently to the report's findings, the committee heard the final conclusions of three months of hearings. The corruption scandal involved politicians taking 'fees' in return for approving construction projects within the government's annual budget. The committee also traced other irregularities, including illegal campaign funding, from politicians' bank accounts. According to some estimates, more than Dollars 80m was diverted to members of the scheme. The findings will now be passed to the judiciary for further investigation and possible legal action. The proposed expulsion of the congressmen will be put to the vote in Congress, probably next month. The latest scandal has been seen as a continuation of a political clean-up started by the ousting of former President Fernando Collor. Although it has won wide public backing, support for the inquiry has wavered in recent days amid accusations that some guilty politicians used their influence to avoid investigation, a claim committee members denied.</p>

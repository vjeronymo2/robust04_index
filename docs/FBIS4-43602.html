			<p>BFN     [Text] Former conservative Prime Minister Konstandinos  Mitsotakis has been ordered to stand trial for moral instigation  and violation of his oath of office stemming from alleged  involvement in illegal wiretaps on political foes from 1988 to  1991. Parliament capped an eight-hour debate yesterday by  voting 163 to 6, with six deputies casting blank ballots, to try  Mr Mitsotakis before a special 13-member court.    "If you can legally and morally support (this action) and  believe it will benefit you politically, then continue this  political persecution," the former premier told the 300-seat  chamber. "What you decide leaves me cold and indifferent."    He added that the charges were part of a political vendetta  against him by his political nemesis, Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou, and warned that the decision to place him on trial  would backfire against the socialists.    Immediately following Mr Mitsotakis' speech, the 111  conservative New Democracy deputies walked out of the session  and did not vote.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RYZHKOV CRITICIZES NEW CABINET SYSTEM;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE EMBATTLED PREMIER, WHO USUALLY DEFENDS GORBACHEV, SAYS THE  LEADER'S PLAN 'WILL CHANGE NOTHING IN THE COUNTRY.'  </P> <P> With the shock of his foreign minister's resignation still fresh, Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came under criticism Saturday from yet another  member of his inner circle -- Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the embattled prime minister.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov, who usually defends Gorbachev, called the new Cabinet system the  president is proposing to increase his control over the government "too  cumbersome" and warned that it "will change nothing in the country."  </P> <P> In a rare attempt to shift some of the blame for the Soviet Union's deepening  crisis away from himself, Ryzhkov complained to reporters at the Congress of  People's Deputies, the national Parliament, that "there have been a lot of  mistakes, but why is it that I can say I'm responsible, while others, who  walked side by side with me, do not?  </P> <P> "Did we undertake perestroika only to tear our shirts five years later and say  that we're on the edge of an abyss?" he continued. "Gorbachev remains my  comrade, but he, too, is responsible for what is happening, just as I am. It  must be said honestly what mistakes have been made."  </P> <P> Liberals have been calling for Ryzhkov's resignation for months, contending  that he has blocked needed economic reforms and proved incompetent in coping  with the crisis.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has given Ryzhkov lukewarm support in recent months. Now, he appears  to be seeking a dignified way to jettison the prime minister by proposing to do  away with the Council of Ministers that Ryzhkov heads and choosing a more  compact Cabinet, presumably under a different prime minister.  </P> <P> But the Soviet president appears to be having trouble gathering the  parliamentary support to make the needed constitutional amendments, and Ryzhkov  supporters now believe that the 61-year-old engineer may not be as politically  doomed as many have assumed.  </P> <P> Asked if he would be willing to go on working with Gorbachev in the wake of  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's dramatic resignation Thursday,  Ryzhkov once again appeared to distance himself from the president.  </P> <P> "I'm prepared to work for the country, and not for some specific person," he  said.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov, in a further fragmentation of the Soviet leadership, appeared anxious  to set out his own views on the country's current political and economic  crisis. Although dubbed "The Crying Bolshevik" for his emotional reactions to  criticism, his comments Saturday were notably hard-edged.  </P> <P> He found fault, for example, with Gorbachev's handling of people. "Of all those  who started the struggle for perestroika in 1985," he said, "I am the only one  who remains at his side now, after Shevardnadze's resignation."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's political nemesis, Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin,  got in a glancing blow as well, complaining that rumors of an anti-government  conspiracy were spread intentionally -- although he did not specify by whom --  to further Gorbachev's push for more power.  </P> <P> "This is an invention aimed at aggravating the situation so as to make strong  presidential power a necessity," Yeltsin told reporters.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has been struggling in recent weeks to fight the country's economic  and political disintegration by assuming more powers and launching a campaign  for law and order, which has included the appointment of a tough new interior  minister and warnings of a crackdown from the chief of the KGB security police.  </P> <P> On Saturday, he issued a presidential decree that gives authorities in Moldova,  the tiny southwestern republic riven by ethnic strife, 10 days to disband  nationalist militias and dissolve two self-declared mini-republics whose  creation sparked increased violence this fall.  </P> <P> If they fail to obey, the decree warned, "necessary measures will be taken in  accordance with the powers granted to the president by the constitution of the  Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Gorbachev has the constitutional power to introduce presidential rule in any  area of the Soviet Union, imposing his direct control on local governments, and  he can also declare a state of emergency and deploy troops to enforce it.  </P> <P> Leaders of the three Baltic republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, say they  are deeply afraid of a Kremlin crackdown in the near future, largely as a  result of their open hostility toward the Soviet military units on their  territory.  </P> <P> Tension is especially high in Lithuania, where the army garrison in the port  city of Klaipeda announced that it will begin patrolling the streets and  checking civilians' documents, and in Latvia, where more than five bomb blasts  in the past two weeks have frightened the population, although no one was  injured. An explosion early Saturday blew out 200 windows at a military school  in the Latvian capital of Riga, the official news agency Tass reported.  </P></p>

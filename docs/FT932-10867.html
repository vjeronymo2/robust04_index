			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (2): Signs of strain more evident - Political scene POLITICAL life in Switzerland is normally active, but tranquil. With their cherished system of direct democracy, the Swiss are almost always about to vote on something at either local, cantonal or national level. But the issues involved are usually quite homely - on zoning bylaws or the need for a new school. Meanwhile, debates on issues of national importance tend to be muted by the existence of a broad and loose coalition government composed of all four main political parties. The role of the opposition is left largely to the people themselves in the plebiscites. The Swiss believe that this system ensures that the country's minorities, both linguistic and religious, are all included in the process and therefore do not become alienated. And, as many Swiss will tell you, everyone in the country belongs to a minority. Even the massive majority of German Swiss think of themselves as a minority within the German culture. Indeed, their fears of being swamped by other Germans was probably the main reason a majority of them voted last December against joining the European Economic Area (EEA). However, in the past few years, this subtle political system has come under increasing stress. The country has come up against issues, such as the environment and the need for an army, that have divided political parties and groups of citizens in unexpected ways, leaving the government uncertain about how to act. In the past few months, these strains have become more pronounced. The results of the EEA referendum showed splits not only between French and German speaking Swiss, as was expected, but also between the young and the old and between town and country. Moreover, the Italian Swiss, who side with the Romands on most issues, went with the Germans on this one, apparently reflecting their nervousness about getting too close to Italy. The government remains committed to European integration but cannot push too hard for fear of aggravating these divisions. Then in January when Mr Rene Felber, the social democratic foreign minister, decided to resign for health reasons, the system was suddenly rocked by a surge of feminist power. The Social Democratic Party, which had the right to name a replacement for Mr Felber in the seven-seat cabinet, sensed the mood and selected a woman, Ms Christiane Brunner, from among their ranks. The stolid men of the centre and right wing parties did not, however, appreciate the idea of having a woman in the cabinet, and they attempted rather crudely to discredit her, partly because of her unorthodox dress and life-style, but mainly because she was on record as supporting the idea of abolishing the Swiss army. Their tactics provoked thousands of women of all political stripes and linguistic backgrounds to take to the streets, and eventually they agreed to the election of another woman, Ms Ruth Dreifuss, to the cabinet. The strength of the woman-power phenomenon has been shown in recent cantonal elections, too. In Neuchatel a few weeks ago, the number of women holding seats in the 115 seat assembly doubled from 15 to 31. Similar increases were seen in elections in Aargau and Solothurn. No one expects the feminist power phenomenon to go away, but it remains to be seen what, if any, impact it and other new issues will have on the political structure. One thing though is clear. Nothing will happen impulsively - 'I think we're clever enough not to change our system unless we can find a better way,' says Mr Adolf Ogi, the transport minister and this year's president.</p>

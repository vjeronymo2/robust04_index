			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail shares benefit from Thanksgiving Wall Street US share prices bounced back vigorously from last week's declines as investors looked for good value amid the wreckage of the sell-off, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31.29 up at 3,739.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.87 to 454.16 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 3.20 to 745.72. NYSE volume amounted to 265m shares. The Dow fell more than 140 points in the first three days of last week, and then posted a 33-point recovery on Friday in extremely low volume. The market was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Some analysts still believe there may be a traditional year-end rally but most are bearish about the longer term prospects for the market. Statistics released early in the morning showed sales of existing homes had risen by 0.5 per cent in October, in spite of increasing interest rates, and many fear such data could prompt the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates again in the near term, thus depressing corporate earnings. Most leading retail companies rose after reports from shopping malls across the country of a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Among the stores, Nordstrom gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 46 1/4 , Gap Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36, Ann Taylor Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 3/8 , Dillard Department Stores Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 28, Dayton Hudson Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 78 5/8 , May Department Stores Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 36 and Wal-Mart Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 23 7/8 . JC Penney fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 46 3/8 . RJR Nabisco Holdings was unchanged at Dollars 6 1/4 in spite of news from the consumer products giant that it was developing a smokeless cigarette. Campbell Soup held at Dollars 43 3/4 after announcing that it had agreed to buy Pace Foods, the salsa maker, for Dollars 1.1bn. Campbell said the deal would probably dilute earnings per share in 1995 and 1996. Canada Toronto drifted lower in light, directionless trading, in spite of the solid advance by the New York market. Analysts said local trading was quiet as investors remained a bit gun-shy after the sell-offs last Tuesday and Wednesday. The TSE 300 composite index closed 10.85 points down at 4,088.40, while falls outscored advances by 383 to 311 after volume of 36.8m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by gold, financial, oil and communications stocks. Paper, conglomerates and industrial product issues rose. The golds group fell 1.70 per cent as the New York spot bullion price lost USDollars 1.50 to USDollars 383.10 an ounce. Mexico The bolsa ended sharply higher on mainly local demand as investors bet on a smooth transition of power later this week. The IPC index climbed 77.66 or 3.12 per cent to 2,562.83. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is due to hand over power to President-elect Ernesto Zedillo on December 1. Telmex ADRs rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53 7/8 , while in Mexico its 'L' shares gained 2.22 per cent. Turnover in Telmex accounted for half the bolsa's 72.7m shares traded yesterday. Venezuela The tone was easier in Caracas as the forthcoming share subscription from Electricidad de Caracas weighed on sentiment. The Merinvest composite index slipped 0.60 to 116.64.</p>

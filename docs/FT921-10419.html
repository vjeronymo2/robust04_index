			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Profits rise at Bankers Trust Australia BANKERS Trust Australia, the Sydney-based offshoot of the US-controlled financial services group, has moved against the banking trend in Australia with a strong rise in earnings in 1991. The company yesterday announced a 31 per cent advance in net profits to ADollars 160.8m (USDollars 123.6m) from ADollars 122.8m a year earlier. Pre-tax earnings rose 38.3 per cent to ADollars 279.1m. Mr Rob Ferguson, managing director, said the company's return on average shareholders' funds was 34.2 per cent, and group assets had grown to ADollars 4.5bn from ADollars 3.6bn in the year. 'All areas of the bank posted increased profits,' he said. 'Funds management accounted for one-third of all revenues, while investment banking accounted for the rest. 'This improvement was in spite of the tough economic times. Banker Trust's approach has been prudent in all business areas.' But Mr Ferguson warned the 1991 trading year was unlikely to be repeated. 'Interest rates traded lower during the year,' he said. 'The 90-day Bank Bill rate fell from about 12 per cent at the beginning of the year to less than 8 per cent at the end of 1991. 'This extraordinary rally was clearly an advantageous environment for banks. (In 1992), there may not be the trends in interest rates that characterised 1991. There should, however, be opportunities in other parts of our business that will offset this factor.'</p>

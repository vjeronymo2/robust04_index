			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The high roller who died by the sword: The life and savage death of baccarat addict Akio Kashiwagi HE WAS a small, dapper man, wearing a blue-striped shirt and bank clerk's grey suit. His manner was so unassuming you would hardly know he was there, were it not for the circle of attendants hovering around him, watching his every move. In front of him, stacked on the green baccarat table, were piles of brightly-coloured counters. They represented gaming chips worth Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.2m). The table was separated from the others in the baccarat pit by a red rope, as if reserved for royalty. The little man seemed oblivious of the attention he aroused. He bet the same amount - Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 110,500) - on each successive hand, dealing the cards from the shoe precisely and noting the outcome on a score-card. Winning or losing, his stake never varied. He played for 14 hours, through the night. A small crowd gathered, at a respectful distance, to peer over the rope. The management tried to shoo them away. An executive explained in an awed whisper: 'That's the Warrior. Look how he pushes his piles of chips forward, like a battalion of soldiers going into battle.' His real name was Akio Kashiwagi and he was one of the world's five biggest gamblers, a man capable of winning or losing Dollars 10m in a single night. But the casino operators around the world who knew him as the Warrior had yet another private name for him: the Whale. A whale is a very large, powerful creature. It takes some beaching. But now, the Whale is dead - slashed to death with a samurai sword in his Japanese fortress home. Akio Kashiwagi, the ice-cool high-roller, has played his last hand. *** Kashiwagi's arrival in a casino ignited a heady mixture of fear, excitement and greed in gaming managers. They were like field animals caught in the glare of car headlights. They were dazzled by his action, which they craved  -but terrified that, in the rush, he might run them over. That is what the Warrior did in Darwin, north Australia. That is what he threatened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. That is what he was trying to do in London. He was superstitious, but was without fear: a gambler like no other. Last month, 54-year-old Kashiwagi was found hacked to death. He had been slashed 10 times and died from loss of blood. Police arrested a 44-year-old Japanese yakuza (gangster) named Kodo Saiki and Emi Miyashita, a 23-year-old nurse. It is alleged that Kashiwagi was alone on the night of January 3 when Saiki broke into his home and stabbed him, and that Miyashita helped to clean the getaway car. The police believe that Kashiwagi died for an absurdly low stake. They think he was killed after an argument over the ownership of a car which the Warrior bought from Saiki for Y3.5m (Pounds 15,700), but - according to Saiki - had failed to pay for. If the police are right, the Warrior lost his life for a sum he would have regarded as beneath notice on the baccarat table. *** If Kashiwagi's death was bizarre, so was much of his life. The son of a carpenter, he was born into a poor family near Mount Fuji just before the Second World War and left school at around 16 determined to escape poverty through hard work. He took a back-breaking job as a bearer carrying supplies to the hut at the top of the mountain. When he had saved enough money, Kashiwagi began investing in property. He was helped by his wife, Mieko, a one-time geisha who introduced her husband to her former clients. But he earned a reputation for ruthlessness; it was said that he hired yakuza thugs to persuade reluctant sitting tenants to vacate property which he wanted to develop. Usually, however, he speculated in short-term trades, and once said: 'All the money I have, I made myself. I don't care how I earn it, even if it's through gambling.' He claimed eventually to own Dollars 1bn in assets with an income of about Dollars 100m a year. Yet, he was not listed among the top taxpayers in his district and exactly how he could have built up such a large fortune remains a mystery. He was the only principal of his company, Kashiwagi Shoji, which in 1988 had sales of only Dollars 15m and five employees, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. From the profits he built a handsome, well-fortified house, known locally as Kashiwagi's Palace, on the shores of Lake Kawaguchiko at the foot of Mount Fuji. But the main use for his wealth was to indulge his obsessive desire to become the man who broke the bank in Monte Carlo - or anywhere else. There is no skill in baccarat. Every move is laid down according to fixed rules. The only decision is the side on which to bet - Bank or Player. The object is to get closer to a total of nine (face cards and tens counting as zero). Two cards are dealt to each side, with the possibility of drawing a third. The edge in favour of the house, in return for running and bankrolling the game, is 1.2 per cent. This is one of the lowest margins in casino gambling although it is enough, in the long run, to be highly profitable. But over a limited session, such as a weekend's play, a player can enjoy swings of luck that spell disaster for the casino. Sir Edward Clarke, a former Solicitor-General of England, observed of baccarat at the start of a trial in 1891: 'It seems to me to be about the most unintelligent mode of losing your own money, or getting somebody else's, I ever heard of.' And, indeed, it is very hard to explain its obsessive quality without playing the game. But very rich men who like to gamble are fascinated by it and its stomach-churning suspense - even though they know, as did Kashiwagi, that the house edge, small as it seems, must finally prevail over the player and destroy him. *** Besides his spectacular gaming habits, little is known about Akio Kashiwagi's private life. He ran his real-estate business from a shabby, two-storey building in downtown Tokyo. And, apart from his 'palace,' he lived simply. In American casinos, where he could have had anything he wanted, his favourite food was BLT (bacon, lettuce and tomato) sandwiches and a dish described as marinated monkey meat, prepared by a private chef. He became known as a high roller about four years ago. His routine was to travel to different casinos around the world and play night and day. The casinos welcomed him with open arms although the risks, at the level the Warrior played, were very high. The biggest Las Vegas casinos have a limit of Dollars 200,000 a hand and such establishments do not normally run scared. But given that a hand takes about 45 seconds to play, it does not take very long for a player to win a million - or, indeed, several. One famous night, at the Diamond Beach casino in Darwin, Kashiwagi achieved his ambition to break the bank. At one point, he was Dollars 10m in the hole. He was down to his last Dollars 200,000 bet when his luck changed. In four hours, he won back his losses and went on to beat the casino out of Dollars 19m - equivalent to its average profits for an entire year. But Kashiwagi's most celebrated encounter was at Donald Trump's hotel, the Trump Plaza, in Atlantic City in 1990. The casino was struggling, like most of Atlantic City, and saw his high action as a chance to get out of trouble. Great efforts were made to lure him to the hotel. The Warrior was given the best suite, a split-level apartment with hot tubs, a grand piano, butler service and a long view of the Atlantic ocean. Security was co-ordinated round the clock. An elevator was on standby to take him to the casino floor. Trump was nervous. 'Wow] Two hundred thousand a hand]' he exclaimed. His casino chief, John O'Donnell, tried to reassure him: 'Just be prepared. There are going to be tremendous swings between now and the time he stops playing . . . I've got a real good feeling about this guy.' Kashiwagi brought Dollars 6m in cash (in bank drafts) and was granted a further Dollars 6m credit; a frighteningly large sum, O'Donnell conceded. But he was determined that the Plaza would go for it. The Warrior went down to play on the first evening. His only concern was to avoid publicity and maintain his privacy. He went ahead Dollars 2m. Half an hour later, he was down Dollars 2m. And so it went. He played for eight hours. At 2 am, two hours before the baccarat pit shut, he was still losing Dollars 2m. Then, his luck changed. In the final hour, he won a stupendous 23 hands in a row - which was like calling heads or tails correctly 23 times. At closing time, Kashiwagi had beaten the house for Dollars 4m. Trump, on the telephone, sounded agitated: 'How could that happen?' he demanded. 'What do you mean, Donald? That's the game,' O'Donnell replied. 'But do we keep playing to this guy? Should we throw him out?' asked Trump. 'Absolutely not]' said O'Donnell. Kashiwagi's streak continued. That night, he won another Dollars 2m. By then, the local press had word that one of the world's highest rollers was in town. But Kashiwagi took exception to a remark at the table, about how many hands he was up, and left Atlantic City - a Dollars 6m winner. The Trump Plaza, hell-bent on a return match, gave him a farewell gift and provided a limousine to the airport. *** O'Donnell, who recorded this experience in his memoirs, Trumped], was proved right. Kashiwagi returned in the spring and dropped nearly Dollars 10m over four days of solid play. The Whale had been landed - almost. But Trump, sweating over the action, could not bear the strain any longer. While Kashiwagi still had Dollars 2m in credit, Trump ordered the game closed. The Warrior was furious. He did not have to wait long, though: a rival casino rushed a car over to the Plaza to pick him up. Kashiwagi also played in London, following the same routine of betting Dollars 50,000 a hand at punto banco, as the British version of baccarat is called. 'He played all day and all night, and never gave us any trouble,' one casino manager recalled. Confidants of Kashiwagi believe that the fall of the Japanese property market in 1980 hit him very hard. He had borrowed large sums of money on property investments, which in the good times he could service easily. When the market collapsed, the demands on him became severe. Speculation that he was in debt to the yakuza adds a sinister note. Such organisations know only one way of calling-in bad debts. One Las Vegas manager recalled that Kashiwagi himself could be very tough when it came to settling his gaming losses. 'He had won every battle in his life. The only place he could be denied was the baccarat table.' In his macabre death, he was also a samurai. And, whatever the truth of his passing, casinos around the world are going to miss him. The Warrior is no more.</p>

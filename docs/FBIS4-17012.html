			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kucherenko: "Central Bank Turns the </F> Screws"]    [Text] The Central Bank of Russia's Moscow department  reports that in March another three banks acquired currency  licenses.    "Alternativa," "Moskva," and "Baltiya" received so-called  domestic licenses. That is, the licenses which give the right to  engage in freely convertible currency operations on Russian  territory. And "Lantabank" has acquired an expanded license  which also enables it to establish agent relations with six  foreign counterparts.    Unfortunately, punitive sanctions have had to be applied to  violators of the procedure. As of 1 April the Central Bank main  administration for Moscow suspended for a month the right of  some banks to buy and sell currency using their own funds. They  include the "Eastern-European Investment Bank," the  "Credit-Consensus," "Progress-bank," and "Russian joint-stock  commercial bank."    Their sin is to have engaged in buying and selling in  violation of the limit set by the Moscow administration. And  now, if these institutions intend to disobey the ban through 1  May, deals involving them will be deemed invalid and the funds  they obtain in such operations will go into the state revenue.  Which accords with article 14 of the Russian law "on currency  regulation and currency control." But clients of the guilty  banks may rest assured -- the penalized banks have the right to  buy and sell dollars and marks on instructions from their  clients.    As we can see, the Central Bank seriously intends to  introduce order in the currency operations of its subordinates  -- the commercial banks. But let us not forget that alongside  them firms are alive and well which are merrily dealing in  freely convertible currency without any banking licenses,  without obeying the Central Bank of Russia, and spitting on its  endeavors. They have not been assigned any of the quotas and  rules which the Central Bank sets for its own "vassals." The  Central Bank of Russia cannot take nonexistent permits away from  them or block their accounts, to which sanction any refractory  and undisciplined commercial bank is inexorably subject. As we  were told by Central Bank of Russia spokesman A. Sitnin, all  that can be done is to send letters to the prosecutor's office  and the tax service.    So far this has produced no results. And the bankers'  dissatisfaction is therefore inevitable: "Why are we being  punished and not them?" So that in this delicate sphere, a  highly explosive one for the economy, no consolidation of  statehood can yet be seen.</p>

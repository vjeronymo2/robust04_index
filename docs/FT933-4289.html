			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Proposed ruling will hit Rothmans THE restructured Rothmans tobacco group will be excluded from the FT-SE 100 index if a proposed rule change goes ahead, and nearly half SmithKline Beecham's market capitalisation may also be omitted. The proposed rule change, announced yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee, means that only companies which pay a mandatory UK franked dividend will be eligible for inclusion in the indices. The committee proposed the change in response to the problem set by the restructuring of Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings. Rothmans is a current constituent of the Footsie; Dunhill is a subsidiary of Rothmans and is accordingly excluded from the indices. Four new companies will be formed: Rothmans plc and Rothmans International NV; and Vendome plc and Vendome SA. Although the two pairs will be linked in the form of inseparable units, shareholders will be able to elect whether to receive the dividend from either the PLC or the NV company. If they choose the latter, the dividend will not be franked (ie, will be paid gross). It is a principle of the indices that only UK companies are included, but at Rothmans/Vendome, the ability of shareholders to elect for dividends makes it impossible to give a precise definition of the proportion of the company which counts as UK-based. The committee, which consists of market participants and is chaired by Mr Peter Jones of fund managers M&amp;G, has proposed a rule which says that companies where shareholders may choose between a franked or an unfranked dividend would not be eligible. This rule would exclude Rothmans/Vendome from the indices. It would also cause a problem for SmithKline Beecham units which have been included in the indices for several years, and make up nearly half the capitalisation of the company. The rules, as drafted, would exclude the units, which comprise about 1 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index. Discussions are taking place with the company and its advisers. Mr Mark Makepeace, head of indices at the Stock Exchange said: 'The problem is that it is very difficult to look through the structure of Rothmans/Vendome and say how much of it is a UK company. The index is designed to serve investors who are seeking to gain exposure to UK companies, and not those from overseas.' Mr Ken Costa, of Warburg Securities, joint brokers to Rothmans/Vendome, said: 'We're trying to understand the basis for the decision before making any further comment.' The rule needs to be approved by the FT-SE Actuaries share Indices Steering committee which meets on October 6. The composition of the indices is very important to investment managers who aim either to track them, or outperform them. See Lex</p>

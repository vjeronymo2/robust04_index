			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruno Franceschi] </F>   [Excerpts] Sarajevo, June 27 (AFP) -- UN officials were  seeking a meeting with Bosnian Serb and Moslem military leaders  Monday following the killing of a British UN soldier by  suspected Serb gunners and other attacks on peacekeepers in the  eastern enclave of Gorazde. Commander Eric Chaperon, spokesman  for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the unidentified  soldier was killed Sunday evening at his observation post in  Gorazde, probably by Serb gunners. His death brought to 44 the  number of peacekeepers killed in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the past  two years. "Sunday was a really bad day for the UN in Gorazde,"  Chaperon said. He said UN patrols in the region had come under  repeated attack by Serb and Moslem gunners throughout the  weekend, but no further casualties were reported. [passage  omitted]    Elsewhere, artillery duels continued Monday in the northern  Mount Ozren region, where the Moslem-led Bosnian army has been  waging a major offensive against Serb forces, but the fighting  was less intense than over the weekend, Chaperon said. "It is  clear that the Bosnian troops have made territorial gains," he  said although he couldn't provide any more details.    The Serbs have reportedly evacuated several villages in the  area in the face of the Moslem offensive.    Chaperon said UN military observers deployed in the north  were reporting heavy shelling from both sides. The observers  were finding it increasingly difficult to accomplish their  mission as they are not being granted access to the battle  zones, he said. The fighting is in a strategic zone just south  of a thin land corridor linking Serb-conquered territory in  northeast and western Bosnia. [passage omitted]</p>

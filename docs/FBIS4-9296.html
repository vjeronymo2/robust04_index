			<p>CSO     [Text] (STA) Podgorica -- The accusation leveled by the  Belgrade Center for Antiwar Activities against the Montenegrin  state leadership for war crimes committed against civilians,  specifically refugees, no doubt seriously endangers the security  and stability of that state. The accusation is plausible, based  on documents signed by Nikola Pejakovic, Montenegrin minister of  interior affairs. The documents state that scores of Muslim  refugees arrested by the Montenegrin police last May were handed  over to the Serbian police, after which they vanished without a  trace.</p>

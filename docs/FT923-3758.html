			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sunleigh turnround to Pounds 11,000 profit Substantial progress was made by Sunleigh, the leisure products group, in the half year to June 30. It turned round from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.33m to profit of Pounds 11,000. Mr Robert Upsdell, chairman, pointed out, however, that market conditions at home and abroad showed no sign of improvement. He said the restructuring and refocusing of Sunleigh as an active leisure group continued with the acquisition in April of a majority holding in Gaval Securities, which makes sailing dinghies and catamarans under the Laser and Dart trademarks. The acquisition had also advanced the group's strategy to develop a more international business base, to the extent that some 40 per cent of group sales were expected to arise from overseas markets. Turnover came to Pounds 6.97m (Pounds 5.34m). The profit was struck after a Pounds 51,000 charge arising from stock write-downs and compensation for loss of office to the former chairman.</p>

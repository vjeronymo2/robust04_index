			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The East Jerusalem dailies AL-QUDS and  AL-NAHAR and the weekly AL-MANAR on 27 June carry editorials on  the Shamgar Commission report dealing with the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre in Hebron.    An editorial in Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic on page 11  entitled "A Report That Contained Nothing New" notes: "It is  not surprising that the Palestinians received the report,  released yesterday, by the Shamgar Commission set up by Israel  to investigate the circumstances of the bloody and horrifying  massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque with condemnation and  denunciation." The paper adds: "This commission ignored the  fact that the horrible massacre came as a result of the policy  of encouragement and tolerance pursued by the occupation  authorities in dealing with the settlers, their crimes, and  their attacks against defenseless Palestinians about which the  Palestinian side had always warned. It also ignored the issue  of the settlement and arming the settlers as a main cause for  the massacre." The paper deems the commission's recommendation  to restrict the introduction of weapons into the mosque as  inadequate. It asks: "When there is more than one Goldstein  among armed settlers, what guarantee is there that another armed  settler will not commit another massacre in another place?" The  editorial decries the fact that no Israeli official has been  called to justice despite such a horrible massacre. It  concludes: "At any rate, the above-mentioned commission report  affirms the Palestinian conviction that, from the outset, the  formation of this commission was aimed at exonerating Israel  from its responsibility and absorbing the effects of the  massacre, especially in the international arena. From this  premise, the commission report was not surprising to us, nor did  it add anything new to what we had been accustomed to in this  regard."    In an editorial on pages 3 and 7 entitled "The Shamgar  Report  and the Omitted Facts," Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic says that  "the commission's report should have explained that in Hebron  and Qiryat Arba' there is fertile ground for extremists and that  more Goldsteins are waiting for an opportunity to commit similar  massacres against the defenseless and innocent Palestinian  people, as Rabin himself admitted yesterday. We hoped that the  report would recommend the need to put an end to those  bloodthirsty extremists." After noting that the report called on  the Israeli Government to separate Muslims and Jews in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque, the paper asks: "Why did the commission not  have the courage to sanction the separation of Muslims and Jews  in the city by removing the Jews from there?    "With all due respect to the commission members, the report  was bland in color and content, as if the objective was not to  point an accusing finger or offend the emotions of any party."  In conclusion, the paper says the Palestinians had hoped that  the commission report would be a verdict on the settler  terrorism, "but it was disappointing and created bitterness and  scorn among our people."    Jerusalem AL-MANAR in Arabic on page 1 carries an editorial  entitled "The Shamgar Report and Disregard of the Facts." This  paper, too, says that the Shamgar Commission report was  "disappointing" and "ignored many of the facts which this  commission should have taken into account." The editorial notes  that "the Israeli Government and all the political and security  leaders welcomed this report because it did not hold any of them  responsible. It placed the responsibility for this hideous  crime on Barukh Goldstein alone." The paper accuses the Israeli  Government of ignoring the Palestinians' complaints against the  settlers and says that "settlements are time bombs that might  explode at any moment, and the Shamgar Commission failed to  mention these settlements in its report which filled more than  300 pages." After asserting that Goldstein alone did not commit  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the editorial says: "While  rejecting this report which has been welcomed by all the Israeli  leadership, we emphasize that the causes which led Goldstein and  his partners to commit their crime are still there."</p>

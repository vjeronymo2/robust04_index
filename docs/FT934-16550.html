			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Californian tax row near resolution: New law addresses foreign protests at unitary system GOVERNOR Pete Wilson of California today will sign into law a bill to change the state's controversial unitary system of taxation. The new law, which addresses most of the complaints by foreign companies and governments at the unitary system, sounds the bell for the last round in a decade-old legal fight between California and Barclays Bank of the UK, which has challenged the constitutionality of the state's tax system. As soon as Mr Wilson has signed the bill, the US solicitor-general is expected to file a brief with the US Supreme Court arguing that the new legislation renders the Barclays complaint moot, and so the court should leave in place a decision by California's supreme court in favour of the state. Barclays and the UK government will respond with briefs by the end of next week, then the Supreme Court would be expected to announce whether it will hear the case or dismiss it outright on November 1. At stake is some Dollars 533m (Pounds 353m) of tax refunds California would owe Barclays and other foreign-owned companies if it lost the case, as well as an estimated Dollars 354m the state believes it would be able to assess in taxation if it won. Besides, the state could have another Dollars 3.1bn at risk if any Supreme Court condemnation of unitary taxation were extended to US-owned companies. The Clinton administration has been buffeted between its promise to back California in the lawsuit and pressure from US businesses and foreign governments, particularly the UK, to uphold the principles of the international taxation system which are seen to be challenged by unitary taxation. California's new legislation might diminish the likelihood that the Supreme Court will decide to hear the Barclays case, but the principal factor prompting that legislation - the UK's threat to retaliate against US companies - reinforces the Barclays arguments about the unconstitutionality of unitary taxation. All in all, lawyers on both sides believe the chances that the Supreme Court will take the case are less than even. One piquant element in the affair is the understanding that the principal author of the brief from the solicitor-general's office is Mr Kent Jones, who just a year ago wrote the Bush administration's brief against California.</p>

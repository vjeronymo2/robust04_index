			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Alekskey Larionov, by Sergey Saktaganov: </F> "Zhirinovskiy's Supporters in Sakhalin Have United and Are  Thinking About Places in the Oblast Parliament"]    [Text] In the second half of December, leaflets  appeared in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, with appeals to Zhirinovskiy  supporters to create their LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] organization on the island. The organizing body  consisting of eight people, which includes young workers,  students, and even one unemployed person, was headed by Aleksey  Larionov, a 28-year-old watchman at a genetic clinic. On the  local political scene, as he himself has admitted, he is no  newcomer: as long ago as the early 1980's he was given  "prophylactic treatment" by the KGB and removed from the school  Komsomol organization for having prepared leaflets containing  excerpts from Voice of America broadcasts. Four years later he  was an activist in the local organization of DemSoyuz  [Democratic Union], maintaining contacts also with  representatives of the NTS (National Labor Union).    In and of itself, the conversion of what used to be an  ultra-democrat into the initiator of the creation of an LDPR  "cell" appears to be a tremendous political somersault. Because  literally a few days ago the leader of the previously mentioned  DemSoyuz, Valeriya Novodvorskaya compared Zhirinovskiy to  Hitler, and she promised the Russians that, if the Communist  Party merged with the LDPR, they could expect gas chambers,  crematoriums, and torture chambers. But what is interesting  today is not so much a change in the "political face" of one of  the Sakhaliners, as the immediate plans of Zhirinovskiy's  supporters on the island. That was specifically the topic of the  conversation with Aleksey Larionov.    [Saktaganov] To begin with, I would like to know what forced  you to reject so sharply your previous political views. Because,  judging from the results of the recent election, the same thing  occurred with many Sakhaliners...    [Larionov] My views did not change. The organizations  changed. And just as I became an anti-Communist in the tenth  grade, I have remained one. Incidentally, Vladimir Volfovich is  also an anti-Communist, and during this transitional period it  is only he who can stop the "Red wave" that is in motion...    [Saktaganov] But aren't you embarrassed by the fact that, at  a party-wide banquet that the political leaders held in Moscow  to celebrate the election results, Zhirinovskiy ostentatiously  shook the hand of the "chief" Russian Communist Zyuganov? True,  he emphasized that this was only "a handshake between Slavs,"but  it was extremely symbolic...    [Larionov] During all these years I realized that politics  is  actually dirty business. People do not engage in politics in  white gloves. If we want to put an end to Communism, this must  be achieved by democratic means. But from tactical  considerations it is possible to shake Zyuganov's hand. It is  also possible today to walk alongside of him in parliament to a  definite coalition. But the necessity of this kind of alliance  exists only in the State Duma, where Vladimir Volfovich does not  have enough votes. In the outlying areas, in the regions, we  shall not take the step of entering an alliance with the local  Communist Party organizations, or with this Paramoshkin.    We always are well aware that the Communists are our  enemies.  When Zhirinovskiy comes to power, the Communists -- if we can  express it this way -- will be the first to suffer. If they do  not understand this, this is all the worse for them.    [Saktaganov] If it is not a secret, how will they suffer?  Will they "sit" [that is, be imprisoned]? Will they be given  "prophylactic treatment," as you were at one time by the KGB?    [Larionov] Our leader will decide that. Our job is to carry  out his orders. But from my point of view it will be necessary  to take drastic measures.    [Saktaganov] If you are a supporter of strict party  discipline, how do you intend to carry out Vladimir Volfovich's  policy in the territorial question? After all, Zhirinovskiy,  speaking, in particular, in Novosibirsk, stated that for him the  Kurile problem does not exist, and it is very simple to resolve  the frictions with Japan: just aim the big guns at Japan and  demand... Hokkaido. Will your organization in Sakhalin boycott  the Japanese delegations, arm itself with those big guns, and  protest against humanitarian aid from a neighboring country?    [Larionov] I shall say immediately that we shall not arm  ourselves, because we are supporters of legal methods of taking  action But, obviously, we shall boycott any Japanese  representatives and measures with which they are linked. So I  agree with our leader in his view of the territorial question  --and not only with regard to Hokkaido or the Kuriles, but also  with regard to Poland, Finland, and Alaska. First Russia must  stand on its feet, but the time will come when it will be  necessary to resolve the question concerning its borders from a  position of strength.    [Saktaganov] Zhirinovskiy have repeatedly stated in public  that, when he comes to power, all the Jews will be exiled from  Russia. What is your attitude toward them and, in general,  people of other nationalities who are living on the territory of  the oblast?    [Larionov] There are two questions here, because it is  necessary to isolate the Jews from all the other nationalities.  Vladimir Volfovich is right: they are a people who, by their  mentality, are committed to world domination. The history not  only of Russia, but also of all other countries, indicates that  it is impossible to get along peaceably with this nation, but we  do not want to take any extreme measures against them. Therefore  it would be best for themselves if they just leave.    As for other nationalities -- the Tatars, for example, or  the  Mordvinians -- they must recognize the values of Russia and the  Russians, and, in that case, they can continue to live here.    But there will not be any union republics. There will be  guberniyas where the local population -- for example,  Uzbeks -- will have complete cultural autonomy, their own  language and traditions, but they will also be subjects of the  Russian empire.    [Saktaganov] One of the most brilliant figures among the  LDPR  candidates was Kashpirovskiy. Do you also plan to bring into  your ranks the Sakhalin "extrasensory perceptionists" or people  who feel that they are somehow linked with cosmic energy  --followers of yoga, soothsayers, shamans?...    [Larionov] It's still too early to talk about this. But I  feel that, with time, everyone will be with us. Including the  extrasensory perceptionists, if they prove to be beneficial in  the political struggle. Incidentally, Kashpirovskiy is doing a  lot not only for Vladimir Volfovich, but also for the entire  party...    [Saktaganov] What social segments do you plan to rely on in  our oblast?    [Larionov] On all of them except the intelligentsia.  Vladimir  Volfovich was right a year ago, when he said that the  intelligentsia would not understand us. And we put a very low  evaluation on the intelligentsia, inasmuch as the Russian  intelligentsia always played a fatal role in our country's  history.    [Saktaganov] I am, of course, somewhat upset by such a stern  sentence pronounced on the intelligentsia.. But you, as a public  and political figure, will still have to deal with it. Or at  least with those journalists. For example, which of the oblast  newspapers, in your opinion, is close to the LDPR in spirit?    [Larionov] The one that is probably closest in spirit is  GUBERNSKIYE VEDOMOSTI.    [Saktaganov] What will be your tactics in the 6 March  election to the oblast parliament? Are there any possible allies  among the local politicians?    [Larionov] First of all we are counting on the ordinary  people. But we also intend to work with the military and with  the law-enforcement agencies. But we completely reject the  current political establishment -- Krasnoyarov, Fedorov,  Feoktistov, Mikhaylov, etc.    If, in January, we succeed in forming an able-bodied  organization, we shall put our candidates to the oblast  parliament in contact with the local branch of the Russian  National Council, where Gennadiy Semenov is the chairman.    [Saktaganov] Would you like to take this opportunity to say  anything to the readers?    [Larionov] I would like to thank the Sakhaliners for having  made this choice. They have proven to be wiser than many  Russians: our oblast occupies one of the first places with  regard to the number of votes cast for the LDPR. And I would  call upon the inhabitants of the island to unite with our  organization. If possible, I would like you give the telephone  number where I can be contacted: 3-24-02...    [Editor's note]    We would like to emphasize immediately that our newspaper  will never be "close in spirit" to the Zhirinovskiy supporters.  And the sentence pronounced by them on the Russian  intelligentsia pertains literally to each of the SVOBODNYY  SAKHALIN journalists.    But, unlike the LDPR activists who are proceeding along the  path that has already been well-trodden by the  political-investigation workers -- the path of giving  "prophylactic treatment" to dissenters and persons of other  nationalities, we are ready to give the floor to any of the  political opponents, if, of course, he operates within the  confines of the law.    And there is something else. We hope that the Sakhaliners  who  voted for Zhirinovskiy in the recent election, after receiving  more detailed information about the LDPR, so to speak,  first-hand, will finally understand precisely what is  approaching Russia. A person with ears will hear, and a person  with eyes will see...</p>

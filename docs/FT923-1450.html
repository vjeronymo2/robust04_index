			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Keating fears being shut out of Asian trade AUSTRALIA'S prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, warned in Tokyo yesterday that exclusive trade groupings in Asia and the Pacific were a threat to open trade in the region. Mr Keating is concerned over the various Asian trading groups that are emerging in response to the faltering Uruguay Round. Meanwhile in Washington, the treasurer, Mr John Dawkins and the trade minister, Mr John Kerin, are also talking bilateral trade, and protesting at the recent sale of 220,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan, a traditional market for Australian cereals. The ministers' trips come two months after Mr Keating publicly pondered Australia's 'life after Gatt'. He has argued that a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would be best, but if it failed Australia should explore 'Gatt-friendly' regional arrangements. The problem for Australia, according to a government advisory group, is that Asia's embryonic trade groups see little value in including a small and marginal market like Australia, which is anyway an object of suspicion because of its westernised views on politics and human rights. The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which aims at free trade in most manufactured goods, ignores Australia's main interest, which is farm products. The US has invited Australia to join the proposed North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA), regardless of the geographical conundrum that implies. But the US could refuse to dismantle existing barriers to critical Australian exports to the US like steel, sugar and beef. The group which seems to be gaining the edge in the Asian region is the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) which was an initiative of the Malaysian prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Here, however, Australia and New Zealand have been left out. In Japan this week, Mr Keating will hear whispers that Japanese business is actively encouraging the EAEC. This is despite government officially supporting Australia's own initiative, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Group (APEC), formed four years ago as Australia's attempt to affirm its Asian links. APEC would be the prefered forum for Australia, and was seen as helping it to gain clout in the fight against EC protectionism. Australia has traditionally considered the EC as the principal offender on corrupting trade in its key exports, particularly wheat. But this conviction has been clouded recently by subsidised US wheat exports to key Australian markets like Kuwait, Yemen and Pakistan. APEC's problem is that it is suspect just because it is chaired by west-leaning Australia. Moreover, if Japan throws in its lot with the EAEC, APEC would become less viable as a free trade bloc.</p>

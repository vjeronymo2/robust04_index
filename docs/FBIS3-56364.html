Follows the full text of his  toast:    "Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, dear guests, ladies and  gentlemen,    I think you will agree with me in saying that these last  days  brought a special meaning to our life and activity. The world  is watching the events in Russia. Amid the stormy political  developments which dominate Moscow's current life, the visit of  the president of the United States of America nonetheless  attracted particularly close attention.    Our meeting testifies to the fact that Russia is concerned  not only with its own problems, but feels itself an integral  part of the world community, and shares in the world's anxieties  and hopes.    Time flies unbelievably fast during official visits.  Literally all of the available time is scheduled, and we, Mr.  President, have succeeded in making the utmost use of every  minute. The key is not only in the fact that the visit was  thoroughly prepared in advance. Most importantly, both the  Russian and American sides had a sincere desire to reach a  mutual understanding and give our partnership a new, global  scope.    Each of our discussions with President Clinton was direct  and  honest. We spoke about the most important problems and didn't  shun acute issues, looking for unconventional solutions to them.  This, I believe, is the way of both the Russian and American  peoples.    The ground-breaking results of the Russian-American summit  in  Moscow are not the only reason why this day is important.  Russia celebrates January 14 as the first day of the New Year,  according to the Russian Orthodox calendar. We have always  observed this day, even in the hardest times.    In line with Russian tradition, I would like to wish our  American guests and all those present good health and well-being  in the new year. The year that has begun is new for Russia in  every sense of the word. The country has entered this year with  a new constitution which meets modern, civilized standards. The  Federal Assembly, elected by free and democratic vote, has begun  its work. In these past elections, the citizens of Russia  reaffirmed their commitment to internal peace and stability,  democracy, and Russia's renewal.    Along with this, it is as clear as always that all  developments in Russia are of vital importance for the whole  world. Now we need to be sincerely supportive of each other's  success, since the resolution of Russia's problems is a key  factor in achieving global stability and confirming the basic  values of the modern world.    It is not enough to mouth these values. It is necessary to  bring one's actions into line with them in order to achieve  tangible results. Only then will the recognition of these  values in every country lead to the success of the entire world  community.    Life in a free and democratic society must be better both  for  the common people of every single nation, and for the whole  world community. This is not only about upholding ideals, but  also about providing people with everything necessary for a  worthy life. This goal cannot be attained without pooling our  efforts, without defining our partnership in practical terms.  Together we shall overcome. To me, this famous phrase means  that only together can we ensure the triumph of freedom  everywhere in the world and, most importantly, in the hearts of  the people who live in it.    We appreciate the active role played by the present U.S.  Administration in mobilising international support for Russian  reforms. But of course, we would welcome the further  intensification of these efforts. Economic interaction is now  moving to the centre of the Russian-American partnership in all  its diversity.    It is necessary to speed up the implementation of the Tokyo  Accords. It is very important for us to have a respite in  repaying our external debt. We want fair access to the American  and world markets, an expansion of trade and investments, and  assistance to Russia in creating the infrastructure needed for a  civilized market economy.    Ever more people in our countries are now keeping an eye on  the rouble exchange rate against the dollar and the dynamics of  stocks and shares on exchange markets in Moscow and New York.  This is an encouraging sign of our transition to a normal,  civilized financial system.    I can say more: For the first time, it is now becoming  possible to form long-term, diversified links between our two  economies. This is a reliable foundation on which to build our  strategic partnership. The prospect of creating a free trade  zone between the two countries deserves special attention.    On the whole, a variety of bilateral ties between Russia and  the United States is now being actively developed.    The Russian-American dialogue is increasingly centering  around relatively new problems, including the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and their delivery-vehicles,  regional arms races, as well as outbursts of nationalism and  other kinds of extremism.    All this does not mean, of course, that there are no  problems  in the Russian-American relationship. But the main thing is  that both we and the Americans consider the solution to these  problems attainable through dialogue in which both sides are  equally interested and which is based on commonality of our  long-term national interests.    In closing, I would like to recall the words of the  far-sighted traveller and thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, who  wrote more than 150 years ago that there are two great nations  in the world at present, which began their movement from  different starting points, but seem to be progressing towards  the same objective. I mean the Russians and the Americans.  Their origin is different, and their paths are dissimilar, but  nevertheless both appear to be among God's chosen nations.    History has offered us a unique chance to realize the full  potential of partnership and friendship between our two great  states. Democratic Russia is ready to make full use of this  potential. Permit me to propose a toast to the health of the  President of the United States and his wife and to the  well-being and prosperity of the American and Russian peoples."</p>

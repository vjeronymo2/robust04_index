			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By L. Baterna Hubert] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Belgium -- The Ramos Administration has  swept away all chances of a peace accord between the government  and the National Democratic Front (NDF), said Luis Jalandoni,  NDF vice chairman for international affairs, during a talk  before a small group at the Centre International over the  weekend.    Jalandoni assailed the declaration of an executive order  which "imposed the Philippine Government Constitution as the  framework of the peace talks."    "For the NDF, the political arm of the Communist Party of  the  Philippines (CPP), this is a violation of the government-NDF  Joint Declaration signed in The Hague (Netherlands) last  September 1992," Jalandoni said.    "This imposition of the rule of law will never be accepted  because it will be synonymous to surrender and it fails to  recognize that the revolutionary movement has its own  constitution, programs, and processes."    Jalandoni, now a Dutch citizen based at the NDF headquarters  in Utrecht, The Netherlands, also cited the NDF's opposition to  President Ramos' amnesty proclamations which, he said, "grant a  license to kill and encourage the same people who were  responsible for salvaging and the disappearance of persons to  commit more crimes while extending amnesty to renegades and  corrupt officials who profit from false surrenders."    He disclosed that an NDF communique was sent recently to  former Ambassador Howard Dee of the government negotiating panel  that "with the amnesty proclamations and the executive order,  the Philippine Government has put huge obstructions in the peace  process."    "A possible meeting between government and NDF  representatives cannot take place as long as these obstacles,  which Ramos himself had placed, remain," he said.    Meanwhile, Philippine Ambassador to the Netherlands Romeo  Arguelles confirmed that former Ambassador Dee had direct  communication with the NDF. "They are still talking, although  no agreement has yet been reached on the venue for the second  round of exploratory talks," Arguelles said. "As far as Manila  is concerned, the government is still open and is prepared to  negotiate."    Jalandoni, guest speaker of a conference with slide  presentation and photo exhibit organized by the Centre  International in collaboration with the Ligue Anti-Imperialiste  and the Groupe Philippines de Belgique, related the "25 years of  resistance in the Philippines" in commemoration of the 25th year  anniversary of the New People's Army (NPA).    Connie Ledesma of the Makibaka [Makabayan Kilusan ng Bagong  Kababaihan -- Nationalist Movement of New Womanhood] Women's  Front, who spoke on the "Role of Filipino Women in the Armed  Struggle," joined Jalandoni on the panel.    "Despite Ramos' predictions that the NPA would self-destruct  in December 1993, the NPA is still here, large, strong, and  flourishing. It will continue to be so long after the Ramos  Administration have left the scene. With the support of the  masses, the NPA is invincible," he said.    Tanada [Subhead]    Senate Minority Leader Wigberto Tanada asked President Ramos  to recast his conditional and limited amnesty into a general and  unconditional amnesty as recommended by the National Unification  Commission (NUC) to encourage rebel groups to surrender with  honor and justice.    In a privilege speech, Tanada said that the two amnesty  proclamations are a "virtual trap" that would discourage instead  of encourage the rebels to apply for amnesty because the  approval or disapproval of amnesty applications is open-ended.    "I am for amnesty. But I am for amnesty at the proper time  and after the proper preliminary steps have been taken; not the  amnesty in the form, spirit, and substance the administration is  foisting," Tanada said.    He added that the government and the rebel groups should  have  first sat down over the negotiating table to ensure the success  of any amnesty proclamation.    Tanada said that he has been informed by all the armed rebel  groups -- leftists, rightists, and secessionists -- of their  blanket rejection of a unilateral amnesty outside of  negotiations.    "Without the active participation of these rebel forces,  Proclamation 347 and 348 will not be workable and will generate  more problems than they will resolve," he said. "Let us  remember that the commitment to negotiate goes with the  commitment not to take any action that will be seen to sabotage  or endanger the negotiations."    Tanada expressed his strongest objection to the "dangerous  and unacceptable" Proclamation 348 extending amnesty to  applicants from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and  the Philippine National Police (PNP) personnel who may have  committed human rights violations in connection with their  counter-insurgency operations.    "It is dangerous and unacceptable," he said. "It is amnesty,  or forgiveness, being extended by government to its own agents  against the very people that government is supposed to serve and  protect."    He argued that the only ones who are in a position to  forgive  human rights violators are the human rights victims, not the  government.</p>

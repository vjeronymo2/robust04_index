			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Upbeat Chrysler lifts payout again Chrysler yesterday under-scored its confidence in its financial outlook by boosting its dividend for the second time in six months. It also announced plans to eliminate its large unfunded pension liability by the end of 1994. The initiatives reflect surging US demand for vehicles, and Chrysler's success in winning market share through a succession of attractively-styled cars and light trucks. The quarterly dividend will rise from 20 to 25 cents a share for the payout due on July 15. Chrysler increased the dividend from 15 to 20 cents a share with its mid-January payment. That was the first rise since it halved the dividend from 30 cents in the second quarter of 1991. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, told yesterday's annual meeting Chrysler had not planned to increase the dividend again so quickly, nor fully fund its pension obligations this year. 'But because of our strong cash flow and what looks like a continued strong auto market and general economy, we believe these actions are warranted,' he said. The company had Dollars 4.5bn in cash at the end of last year, and this had risen to Dollars 5.9bn at the end of the first quarter. Chrysler's unfunded pension liability has been a restraint on the company's stock and credit rating for many years. It stood at Dollars 3.9bn at the end of 1992, and dropped to Dollars 2.2bn at the close of last year. Chrysler put an additional Dollars 700m into the fund early this year, and the recent rise in US interest rates should also have shrunk the shortfall. Detroit rival General Motors, which has the largest US pension deficit, announced plans earlier this month to inject some Dollars 10bn into its fund, with Dollars 4bn coming from improved cashflow and Dollars 6bn in the form of its E series stock. The stock is linked to the performance of EDS, its computing services subsidiary. Mr Eaton said Chrysler's aggressive action indicated 'the degree of confidence we have in ourselves, the strength of the automotive market and the overall economy'. His remarks contrasted sharply with Chrysler's plight three years ago when, facing the onset of US recession with a tired product line and falling market share, its future as an independent company seemed in doubt. Moody's, the credit information agency, raised its senior debt ratings for Chrysler to Single-A3 from Baa2 yesterday.</p>

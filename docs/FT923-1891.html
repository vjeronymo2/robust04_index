			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Auditors report price pressure MANY SMALL firms of chartered accountants are experiencing severe price competition for audit work, according to the findings of a new survey. 'Lowballing' or predatory pricing by rival firms for audit bids has caused concern for nearly two thirds of a sample of 46 members of the CharterGroup partnership, an association of accountancy firms. Many firms have reported over the past few months that they have been coming under pressure to reduce audit fees. The ethics committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was sufficiently concerned about lowballing to circulate a discussion paper on the subject. Sixty-three per cent of the CharterGroup survey said the present extent of lowballing was sufficient to warrant concern, and 76 per cent believed it would lead to a lowering of audit standards.</p>

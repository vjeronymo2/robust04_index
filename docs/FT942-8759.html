			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Doctors warn of disputes over pay The National Health Service will face 'unseemly and divisive' local disputes if proposals to introduce performance-related pay are implemented, the British Medical Association warned the government yesterday. Ministers want the NHS to begin moving from central to local pay determination this year. Following a series of preliminary meetings with Department of Health officials, the BMA yesterday expressed 'profound objections' to doctors' national terms and conditions being changed. BMA leaders say they have been told that, from next April, the Doctors and Dentists Review Body will recommend only 'exceptionally modest' national increases, leaving local NHS trusts to award any further rises under performance related pay schemes. Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the BMA council, warned in a letter to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday that the degree of control such schemes offered managers would introduce a dangerous principle to the medical field. Hospital consultants' first duty was to their patients, but there was a risk of performance related pay forcing them to comply with a trust's business needs. The BMA has told Mrs Bottomley that it is willing to discuss alternative remuneration structures for doctors, but it objects to being faced with a 'single dogmatic solution'. The 1991 NHS reforms heralded a move from central pay determination. Many doctors believe that the existence of national pay and conditions is an important element in ensuring consistent standards of care across the country.</p>

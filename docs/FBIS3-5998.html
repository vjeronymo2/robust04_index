			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA March 12. -- The British Government has  decided to contribute a further USD [U.S. dollars] 1.9 million  to the European Community International Programme (ECIP) for the  reintegration of Vietnamese boatpeople who have returned from  camps in the region, says a press release made available here by  the British Embassy.    Seventy percent of the money will go into the very popular  ECIP credit scheme which benefits ordinary people and  repatriates as well as those who wish to borrow money to start  small businesses. The rest will go into microprojects to  improve the living standard in areas heavily affected by  economic migration.    The decision reinforces the UK's position as the largest  single national donor to the ECIP and takes the total British  contribution to almost USD 10 million, not including the  standard contribution which the UK pays automatically as a  member of the EC.    Commenting on this event, British Ambassador to Vietnam  Peter  Williams said: `This additional sum underlines the UK's  commitment to real cooperation with the Vietnamese Government in  solving the tragic humanitarian problem of boatpeople in Hong  Kong and elsewhere in the region. We believe that the ECIP  offers the best possible source of assistance for returnees and  for local authorities who have to reintegrate them into society.  I hope that as many migrants as possible will understand this  and avail themselves of the benefits of the ECIP by returning  before the end of the programme in November.'</p>

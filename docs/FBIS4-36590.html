			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source in the Democratic Republic of  Yemen [DRY] welcomed the American stand concerning the necessity  of Sanaa's obligations to the UN Security Council's resolution  on cease-fire and not to impose unity by force.    In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, Aden, the source  also praised the communique of the Arab Gulf countries, members  of the Cooperation Council, and the communique of the ARE [Arab  Republic of Egypt] expressing thanks to the fraternals in the  Gulf and Egypt for their positive stand which shows eagerness  about Yemen's land and people.    The source added: We announce our thanks to the Arab  community and the world community, which rejected the law of  force, destruction and bloodshed, and we would like to confirm  our obligation to the Security Council Resolution No. 924 and  that Sanaa is trying to deceive the world just as it did in the  night of the blessed 'Id al-Adha when it announced a cease-fire  and gave its orders to its forces to resume fighting.    The source said: We are picking up signals of orders by the  head of the Sanaa regime to these forces in the fighting fronts  to regather and mobilize themselves in an offensive position on  our country. And, as for us, we will commit ourselves to the  resolution of the world community and we will not do any  military action except in defense against the awaited attack.</p>

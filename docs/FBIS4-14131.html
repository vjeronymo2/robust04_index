			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, one of the officials of the  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Damascus, said that last  Friday's [22 April] agreement between representatives of the  Fatah Hawks and the Hamas 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions in  Gaza is not the beginning of a political agreement between the  two sides. The Hamas official said the agreement was signed to  resolve some of the differences on outstanding issues between  the military wings of the two movements and to lay the  foundations of dialogue to resolve possible future problems and  prevent a resort to arms and starting an internecine Palestinian  fighting.    Abu-Muhammad Mustafa pointed out that this is not the first  time that such an agreement has been signed between the Fatah  hawks and the al-Qassam battalions, adding that the political  stands and the basic differences on the Oslo-Cairo agreement and  the stands on the occupation and the Palestinian cause are still  the same between Hamas and Fatah.    As for the reported joint seminar between Hamas and Fatah,  which was held at the Islamic University in Gaza recently,  Mustafa said that the seminar was just an open debate among  students and that differences between the two debating sides  continued unabated. He added: This has nothing to do with  allegations that Hamas has begun to retreat from its principled  stands.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMWAY PRESIDENT, A SPURNED SUITOR, VOWS TO 'BEAT' AVON  </P> <P> Amway Corp. President Richard DeVos has turned to taunting Avon Products Inc.  for rejecting Amway's recent takeover bid, telling a company convention crowd  that if Amway can't join them, "We'll just beat 'em."  </P> <P> The thousands of Amway distributors roared in approval Saturday as DeVos joked  the company's new motto may be "Sponsor An Avon Lady Today."  </P> <P> About 7,500 of Amway's 1 million independent distributors worldwide attended  the two-day convention at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel.  </P> <P> The convention, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Ada, Mich.-based  company, comes about a month after Amway teamed up with corporate raider Irwin  Jacobs to buy a 10.3% stake in Avon. A week later, Amway offered to buy the New  York-based cosmetics company for $2.1 billion.  </P> <P> Avon rejected the offer, and in a series of stinging letters to Amway it  described the direct-sales company as "marked by zealotry" and said such a  merger "would destroy Avon's good name."  </P> <P> Amway withdrew its offer, calling Avon's rejection hysterical, irresponsible  and vicious.  </P> <P> "I don't think we'll have to buy Avon, we'll just beat 'em," DeVos said.  </P> <P> After a nearly evangelical speech describing Amway distributors as  "life-enrichers," DeVos said of the Avon bid: "We were only trying to enrich  their lives."  </P> <P> DeVos and Chairman Jay Van Andel founded the company in 1959 by mixing laundry  suds in their basement.  </P> <P> "Instead of seeing what kind of dirt they could dig up, we could have shown  them how to clean up," DeVos said of Avon.  </P> <P> The "dirt" refers to an investigation Avon launched into Amway operations to  fend off the bid. It turned up possible financial wrongdoings by the company's  chief executive, William W. Nicholson.  </P> <P> Amway also is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and  Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged illegal stock activity in the  Amway-Jacobs partnership.  </P></p>

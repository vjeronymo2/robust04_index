			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / US trials for French abortion pill The controversial French abortion pill RU 486 will be made available for US clinical trials in the autumn through an unusual arrangement donating all US patent rights to a non-profit population group, Reuter reports from Washington. Roussel-Uclaf of France, a subsidiary of Germany's Hoechst, has agreed to donate all US patent rights to the drug to the Population Council, a New York-based international non-profit group. The Population Council is seeking a manufacturer for the drug. Abortion rights activists hailed the agreement as a tremendous victory, but anti-abortion groups were angered. The American Life League called RU 486 a 'human pesticide'.</p>

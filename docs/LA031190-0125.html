			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST WHAT IS A DELICATESSEN SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE, ANYWAY?  </P> <P> Last Oct. 21, Marvin Saul called a meeting of his employees, all 189 of them,  in the parking lot of his Junior's restaurant. The agenda: the reopening of  Junior's, which at that moment was undergoing the final stages of a major  remodel job. But as the staff sat in their rented chairs, expecting a litany of  procedural information, Marvin Saul dropped a bombshell. After 30 years in the  business, he was handing the business over to his sons. "It's the beginning of  a new era," Saul told his employees.  </P> <P> Two days after Saul's announcement, Junior's reopened its doors to the public  as a completely new version of its old self. Not only was Junior's in the hands  of a younger generation, it had a younger, contemporary look. Junior's now  seemed almost trendy.  </P> <P> When Marvin Davis decided to open a Carnegie Deli in Beverly Hills, he hired a  big-name architect, Pat Kuleto, whose projects include Wolfgang Puck's Postrio  in San Francisco. Kuleto's design has been controversial -- some have  complained that the new Carnegie is too upscale.  </P> <P> The new Carnegie and the remodeled Junior's have left deli mavens in Los  Angeles struggling to adjust. Mostly, they worry, delis don't look like delis  anymore.  </P> <P> "Exactly," Marvin Saul says, not without pride. "The new look at Junior's is  the antithesis of a typical deli, really upscale. Some people ask, 'Why didn't  you leave it alone?' I say half of life is change. You have to give people what  they want for the '90s."  </P> <P> "People hate changes -- they're afraid," says Abe Lebewohl, owner of New York's  Second Avenue deli. "When I expanded in '73, oh my God! Over and over, I'd  hear, 'I liked the old place.' But believe me, the old place was a horror. And  of course people got used to the new place. It's still a deli."  </P> <P> When it comes to defining exactly what a deli is supposed to look like, even  the experts have trouble coming up with a simple answer.  </P> <P> "A deli," says Art Ginsburg, owner of Art's Deli in Studio City (slogan: Where  every sandwich is a work of art), "is what a coffee shop is: very plain, very  simple, well-lit, vinyl floor, no carpeting. The booths are not high-backed  booths; but lower, you know, open to the hubbub. "  </P> <P> "What's a deli supposed to look like?" says Al Mendelson, owner of Nate n' Al's  in Beverly Hills (a carpeted deli). "Well, in Jewish, they say it's haimisch.  You need old-timers like myself with know-how -- you know I'm 85 years young --  to make people feel comfortable. But everything's changing. I think delis are  getting to be a thing of the past."  </P> <P> "Go no further," says Fred Austin, co-owner (with his brother-in-law, Alan  Dell) of Katz Deli on New York's Houston St. "We're the archetypal deli. We're  the pattern and the criteria by which all others are judged. We've been here  103 years. Did you see 'When Harry Met Sally . . . '? Do you remember the  orgasm scene? That's the consummate deli experience. If you don't leave Katz's  breathing heavy, then we're not doing our job right."  </P> <P> "What you have to really realize," says Carnegie architect Pat Kuleto, "is that  until recently, there was no such thing as deli design. They were always  started on a budget, so you'd simply buy the cheapest restaurant equipment.  Then you'd put a few sandwich signs up on the wall, a few pictures of the  owner, a couple of notices from the government and a few posters supplied maybe  by the RC Cola Company or something. You'd turn the lights up real bright, hang  a bunch of sausages around and show the food, you know, cause that was kind of  the program -- to just show off the food. And that was it -- they called it a  deli."  </P> <P> Or as Second Avenue's Abe Lebewohl puts it: "Jewish-type delis started out as  what they used to call dry kishka stores -- nothing fancy -- I mean it's not Le  Cirque.  </P> <P> "Of course as people's tastes changed and so on, delis went into other things,"  Lebewohl continues. "Delis started taking over; they started becoming  restaurants. When I started in the business in 1950, prices were higher,  expenses were more, you needed to expand and hire good cooks."  </P> <P> For Pat Kuleto, the 1950s marked the end of the great deli era. His design of  the Carnegie in Beverly Hills snubs all post-1950 design elements. "The  fantasy, or trick," he says, "was to try and create a space that had enough of  the classic old feelings of the way delis should have been done -- prior to the  advent of the '50s when everything in remodeling was ruined by Formica and  plastic and all the crud of mechanization."  </P> <P> "Everybody decorates different," Art Ginsburg says. "It's like people's homes.  You know, some people decorate with an Oriental theme, some do Italian or  Spanish -- right now it's that Southwest look. Same with delis. See, times  change. In each decade, the remodeling's been different. In the '50s they used  certain color combinations: yellow and green. We started in '57 and have tried  to maintain the same look -- I still have my original neon sign with the  blinking arrow and I've never wanted to take it down. The last time we  remodeled was about four years ago -- we changed the fabric color of the booths  a little bit, but we still kept it in earth tones. I stopped by Junior's  recently and I think it came out very good. It's still got its counter -- and  after all, that's the difference between a restaurant and a deli. A deli is a  counter."  </P> <P> "A deli is the smell, it's the aroma, it's the noise," Katz's Fred Austin says.  "A deli is striped down to its bare essentials -- Formica tables, chairs, the  only concession we make is we pad our chairs. In 1948 the store was extended,  and that's the last time anything was touched. When bulbs burn out we change  them. And we change the calendars as need dictates . . . and obviously when  there's a movie, like 'When Harry Met Sally. . . ' filmed here -- did I tell  you it was filmed here? -- we put up some signs in the windows as display."  </P> <P> Marvin Saul used to think a lot like the people at Katz.  </P> <P> "I absolutely resisted change at first," Saul says. "You know the saying 'a  rose is a rose is a rose'? Well, I felt a deli is a deli is a deli. But my sons  taught me that to stay even you've got to make changes. Otherwise you fall  behind."  </P> <P> Still, this latest remodel wasn't as easy for Saul as he likes people to  believe.  </P> <P> "The first night," Jonathan Saul remembers, "when we went to destroy the place  and started breaking down tables I said, 'Dad, break something, I know you've  always wanted to.' So he took a sledgehammer and started to swing at a table,  but then he stopped, put the hammer down and said, 'I've got to go home.' He  left with a tear in his eye."  </P></p>

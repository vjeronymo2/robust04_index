The panel, which consists of health physicists, radiology  experts and medical ethics specialists, will review the data  turned up by inter-agency investigations to comb the hundreds of  thousands of documents about the tests and see whether ethical  standards were violated.    The efforts, initiated by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary,  also involve the Defense Department, the Department for Veteran  Affairs and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA).    The White House, which set up a "working group" a week ago  to  coordinate the activities, said the Central Intelligence Agency  (CIA), is also joining the probe. The CIA reportedly destroyed  many of the reports on the tests.    The Energy Department has so far interviewed some 4,000  callers on a telephone hotline, about 20 percent of them claimed  to be victims of some of the radiation experiments, a department  spokesman said.</p>

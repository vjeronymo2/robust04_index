			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hall shares jump 12p on news of restructuring deal SHARES in Hall Engineering (Holdings), hard hit by the depressed construction and engineering industries, jumped 12p to 131p on the announcement yesterday of a Pounds 1.5m restructuring programme designed to reduce overheads and improve profits. Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, revised its profit forecast from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 6.7m for the year to December 31, 1993. It added that the changes would reduce pre-tax profit to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 5.07m) in 1992, but that the group was likely to maintain its dividend at 1.75p. The restructuring involves depot closures at the Hall &amp; Pickles steel stockholding and BRC steel reinforcing products arms. BRC was also forming a division to include its masonry and cladding business. The company said the moves would improve profits by about Pounds 1.2m a year, but involved the loss of 90 jobs. Hall's workforce had fallen from 1,600 a year ago to about 1,400. The latest changes - Hall sold BRC's South African business in September and closed its Stafford factory in June 1991 - was brought on by the collapse in demand for steel reinforcing from the construction industry, and flat demand for its engineering products.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (4): A diversified trade pattern - Nafta membership remains a goal Mr Bill Clinton's US presidential election victory last November produced political tremors in Santiago. Chile had put a lot into its relationship with President George Bush, who promised in May 1992 to negotiate a free trade agreement with Santiago upon successful conclusion of the Nafta talks between the US, Mexico and Canada. There were widespread fears that an incoming Clinton administration, pledged to focus on domestic issues, would turn its back on Latin America or even pursue a more protectionist line with its neighbours. Gains for Chile from Mr Bush's 1990 Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, covering debt, trade and investment, could be at risk. In the event President Clinton reaffirmed his predecessor's stance on Chile, while Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said in April he hoped that the Nafta would be the 'first building block' of a hemisphere-wide free trade deal. However, amid the sighs of relief, the government has been at pains to cool hopes of rapid progress towards an FTA. 'Chile has a very diversified composition of trade, about one third to Europe, one third to the US and one third to Asia,' says Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister. 'So in the short and medium term, an FTA is not really essential to our trade strategy. We will pursue an FTA with the US without any sense of urgency, but with determination,' he adds. Even if a deal is reached, it is unlikely to lead to a dramatic increase in trade with the US, already the country's biggest trading partner. Chile has relatively low barriers to imports, with a uniform tariff rate of 11 per cent for most produce, and a welcoming attitude to foreign investment. However, an agreement would reassure investors and act as an insurance policy against a drift towards a more protectionist stance by Washington. The government likes to emphasise that the costs to the US of a deal with the small Chilean economy would be minimal. But it would not necessarily be painless for Chile. One of the biggest obstacles for Washington to a trade agreement is Chile's protected agriculture sector. Wheat, vegetable oils and sugar imports are levied with duties aimed at maintaining a minimum domestic price for local producers. 'Bread and sugar are twice the price they should be,' said a US diplomat in Santiago. 'This is a subsidy borne on the backs of the poor. The US could sell Dollars 100m of wheat to Chile if it liberalised in this area.' However, local producers are pressing to have the price banding extended to a larger number of staples. The system also reduces the force of Chile's complaints about European Community trade barriers - fruit growers face an average 18 per cent duty on exports to the EC and a bumper European apple crop has produced curbs on Chilean apple sales. Nonetheless, Chile's government has lambasted the EC, especially France and Germany, for foot-dragging on farm trade in the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade talks. The timetable for talks with the US is undefined, but agreement is unlikely this year, with the Nafta talks continuing. In the meantime, Chile has been vigorously pursuing bilateral agreements with its more like-minded neighbours. This April Chile signed a free trade pact with Venezuela aimed at eliminating import tariffs on 90 per cent of goods by January 1997. A similar deal signed with Mexico in September 1991 produced an 80 per cent increase in Chilean exports to Mexico last year, to about Dollars 80m. Negotiations with Colombia are 'well advanced,' says Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry. 'Most of Chile's export growth in the past two years has come from Latin America,' Mr Vial says. However, the government has fought shy of joining any of the region's emerging trade blocks, such as Mercosur, which groups Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. 'The experience with broader integration has not been so good,' says Mr Vial. 'There is still too much instability in the economies of the Mercosur countries, particularly Brazil.'</p>

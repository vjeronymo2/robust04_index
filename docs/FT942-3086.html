			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Reforming US welfare The most important aspect of the welfare reforms announced this week by President Bill Clinton is the proposed shift from a passive to an active stance. The laudable goal - likely to strike a chord with politicians in other countries - is to break the 'cycle of dependency' and provide recipients with the job training, counselling and childcare required if they are to become productive citizens. Although Republicans have reservations about many of the specific measures, there is strong bipartisan support for ending the present system, both on Capitol Hill and among state governors, many of whom are introducing their own welfare reforms. There is little prospect of legislative action this year, because the relevant congressional committees are grappling with the even bigger challenge of healthcare reform. But given the consensus on the need for change, reforms loosely based on Mr Clinton's ideas probably will be enacted in 1995. The most controversial change is the proposed two-year time limit on welfare payments. This is not quite as sweeping as it sounds. The new rules would apply only to the 'next generation' - people born after 1971, about a third of the present case load. And the measures would be phased in slowly: by the year 1999 it is estimated that only about 8 per cent of the welfare population would be working for their benefits. Nor is Mr Clinton proposing an end to public support after two years. If recipients could not find private sector jobs before the deadline, they would be offered publicly subsidised employment at the minimum wage. Provided people 'play by the rules' and continue searching in good faith for private sector jobs, the offer of public employment would be permanent. The relevance of these measures to Europe's problem of welfare dependency is limited. Mr Clinton is focusing on Aid for Families With Dependent Children, a joint federal-state programme which channels benefits almost exclusively to single-parent families. The most important differences between the US and Europe relate to treatment of adults and the unemployed. The US has never had a general welfare system: childless adults do not qualify for federal benefits and get very little assistance from states. Unemployment insurance has always been limited to six months, with temporary extensions during recessions. It is in these areas that reforms in Europe may produce the greatest benefits in terms of reduced dependency. The US insistence that young mothers with children 'earn' their benefits marks a hardening of moves toward 'workfare' which began with the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988. Yet it is questionable whether this is the most urgent priority when cash for job training is so limited. Instead of trying to get mothers out of the home, where they are gainfully employed in raising children, it would make more sense to focus on improving the job skills of unskilled young males, who have dropped out of the labour force in disturbingly large numbers. If such men were more employable, they would also make better marriage prospects. The number of out-of-wedlock births might then decline. And the US would have begun to address one of the root causes not just of welfare dependency, but of the poverty and violence that disfigure inner cities.</p>

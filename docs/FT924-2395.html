			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls as storms keep traders away Wall Street US SHARE prices remained weak across the board yesterday in a market that was unusually quiet in the wake of a heavy rainstorm that flooded parts of downtown Manhattan, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.11 at 3,304.08, having traded throughout the day only a few points below Thursday's close. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending down 0.92 at 433.72, while the Amex composite edged 0.99 higher to 393.38 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.15 to 655.78. Turnover on the New York SE was well down from recent levels at 165m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 903 to 839. Trading was greatly affected by the winter storms that hit the North East coast, with many market participants unable to make it into work. Due to flooding near Wall Street and the shutdown of much of New York's transit system, the government bond markets closed early at 1pm. The Labor department announced that consumer prices rose just 0.2 per cent in November, in line with market expectations. Following Thursday's news of a decline in producer prices last month, analysts are confident that inflationary pressures are not building up despite the gathering pace of the recovery. The other economic news came from the University of Michigan, which reported another big rise in its monthly index of consumer confidence, evidence that the surge in optimism recorded since the election carried through into early December. Although the two sets of data were positive, share prices eased because some investors continue to take profits earned during the recent rally and others remain wary of a market they believe looks over-bought. Among individual stocks, IBM staged a mini-recovery, rising Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 62 3/8 and reversing a week of declines prompted by renewed concern about further restructuring and talk of a possible threat to the company's dividend. Smith International climbed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 3/4 in busy trading after the company announced it was selling its Directional Systems &amp; Services business to Halliburton for about Dollars 240m in Halliburton stock. The news left Halliburton Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 28 3/4 . Santa Monica Bank dropped Dollars 1 5/8 or 16 per cent, to Dollars 8 7/8 after announcing it would post a loss in 1992 because of the real-estate recession in its local market. The bank will also be unable to pay a fourth-quarter dividend. On the Nasdaq market, Biogen jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 47 in turnover of 2m shares on forecasts from the company that 1992 earnings would come in above Dollars 1 a share, compared to the 15 cents a share the company earned in 1991. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed, leaving the market with a loss on the week. The TSE-300 fell 2.75 points to 3,267.49 on volume of 34.47m valued at CDollars 249.7m, according to preliminary figures. The index was down 22 points on the week. Declines led advances 282 to 275. Eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher.</p>

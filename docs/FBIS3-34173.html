			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Misratah on 3 </F> February -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Brothers, this is Misratah, the town whose  history is known to all Libyans and to all enemies, and whose  heroic battles during the war of Jihad and liberation are well  known to everyone. [passage omitted]    We say to the U.S., Britain, France, the hirelings, and  Zionists, that Misratah will reject treason and arrogance. The  enemy's calculations, which have led it to issue three unjust  resolutions -- concocted through the Security Council -- against  the Libyan people must be foiled here in Misratah. We should  announce from here, from this town in which we challenged the  fleets of Italy and its unjust aggression at a time when there  was no comparison between the defenses of the inhabitants of  Misratah and the Italian brute force. Today, however, there is  some comparison between our force and its readiness and of that  of the enemy's, who might like to repeat the aggression once  more.    Brothers, we would like to announce from Misratah that the  Libyan people has come to the conclusion that the battle is not  against the Jamahiriyah; it was not caused by the Pan Am  incident and it is not a battle between just two sides. The  Libyan people has come to the conclusion that a fresh  colonialist campaign and a new imperialist scheme is under way  against the Arab nation. However, it has been ordained that  Libya should raise aloft the banner of this battle. And it has  been ordained that the Libyan people should raise aloft the  banner of Saladin, Jamal-'Abd-al-Nasir, al-Suwahli, and Umar  al-Mukhtar, as well as other banners which symbolize our  glorious history; we should raise them all aloft.    The Libyan people is aware that Washington, Paris, Berlin,  Bonn, London, and Tel Aviv are all behind the battle which is  taking place now in the streets of Cairo. The battle which is  taking place in the streets of Cairo is a long and a serious  battle; it is a battle which has nothing to do with Islamic  extremism and has nothing to do whatsoever with Islam. It is a  scheme to divide Egypt into a mini-state for Copts and another  one for Muslims, and to Balkanize the Arab homeland.    The Egyptian people must therefore be aware that Tel Aviv,  Washington, Paris, and London -- and Bonn too -- are all behind  the battle which is taking place in the streets of Cairo at this  moment. It is the beginning of a serious battle, a very serious  battle indeed, which aims at fragmenting Egypt and dividing it  into mini-states, because Egypt is the mother of pan-Arabism.  Cairo is the capital of the Arab nation, and the Egyptian  people has made innumerable sacrifices against the Crusaders,  colonialists, and Zionists.    The Libyan people would like to warn its fraternal Egyptian  people against the seriousness of the plot which is being  hatched by Western power and Tel Aviv. The faked peace process,  which is being bragged about to us these days, is no more that a  smokescreen for the Zionist conspiracy against Cairo and the  U.S. conspiracy against Cairo. Hence, the Libyan people in  Misratah would like to warn its brothers, with whom it is linked  by same fate, its Egyptian brothers and Cairo, the capital of  the Arab nation, that a serious conspiracy is being hatched  against Cairo, first and foremost before Tripoli and Misratah.    The Egyptian people ought to vigilant. We would like to warn  our brothers in the fraternal Egyptian leadership, out of our  concern for them and for our common fate, to warn them from  Misratah, the town of Jihad and resistance and the town of  heroic sacrifices, that the peace process is a lie and a  smokescreen for the dangerous conspiracy against Cairo itself.    Therefore, those meetings, delegations, consultations, and  compromises are merely a dangerous conspiracy which hides the  serious, the secret, wanton, and dangerous work which is being  carried out day in, day out, against Egypt itself, against  Palestine, and against the Arab nation. We are going to take  Tel Aviv's wraps off here in Misratah: When it sends  delegations to Cairo, Taba, Oslo, Geneva, and to the United  Nations, it is in order to hide the serious conspiracy against  Egypt, a conspiracy which is being hatched in secret in order to  Balkanize Egypt and to divide Egypt in a bid to destroy the  biggest Arab country, and to undermine Arab stamina for a  confrontation.    They look at peace between Egypt and the Zionist enemy from  their viewpoint as being a temporary truce, and when  preparations are completed there will be a clash, because the  Jews will not be satisfied with a small state surrounded by  Arabs and confined between Arabs and the sea, and get a tiny  state. The Jews are planning to establish an empire, not  between the Euphrates and the Nile, but from the Atlantic to the  Gulf, which would replace the Arab nation.    At the same time, O brothers, I thank you for giving us  this opportunity to deliver this serious speech which concerns  the fate of the Arab nation. At the same time, O brothers,  while maneuvering and deceptive operations are openly taking  place, such as negotiations on Gaza and Jericho, these moves  hide the real criminal plan directed against Egypt. At the same  time, O brothers, they send delegations and talk with Algeria,  which is the second biggest Arab state and is the country with  1.5 million martyrs. They court Algeria with lies and talk about  economic aid -- the IMF, the World Bank -- and the possibility  of granting loans to Algeria. At the same time, O brothers, they  are igniting covert fires and working to cause an internal  explosion within Algeria. Paris is behind the battle which has  started in Algeria, and France fans it directly with the black  French hand. It is not an Islamic battle at all, it is a  battle, which according to their plans, will not end until  Algeria is fragmented piece by piece, and tiny states are set up  in Algeria once again. Then these states will be ethnic and  family states which are isolated from each other, and which ask  Europe for help and which are at Europe's mercy.    From Misratah, the city of historical resistance, the city  of  struggle, bravery, and sacrifices, we address the call to the  brave Algerian people and our friends in the new Algerian  leadership, to warn them against this conspiracy being hatched  by Paris, the Western states, and Zionism, in order to bring  about the fragmentation of and balkanization of Algeria, and to  realize that the battle is not with the Islamists or with Islam.  Algeria is an Islamic state, Egypt is also an Islamic Sunni  state. There is no defection from Islam or heresy in Egypt.  Egypt is a country of Islam and is a country of the Holy  al-Azhar, but the things which are taking place in the streets  of Egypt and Algeria are an U.S.-French-British-German-Jewish  conspiracy.    The Libyan people are those who can today raise their voice  high in order to warn the Arab nation against this sudden  danger, O brothers, against the Arab nation. The reason for  this is because the circumstances of the Arab peoples do not  allow them to express what is in their hearts with regard to  America, Britain, France, and Zionism. The Arab peoples are  prisoners, and the Arab petty states are tantamount to mass  prisons for the peoples of the Arab nation.    The Libyan people have broken the chains and have liberated  themselves with the revolution, the great al-Fatih revolution,  and their voice has become loud. The Libyan people are their  own masters and are the people of the People's Congresses and  People's Committees, the people of revolutionary committees and  free vocational trade unions, the people who possess authority,  wealth, and weapons.    O brothers, we have the right to warn our nation from  Misratah. We have chosen Misratah because Egypt knows Misratah,  Algeria knows Misratah, and the Arab nation and the enemy know  Misratah. The enemy knows the bitter lessons it tasted in  Misratah. The enemy recalls the distress it faced from  Misratah's resistance. [passage omitted]    The battle is one from the Ocean to the Gulf, regardless of  attempts to deceive us. We understand history. We make  history. We will not be deceived, O brothers. The battle is one  from the ocean to the Gulf and the enemy is one from Tel Aviv to  Washington. One enemy against one nation.    We should not be deceived, O brothers, that there is an  Algerian issue, a Palestinian issue, a Syrian issue, an Iraqi  issue, and a Libyan issue. This is a lie. This is deception.  This cannot fool us while we are talking from Misratah.  [passage omitted] However, the U.S. of yesterday is not the  U.S. of today. The U.S. today supports with all its might the  artificial Jewish state and arms it with the nuclear weapon and  with the bacteriological and chemical weapons, which are  targeted toward the oblivious Arabs. O simple-minded Arabs,  Israel's weapons are targeted on you alone.    Who has a quarell with the Jewish state? You Arabs and  Muslims. And who supplied this mini-state with the mass  destruction weapons? It is the West who is deceiving you at  present and who laugh and ridicule you, and tells you it is your  friend. What sort of friendship is it between the Arab nation  and its real traditional enemies? The animosity between Islam  and the Jews and the Christians will continue until the day of  judgment. This is the will of God and all other attempts are  naive and ignorant.    We are not seeking friendship with the imperialist states.  However, what we want is that they remain within their borders  and we remain within ours. That is all. We have no ambitions  with regard to their assistance. We are not in need of  assistance. We are not in need of assistance either from the  U.S., from Britain, from France, or from the European Economic  Community [EEC]. To hell with the EEC. We can do without the  EEC and without any relations with the EEC. Those who pin their  hopes on the EEC and on European assistance are plowing in the  sea. They are naive. They are ignorant. They are  insignificant, and history will cast them to its wastebin.    The Libyan people, O brothers, has the honor and the pride  and glory that it is paying the price for independence. We are  a free and independent people. We have glory and pride in that.  We challenge any of the peoples around us to be free. All the  peoples around us are shackled. If they were not shackled  internally they would be shackled by foreign aid and burdened by  foreign debts, and are under foreign control and under foreign  aid. What sort of independence is it that depends on foreign  aid? What independence is it that depends on foreign  assistance? What sort of independence is it for Kuwait if it is  unable to remain independent without the protection of foreign  forces? Joining Iraq would be a million times better for it  than to remain artificially independent and dependent on the  presence of foreign forces. What would happen if the foreign  forces withdrew? Kuwait's independence would disappear along  with the foreign forces.    If Saudi Arabia's independence is dependent on the U.S.  forces, what meaning does this independence have? For Saudi  Arabia to join Egypt or Iraq or Yemen would be better than to  have an independence that depends on the presence of foreign  forces.    The Libyan people, O brothers, is paying the price for  genuine independence. This the price of independence. It is to  give up the foreigner, be hostile to those hostile to you, and  to reject bargaining. Bargaining with dignity, bargaining with  your brother. We, O brothers, do not bargain on Iraq and on the  sufferings of the people of Iraq and the tragedies of the  children of Iraq. Those who do that are cowards. They are the  insignificant and the lowly who will be cursed by the nation and  cursed by the children of Iraq.    We, O brothers, do not sacrifice the fate of the nation or  the future of the nation, or the future of the Palestinian  people, or the Palestinian issue for the sake of our national  issue. We know that our national issue is part of the pan-Arab  issue, and that any loss in the Palestinian issue is a loss to  the Libyan national issue.    Therefore, we profoundly regret the sale of dear Palestine.  Palestine has been sold and holy Jerusalem has been abandoned.  The bargaining on the Palestinian people has been done. O  brothers, they are selling the Palestinians at auction. They  are trading Jerusalem; let the curse befall those rulers who are  trading holy Jerusalem. They are trading the al-Aqsa Mosque, O  brothers. They are trading Palestine. Selling the Palestinian  people, selling, O brothers, the future of the Arab nation,  selling the future of your children and grandchildren. This is  the price of independence, O brothers, which Libya is currently  paying.    Libya is not paying the Lockerbie price, because no verdict  has been passed regarding this issue to the effect that Libya  should pay this price. However, Libya, with resolutions 731,  748 and (?889), is paying the price of independence, the price  of liberation, the price of emancipation, the price of it being  a free and sovereign country which can say no when it wants and  yes when it wants, and according to what it thinks. Those who  do not pay this price are neither independent nor free. He who  wants to have freedom will have to pay the price.    Therefore, we declare that we have nothing to do with  Lockerbie, and that we have no interest in this issue. We do  not look at it and we are closing this file, because we know  that we are not going to pay the price of Lockerbie. But we are  paying the price for our irreversible independence. Liberation  and emancipation are irreversible, independence is irreversible.  We will not retreat from the fact that we are living free under  the sun and on the land of our forefathers. [cheers] [passage  omitted] We have to declare, O brothers, that Egypt is in  danger, Algeria is in danger, Yemen is in danger, and Sudan is  in danger. We have to declare, O brothers, that these peoples  are exposed to danger before the Libyan people, because the  Libyan people is capable of confrontation and fighting, but  these peoples have been deceived by peace, by the mirage of  peace. The Arab nation is being deceived right now and a  conspiracy is being fomented against it, the conspiracy of the  Balkanization of the Arab nation and the tearing off of its  limbs, O brothers.

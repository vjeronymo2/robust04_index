			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO TRIES TO PROVE POINT IN TOURNAMENT OF TRUTH  </P> <P> This week's four-nation Los Angeles Soccer Cup is being called El Torneo de la  Verdad -- The Tournament of Truth.  </P> <P> The reason is that it has Mexico, which has been barred from trying to qualify  for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, against Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala,  each of whom has a good chance of qualifying.  </P> <P> According to Mexican national sentiment, Mexico's team is better than any of  the other three, just as it is better than the other two countries left in the  regional qualifying chase: the United States and Trinidad and Tobago.  </P> <P> Tonight, Mexico has the opportunity of partially proving that contention. It  plays Guatemala at 9 p.m. at the Coliseum in the nightcap of an international  soccer doubleheader that also has Costa Rica and El Salvador meeting at 7:30  p.m.  </P> <P> Tonight's winners will meet at 9 p.m. Thursday in the championship match, with  the losers playing for third place at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Perhaps Mexico is correct. Perhaps it is the strongest soccer power in the  Central and North American and Caribbean (CONCACAF) region. But because it  chose to disregard the rules and fielded overage players during qualifying for  the World Youth Championship currently under way in Saudi Arabia, it is paying  the price.  </P> <P> Tossed out of the Seoul Olympics (and replaced, incidentally, by Guatemala,  which should provide an added edge to tonight's match), Mexico also has been  barred from any world championships for two years. It next will resurface  during qualifying for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona.  </P> <P> By then, a new regional power might have emerged, if the United States' recent  run of success means anything.  </P> <P> On Monday, the United States scored a surprising, 2-0 win over East Germany in  Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, during first-round play in the fifth World Youth  Championship. The victory, combined with a 1-1 tie against Mali last Friday,  vastly improves the Americans' chances of reaching the next round.  </P> <P> A stronger-than-expected showing in South Korea during the Olympics last  summer, an astonishing third-place finish in the first World Indoor  Championship in the Netherlands in January and a strong chance of qualifying  for next year's World Cup, jointly indicate that U.S. soccer fortunes are  definitely on the upswing.  </P> <P> Just how difficult the road to Italy will be might be shown in this week's  matches at the Coliseum. It was Costa Rica, for example, that ended U.S. hopes  of qualifying for the 1986 World Cup with a 1-0 victory in Los Angeles four  years ago. The United States, which elected not to take part in the Los Angeles  Cup, meets Costa Rica April 21 in San Jose, Costa Rica in its first match of  the final qualifying round.  </P> <P> Guatemala will not be a pushover, either, and already has eliminated 1986  finalist Canada. El Salvador reached the 1982 World Cup in Spain, and Trinidad  and Tobago is an unknown factor. Two of the five countries will advance to  Italy.  </P> <P> Soccer Notes  </P> <P> The United States' win over East Germany Monday came on the strength of goals  by Troy Dayak of Livermore, Calif., in the 47th minute and a penalty kick by  Steve Snow of Schaumburg, Ill., in the 89th minute. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller of  Lacey, Wash., was in excellent form in the nets. The victory gives the United  States. three points from two games, with a match against unbeaten Brazil on  Wednesday. Mali, in contention with the United States for second place in Group  C, plays East Germany the same day.  </P> <P> Arturo Angeles of Arcadia, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, is the  lone American among 24 referees officiating the tournament in Saudi Arabia.  Another local referee, Majid Jay of Los Alamitos, has been named by the United  States Soccer Federation as one of seven FIFA referees for 1989. All seven are  eligible to referee matches at the international level.  </P></p>

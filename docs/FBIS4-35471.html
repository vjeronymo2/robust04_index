			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the Russian Duma -- the  Russian parliament -- received at the parliament in Moscow  yesterday the Iraqi ambassador to the Russian Federation.    At the outset, the ambassador expressed Iraq's gratitude for  Russia's recent position at the Security Council and its demand  that the blockade be lifted, stressing the need to develop this  position to lift the unjust blockade on Iraq. He noted that  Iraq has implemented all Security Council resolutions.    The Iraqi ambassador briefed Rybkin on the situation in Iraq  and what Iraq has done to implement Security Council  resolutions, stressing the need for the Security Council to  fulfill its own obligations, lift the blockade, and end the  suffering of the Iraqi people.    The Iraqi ambassador also handed the chairman of the Russian  parliament a detailed memorandum on the social and economic  effects of the blockade on the life of the Iraqi citizens after  four years of its enforcement. He explained how this is  affecting their health situation, noting the large increase in  the mortality rate of children and the elderly. He also said  that the blockade has had adverse effects on many countries,  primarily Russia, and that these countries have incurred great  losses as a result of the blockade.    For his part, Ivan Rybkin stressed that the Russian  Federation and the parliament are ready to use all means to lift  the unjust blockade and take part in international and  parliamentary conferences to lift the blockade and end the  suffering of the Iraqi people.    He also expressed his happiness and desire to host a  delegation from the Iraqi National Assembly, led by Sa'di Mahdi  Salih, the assembly speaker, to discuss relations and ways of  enhancing them between the two friendly countries and peoples.</p>

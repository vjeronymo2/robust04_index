			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- North Korea told a  delegation from Japan's Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ] that the country is not trying to develop nuclear  weapons, SDPJ officials said Tuesday.    Hwang Chang-yop, the Korean Worker's Party's secretary in  charge of international affairs, told the visiting delegation of  SDPJ legislators in Pyongyang that "North Korea will not have  nuclear bombs" and has neither the technology nor funds for such  a purpose.    SDPJ officials in Tokyo said the legislators headed by House  of Representatives member Kazo Watanabe held talks with North  Korean officials in Pyongyang on Monday.    Watanabe reportedly conveyed a message from Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata to the effect that resolution of the nuclear row  through dialogue will help improve relations between Japan and  North Korea. The two countries have no diplomatic relations.    Hwang's remarks echo comments by North Korean President Kim  Il-song in the fall of 1990 to a joint delegation of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) and SDPJ members.    The SDPJ delegation entered the North Korean capital via  Beijing on Saturday and held talks with ruling party officials,  including Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the reunification policy  committee, over the nuclear problems and bilateral issues.    The delegation is returning home Tuesday by way of Beijing.    The SDPJ, Japan's second largest opposition party, has  traditionally maintained close relations with North Korea, which  is suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons development program.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] There have been no new developments in the  government crisis. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is spending  his fourth day at home in Quraytim today. His visitors report  that he is persisting with his positions, which call for  broadening the basis of government representation of Christian  leaders. The visitors appealed to him to start exercising his  powers again and to maintain his authority.    Within the framework of the efforts to solve this crisis,  former Prime Minister 'Umar Karami is now meeting with Chamber  of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri.    Delegations continued to arrive at Prime Minister  al-Hariri's  house in Quraytim, where he received Labor Minister 'Abdallah  al-Amin, Minister of State Shahe Barsoumian, and Deputy Khatchig  Babikian. Earlier, al-Hariri received al-Mina' Mayor  'Abd-al-Qadir 'Alam-al-Din, who expressed his support for him in  continuing to shoulder responsibility. He also received a  delegation from the al-Fulayti clan in 'Irsal, which called on  al-Hariri to continue shouldering his responsibility. He then  met a delegation led by Shaykh Khalil al-Mays, the mufti of  Zahlah and al-Biqa. [passage omitted]</p>

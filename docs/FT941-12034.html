			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Simsmetal sharply ahead at halfway Simsmetal, the Australian scrap metal and recycling group which was relisted in 1991 and has been actively expanding into North America, yesterday reported first-half profits of ADollars 23.5m (USDollars 16.6m) after tax, up sharply from the ADollars 7.33m seen in the same period of 1992-1993, writes Nikki Tait. Revenues for the six months to end-December rose to ADollars 363.2m from ADollars 275.1m a year ago. Simsmetal said that strong ferrous scrap prices, higher volumes and the weakness of the Australian dollar against the US currency helped produce the improved figures. It added that it is still negotiating to acquire interests in related businesses in both the US and the UK.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christian Chartier: "Fokker Axes 1,900 Jobs, </F> Cuts Production 20 Percent"]    [Text] Amsterdam--Citing "market decline" and "price  erosion," Dutch airplane builder Fokker announced on Monday 14  February a new reorganization plan--the third in 2 years, and  the most "dramatic."    The plan, which was expected as a follow-up to the  resignation of the company president 2 weeks ago (see LE MONDE  of 1 February), calls for a 20 percent drop in production, which  is slated to fall from 50 to about 40 aircraft per year, and an  almost proportionate cut in the number of employees.    Some 1,900 positions of the company's 10,500 positions will  be eliminated (it had employed 12,800 as of December 1991), thus  doubling the scope of initial personnel retrenchment plans for  1994. Assembly lines will suffer the largest number of cuts  (1,400), but management is also taking hits. Some property  disinvestments will follow, further reducing Fokker's overhead.  Finally, the company is going to take a close, hard look at its  contracts with suppliers. The big question is whether the  Amsterdam builder will succeed in reducing its costs for the  airframes provided by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), currently at a  price well above the world average: 37 percent higher in the  case of the F-70, and 57 percent in the case of the F-100. The  contract antedates DASA's takeover of Fokker but has never been  amended, a fact that leads some Dutch journalists to speculate  the company is being set up for "strangulation" by its  "predator-savior." The airframe surcharge is responsible for all  but a few million florins of the 450-million loss Fokker is  expected to post for 1993.    But Fokker, like every other aviation builder, is buffeted  by  turbulent winds: The airlines, overequipped and locked in a  price war, are not modernizing their fleets, and builders are  intensifying the competition to hang onto market shares. Fokker  does not expect real recovery before 1996, but says it is  convinced it will weather the storm and keep its reputation for  building innovative models.</p>

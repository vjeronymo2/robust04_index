			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today sent best wishes to the new Japanese prime minister,  describing Tsutomu Hata as "a well-known friend of the United  States."    Hata "shared his predecessor's desire to implement reforms  in  Japan. We look forward to working with him on a wide range of  issues," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said.    "He was just elected this morning, so we'll have to wait to  see how that situation shapes up domestically," she told a White  House press briefing.    "We will work with Prime Minister Hata's new government,"  Myers said.    Hata, 58, was former foreign minister of Japan. He replaced  Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned amid allegations of financial  wrongdoing.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Asian assets ahead 28% SCOTTISH Asian Investment, managed by Murray Johnstone, reported net asset value per share increased by 28 per cent, from 687p to 882p, in the six months to January 31, helped by sterling's devaluation. This, together with a continued narrowing of the discount to net asset value since the move onshore from Jersey early last year, resulted in the share price jumping by 41 per cent over the period, from 547p to 773p. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 895p. Commenting upon the results directors said the period was notable 'for the wide divergence of performance in Far East stock markets, most notably those of Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand.' After changing its domicile the trust is now planning a 4-for-1 scrip issue to improve liquidity. The proposal will be discussed at an extraordinary meeting on May 4.</p>

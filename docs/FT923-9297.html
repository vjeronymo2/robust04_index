			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: WPP restructure proposal gets overwhelming support SHAREHOLDERS in WPP, the marketing services group, voted almost unanimously yesterday in favour of a financial restructuring plan. Of the preference shareholders, some of which had earlier threatened to vote against, 99.7 per cent voted in favour. The vote opens the way for Mr Gordon Stevens, an ex-Unilever man, to become non-executive chairman today. WPP will now be working to improve operating margins, with the main thrust being an attack on the staff costs to revenue ratio. It is aiming for a further refinancing on more normal terms by 1997. WPP is negotiating the sale of Scali, McCabe, Sloves, an advertising business, which could raise Dollars 65m-Dollars 70m (Pounds 37m) and might be completed in the next few months. The sale or flotation of the market research business, which might be worth Dollars 150m to Dollars 200m, will take longer, while a plan to float the South East Asian activites appears to have been postponed. Under the restructuring plan the group's convertible preference shares are turned into 160.3m new ordinary shares which will start trading today. The ordinary shares closed yesterday at 41p, down 4p and the convertibles at 31 1/2 p down 2p. The group's banks are also subscribing to an issue of 239.5m new shares at 60p each, raising Pounds 143m, which will be used to repay some of the company's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) debt. Shareholders can buy back these shares from the banks. The banks have also provided the group with a Dollars 150m bridge facility. The group has its bank's permission to launch a rights issue, so long as it is priced at 45p a share or more.</p>

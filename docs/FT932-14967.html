			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Major and Owen reject Bosnia arms call MR John Major, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen, one of the international mediators for a peace agreement in Bosnia, yesterday rejected suggestions that supplying arms to the Moslems would help resolve the year-old conflict there. Mr Major, answering a parliamentary question, said the weapons flow to all sides should be cut off rather than increased. The US has said that a partial lifting of the United Nations arms ban to help the Moslems defend themselves against Serb attacks was under consideration to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. The public endorsement of such a step earlier this week by the former British prime minister, Lady Thatcher, has provoked a political debate in Britain about the need for the international community to take more decisive action to stop Serb aggression. Escalation of the debate came as Serbs last night launched a heavy assault on the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in east Bosnia, according to Bosnian radio. The defenders were said to have been pushed to within 2km of the town. Lord Owen said in a BBC radio interview: 'The whole European Community takes the view that lifting the arms embargo is not the right priority at this stage and that the fundamental thing is tightening sanctions' against the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, Speaking after talks in London with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the peace talks, Lord Owen said the danger of arming the Moslems was that it would unleash an armaments race. At a meeting later yesterday with Mr Douglas Hogg, a British Foreign Office Minister, Mr Bartholomew was understood to have accepted that a decision to lift sanctions would inevitably increase the fighting. Mr Bartholomew, who later had talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, and Mr Hogg agreed that everything possible should be done to ensure that a resolution to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia should be pushed through the Security Council later this month, if the Bosnian Serbs had still not signed the Vance-Owen plan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sefi Hendler; italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] The Labor faction is now holding an emergency  session in view of the recent events. Despite the urgency of  the meeting, the prime minister and defense minister did not  come here today. The most senior government representative here  is Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who first addressed himself  to Yasir 'Arafat's thundering silence after the wave of attacks  in Israel:    [Peres] I hold a grave view of it and regret it. I  believe he should have reacted. Furthermore, some of the PLO  leaders have reacted. At the same time it must be absolutely  clear: Just as we will not hesitate taking every step against  terrorism, we will not stop, not even for a minute, the  negotiations for an arrangement in Gaza and Jericho.    Regarding the defense aspect, Peres said that a closure will  be imposed on the territories. He explained that the government  will take every step necessary to restore security, though he  believes the attack in 'Afula could not have been prevented. He  describes here a chronicle of an incident that everyone could  foresee:    [Peres] The truth is that the incident in the Cave of  the Patriarchs caused a deterioration. We knew that 40 days  would go by and the retaliation would not be late in coming.  Every thinking Israeli knew this would happen. We did  everything we could to face the hardships, but we know that we  cannot anticipate everything.    Peres also referred to voices of the right-wing opposition,  which in fact could be heard just outside the hall where a  demonstration is calling for the establishment of a state  commission of inquiry to investigate the deterioration of the  security situation. Mr. Peres said:    [Peres] Yes. This is an outstanding idea. If it is  correct, then a commission of inquiry should investigate every  day of the war of Lebanon. Not a day went by in Lebanon in  which we did not have a fatality.    The Labor faction session is still in progress at the Labor  headquarters in Tel Aviv, and we will return if more significant  remarks are made here.</p>

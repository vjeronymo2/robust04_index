Vladimir Nikolic has the  details:    [Begin Nikolic recording] Apart from the official proposal  of the agenda, members of the DS Main Committee were also  presented with a proposal by Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the  Executive Committee. For the time being, it is certain that  the items on the agenda that are undisputable and up for  discussion are reports on past elections and the election of DS  deputies to the Republican Assembly. One has the impression  that no one has anything against holding an extraordinary  convention, so one may expect that its date will also be  established.    What has attracted the public's attention is certainly the  proposal by Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Committee,  to hold a vote of confidence in Party Chairman Dragoljub  Micunovic, which has confirmed the stories about disagreements  and rifts in the DS' top leadership.    We have just learned at the DS Information Service that the  proposal to hold a vote of confidence in Chairman Micunovic has  received the necessary majority of votes from the present  members of the Main Committee -- that is, that the  somewhat-amended agenda proposed by Djindjic was adopted.    We would also like to add that when it was decided to hold  the session behind closed doors, correspondents were told that  they will be informed of the session's outcome by an  announcement or possibly at a news conference.

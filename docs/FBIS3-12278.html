			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has issued a  statement in which it said: Our kinsfolk's blood will not go in  vain. The blood of the faithful will not sink in the sands of  oblivion. The bullets of our strugglers are the imminent  response to the Zionists. Violent confrontations with the  occupiers are the road that our people have willingly pursued.  Our people will not abandon their sincere option until the  entire sacred Palestinian homeland is liberated and until we  avenge every Palestinian soul killed by the filthy Zionist hands.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges on economic growth data Wall Street After a session's pause, US stocks surged again yesterday as favourable economic news propelled bonds and the dollar sharply higher, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 51.16 ahead at 3,881.05, led by cyclical stocks emerging from their long summer slumber. It was the index's best closing level since March 18. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 kept pace, ending 6.08 better at 473.80. Advancing issues outnumbered declines on the Big Board by a seven-to-three margin. Trading was brisk, with 305m shares exchanged by the final bell. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.44 higher at 449.56, while the Nasdaq composite was up 8.18 at 764.03. Stocks opened solidly higher thanks to a welcome piece of news from the Commerce Department, which revised its estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.8 per cent, from a preliminary reading of 3.7 per cent. With analysts expecting a much stronger figure, Treasury prices jumped ahead and the dollar vaulted well over the Y100 mark. Amid all the excitement, a big rise in the University of Michigan's August index of consumer confidence was virtually ignored by the inflation-sensitive bond market, though profit-taking took its toll in the afternoon. By late morning, the bellwether blue-chip index had extended its gain to more than 50 points, triggering the NYSE's restrictions on computer-guided trading. Still, the 'collar' failed to force share prices into retreat. The same stocks which led Wednesday's 70-point surge were at the forefront yesterday. Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, gained Dollars 3 to Dollars 73, while Caterpillar was Dollars 3 3/4 higher at Dollars 115 5/8 . Alcoa climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 and General Electric Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 . But consumer non-durable issues were not to be excluded from the rally. Procter &amp; Gamble forged Dollars 1 7/8 ahead to Dollars 59 3/4 while Philip Morris added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/2 . In retailing, Sears chipped in with a Dollars 1 1/4 gain to Dollars 47 7/8 . JC Penney powered Dollars 2 ahead to Dollars 51 3/4 on comments by money managers that the stock was unvalued. The improved outlook for semiconductor stocks benefited the entire technology sector. Motorola gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 55 3/8 and Texas Instruments put on Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 82 3/4 . On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems advanced Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 and Wellfleet added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 . Chiron, the biotechnology concern, jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 after adopting a shareholder rights plan designed to deter an unfriendly suitor. Canada Toronto followed other major world stock markets higher with share prices rising sharply in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index jumped 47.43 points, or 1.11 per cent, to 4,304.43, with advances leading declines by 461 to 284. Over the week, the index gained about 107 points. Volume stood at 59.38m shares, down from 61.53m on Thursday. Trading value slipped to CDollars 794.8m from CDollars 884.5m. Brazil Sao Paulo dropped 2.6 per cent in heavy trade as investors staged a profit-taking bout after prices rose by 24 per cent this month. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended down 1,403 at 52,143 points. On the Rio de Janeiro bourse, the ISENN fell 2.1 per cent to 20,419 points. Volume was high at 573.3m reais (Dollars 641.2m).</p>

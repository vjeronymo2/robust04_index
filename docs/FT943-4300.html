			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Big C&amp;G rise fuels doubts of bid critics Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, yesterday reported a 44.5 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds 75.3m to Pounds 108.8m. The percentage increase is among the higher rises reported by UK mortgage lenders, and has underlined concerns expressed by some C&amp;G members that Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash takeover bid for the society may not be a full price. The profit rise came despite a decline in operating margins over the past year. C&amp;G warned that pressure on margins could be expected to continue through the rest of the year. The increase reflected both a drop in provisions for bad and doubtful debts and an aggressive approach to the mortgage market which saw lending rise by almost 30 per cent to Pounds 1.48bn. Loss provisions fell by 63 per cent from Pounds 63.6m to Pounds 23.5m, while net interest receivable rose by less than 1.5 per cent to Pounds 169.3m, even though business volume was markedly higher. The proportion of C&amp;G's funding which is drawn from the wholesale money markets rather than retail deposits was somewhat higher at the half-year than the 22.8 per cent it represented at the 1993 year-end. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said C&amp;G had concentrated on trying to win a larger share of mortgage business. But the impact of competition, which had led it to stop charging valuation or application fees, had translated into a drop in other income and charges from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 25.2m and contributed to a rise in management expenses from Pounds 49.1m to Pounds 58.0m. The increase in administrative costs - which took costs as a percentage of income to 29.8 from 26.4 per cent at the end of 1994 - also reflected the cost of running the extra 20 branches and Pounds 1bn mortgage book acquired in the takeover of Heart of England Building Society. C&amp;G also paid Pounds 4.2m expenses - a combination of fees to advisers and costs of mailing information to its 1.4m members - relating to its proposed acquisition by Lloyds. Further costs will come through in the second half of the year, reflecting work on computer systems for the voting procedures by which the members must approve the deal. Mr Paul Rivlin, one of the organisers of the C&amp;G Alternatives Group, said the results reinforced the view that the society's business was very robust. 'If anything, these results strengthen the concern that Pounds 1.8bn is not a very good deal,' Mr Rivlin said. His group wants C&amp;G's board to explain more fully the rationale for accepting the Lloyds bid rather than adopting any other course.</p>

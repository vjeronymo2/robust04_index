			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT)  [Democratic Labor Party] is looking to the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] as the only party with which he might  break the isolation of his candidacy for the presidency of the  Republic. He is acting on two fronts, seeking to convince at  least some PMDB members. He is openly courting the PMDB's Rio  Grande do Sul State wing, while quietly and favorably responding  to former [Sao Paulo] Governor Orestes Quercia's overtures for  agreement.    Brizola's isolation stems from the unfeasibility of an  alliance with the PT [Workers Party] -- owing to the absolute  leadership of Lula [PT leader Luis Inacio Da Silva] in the polls  and the consequent reluctance of the latter -- and with the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], mainly because of his  aversion to the party's Ceara State wing.    In light of the affinity expressed by PPR [Progressive  Renewal Party] leader Paulo Maluf, who is sympathetic toward  Brizola, with [Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' PFL  [Liberal Front Party] -- which is the PDT's worst enemy after  entrepreneur Roberto Marinho -- it has been said that the  possibility of an alliance has definitely been buried, leaving  the PMDB as the only alternative.    Brizola has already met with PMDB President Luiz Henrique da  Silveira once and will meet him again this week. Brizola  proposes using his political clout in Rio Grande do Sul State to  help former [Social Security] Minister Antonio Britto become the  Rio Grande do Sul governor in exchange for support for his  presidential candidacy.    Brizola even pledged to overcome old disagreements with  Senator Pedro Simon in order to reach an understanding.</p>

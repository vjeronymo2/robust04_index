			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA BAND HELPS HAIL THE FORMER CHIEF  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan probably wasn't humming "California Here I Come"  when the last strains of "Hail to the Chief" faded Friday and he departed  Washington with a round of emotional goodbys.  </P> <P> But a group of Agoura teen-agers helped make certain Reagan heard the  California tune after he arrived in Los Angeles to start his retirement.  </P> <P> The Agoura High School band got last-minute marching orders to help welcome  Reagan back to California by serenading him with the tune and several other  songs in welcoming ceremonies as he and his wife, Nancy, arrived at Los Angeles  International Airport. Also on hand were the USC Marching Band, a Salvation  Army band and a Mexican-style mariachi band.  </P> <P> The 100 excited musicians, flag twirlers and pompon girls hastily learned on  Thursday afternoon and Friday morning how to perform the Marine and Navy hymns  and the "Eagle Squadron Parade March."  </P> <P> They said the fact that Reagan once owned a ranch a few miles from their school  had nothing to do with their invitation; neither was the fact that Reagan  started his political career by winning a post on the soil conservation  district that serves the Agoura area.  </P> <P> It turned out that a coordinator of the welcoming ceremonies, producer Jerry  Naylor, lives in Agoura and has heard the band play, said Agoura High  bandmaster John Mosley.  </P> <P> "It was a unique situation," Mosley said. "They were going to just have college  bands, but somebody said, 'Why not have a high school band?' " The invitation  was extended Sunday, he said, but the band did not receive a music list until  Thursday.  </P> <P> Naylor, a former rock 'n' roller who became the lead singer of The Crickets  after Buddy Holly died in a 1959 plane crash, is a veteran Republican Party  campaign worker.  </P> <P> About 700 invited guests attended the airport reception. After meeting with  Mayor Tom Bradley, actor Robert Stack and others, the Reagans where whisked by  motorcade to their new home in exclusive Bel-Air.  </P> <P> "It has been a bittersweet several hours this day," Reagan told the crowd.  </P> <P> Before landing, Reagan told reporters aboard an Air Force plane that "it was  hard to say goodby" after eight years as president.  </P> <P> It wasn't hard for the USC band to say goodby to the Agoura High Band after the  ceremonies, however. USC musicians were jolted when the Agoura band played its  fight song -- which also happens to be the UCLA fight song.  </P></p>

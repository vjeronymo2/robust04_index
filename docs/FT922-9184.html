			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: Joan of Arc at the Stake - Brighton Festival Honegger's dramatic oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake was the idea of Ida Rubinstein, the mime, dancer and actress. She wanted Claudel to write the poem. His reaction was 'Another Joan of Arc? No, I won't'. But she received the text shortly afterwards. Honegger set to work, apparently greatly stimulated. Rubinstein intended Joan as part of a double bill with the scenic cantata La Sagesse, commissioned by her from Milhaud, and to perform them at the Paris Opera. That institution, as so often, had cold feet. So Joan was first done in concert form, with Rubinstein, in German, at Basle in 1938. La Sagesse was not given until after the war. Since the centenaries of both Honegger and Milhaud fall this year a performance, at last, of the double bill would have been a bright feather in Brighton's cap. Or perhaps not. Generous rehearsal time would be needed and there did not appear to have been enough of that for Sunday's concert performance of Joan in the Dome. The BBC Symphony Orchestra came to join the Festival Chorus. Since large forces are needed and the Dome platform is circumscribed, the chorus was split in two and placed at the opposite ends of the balcony. I was near the half with the men and the Christ's Hospital Junior Girls' Choir (very good). It cannot have been easy for the conductor David Robertson to keep the two halves together. Maybe for those sitting dead centre (and for listeners to Radio 3) things may have sounded better. It was not only the choral ensemble that was rough. The picturesque touches with which Claudel larded his text made slight impact. For much of the time the orchestra leathered away between mezzoforte and fortissimo without light or shade. There was a half-hearted attempt at semi-staging. A Cross was placed behind the trombones and fitfully illuminated. The women soloists were dressed in bright colours. Joan, barefoot, wore a simple dark dress. Fiona Shaw, Brighton's successor to Ida Rubinstein, Vera Zorina, Ingrid Bergman and other stars, has striking features almost as Gothic as Edith Sitwell and a voice admirable for conveying suffering and hope, capable of holding its own with the BBC SO. Miss Shaw remained obediently at the conductor's side but looked as if she wanted to roam. Hence perhaps signs of physical tension. Among the small parts tenor Neil Jenkins as Porcus and actor John Woodvine as Brother Dominic stood out. In general Mr Robertson showed too little regard for his soloists. Joan of Arc at the Stake continues to win a popular success only rivalled among works of this hybrid form by Orff's Carmina burana. It was given in Dennis Arundell's English translation in which one is not too conscious of that kind of French rhetoric which implies that if you intone names like France, Burgundy, Rheims or Domremy often enough you have made a statement. Many find the emotional impact strong: for others what remains is little more than hot air and stale incense. Honegger was an able, attractive composer. The tapestry is skilfully woven: the build-up of the last scene and ending is impressive. Yet the final impression is of musical footnotes. Sponsored by British Gas</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> President Bush signed into law a $49.8-million package of non-military aid to  sustain the Contras until Nicaragua holds elections next February. Bush  reiterated his pledge to support a diplomatic solution in Nicaragua and  repeated his call for the Soviet Union to advance the peace process by ending  its military aid to the Sandinistas. At a Rose Garden ceremony before he signed  the compromise legislation his Administration worked out with Congress, Bush  said: "The success of the Central American peace process and the prospects of  national reconciliation in Nicaragua depend on full and honest Sandinista  compliance with their repeated pledges of democracy and freedom."  </P></p>

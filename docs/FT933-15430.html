			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Yeltsin to get power to agree credit terms THE Russian parliament yesterday sent Mr Boris Yeltsin on his way to the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo by proposing a decree giving the president power to agree on the terms of foreign credit. The resolution, proposed by Mr Sergei Mikhailov, deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee, and a hardliner, also set out that any new obligations had to be agreed in advance with the parliament. Despite parliament's unremitting hostility to the government's programmes and actions, the government has continued with its efforts to press towards further liberalisation. Yesterday, it announced that punitive taxes on sales of oil over the official ceiling of Rbs4,000 a tonne would be lifted, theoretically allowing any price to be set. However, domestic industry will exert pressure which is likely to ensure that the price is still kept lower than world levels. To further cloud the price lifting, there was doubt whether the decree abolishing taxes had received final approval. The government yesterday also stressed the success of its anti-inflationary policy. Inflation has fallen to around 15 per cent a month from around 30 per cent earlier this year. Separately, the rouble appears to have stabilised at around 1,100 to the dollar. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance, optimistically predicts that inflation will continue to decline and that the rouble rate will be held for some time. In an interview in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta yesterday, Mr Fyodorov pressed the case for Russia to join the G7 and said that the responsibilities of reform rested with Russia. 'We maintain the firm position that we do not ask for any help. We do not need anything free of charge. Credit, yes, we will take what we need and we will not take what we do not need,' he said.</p>

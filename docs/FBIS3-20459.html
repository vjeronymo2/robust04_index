			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dai Jingming (2071 2417 2494): "General Trend of </F> the Chinese Stock Market and Its Crucial Problems"]    [Text] When bringing up the subject of the general trend,  insiders at the stock market are bound to regretfully state: The  general trend is grim and the outlook unpredictable. In summary,  the situation manifests itself in the following three ways:    1. Although the market has rapidly expanded, trading has,  conversely, declined. From 1992 to 1993, the number of new  companies and the aggregate market value of the Shenzhen and  Shanghai markets have steeply increased from 71 companies and  somewhat over 20 billion yuan to 182 companies and 352.1 billion  yuan. The general rule is that an expanding market will of  course result in an expanding trade volume, but here in this  case the facts run counter to what one would have wished for.  Since the Chinese stock market turned bearish in July of last  year, trade volume and trade value have declined day after day.  There had indeed been times when the daily trading volume was  around 1 billion, but trading volume at the current stock market  is now completely different.    2. People show are low-spirited, and speculative activities  overshadow investments. For quite a while now, the stock market  has been in a turbulent, restless state, with many shareholders  having "thrown good money after bad," a fact which has had a  strong dampening influence on investment enthusiasm. It rather  increased speculative inclinations, so that purely speculative  trading, eagerly getting in on upward moves and abandoning items  with declining tendencies, artificially creating sudden spurts  in the market, giving forth fictitious notions, all such  activities have become common occurrences.    3. It will still take quite some time to bring order into  the  disorderly state of share prices. Looking at the actual  conditions in the stock market we see that there is no orderly  way in which the first-, second-, and third-line share prices  change, quite a few third-line share prices are higher than the  second-line share prices, or even higher than the first-line  share prices. A major reason for this is that the entire process  of adjusting price positions is beset with much that is  unrelated to the law of value, such as the procurement  mentality, and regionalism, with the result that prices for some  mediocre shares are high above those of quality shares. Faced  with so grim an general trend, anyone in the role of an investor  will of course be concerned and entertain fears, and it also  stands to reason that agencies charged with the supervision and  administration of securities trading, no matter at what level,  should be extremely vigilant. Society generally believes that  China, being a socialist country, where there is government  support, and regulation and control by the state, cannot  possibly meet with a calamity on the stock exchange. Anyone who  will still stubbornly cling to this outdated idea, disregarding  the many concealed danger spots that do exist in the operational  processes of the stock market, is certainly very much wrong.    Where, then, are the problems in this grim overall state of  affairs? In my opinion, the fundamental problem that presently  impedes the steady development of the stock market is the  incongruous state of the supply-demand relation and the  imbalance between supply and demand. This contradiction will  still be the major factor that will impede stock market  development in China, also throughout 1994.    At present, the supply-demand contradiction manifests itself  mainly as an excess of supply over demand. Let us first look at  the supply side: The aggregate market value of the two markets  of Shanghai and Shenzhen is now 352.1 billion yuan. Let us,  furthermore, make an initial calculation: In 1994, it is planned  to introduce to the market 5.5 billion yuan of new share  offerings. Add to this the bonus shares [song pei gu 6623 6792  5140], state-owned shares, and shares owned by judicial persons,  that will come on the market and be transferred, and also some  shares for which transfer had not been completed in 1993; thus,  the total amount will not be less than 10 billion yuan of  shares. Converting at the rate of 10 yuan market value per  share, we can then estimate that the total capital brought into  the market will be over 100 billion yuan. These figures clearly  demonstrate how large the supply will be, and how rapid a growth  will occur. However, quite a number of specialists and scholars,  who are engaged in studies of the stock market, make light of  the increase in supplies and the subsequent pressure on the  market. Commonly, the following three different theses are  expressed in this connection: According to the first thesis, the  absolute volume increase, as between 1993 and 1994, a mere 500  million, did not at all amount to very much, and besides, the  infusion into the market has occurred evenly and in a  well-distributed way. Market operations could easily foresee  developments, so that this could not possibly have generated a  shock of any severity. If analyzed from the angle of the total  volume, of deposit volume, and of increase volume, this point  can be further explained. As far as the single share offerings  introduced into the market and the total market value are  concerned, net increases in 1993, as compared with 1992, had  been 1.5-times and 16.5-times, respectively, and in 1994, as  compared with 1993, again 1-time and 0.3-times. It shows that  the impact on the market in 1994 was much weaker than in 1992.  The second thesis argues that the expansion has not only had a  one-way, but rather a two-way effect. With the issue of new  shares in the market, it was not only the supplies that  increased, but they also brought along capital, which in turn  initiated demand. The third thesis argues that there exists a  huge demand potential which can easily cope with the pressure  generated by the expansion. According to statistics, total  savings deposits by the entire population amount to 1.5 trillion  yuan, while the total amount brought into the stock market was  only 100 million yuan, which accounts for not even 6.7 percent.  This thesis argues that capital follows market conditions. Once  the market situation is favorable, capital sources will open up  widely.    Let us now examine the situation from the demand angle.  Without too many qualitative analyses, here only three  calculations: First, if we distribute the total 100 billion  accretion of new shares among 16 million shareholding citizens  (China now has 8 million shareholding citizens), each of them  would have to invest another 6,250 yuan, while not withdrawing  original investments, which would amount to having to buy 300  "development shares" [4099 1455 5140 4384] (computed at 21 yuan  per share). Second, what portion of the 1.5 trillion aggregate  deposits represents peasant deposits and what portion represents  deposits by urban resident? According to investigation and  analysis, not quite 0.5 percent of the urban residents' deposits  could be truly available for investment in the stock market.  That means at most 7.5 billion yuan could be made available from  the said capital fund, which would make up only 7.5 percent  within the new stock accretion. Third, new offerings of shares  during the second semester of 1993 expanded at an average  monthly rate of 7.4 percent, while the influx of capital into  the market increased at the rate of only 3.5 percent, thus  leaving a disparity of 3.9 percent. Some particular shares even  showed a reverse movement, such as the "development A shares."  The total share capital expanded from the 140 million yuan of  1992 to 270 million yuan in 1993, thus supplies increased 93  percent. However, only not quite 40 percent of the 1992 amount  came in in 1993 as the capital of "development A shares," demand  having thus declined by somewhat over 60 percent. In 1994, which  is supposed to be the "Bond Buying Year" and the "Fund Building  Year," the divergent flow of capital will no doubt receive much  attention. In view of the present trend, our prognosis is: On  the one hand, supply will expand at an accelerated pace, and, on  the other hand, demand will, conversely, decline, and this will  further aggravate the conflict between supply and demand. The  shortage of capital funds in the stock market will increasingly  constitute a bottleneck that will hamper the development of the  stock market.    What is the remedy? The radical cure would be to return  again to the real demand of the market, to effect a  well-balanced adjustment of the current plans for the issue and  market offering of shares, so as to have demand determine  supply, and to truly establish a plan for the issuing and market  offering of shares on the foundation of actual demand in the  stock market.</p>

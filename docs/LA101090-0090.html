			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST 9 JAPANESE WWII INTERNEES GET REPARATIONS  </P> <P> In a moving, emotional ceremony, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh knelt Tuesday and  presented an entire nation's apology to Mamoru Eto, a wheelchair-bound,  107-year-old Japanese-American minister who was forcibly interned during World  War II.  </P> <P> Thornburgh, handing out $20,000 redress payments to nine elderly internees, the  first of about 65,000 Japanese-Americans who eventually will receive them, told  the recipients that, even when the American "system failed you, you never lost  your faith in it."  </P> <P> "By finally admitting a wrong, a nation does not destroy its integrity but,  rather, reinforces the sincerity of its commitment to the Constitution and  hence to its people," the attorney general said.  </P> <P> "We can never fully right the wrongs of the past," President Bush declared in a  two-paragraph statement accompanying each check. "But we can take a clear stand  for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to  Japanese-Americans during World War II."  </P> <P> Two Californian congressmen, Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose), and Robert T.  Matsui (D-Sacramento), brushed tears from their eyes and embraced as the  audience in the Justice Department's Great Hall sang "God Bless America."  </P> <P> Mineta, who was interned as a 10-year-old in a camp at Heart Mountain, Wyo.,  said: "Americans of Japanese ancestry now know in their hearts that the letter  and spirit of our Constitution holds true for them."  </P> <P> Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who lost his right arm fighting in Europe  with the Japanese-American 442nd Regiment, had to dry his eyes after greeting  Eto, a resident of a Los Angeles nursing home.  </P> <P> "We honor ourselves and honor America," Inouye said. "We demonstrated to the  world that we are a strong people -- strong enough to admit our wrongs."  </P> <P> Eto, who was minister of the First Japanese Nazarene Church in Pasadena when he  was sent in 1942 to the Tulare Assembly Center and then to the Gila River  (Ariz.) Internment Camp, said through his son, David, that he has no immediate  plans for the money he received.  </P> <P> The elder Eto, a resident of the Minami Keiro Nursing Home in Los Angeles,  delivered the ceremony's opening invocation in Japanese. His son said he has  forgotten the little English he once commanded.  </P> <P> David Eto, 59, a Woodland Hills engineer for Hughes Aircraft Corp.'s Missile  Systems division who later will receive his own $20,000 payment, agreed with  most recipients that the symbolism of the government's action outweighs the  dollars involved.  </P> <P> Tsyako (Sox) Kitashima, 72, of San Francisco, who personally mailed more than  25,000 letters in support of redress, expressed similar sentiments.  </P> <P> Kitashima was 23 when she was sent to a camp at Topaz, Utah, carrying as much  of her belongings as she could cram into the two suitcases allowed by  government officials. She said that for thousands of Japanese-Americans, the  redress and apology "hopefully will unburden the stigma of disloyalty" that  resulted from the forced relocation.  </P> <P> Although he was the first recipient, Mamoru Eto is not the oldest. Robert  Bratt, who runs the office of redress administration in the Justice  Department's civil rights division, plans to present a Phoenix woman who will  be 108 next month with a check in a private ceremony later this week. The  woman, who declined use of her name, is suffering from a toothache and is  considered too fragile to travel to Washington, Bratt said.  </P> <P> The redress program was mandated by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. The  $20,000 payments and letter of apology are to be provided to the 65,000  internees who were living when the law was passed, or to their heirs. About  120,000 Japanese-Americans were interned during the war.  </P> <P> The payments, expected to exceed $1.5 billion, are to be completed in fiscal  1993.  </P> <P> Ceremonies honoring other senior recipients are planned Thursday in Chicago;  Friday in Los Angeles and Fresno; Saturday in San Francisco, Sacramento and San  Jose; Sunday in Seattle, and Monday in Honolulu.  </P> <P> Other recipients who participated in Tuesday's ceremony were Hau Dairiki, 102,  of Sacramento; Kisa Iseri, 102, of Ontario, Ore.; Hisano Fujimoto, 101, of  Lombard, Ill.; Senkichi Yuge, 101, of Los Angeles; Sugi Kiriyama, 100, of West  Los Angeles; Sade Ide, 90, of Arlington, Va.; Don Hatsuki Shima, 86, of Laurel,  Md., and Ken Yamamoto, 73, of Silver Spring, Md.  </P> <P> On their way up the stairs to the Great Hall, recipients and other participants  passed wall murals of some of civilization's leading exponents of law and  justice -- Hammurabi, Moses, Solon, Justinian, Thomas Aquinas, John Marshall  and Oliver Wendell Holmes.  </P> <P> But the wartime Justice Department departed from the principles those men  espoused in its active support of the relocation and internment program.  Thornburgh, in his comments, said he is "not unmindful of the historic role  this department I now lead played in the internment. It is somehow entirely  fitting that it is here where we now celebrate redress."  </P></p>

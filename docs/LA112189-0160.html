			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CO-FOUNDER OF WENDY'S RETIRES  </P> <P> Robert L. Barney, chairman of Wendy's International Inc., is retiring from the  restaurant chain he helped build two decades ago, the company announced today.  </P> <P> Wendy's said it has no immediate plans to name a successor. Barney leaves May  20, the company said.  </P> <P> Barney, 52, met Wendy's founder R. David Thomas when the two worked at a  Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Columbus in 1964.  </P> <P> Barney helped Thomas begin the Wendy's hamburger chain, and served on its board  of directors after the Nov. 15, 1969, founding in downtown Columbus.  </P> <P> He became president in 1971, when Wendy's had two restaurants -- it now has  3,800 -- and helped develop the company's franchising system. He was named  chief executive officer in 1980 and chairman of the board in 1982.  </P> <P> Wendy's is generally seen as No. 3 behind McDonald's and Burger King, but has  suffered losses in recent years that, by some accounts, have placed it No. 4,  behind Hardee's Food Systems Inc. as well.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EMBATTLED THATCHER VOWS TO FIGHT FOR JOB  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, bloodied but unbowed by a bruising battle for  leadership of her party, vowed today to fight on, but her main rival boasted  that he is now only nine votes short of ending her political career.  </P> <P> "I fight on, I fight to win," Thatcher told reporters in London on her return  from the Paris European security summit.  </P> <P> But political sources said there were signs of support ebbing from Thatcher to  Michael Heseltine, who forced the contest for leadership of the Conservative  Party into a second round with a strong showing in Tuesday's first ballot.  </P> <P> Heseltine, 57, an ex-defense minister who resigned from his post five years ago  in a dispute with Thatcher, said more Tory members of Parliament will switch to  him on the second ballot, for which only a simple majority is needed to win.  </P> <P> "Ten people have told us since last night that they are with us," a Heseltine  campaign official said. "We need nine more to get us to the 187 level."  </P> <P> Political sources said some influential politicians believed that Thatcher, 65  and in office for 11 1/2 years, should be persuaded to step aside now and avoid  the risk of a humiliating defeat that would split the party.  </P> <P> But defeat was not on the "Iron Lady's" mind when she emerged from her official  residence at No. 10 Downing St. to repeat that she is still in the battle.  </P> <P> Thatcher drove from Downing Street to Parliament, where she stood amid cheers  from supporters to present her report on the Paris summit.  </P> <P> Since her return from the summit, Thatcher had been closeted with party  leaders, getting their advice on the mood among Conservative legislators after  the inconclusive first ballot.  </P> <P> Thatcher won 204 first-ballot votes to Heseltine's 152 but failed by four votes  to get the margin needed under the rules to avoid a second poll next Tuesday.  </P></p>

Soon after 1000 local time [1600 GMT], Cordeiro was taken  from Rengua Penitentiary to Rancagua Courthouse, where she was  officially notified of the Supreme Court ruling granting her  release.    Cordeiro was arrested by Investigative Police personnel in  March on charges of participating in the holdup of a telephone  company at Graneros together with two other persons.    During an exclusive interview with the "24 Hours" news  program, Cordeiro reiterated that she had been tortured and  raped at the First Investigative Police Precinct. Judge  Alejandro Solis was appointed to investigate her case. The  result of the investigation conducted by Judge Solis proved that  there was no concrete evidence to support Cordeiro's charges  against the Investigative Police. Despite this, eight policemen  have been indicted for arbitrary detention, psychological  harassment, and counterfeiting documents.</p>

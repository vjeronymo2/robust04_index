			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Kasim Begic, chairman of the </F> Economic Council of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and  participant in the work of the Transitory Committee for  Developing and Implementing the General Agreement on  establishing the federation, by Mehmed Agovic on 4 March; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Begic] From an economic viewpoint, the general  agreement on establishing the federation deserves support at  this stage of the talks because these solutions are basically on  the verge of achieving two general effects. First, regarding  the allocation of economic authority between the center and the  cantons, accepted are those solutions that are typical for a  usual federal setup of modern states -- on the one hand, kept at  the central level are those solutions that ensure an unified  economic-social system with unified money, freedom of the flow  of goods, factors of economic operations, monetary and fiscal  policy, and so on, and on the other, in allocating economic  authority solutions also typical for federal states in the  modern times are accepted, which means that apart from the  separate powers of the center and the cantons, also accepted are  joint engagements of the two levels of authority. Second, such  solutions also create a basis for adequately realizing  agreements with political, social, and other non-economic  characteristics, which means that a basis is also thereby  created for outlining the draft of the constitution of the  federation, the work of which should start today.    [Agovic] What does this economic concept mean for the third  side, which is not included in this agreement -- the Serbian  side? Can (?this) be a kind of integrative (?link)?    [Begic] I must stress that the solutions that have been  envisaged in this agreement are to a great extent identical to  solutions that were offered at the initial Geneva negotiations  by the legitimate bodies of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Namely, our  official proposal within the framework of the peace plan was to  try a federal setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, these  solutions are to a great extent identical to our proposal from  July 1993 and these solutions were offered for the entire  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that such solutions from this  agreement are also creating a basis for this so-called third  side, for it to be able to join this agreement in a way and do  so in a very short period.    [Agovic] The Republic of Croatia is also included in this  entire arrangement. What is this problem like?    [Begic] I must say that the framework of the preliminary  agreement, which envisages the founding of a confederation  between the Bosnian federation -- that is, Bosnia-Herzegovina --  and Croatia in an economic aspect and seen from present angle of  vision, above all, contains a lot of optimistic and, I could  even say, unrealistic content. Namely, this preliminary  agreement, among other things, envisages the creation of a  customs-monetary union, which already addresses elements of a  special state entity. The fact that it sounds too optimistic as  the prerequisite for joining a confederation between two  sovereign states is, above all, an adequate constitutional setup  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, only when the work on the  constitution of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is near  completion will it be possible to assess the scope of the  offered preliminary agreement on creating a confederation  between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    [Agovic] You are leaving for Vienna this evening to take  part in the work of the committee for drafting these documents.  Would this be a sufficient basis for doing so?    [Begic] The basis is good. I hope that the Transitory  Committee, in whose work I will take part, will be able to  continue along this good path that the Washington papers have  offered and I hope that this will be a key to peace for  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

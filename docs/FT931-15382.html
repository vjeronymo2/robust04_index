			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Industry squeezed as input costs rise PRICES OF raw materials and fuels rose again last month as the devaluation of sterling continued to put upward pressure on manufacturers' costs. Input prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in December, a smaller month-on-month rise than expected. Compared with a year ago, prices rose 5.2 per cent, the highest rate of increase since 1979. Before September - when sterling was devalued - raw material and fuel prices were falling. The sharp jump in input price inflation since autumn has not yet led to a corresponding increase in output prices. Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that, in December, prices of goods leaving the factory gates rose by 0.2 per cent, taking the annual rate of output price inflation to 3.5 per cent - compared with 3.3 per cent in the year to November. That suggests that manufacturers are reluctant to pass the higher input costs on to consumers. Raw materials and fuels account for about 40 per cent of expenditure. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburgs, said output prices were being held down by sluggish unit wage costs. The latest figures from the Department of Employment show they rose by only 1 per cent in the three months to the end of October. 'It is going to take a while for the latest cost increases in raw materials to come through,' Mr Gardiner said. 'Output prices are being held at bay by unit wage costs that are going nowhere.' The underlying rate of output price inflation, excluding volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in December compared with the previous month, and 2.4 per cent in the year to December. That was unchanged from the November figure. The latest monthly increase in input prices of 0.1 per cent followed much bigger rises in October and November, when they rose by 2.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said December's figure was a brief respite for input prices: 'Dollar-denominated commodity prices now appear to be moving upwards after the excessive deflation of the past year.'</p>

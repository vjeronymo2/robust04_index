			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift to go private via 398p share offer Nu-Swift, the fire protection and property group, is to be acquired by a private company indirectly owned by Mr Jacques Murray, its chairman. Euro Fire Security will offer 398p in cash for each Nu-Swift share, valuing the issued share capital at Pounds 147.2m. The price represents a 15 per cent premium over the 345p of the last trade on the USM at the end of June, when news emerged of the plans to take the company private. Mr Murray is the sole beneficial shareholder in European Fire Protection Holding, owner of Euro Fire Security. Through EFP and other companies he owns 24.4m shares (66.1 per cent) of Nu-Swift, which he has chaired since 1984. The other main shareholding is held by subsidiaries of ADT, the Bermuda-based security and vehicle auction group headed by Mr Michael Ashcroft. They have 8.4m shares, or 22.8 per cent. Mr Ashcroft is the independent director on Nu-Swift's board. ADT's subsidiaries are backing the proposed privatisation. Mr Murray has confirmed that connected shareholders will not use their vote at the extraordinary meeting, still to be convened, on the adoption of the scheme. Nu-Swift lost its full listing on the Stock Exchange in 1991 because such a small stake was in public hands. Since December 1988 the group has bought about 7m of its own shares, leaving only 11.1 per cent outside the two principal investors. The board said yesterday that it considered the trading of the shares on the USM was 'not currently serving any useful purpose,' and imposed a costly administrative and regulatory burden. The group has changed the nature of its business, disposing of service industries and moving into property. At the end of June the unaudited balance sheet showed consolidated net assets of Pounds 135.7m, equivalent to approximately 367p a share. The bank balances and cash were Pounds 91m before finance debt.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons' slimming pill The decision by Fisons to sell some 10 per cent of its business is welcome evidence of the new management's ability to break with tradition. Its consumer medicines may find a ready sale among larger drug companies anxious to spread the risk of ethical drug research. Getting rid of the peat business will solve an irritating environmental problem, as well as disabusing those consumers who think Fisons is a gardening company. With luck, the proceeds could reach Pounds 300m, which would leave the group with over Pounds 100m of net cash. The question is how Fisons will spend the money. The obvious answer is to buy in drugs and delivery systems too small to attract its larger rivals, or to engage in co-marketing of a kind unpopular with previous management. Fisons has yet to prove that there is room for a drug company of its size to flourish in a world of giants. But as the market has come to realise, there is not much chance of it being subject to a hostile bid either. Since the previous chairman left in mid-January, the shares have moved with the market. On the basis of yesterday's deal, they perhaps deserve to do better than that.</p>

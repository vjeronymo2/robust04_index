			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: MMC must look into this fowl practice Sir, The Commons trade and industry committee would do well to add food retailers to its list of sectors to be examined with regard to UK competition policy ('MMC's impact to be assessed' December 12). It would be difficult to find a clearer example of the failure of our competition authorities than the current price war between the supermarkets. Having fought themselves to a standstill (with many casualties) on milk and bread, the supermarkets' latest battleground is turkeys. Gateway has boasted prices for the frozen variety of 35 pence a pound. Safeway went one better with the self-basting version at 34p. Kwik Save has trumped these with its 28p a pound fowl. Such prices make turkey cheaper than dog-meat  - and are less than half what the retailers pay the producers. The competition authorities have the responsibility for adjudicating on whether this war is a legitimate ploy to pull in the punters, or whether it is a cynical example of predatory pricing. In the confusion following the announcement of Sir Bryan Carsberg's resignation as its director-general, the Office of Fair Trading has said nothing. Meanwhile, the traditional high street butcher and specialist producer are being bankrupted because they lack the financial muscle to cross-subsidise important lines from profits made on others. So confident of official inertia have the retail giants become that Tesco now advertises on television that it takes a loss on each sale of many lines. At the very least this should merit an MMC investigation. Again, so far the response has been silence. The trade and industry committee may wish to ponder whether this is consistent with the secretary of state's pledge to 'intervene before breakfast, lunch and dinner'.

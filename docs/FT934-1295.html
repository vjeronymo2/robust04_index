			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Seeking same subsidies Sir, You are right ('Gatt and the media', December 15) that many of the EU arguments are a smoke-screen for a commercial interest. You have unintentionally contributed to that smoke-screen by repeating the French disinformation that the Americans want subsidies for European films cut or abandoned. This is not so. What they do feel, and this is highly understandable, is that their European subsidiaries should benefit from the same subsidies when the source of those subsidies is a levy on box office receipts and when those subsidiaries make films in Europe. Far from trying to intervene in the fiscal policies of sovereign states, the Americans are seeking to eliminate unlawful discrimination. J E Ferry, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &amp; MacRae, 14 Rue Montoyer, 1040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

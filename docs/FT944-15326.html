			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Heseltine confirms regional aid future Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, insisted yesterday that the government is committed to the regional aid policy which this week helped win for Britain a Pounds 450m investment by Samsung, the Korean industrial group. Mr Heseltine said the idea that the system of regional selective assistance grants, under which the Samsung investment has been offered Pounds 58m, would be abandoned was 'trivia'. He said: 'There are no question marks over the programme.' Asked on BBC Radio 4 yesterday if he could guarantee that grants for next year would not be less than the current year, he said: 'These programmes I am dealing with are spread over several years and my department is actively negotiating across the world in order to continue this inward investment into Britain.' RSA grants are made to encourage job-creating investments in areas of Britain needing economic regeneration. In 1993-94 Pounds 341m was spent. In August ideological differences between ministers over the principle of such intervention became public with the leaking of a letter to Mr Heseltine from Mr Michael Portillo, then chief secretary to the Treasury. In the letter Mr Portillo said he saw no strong case for retaining the regional aid scheme. When on Monday Samsung announced its choice of Cleveland for a new electronics complex, Mr Portillo, now employment secretary, welcomed the news but made no mention of the grant incentive offered. In spite of Mr Heseltine's support for the regional aid principle the DTI earlier this year started scrutinising applications for grants in England more stringently, arousing concern from economic development agencies that areas needing regeneration might lose out. The tightening is due to various factors, including constraints on public spending, additions to the assisted areas map, and an increased stress in granting aid on the quality of jobs created.</p>

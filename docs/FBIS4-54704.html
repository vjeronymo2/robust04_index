			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor Krejci </F> in Prague; date not given: "Membership in More Than One  Political Party Is, in My Opinion, a Typical Case of Bigamy"]    [Text] [Krejci] The government proposes that membership  in political parties be exclusive. This means that no one can  be a member of several political parties at the same time. The  opposition claims that such a law would violate the Constitution  and the Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. What is  your view of this issue?    [Klaus] I am not an exponent of the Constitution or of the  Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. However, I have the  feeling that many people in our country shield themselves by  their reading and interpretation of these documents. They then  reach certain conclusions from which it would appear that, on  the one hand, everything is possible and that, on the other,  nothing at all is possible.    In my opinion, membership in two or more political parties  is  like a marriage with more than one spouse. This is simply a  typical case of bigamy, and I do not believe it would make sense  to introduce something like this into our legal code.    [Krejci] You have visited Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.  What impression has this visit made on you? Could you compare  the reform process in our country and Chile?    [Klaus] The strongest impression I have from this visit is  one of enormous contrasts--both between the individual countries  and within each state unit. We do not like it when someone  views the postcommunist part of Europe as a monolithic mass.  However, I must say to everyone who does not like this that we  also have a priori a slightly simplified view of this part of  the world.    The sociopolitical sphere also made a strong impression on  me. These countries are very dissimilar, and the political  situation in each is different. Argentina has a distinct and  strong government led by Menem and Cabal that is undoubtedly  pushing this country forward. Chile is in the post-Pinochet  phase, and something like our Civic Forum governs there. No  obvious positive consensus has been reached yet on the way  forward. Brazil, in the political sense, is in a very unstable  situation, and you will not find personalities of the  Argentinian or Chilean caliber there.    As far as Chile is concerned, it is going through its own  form of coming to terms with the past, which, for it, is still  terribly close and within reach. While in our country the  victims of communist despotism, which was far worse at the  beginning, are in the 60-to-80-year-old age group, in Chile this  happened 15 years ago. This means that the people affected are  still young. Therefore, in this country the issue of coming to  terms with the past is completely different from what it is in  our country. My idea, often repeated in our country, of a  rear-view mirror attracted a great deal of attention in Chile.  This greatly inspired President Frey and, apparently, he will  incorporate it into his speeches. General Pinochet is still  commander of the Army and, therefore, is an important official.  Nevertheless, in Chile they have decided to very quickly draw a  thick line under the past and go on. Indeed, they have no major  restitution-rehabilitation and screening problems there. The  president of the Senate, who is a very affable fellow, said in  this context that he was imprisoned twice under Pinochet, but  this does not prevent him from going to dinner with him today.  This is indeed a slightly different view from the one we have,  and it is worth making the comparison.    [Krejci] The post of education minister has become vacant.  What is your stance on filling this position?    [Klaus] Within the framework of the coalition, the Civic  Democratic Party respects the fact that the Christian Democratic  Party holds this post. As far as the candidate is concerned, I  have to say that, so far, no talks have been held.</p>

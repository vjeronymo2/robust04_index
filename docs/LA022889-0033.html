			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Wall Street professionals, who were wondering how strong the recent market  really is, now know that the double whammy of higher inflation and a rise in  both the prime and discount rates is enough to make the market pause and take  note of reality, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas  Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> Only a handful of San Diego stocks escaped the downturn.  </P> <P> La Jolla Bancorp continued to move up, gaining $.75 and hitting a new high of  $9.50 as investors continue to believe that the county's smaller banks are  takeover targets.  </P> <P> Western Health Plans was the largest percentage gainer of the week, moving up  $.4375 to $1 after Mercy Services Corp., an affiliate of San Diego's Mercy  Hospital and Medical Center, announced it would invest as much as $15 million  to salvage the health-care plan operator. Mercy Services could eventually own  45% of Western's stock.  </P> <P> Price Co., which on Monday explained technical details of its preferred stock  dividend, moved up $.75, largely on a favorable mention in the latest Fortune  magazine.  </P> <P> The downside for San Diego stocks was primarily populated by interest-sensitive  stocks, with Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan down $1.50, Imperial Corp. of  America down $.875 and Great American First Savings Bank down $.25.  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which is preparing its proxy statement for an  April shareholder meeting on its merger with Southern California Edison, was  down $.375.  </P> <P> Fisher Scientific dropped $1.75 as it reported lower fourth-quarter earnings  than expected -- $.27, down from $.30 the previous year, Katz said. The poor  fourth quarter resulted in yearly earnings of .04. Henley Group, which controls  more than 80% of Fisher, likewise dropped $1.75.  </P> <P> Maxwell Laboratories was down $.75 after reporting disappointing second-quarter  earnings of $.20, versus $.25 for the corresponding quarter the previous year.  </P> <P> Other stocks moving down included Cohu, down $1.625, and Cubic, down $1.125,  after recent run-ups.  </P> <P> Shareholders of Langley who are still trying to find the quote for their stock  should contact St. Catherine, Ontario-based Fleet Aerospace. Langley  certificates should have been exchanged for Fleet Aerospace common and  preferred, Katz said.  </P></p>

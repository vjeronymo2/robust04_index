			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Economics: Attention focuses on UK inflation ATTENTION returns to UK inflation this week with today's release of the April producer prices index. Input prices have shot-up since the pound was devalued last autumn, putting pressure on manufacturers' profit margins. So far, however, industry appears to have absorbed most of the price increases for fuel and raw materials. This is reflected in the relative stability of the prices of goods leaving factory gates. Output price inflation has remained stable at a rate of around 3.5 per cent since the end of last year. Economists have forecast some upwards movement in the output prices index for April as the increase in excise duties of the March budget, and higher food prices feed through. Input prices may ease slightly, reflecting sterling's appreciation during April. Producer price inflation figures are also due out in the US. Prices are expected to have slowed quite sharply last month, following reductions in tobacco prices and air fares. To some extent these factors will be offset by higher prices for most agricultural commodities. The release in Spain of quarterly unemployment survey data later this week, is unlikely to provide much comfort for the hard-pressed government. In the fourth quarter of last year the survey showed that 20 per cent of the labour force was unemployed. Most economists expect the new figures to show a small rise. The following are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures in brackets are the median of analysts' forecasts, supplied by MMS International, a financial information company.

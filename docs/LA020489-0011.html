			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: WAGNER RETURNS, IS REINSTATED BY THE AZTECS  </P> <P> In what might conclude the saga of running back Darrin Wagner, San Diego State  Coach Al Luginbill announced Friday that Wagner will not transfer to Nebraska  and has been reinstated by the Aztecs.  </P> <P> Wagner quit SDSU in November, and Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said in statements  that he would be welcomed as a walk-on. Wagner was The Times' 1987 San Diego  County back of the year for Lincoln but did not play for the Aztecs as a  freshman.  </P> <P> According to Luginbill, Wagner returns to the team under certain restrictions  and will redshirt in 1989.  </P> <P> "Darrin just needed to find out for himself that he had a good situation here  at San Diego State," Luginbill said. "But he is still on scholarship, and we're  very happy to have him back. As far as I'm concerned, this case is closed."  </P> <P> Wagner said he was hesitant to go to Nebraska and was listening to what other  people were telling him. "I'm just more comfortable at San Diego State," he  said. "This is my hometown, and this program is a Division I program that's  headed in the right direction. I want to be a part of it."  </P> <P> Raymond Thompson, Crawford High School offensive lineman, has verbally  committed to play football at Weber State.  </P> <P> At Crawford, the 6-foot-2, 239-pound nose guard, was named to the All-State  Cal-Hi Sports team and All-City Central League first team.  </P> <P> MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Cal State San Bernardino overcame a 13-point second-half deficit with a 12-0  run midway through the second half to defeat UC San Diego, 96-89, at Triton  Pavilion.  </P> <P> Freshman Rick Batt, starting for the first time in place of injured center  Gordon McNeill, had 36 points on 15 of 22 shooting and 13 rebounds. UCSD (7-14)  led, 48-40, at halftime.  </P> <P> CS San Bernardino (15-5) made all 20 of its second-half free throw attempts and  25 of 26.

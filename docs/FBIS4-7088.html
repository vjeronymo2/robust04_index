			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Political parties and  organisations of various countries denounced moves of the U.S.  imperialists against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The Central Committee of the African Party of Independence  of  Senegal in a statement April 7 said the United States totally  reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-USA contact  in New York and was going to resume the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises and deployed "Patriot" missiles in South  Korea.    A statement published by the participants in the  international chuche idea seminar on independence, peace and  friendship on April 10 denounced the U.S. imperialists for  massing their huge Armed Forces in South Korea and around the  Korean peninsula, vociferating about the resumption of the "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises, and branded it as a brazen  violation of the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean people  and as an act of provocation to stifle the socialism of Korea.    It urged the United States to cancel the plan to resume the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises that poses a big threat  to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Far  East. "If the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries take the  road of unleashing another war on the Korean peninsula, we,  together with the followers of the chuche idea all over the  world, will fight on the same trench with the Korean people with  arms in hand," the statement stressed.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement on  April 6 said that the United States must immediately stop its  moves to stifle the system of socialist Korea and renounce its  policy hostile to it, and the United Nations Security Council  and the International Atomic Energy Agency must not follow the  United States any longer, discarding the double standard and  partiality.    The Denmark-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Friendship  Association in a statement said the U.S. clamor about "nuclear  threat from North Korea" is completely groundless. The nuclear  issue of the Korean peninsula can be resolved only when all the  nuclear weapons of the United States are removed from South  Korea and such aggressive war exercises as "Team Spirit" stopped  and all the U.S. forces withdrawn from there, the statement  stressed.</p>

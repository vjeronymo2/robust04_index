			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Tackling 'disarray' in help for exports: Fears that not enough is done for outward goods EXPORTING is scary. Assuming that barriers such as language, customs, standards and procedures can be overcome, and adequate representation found in alien markets, the financial exposure alone can be crippling. Uncertainty is assured. So says Mr William Nothdurft in a book that will strike a chord with exporters everywhere, particularly on the eve of the launch of one of the UK's most ambitious export promotion campaigns - to be called North America Now. Details of the US trade campaign - expected to include unique and innovative government initiatives - will be unveiled by the Department of Trade and Industry tomorrow. It will be launched at a time of fierce debate over how governments should best help exporters. Britain is not alone in discovering that sustained non-inflationary growth is better driven by exports than domestic demand. Nor is it alone in worrying about widening trade gaps. Across the Atlantic, the infant administration of President Clinton is obsessed with the link between trade and jobs. The Australian government is reviewing the services it offers exporters. Export promotion is in vogue. A core worry is that so few exporters account for such a large proportion of exports. In the UK, the top 50 companies account for about 44 per cent of visible exports totalling Pounds 108m last year. As a result, export promotion efforts are invariably targeted at smaller companies, often with limited success. At the same time, however, there is widespread concern that government efforts to aid exporters often miss the mark. Trade missions are often dismissed as 'jollies' - backing for companies to attend trade fairs is attacked as unco-ordinated. Government efforts have targeted the 'export-willing', but have been less successful in pinpointing the 'export-ready'. Even export campaigns have been questioned. Mr Graham Bannock, a consultant to the DTI on a number of trade issues, and author of a government report on exporting, says: 'They don't generate much in the way of exports. But it's terribly difficult to prove anything convincingly because of the wide variety of other factors that can effect export performance over a period of time.' Business leaders such as Mr Simon Sperry, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce, say there is 'disarray' on the delivery mechanism for export services. He says there are too many agencies - including Enterprise Agencies, Local Employer Networks, Training and Enterprise Agencies and One-stop Shops - competing for funding, and in the end not providing a quality job. At the Institute of Export, Mr Ian Campbell points to export-active organisations such as Tecs, the Institute of Freight Forwarders, the Confederation of British Industry, Institute of Marketing, chambers of commerce and the Institute of Directors, and asks: 'When did they last meet jointly, or co-ordinate efforts? We need a more co-operative corporate structure.' Mr Campbell notes that the budget of the British Overseas Trade Board last year amounted to Pounds 173m - 'enough to run the health service for 25 hours'. Of this, Pounds 123m goes on staff salaries at the DTI and their equivalents in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland, and on payments to embassies abroad for commercial services. Apart from concern that too little money has been budgeted for export promotion, there are criticisms of the lack of continuity at the head of the DTI. It has had 16 ministers in 24 years, with just three of them lasting beyond two years. Nevertheless Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, a junior DTI minister, appear to have impressed industry with their early efforts to tailor government activities to meet exporters' needs. For a country in which exports account for 18 per cent of gross domestic product, many industrialists would say this is long overdue. Defining his export promotion strategy yesterday, Mr Needham identified three prongs - services to improve competitiveness and the exportability of British products, particularly in industrial export markets; aid to the capital goods industry to help them take opportunities in developing country markets, with a target of raising capital goods exports from Pounds 10bn in 1993 to Pounds 20bn by 2000; and the protection of British trading interests in forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in bilateral trade conflicts over products like steel, cars, procurement, or on taxation of international companies. What is distinctive in Mr Needham's strategy is a conviction that export promotion starts with private industry, and at the regional level.</p>

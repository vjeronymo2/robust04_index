			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / As they say in Europe: The art of dismal non-politics LE MONDE told me that the French election causedthe departure of a man who had been a member of the National Assembly since 1936. He was Edouard Frederic-Dupont, aged 91 and unknown to the general public. That was the most interesting thing on the outcome I read in that or any of the other 28 French commentaries I glanced at. But only Le Figaro produced a view that I had expected to be universal. The Socialists had lost, said Alain Peyrefitte, because of their 'passivity in the face of the brutal Common Agricultural Policy imposed by Brussels and Anglo-Saxon pressure in the Gatt.' Many cling to that geopolitical solipsism that masqueraded as a foreign policy until the Gulf affair of 1991. Apart from that, everybody agreed that voters were fed up with the ageing and scandal-prone socialists. Nobody explained why that was a reason for giving a colossal majority to a coalition led by Jacques Chirac and Valery Giscard d'Estaing. But, as France's leading television political analyst, Christine Ockrent, said a day or two before the vote: 'Politics are very old fashioned.' And she is right: the idea of two parties raving at each other about how much better they can do than the other lot seems, to say the least, a little passe. There is a new 'non-politics' based on a shortage of topics for disagreement. It has made inroads even in France. Compare the lack of debate today with the situation of a decade ago when the Socialists nationalised the banks - a process which is now being reversed. Anyone who suggested bank nationalisation today would be regarded as a lunatic. Yet the case for nationalising banks in 1993 is no less strong than it was in 1981 when they had succeeded in wrecking the economies of only the developing world. The main constituent of 'politics' is that you promise the moon and either ruin the economy trying to achieve it or say you have achieved it come what may. 'Non-politics' means saying you cannot do anything very much and that there are no alternatives to what you are doing. Electorates have rejected the old but they do not much like the new. As one Paris paper put it last week: 'The French want no more broken promises or unrealisable dreams. They ask those who will govern them from next week to open the prospect of a solution tomorrow for their problems of today.' In Germany there is a belief that what happened in the French election will be repeated next year there. Germany is suffering scandal fatigue too. As the Mannheimer Morgen put it, apologies and promises to do better will not be accepted: 'Being in politics no longer means you can get away with saying 'sorry.'' The political scene is as dismal as in France: what passes for debate comes down to tedious discussions about tax rates or something known as repo fixing. All this reflects an almost Europe-wide phenomenon - the area of legitimate discussion has become appallingly constricted. Except in Italy, where the agenda is unlimited. In Britain the Budget debate was between the government and the City of London; local politics ended when Mrs Thatcher substituted what Friedrich Engels saw as an essential constituent of a future communist state - 'the replacement of the government of persons by the administration of things.' The British cannot vote for higher local taxes any more because the government has banned them. Non-politics are reflected in an insight that provides another dimension to Ms Ockrent's apercu. When he gave up his job as 'peace envoy' in the former Yugoslavia last year, Lord Carrington was accused by a radio interviewer of having pursued wrong policies. 'They were the right policies,' replied the noble lord, 'It was just that they didn't work.' That was a truly non-political answer and it provides a key to many riddles. The idea that the right policies may not work is not absurd. Imagine a television interview today about the 'failure' of the policies outlined in the Sermon on the Mount. 'But excuse me, didn't you give a pledge to the meek that they would inherit the earth?' The right reply would be, more or less, the same as that of Lord Carrington, with, perhaps, the addition of the words 'But only time will tell.' This is much better than the political answer - 'You have to realise that at the time we had no idea that unrighteousness would continue so long; it is today a universal problem. And let me say that in the last 2,000 years we have done far more for the meek than the other parties managed in the 3,000 years before that.' It was a sign of the times that an electoral earthquake took place last week and it hardly mattered. The papers wrote about the end of an era. No-one, not even the victors, spoke of a new one opening. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

Here is our colleague with a report on this.    [Unidentified correspondent, by telephone] It is reported  that fighter planes belonging to General Dostam and Ahmad Shah  Mas'ud appeared in the Kabul sky today and bombarded each  other's positions.    During the past two days air attacks by warring forces have  been very severe. While General Dostam's fighter planes have  bombed the presidential palace and the Baghram military airport  on several occasions, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's fighter planes have  attacked several of his opponents' positions, including  Charasyab, situated 25 km south of Kabul. According to reports  the presidential palace has been severely damaged. Furthermore,  yesterday's bombing of Charasyab caused great damage to the  Afghan prime minister's television center. The Afghan Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party] has, however, once again declared its  neutrality concerning the current fighting in Kabul.    The secretary general of the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic  Unity Party] said yesterday: The current war -- just like the  other conflicts in the past 21 months -- will not have a  decisive effect in resolving the Afghan political problems. He  added: The only way to resolve Afghan problems is to set up a  neutral government in which the principal participants would be  the four main political and military groups; that is, the Hezb-e  Eslami, Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Wahdat-e  Eslami, and the Afghan National Islamic Movement. Abdolali  Mazari said: Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami cooperates with the other  members of the Afghan Supreme Cooperation Council solely from a  political point of view.    Meanwhile reports coming from Jalalabad indicate that  thousands of refugees from Kabul are stranded without any  shelter in cold mountain areas between Jalalabad and the  Pakistani border. Kabul hospital sources say that the fighting  in the past three weeks has left hundreds dead and more than  8,000 injured.</p>

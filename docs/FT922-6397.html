			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Thai PM yields to protesters GENERAL Suchinda Kraprayoon, whose resignation as Thai prime minister was demanded in demonstrations which left 46 dead this week, was last night reported to be quitting. A senior army officer said he had been to King Bhumibol Adulyadej and may have submitted his resignation. In any case Gen Suchinda would resign before parliament met on Monday to discuss a constitutional amendment that would force him out of office. The parliamentary move follows agreement among the five parties in the coalition government to back the reforms. Their decision represents a significant victory for pro-democracy activists inside and outside parliament - so much so that rumours yesterday swept Bangkok of an imminent coup d'etat by military hardliners. The decision followed weeks of hesitation over the amendments, culminating in the deaths of at least 46 Thais in confrontations this week between troops and pro-democracy demonstrators. Proposed amendments would reduce the power of the military-appointed senate and limit the premiership to elected members of parliament. Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief, was not elected but appointed by the five pro-military parties after they won a general election in March. Yesterday Mr Pongpol Adireksan, the foreign minister, met foreign ambassadors and later said with tears in his eyes that Gen Suchinda should take the blame for the deaths of demonstrators. 'The image of the country can only improve after we change the prime minister,' he said. The softened stance of the ruling political parties is in marked contrast to the unrepentant attitude of senior military figures such as Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme commander; the military men now look increasingly isolated in the face of demands that those responsible for the shootings should resign or be punished. The Confederation for Democracy, a 10-day-old umbrella organisation of activists, yesterday insisted that the prime minister, the supreme commander and the army commander resign; that those who ordered the killing be punished according to the law; that the constitutional amendments be passed within a month; that the government prevent future violence against demonstrators; and that it compensate innocent victims. Leaders of the group threatened strikes and demonstrations if the amendments were not passed or Gen Suchinda refused to step down. 'If he does not resign then the people will show their strength again all over the whole country,' Dr Sant Hathirat said. 'We are fighting for full democracy and we will continue to fight whether it takes one day or one month or one year.' Mr Somsak Kosaisook, one of the leaders of a state enterprise labour organisation dissolved following a coup by Gen Suchinda last year, said he had met other union officials to discuss a strike. 'If the government stumbles and does not follow up its promises, it is possible that both public sector and private sector workers will go on strike,' he said. According to The Nation newspaper, a group of oilfield employees of Thai Shell Exploration and Production attempted to strike in protest against Gen Suchinda this week. The company said yesterday that crude oil production had been briefly disrupted because of an unspecified 'operational cause'.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WHAD'YA KNOW?' IT'S A NEW WAVE OF RADIO;  </P> <P> CAMPY CALL-IN PROGRAM TOUCHES SAME VEIN AS KEILLOR'S 'COMPANION'  </P> <P> It's Saturday morning and you're tuned to National Public Radio, that bastion  of culture, bulwark of refinement and fount of thoughtful social and political  analysis. Your host, Mr. Michael Feldman:  </P> <P> "Can you get the flu from ducks?"  </P> <P> "I think so. What do you think, Steve?" says Chris, the studio contestant.  </P> <P> "Well, let's flip a coin here," says Steve, another contestant on the phone  line from Kansas.  </P> <P> "I would flip a duck," Feldman interjects.  </P> <P> "I would think you can probably get it from anything," says Steve.  </P> <P> "Yes, you can," says Feldman, banging a desk bell for emphasis as the audience  cheers both Chris and Steve, another step closer to winning wind-up teeth and  other gifts from the fabulous treasure-trove of prizes. "In fact, according to  American Health magazine, every strain of flu is in a duck's gut. Try that at a  cocktail party around the guacamole. . . ."  </P> <P> Well, whad'ya know, it's time once again for another edition of "Whad'ya  Know?," the quirky comedy-quiz-talk-interview-call-in show that is on its way  to becoming one of the hottest entertainment properties on public radio since  "Prairie Home Companion."  </P> <P> If all that seems a little incongruous, consider this: a live, two-hour weekly  program featuring the wit and urbane, off-the-wall ad-libs of a Milwaukee-born  Jewish host originating from studios in central Wisconsin that has developed a  loyal following on dozens of stations from Boston to San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I assume there's some appeal of the heartland that draws them," Feldman says.  "Of course, we're the left aorta of the heartland."  </P> <P> The show has also turned into the latest camp attraction for the high-brow  Midwestern baby-boomer set, who drive by the carloads from hundreds of miles  away to be part of the studio audience. And a television production company  will soon tape a pilot for a possible video version for cable or syndication.  </P> <P> "I don't know if anyone can explain why it's so popular, but it certainly does  have a large and loyal audience," said Sarah Carlston, a spokeswoman for NPR,  which is based in Washington.  </P> <P> Interest in the quirky quiz, now in its third year, took off after Garrison  Keillor folded his long-running "Prairie Home Companion" in mid-1987, and  stations that had carried it began to shop around for something to fill the  void.  </P> <P> That is where the similarity ends, though fans often refer to the newer  offering as the "Dairy Home Companion." Instead of folksy schmaltz, Feldman's  stock-in-trade is irreverent, topical shtick.  </P> <P> "Well, you know my mother still doesn't like Bush," he wisecracked on the air  recently. "She thinks he said a kinder, Gentiler nation."  </P> <P> A one-time high school teacher and cab driver, the bespectacled, 38-year-old  Feldman has been dabbling on the edges of audio peculiarity since 1977, when he  convinced the manager of a small independent station here to let him host a  morning show from a local greasy spoon next to the rescue mission. He  interviewed diners as they ate breakfast, but the show was often interrupted by  bar fights.  </P> <P> After a series of similarly avant-garde ventures on Madison radio, Feldman  caught the attention of WGN, Chicago's top-rated commercial station, which  hired him in 1984 to host a talk show. It quickly flopped and Feldman was  fired, but two years later he was back at Madison's WHA, the University of  Wisconsin-run public outlet, with carte blanche to develop a new program. The  result was "Whad'ya Know?," which Feldman says is just a refinement of his past  offerings.  </P> <P> Trying to pin it down in print is a little difficult because the format and  rules shift to fit Feldman's whims. Armed with a portable microphone, he walks  through the studio bantering with the audience, the show's piano player, who  performs periodic musical interludes, and callers from around the nation. There  is also a community salute -- a new town picked on each week's show by throwing  a dart against a map and then calling residents at random.  </P> <P> It all loosely revolves around a quiz, which Feldman admits is just a gimmick  to hook listeners and get them to call during the show. Questions, as well as  prizes, range from the obscure to the ridiculous:  </P> <P> Question: "Is it true what they say about the sex life of clams?" Answer: "Yes,  they turn from boys to girls. Many have appeared on Phil Donahue."  </P> <P> All this may seem grating or silly to the public-radio purist, which is both  the show's promise and biggest problem. "Public radio formats tend to either be  classical or talk- oriented, but reasoned talk a la 'All Things Considered,' "  Feldman says. "This is unreasoned talk. This is a few things ill-considered."  </P> <P> The show is currently carried by about 90 stations, up from only four two years  ago. That is fast growth by the standards of public radio but a far cry from  the 300 or so affiliates that featured Keillor's show by the end of its 13-year  run.  </P> <P> Carlston said conservative managers at many stations are reluctant to air the  show because it contrasts with the sobering tone of traditional public-radio  programming. Yet, she said, those stations that do take the plunge report that  pledge-week contributions rise considerably when the show airs -- a key  indication of success for non-commercial stations.  </P> <P> The primary public station in the Los Angeles area, KCRW-FM, ran the show  briefly last spring, but dropped it in favor of a more traditional, locally  produced call-in program. However, "Whad'ya Know?" is aired by public stations  in San Bernardino and San Mateo as well as Boston, New York, Chicago and  several other large urban areas.  </P> <P> Feldman, who spends much of his off-air time alternately remodeling his  bathroom and trying to peddle the show to gun-shy public broadcasters, says  such groveling is in keeping with the spirit of the program.  </P> <P> "I do anything I have to do to get an audience," he says. "On this show all we  do is try and pander."  </P> <P> 1 line of 60p  </P></p>

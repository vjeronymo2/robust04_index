			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by a "responsible source at the Command of the </F> Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; date not  given]    [Text] The bloody al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa today repeated to  fail in its aggressive attempts on the various fronts. Our air,  ground and naval forces have been able to repel and foil these  attempts and to rout the hostile forces, inflicting on them  heavy losses of life and material. On the Karish-Tawr al-Baha  axis, our forces were able to shoot down two enemy aircraft and  destroy four Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. On this front  the enemy lost dozens of officers and men, including a  lieutenant colonel and a major. In a hysterical attempt, two  enemy aircraft tried to bomb the Aden refinery, but our air  defenses foiled them. One of the aircraft released its  destructive load over one of the government schools in  al-Burayqah, wounding six women and children living near the  school. In the Abyan-Shabwah axis our forces continued  delivering crushing blows on the invading enemy forces,  compelling them to withdraw and return to where they had come  from. God is great.</p>

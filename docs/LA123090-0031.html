			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EL NINO WILL THREATEN AUSTRALIA WITH SEVERE DROUGHT IN '91, FORECASTERS SAY  </P> <P> El Nino, a weather phenomenon first detected by Peruvian fishermen at the turn  of the century, could leave much of rural Australia praying for rain next year,  weather forecasters said Friday.  </P> <P> El Nino may bring drought conditions to eastern Australia, where farmers are  suffering from falling commodity prices and high interest rates, they said.  </P> <P> The effect begins with a warming of water in the Pacific between Australia and  South America followed by a change in atmospheric pressure and a movement of  winds that carry rain-bearing clouds away from Australia toward the Pacific.  </P> <P> It was named El Nino, Spanish for boy child, by fishermen off Peru who noticed  an increase in water temperature followed by torrential rain.  </P></p>

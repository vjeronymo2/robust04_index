			<p>Two      Japanese companies have collaborated to move beyond the  silicon age by developing a new electronic element with greater  potential memory capacity than the conventional semiconductor chip.  The companies, Suntory Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. have  succeeded in the creation of an artificial protein with a diode  property, which can be applied to the development of semiconductor  chips, potentially increasing their capacity to 1-terabit of memory.  This capacity is far beyond the existing integration limit for  silicon semiconductor chips (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Apr 94, NIKKEI  SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94).

Source: NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN, 24 Mar 94.      The artificial protein created by genetic recombination, has the  same basic functions as an electronic element.  According to  Japanese press reports, this is the world's first successful  creation of a protein that functions as a diode, allowing an  electric current to go through it, and as a switch that controls the  current flow.  Next, a molecular element must be developed to  integrate the artificial proteins.  This would pave the way for  development of a 1-terabit memory chip, which would exceed the 1-  gigabit integration limit of a silicon semiconductor (NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN 23 Apr 94, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94).      The artificial protein was developed by bonding a natural  protein, heat-resistant "cytochrome c552," to flavin, a kind of  vitamin that is able to receive and emit electrons.  Electrons are  exchanged between flavin and heme (hemu), a part of cytochrome c552  that receives and emits electrons.  The method by which electrons  are received and emitted between flavin and heme is equivalent to  electron exchange between a p-type semiconductor that receives  electrons and an n-type semiconductor layer that emits electrons.  This electron exchange makes it possible to control the flow of the  electric current.  The companies confirmed that the artificial  protein properties are not affected even at a temperature of 100  degrees C.  Genetic engineering was applied in the process of  replacing an amino acid that comprised cytochrome c552 with a  special molecule and bonding it to flavin (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24  Mar 94).      This development has potential for various applications.  The  width of the new protein molecule is approximately one hundredth of  the circuit line width of a 64-megabit memory chip, which is  approximately 0.35-0.45 micron.  If artificial protein molecules are  integrated, a high density semiconductor element can be developed.  If photoelectric transfer characteristics that convert light energy  into electric energy and other functions that can detect  temperature, pressure, and ions are added to proteins, this  development can be applied to solar cells and image sensors of a  camera.  Since integration of proteins is still considered  technologically difficult, commercialization of the technology by  its application to sensors is expected before development of a  semiconductor (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94).      The two companies that developed the protein, Suntory Ltd. and  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. teamed their expertise in different  fields, biotechnology and electronic technology respectively.  They  started research cooperation three years ago.  The basic research  institute of Suntory (Teruo Amachi, Director) has conducted research  on proteins that have heme structure and searched for opportunities  to apply the research results to new fields outside its specialties,  which include the production of liquor, food, and pharmaceuticals.  The central research institute of Mitsubishi Electric (Tamotsu  Nomaguchi, Director) has conducted research on making a molecular  device with biomaterials since 1984.  In the future, the two  companies plan to develop a biochip simulating information  processing mechanism of organisms by combining molecules that have  various functions (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 APR 94, NIKKEI SANGYO  SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94).

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Graystone turns in Pounds 4.13m Graystone, the engineering company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.13m on turnover of Pounds 36.2m for the first half. In the comparative period, the group was known as Ptarmigan Holdings and was a mini-conglomerate with interests which included flowers, hotels and sausage skins. Profits then were Pounds 200,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 9.9m. Mr Dick Richardson, the chairman and chief executive who has overseen the metamorphosis - in operation, management and financial control - since his arrival in June 1992, said the results were the first with all the acquisitions in place. These included three engineering companies from Prospect Industries - which Mr Richardson originally floated out of Tace - Cableform and British Syphon Industries. He said that there were still non-core activities - two hotels and a publishing business - within Graystone, but that there were profitable and accounted for less than 2 per cent of group turnover. They would be sold when the right price was offered, he said. Borrowings of Pounds 4.1m at December 31 had been reduced to Pounds 1.2m at June 30 through the sale of non-core businesses. Mr Richardson expected that, thanks to the cash generative nature of the equipment and electrical distribution divisions, the group would be cash positive by the end of the year. The acquisitions contributed operating profits of Pounds 2.14m on turnover of Pounds 17.3m, while continuing operations made Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 714,000) on turnover of Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 8.98m). Exports were 'miniscule a year ago': now direct exports accounted for 12 to 14 per cent of turnover and indirect exports for about 25 per cent. Earnings per share were 1.45p (0.57p) and a final dividend of 0.14p is recommended for a total of 0.24p (nil).</p>

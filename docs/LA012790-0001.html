			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIT LIST OF BASES SPARKS FEAR, OUTRAGE  </P> <P> If the Defense Department shuts down the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, the closure  would not only eliminate the city's second-largest employer but also would  tarnish the image of one of the nation's premier Navy towns, officials and  workers said Friday.  </P> <P> The Defense Department has targeted more than 100 military installations for  possible closure or consolidation. Included are the 47-year-old Long Beach  shipyard, the Army's Ft. Ord on the Monterey Peninsula and at least four other  Northern California facilities.  </P> <P> San Diego County apparently will not only avoid any cutbacks but actually could  benefit from some of the potential closures or reductions throughout  California, members of the local congressional delegation said Friday. If some  of the recommended reductions on the list, scheduled to be released Monday by  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, are approved, military installations in San  Diego could pick up manpower and services, the local congressmen said.  </P> <P> However, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado), whose sprawling district includes one  targeted base in Imperial County, said Friday that he is more concerned over  the "big-picture national security implications" posed by the possible cutbacks  than enthused over any potential local dividends.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's appropriate for us in San Diego to gleefully rub our hands  together and try to figure out how somebody else's misfortune might accrue to  our benefit," Hunter said. "It's more important to look to the national  interest."  </P> <P> Elsewhere in California, word of the possible closures rattled nerves from Long  Beach to San Francisco, where an estimated 38,000 workers face possible  furlough, with dimmer prospects for new jobs as the defense budget shrinks.  </P> <P> Some workers at the Long Beach shipyard, where rumors of reductions have been  swirling for days, were near tears Friday.  </P> <P> "Some guys are really choked up," said Frank Griffin Sr., a sheet metal  mechanic at the yard for 25 years. "They are proud to work for their country,  and they expect a little loyalty from the government in return. For a 45- or  50-year-old guy to find out his job might be annihilated . . . it's a  frightening thing."  </P> <P> The three Northern California installations on the list for possible closure or  realignment are the Alameda Naval Depot and Oakland Naval Supply Center in  Alameda County and Moffett Naval Air Station in Santa Clara County.  </P> <P> Also on the list is El Centro's Naval Air Facility in Imperial County, which  has about 450 military and civilian personnel, according to Hunter. The winter  home of the Navy's precision Blue Angels flying team, the facility also serves  as a year-round staging base for desert gunnery ranges.  </P> <P> The Navy warned that it also would consider closing or realigning Treasure  Island Naval Station, Oak Knoll Naval Hospital and the Naval Air Station at  Alameda if Congress's budget authorizations are less than what has been  requested.  </P> <P> "If the base closed down, the only thing I could do is pack up the truck and go  home to Alabama -- and there's not much there," said Ronnie Phillips, 25, a  forklift operator at the Naval Supply Center in economically depressed West  Oakland.  </P> <P> Some elected officials expressed outrage over the threatened closure of the  Long Beach shipyard.  </P> <P> "If the Administration thinks they can do this without any impunity, they are  sadly mistaken," said Long Beach City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude. "The  popularity of this Administration is going to sink very quickly if they  indiscriminately close or try to relocate these facilities."  </P> <P> "I have said that I do not know why the Navy would even contemplate such a  misguided action against the most loyal Navy town in America," Rep. Anderson  said. "I simply do not understand the logic behind trying to close down the  most productive and efficient yard while keeping those yards losing money open.  </P> <P> The shipyard employs 4,100 workers who overhaul and maintain Navy surface  ships. It is the only West Coast base that is not licensed to perform nuclear  work, a factor that some officials believe helps explain it being targeting for  closure.  </P> <P> Closure of the shipyard would cost the community about $100 million a year and  an estimated $250 million in the Southern California region from spin-off jobs  and subcontracts that the Navy work generates, according to Laurie Hunter, vice  president of the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> In sheer numbers, the closures would be felt most in the San Francisco Bay  Area, where the Navy employs 56,000 civilians and military personnel. If all  the military bases named Friday were to be shut or realigned, 34,113 jobs would  be lost in the Bay Area. But economists said the impact would be worst on the  Monterey Peninsula, where Ft. Ord accounts for 15,129 military jobs, 3,000  civilian workers and an annual payroll of $317 million.  </P> <P> But, not everyone was upset by the possible closures in California.  </P> <P> Noting that "peace and prosperity can go hand in hand," Louise McNeilly,  coordinator of the Center for Economic Conversion in the Silicon Valley city of  Mountain View, said that closing the Moffett Naval Air Station there could free  up land to ease the area's housing shortage, or become the site of a space  museum or a garbage dump.  </P> <P> And the lucrative Port of Long Beach, bursting at the seams and hunting for  room to grow, could convert the precious shipyard land for container storage  space. The port is now looking at landfills to expand, at a cost of about half  a million dollars an acre. The shipyard space would represent more than  $1-billion worth of property, by some estimates.  </P> <P> "That would make one very nice terminal," said Harbor Commissioner Joel  Friedland. "But that is nothing compared to what a shipyard contributes to the  community."  </P> <P> Cutbacks at Long Beach, meanwhile, could mean more ship-repair work for San  Diego, while any reductions at Alameda's Naval Aviation Depot could produce  extra jobs at San Diego's North Island Naval Air Station, according to Hunter  aide John Palafoutas.  </P> <P> "I expect San Diego not only will hold its own, but come out a little ahead in  the game," said Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego).  </P> <P> Bates' comments echoed the earlier prediction of Rear Adm. John W. Adams,  commander of San Diego Naval Base, who said Thursday that the number of ships  based in San Diego could increase under the new defense budget.  </P> <P> "If you close home ports, ships will have to go somewhere, and San Diego is a  pretty logical place for them to come," Adams said.  </P> <P> In a scene likely to be repeated by other congressmen whose districts face  possible cutbacks, Hunter sent a letter to Cheney on Friday in which he began  to make a case for trying to prevent the closure of the Naval Air Facility in  El Centro.  </P> <P> Noting that the facility's remoteness and the area's weather -- last year there  were 360 "flying days" at the base -- make it ideal for training, Hunter argues  that closing it would be ill advised, both for economic and defense reasons.  Pilots from Miramar Naval Air Station often train in El Centro when bad weather  along the coast curtails flying here, he said.  </P> <P> "It's not wise to cut national defense, because that ignores the history of how  we got to where we are today," said Hunter, a member of the House Armed  Services Committee. "This 'peace dividend' talk is a misnomer. The fact is, we  have peace as a dividend because our national defense was strengthened during  the Reagan years."  </P> <P> But proponents of disarmament said that the cutbacks eventually will actually  improve the quality of life.  </P> <P> "We are pleased because it means there are less dangers to the citizens of Long  Beach and the surrounding area," said Harold Collins, chairman of the Long  Beach Area Peace Network, a coalition of 20 organizations. "We have never  fought against the Navy, just ships and nuclear weapons."  </P> <P> Fiore reported from Los Angeles and Morain from San Francisco.

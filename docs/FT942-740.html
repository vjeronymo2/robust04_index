			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Technology: Smile, you're being digitalised - The prospects for cameras that need neither film nor developing are assessed Imagine it is 2005 and you have just returned from a holiday in Hawaii. You have taken all your photos with no film; no developing is necessary. You simply hook up the camera to your computer and begin looking at the pictures on your screen. It was cloudy while you were there, so you digitally add in some sun. You did not make it to the volcano, but create a picture of yourself in front of one, just for show. Then you modem the pictures to your envious brother in Hong Kong. This is the world that digital camera manufacturers are trying to create. Professionals and businesses are already making use of the devices, which can be cheaper than traditional cameras to operate and produce photographs that can be manipulated easily. Digital cameras are moving rapidly into the mass market, too. In March, Apple Computer launched QuickTake 100, a digital camera aimed at the consumer market, which retails for about Dollars 750. Two smaller California-based manufacturers, Dycam and Logitech, have launched similarly priced products. Sony of Japan already sells digital cameras, priced at about Dollars 2,000 or more, to the professional and small business market, and hopes to introduce a mass market version in the next few years. 'Digital cameras will replace a large part of the traditional camera market over the next decade,' predicts Alexis Gerard, managing editor of Future Image newsletter, an imaging publication. 'That's because ultimately it will be cheaper to use - no film or developing costs are involved - and cheaper to produce because the only moving part on the digital camera is the shutter. Digital cameras resolve certain storage problems as everything can be saved on computer. They also allow images to be sent by modem easily from one computer to another. 'Whenever you digitalise something, it becomes more flexible,' says Charles Lee, chief executive officer of GTE, the telecommunications group. 'You can store it, send it. For that reason, digital cameras will eventually be an important part of the information superhighway.' Digital cameras do have drawbacks, however. The easy exchange of images through the information superhighway depends just as much on the construction of that network as on wide acceptance of digital cameras. Moreover, as all 'ordinary' photographs can be digitalised, through the extra step of scanning the image, traditional cameras can be made part of the information superhighway. Cost is also a barrier. Although the absence of film and developing expense can make the digital camera cheaper in the long run, a hefty initial investment is still required. The lowest priced digital camera is about Dollars 750 - and that is before buying other hardware. Users must have access to a computer that can read the digital images, and to a sophisticated printer. Images also need to be improved if digital devices are to pose a real threat to the traditional camera market. 'One of the barriers to building the market is the quality of the image,' says Michael Baron, vice president of business systems for the digital camera division of Sony. 'With smaller photos, most people can't tell the difference between the (traditional) chemical and the digital product. But weaknesses are accented when you move to larger sizes.' Technology is moving rapidly to break down these hurdles. One of the most expensive inputs in a digital camera is the cost of the chips, dubbed 'charge-coupled devices', and their price is coming down fast. 'We hope to bring the price of a digital camera for the consumer market down to about Dollars 350 within the next few years,' says Peter Zan, product manager for Apple's QuickTake. Dycam says its next model, to be launched early next year, will offer features such as interchangeable lenses. Manufacturers are working to make the camera compatible with a larger number of computers, and special printers are being developed for the market. The digital camera works in the following way. By pressing the shutter, the user stores the picture in flash memory, and the image is compressed. The camera is then connected to a computer through a cable. The picture is decompressed and appears on the screen. Despite problems, digital cameras are making inroads into the small business market. The camera is especially cost-effective for photographs being reproduced many times. Chemically developed images are expensive to reproduce, but thousands of digital images can be run off cheaply. Estate agents, for instance, could use the camera to provide photographs of houses for mass mailings; and business cards with photographs can be made at low cost. Digital cameras are certain to encounter resistance in their push to replace traditional versions. Consumers are used to the old film-based devices, and will probably be reluctant to change. Professional photographers, morever, have been trained in chemical processes and may have difficulties switching to a technique that requires completely different skills, including computer knowledge. 'The main hurdle right now is user acceptance,' says Sony's Baron. 'It is very hard to change old habits, so we have to give people a very good reason to do it. The technology has either to offer a price advantage that will be hard to resist or produce something so superior that people will want to switch to it. Those days may be here eventually, but they are not here yet.'</p>

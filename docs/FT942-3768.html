			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: SNP describe themselves as 'big winners' Scotland looked likely to provide the Labour party with its only loss in the European elections even though the party took half the votes north of the border. The Scottish National party was predicted to take the North-East Scotland seat where the result is due to be declared later today. A BBC projection on the basis of the six Scottish results declared overnight put Labour at 50 per cent of the vote, the SNP at 26 per cent, the Tories at 14 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 6 per cent. The two remaining seats - Highlands and Islands, which the SNP is expected to hold, and North-East Scotland - are not counted until the daytime. The Tories, who held no Scottish seats in the previous European parliament, saw their share of the vote slump to 14 per cent, down from 20 per cent in 1989. The nationalists claimed they would reach the crucial 30 per cent mark beyond which they could expect huge gains in a Westminster election. 'This is a watershed moment in Scottish politics; a breakthrough in the campaign for Scottish independence,' said Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader. 'In this campaign we won the argument; now we are emerging as the big winners at the ballot box.' Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, described the night as a 'humiliation for the government and a triumph for Labour'. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalists, moved into second place in the Labour-held seat of North Wales. Among the other parties, the Greens saw the greatest loss of support, down from the 15 per cent they achieved in the 1989 European elections to about 3 per cent.</p>

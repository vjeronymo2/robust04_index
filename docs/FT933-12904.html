			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Coca-Cola signs Dollars 24m Vietnam deal - Joint venture hangs on lifting of embargo by Clinton administration COCA-COLA has struck a Dollars 24.5m (Pounds 16.3m) deal to produce soft drinks in Vietnam as soon as the US trade embargo is lifted, challenging its rival Pepsi-Cola in the struggle for a fast-developing market of nearly 70m people. A contract to form a joint venture has been signed by Coca-Cola Indochina, a company comprising bottlers F&amp;N Coca-Cola of Singapore and Thai Pure Drinks, and Chuong Duong Beverage Factory, a former Coca-Cola bottler now controlled by the ministry of light industry. The money will be spent only if the Clinton administration lifts the embargo, which could happen before the end of the year. US companies are already allowed to sign - but not execute - Vietnamese contracts, and this month Washington stopped blocking Vietnam's attempts to borrow from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders. Much of Coca-Cola's investment will go towards modernising Chuong Duong's factory in Ho Chi Minh City. More than 500m bottles of Coca-Cola a year were sold before the north's war with the US and its south Vietnamese allies. Pepsi-Cola and its partner International Beverage Company, a combination of Singaporean investors and Vietnamese local government organisations, have already announced plans for a Dollars 10m investment in Vietnam. Pepsi officials say they could start production at a modern Ho Chi Minh City factory within two weeks of the embargo being lifted; IBC already produces Cadbury Schweppes carbonated drinks at the plant. Miss Vietnam, 17-year-old Ms Ha Kien Anh, is to feature in Pepsi television commercials that will be shot soon in Bangkok. Pepsi has stolen a march on Coca-Cola in establishing bottling facilities in both Burma and Cambodia, but Coca-Cola is a better known name than Pepsi in much of south-east Asia, especially Vietnam. Thousands of cases of canned Coca-Cola are smuggled into Vietnam and Cambodia from neighbouring countries.</p>

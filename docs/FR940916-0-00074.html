Family Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this rule will have only an indirect, though beneficial, impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, since it would encourage, when funds are appropriated for this purpose, expenditures in the affected housing for increases in security expenses, and operating, maintenance and capital repair costs primarily due to drug-related criminal activity. The rule, thus, is not subject to review under the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary by his approval of this rule for publication hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It allows HUD to approve rent adjustments to private owners for substantial general increases in security expenses, and operating, maintenance and capital repair costs primarily due to drug-related criminal activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E.

Subject to appropriations, a special adjustment may also be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD when HUD determines that a project is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent, and not specific to a particular project, and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity. HUD may, on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the current gross rents for each unit size under a Housing Assistance Payments Contract, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs and reserves required for the Owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to HUD for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Prior to approval of a special adjustment to cover the cost of physical improvements, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The aforementioned special rent adjustments will only be approved if and to the extent the Owner clearly demonstrates that these general increases have caused increases in the owners operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by annual adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The Owner must submit financial information to the PHA which clearly supports the increase. For Contracts of more than twenty units, the Owner must submit audited financial information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB approval number 2577&hyph;0196)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph Shuldiner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22972 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;33&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

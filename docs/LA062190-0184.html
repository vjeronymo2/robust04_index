			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYSINGER WILL COACH BEVERLY HILLS FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Carter Paysinger, a longtime Beverly Hills High assistant football and baseball  coach, was named Tuesday as the school's new head football coach. Paysinger  succeeds Co-Coaches Dick Billingsley and Bill Stansbury, who have resigned to  accept head coaching positions at Oak Park High and Paso Robles High  respectively.  </P> <P> "That's the best thing for the program, because there will be continuity,"  Stansbury said. "They will run the same offense and defense. Had they brought  in somebody new, it would be extremely difficult to learn a whole new offense  and defense in such a short time."  </P> <P> Stansbury believes Paysinger has many attributes to become a successful head  coach.  </P> <P> "He's very bright, personable, has excellent rapport with athletes and is a  very knowledgeable football person," Stansbury said.  </P> <P> In two respects, Paysinger's appointment is unprecedented. He becomes the first  walk-on head football coach at Beverly Hills. He is also believed to be the  first alumnus to become head football coach.  </P> <P> Paysinger was a faculty member until taking a leave of absence at the start of  the school year to enter private business. He did remain a member of the  coaching staff.  </P> <P> "It is not a concern of mine at this time," Principal Ben Bushman said of  Paysinger's walk-on status. "I don't consider him a walk-on because he's been a  full-time staff member.  </P> <P> "He has been one of the integral members of our staff, and when he decided to  come back, we decided to have him. In every sport he's coached here, he's done  an outstanding job."  </P> <P> Bushman was Beverly Hills' football coach during Paysinger's playing career as  a wide receiver and defensive back.  </P> <P> "I remember him as being very dedicated and a smart player," Bushman said.  "He's studied the game and knows it well."  </P> <P> Paysinger inherits a team that was 3-7 last season, with three of the losses  coming by forfeit during the teachers strike.  </P> <P> Paysinger's brothers Vonzie and Donald, who were both football and baseball  stars at Beverly Hills, will serve as assistant coaches.  </P></p>

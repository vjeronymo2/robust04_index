			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KNICKS' WOES CONTINUE TO EXPAND  </P> <P> Even a threatened shakeup could not snap the New York Knicks out of their worst  slump of the season.  </P> <P> The Knicks, not so long ago considered a threat to the Detroit Pistons' crown,  were beaten by Orlando, 121-118, Tuesday night at New York.  </P> <P> Before losing their fourth in a row, the Knicks built a 12-point lead in the  third quarter. The Magic ended a nine-game losing streak and an 11-game road  streak.  </P> <P> This loss and the previous two by a team that was playing so well early in the  season that they won 22 of their first 24 at home, are hard to explain. Last  Thursday, they were humiliated by the other expansion team, Minnesota, 102-82.  Saturday night, Milwaukee, missing three of its best players, won handily at  New York.  </P> <P> The Magic had several stars, not the least of whom was Scott Skiles. Skiles had  his first triple-double: 23 points, 12 rebounds and 17 assists. Michael Ansley  had all 16 of his points in the fourth quarter when the Magic came from seven  points behind. Nick Anderson scored 29 points.  </P> <P> As usual, Patrick Ewing led the Knicks. Coming back from a first-quarter ankle  injury, the center had 17 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The Knicks trail Philadelphia by a game in the Atlantic Division they have led  almost all season. They are only a game ahead of third-place Boston.  </P> <P> "These are games we're supposed to win and build some momentum for the  playoffs," said Ewing, who had only four points in the first half. "But I'm  very disappointed in the way things are going."  </P> <P> Before the game, General Manager Al Bianchi gave first-year Coach Stu Jackson a  vote of confidence. Unless the Knicks straighten out soon, it may be withdrawn.  </P> <P> Skiles was given his chance because guards Reggie Theus and Sam Vincent are  hurt. Skiles played the entire 48 minutes and didn't have a turnover.  </P> <P> Portland 120, Houston 110 -- Clyde Drexler is doing his part in the Trail  Blazers' drive to overtake the Lakers.  </P> <P> He scored eight of his 41 points in the last three minutes at Houston and had  16 rebounds to lead the Blazers to their 10th in a row.  </P> <P> The Rockets, in danger of missing the playoffs despite the presence of one of  the NBA's great players, Akeem Olajuwon, built a 14-point lead in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> San Antonio 128, Seattle 106 -- There are seven teams in the NBA with winning  records on the road, five of them in the West.  </P> <P> With successive wins at Phoenix and Seattle, the Spurs, bouncing back after a  mild slump, are one of them at 18-16.  </P> <P> David Robinson scored 20 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs  romped and pulled to within 2 1/2 games of Utah in the Midwest Division.  </P> <P> Detroit 117, Milwaukee 96 -- It just keeps getting easier for the NBA champion  Pistons.  </P> <P> With James Edwards getting 21 points in 29 minutes, the Pistons took command  early in the second quarter against the crippled Bucks and were never in danger  at Auburn Hills, Mich.  </P> <P> The Pistons have won 12 in a row and 25 of their last 26 games.  </P> <P> The Bucks, playing without their two big men, Jack Sikma and Greg Anderson,  jumped in front, 29-21, in the first half, but were out of it by halftime,  trailing, 57-41. They were only five for 23 in the second period.  </P> <P> Chicago 122, Washington 97 -- Michael Jordan, playing one of his infrequent  poor games, sent out a call for help in the third quarter at Chicago.  </P> <P> Scottie Pippen and rookie Stacy King answered the call and the Bulls broke open  a tight game.  </P> <P> Pippen made two free throws to break a 75-75 tie late in the third period and  King ignited a 12-4 run with a resounding dunk to start the last quarter.  </P> <P> Jordan had 21 points on eight-of-19 shooting. Pippen and King each had 24  points.  </P> <P> Indiana 112, Miami 98 -- Detlef Schrempf scored 20 of his career-high 29 points  in the first half at Miami as the Pacers snapped a five-game losing streak with  an easy win.  </P> <P> Golden State 105, Minnesota 101 -- Mitch Richmond had 18 of his 24 points in  the second half at Oakland and the Warriors ended a two-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Warriors were without Chris Mullin, who has a virus.  </P> <P> Tony Campbell scored 34 for Minnesota.

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Amsterdam SE to delist shares in Daf SHARES in Daf, the Dutch truckmaker which collapsed under the weight of its debts in early 1993, are to be delisted from the Amsterdam stock exchange on September 1, with official trading to end on August 31, the bourse said yesterday. The move follows repeated assertions from the receivers that shareholders could not expect to receive anything for their shares, which are now quoted at just Fl 0.45, compared with their flotation price of Fl 47 per share in mid-1989. Daf was resurrected in slimmed-down form as Daf Trucks in March. The company is held privately by shareholders who include the Dutch state, the Flemish regional government of Belgium, and a number of institutional shareholders. The decision to halt trading means that the expiration date of October call and put options on Amsterdam's European options exchange will also be brought forward to August 31. However, Daf's 1988 6 3/4 per cent bonds will continue to be traded on the bourse on an over-the-counter basis. A group of bondholders has said it will undertake legal action to press for damages against the issue's lead-manager, ABN Amro Bank, and the trustee. The bonds, with a nominal value of Fl 1,000, have recently been quoted at around Fl 25.</p>

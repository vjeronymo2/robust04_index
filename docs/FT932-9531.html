			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Bankers share the blame for debacle IT IS no mean feat for a company to come so close to seeking protection from its creditors within less than 15 months of reporting profits of Dollars 279m (Pounds 181m). But GPA is no ordinary undertaking; and the fact that it rose so far and fell so fast owes as much to the bizarre decisions of its bankers as to the mistakes of the man-agement, headed by the founder, entrepreneur Mr Tony Ryan. GPA took off on the basis of a classic market opportunity. In the recession of the early 1980s, after the huge increase in fuel prices that followed the second oil shock, airlines were financially stretched. In the US their problems were compounded by deregulation. Aircraft manufacturers found their order flow shrinking at an alarming rate. For GPA and other companies in the operating lease business, this meant that aircraft were available cheaply and airlines welcomed new sources of off-balance sheet finance. Mr Ryan and his Shannon-based team seized the opportunity just in time for the economic upturn. What might have been a viable operation in the long run then became something altogether more dangerous, as Mr Ryan's ambition coincided with the urgent need of big international banks to find new clients. In the aftermath of the Latin American debt crisis, the banks found their credit ratings were lower than those of their big corporate clients, who promptly decided to cut out the banking middlemen and go direct to the markets for funds. In their search for replacement business, the banks turned to higher-risk lending in areas such as leveraged takeovers, property and aircraft leasing. At the same time, the Japanese banks, which came to account for 38 per cent of GPA's credit facilities by 1990, were seeking to internationalise their operations. Aggressive accounting (whereby profits on the sale and leaseback of aircraft were taken immediately instead of being spread over the term of the lease) combined with a veritable cascade of bank money, helped GPA's pre-tax profits rise from Dollars 17.4m in 1985 to Dollars 279m in 1992, an astonishing figure for a business that employed little more than 300 people. But the risks were mounting phenomenally, as the fleet of aircraft owned by GPA rose from 40 to 400 in the same period. Among those risks were: Operational gearing in the market itself. Analysts estimated at the end of the 1980s that every 0.5 per cent variation in the growth of demand for aircraft between 1990 and 2000 would lead to a variation in the worldwide fleet, needed to satisfy that demand, of 700 aircraft - this on a total jet fleet at the time of 8,300. Given that GPA's profits and solvency hinged substan-tially on making sound judgments about the balance of supply and demand in the aircraft market, the impli-cit leverage was potentially lethal. Mismatching of costs and revenues. GPA's operating leases with airlines mainly ran for five to seven years, which was much less than the life of the aircraft. If the leases fell in, or were terminated when demand was weak, GPA, the owner, could find itself paying financing and other costs on aircraft that were not producing revenue. Weak residual values of aircraft. Since GPA became increasingly dependent for its profits on the sale and leaseback of aircraft, any decline in values was threatening. It would also reduce collateral for further finance and deter investment demand. Lack of creditworthiness of many airlines, both in the US and the Third World. With so many inherent hazards in the business, GPA needed a substantial cushion of equity to help minimise risks. Instead the banks permitted a degree of financial gearing that looked absurd long before the company ran into trouble. In the five years before the abortive attempt to float the company last year, GPA's liabilities soared from Dollars 892m to a stunning Dollars 5.3bn. Share capital and reserves in 1992 of Dollars 1.2bn were dwarfed by firm commitments to buy aircraft in future years of Dollars 9.4bn, plus options to purchase a further Dollars 8bn more. GPA thus found itself trying to make an international offer of equity shares last year with a prospectus that baldly stated that 'there can be no assurance . . . that adequate sources of capital will be available to fund the group's aircraft purchase commitments.' This was, in short, a spectacular banking aberration. Rarely can so much have been borrowed by so few, on the basis of so insubstantial a balance sheet. Yet the principles involved bear some similarity to those that prevailed in the British fringe banking fiasco of the mid-1970s. Then, the Bank of England instructed the clearing banks to reduce their lending to an overheated property market. But the banks simply lent more to the secondary banking system, which promptly ploughed money into speculative developments at the peak of the market. The clearing banks thus suffered huge provisions and write-offs when property prices fell and the fringe collapsed. By the same token, the existence in the 1980s of aircraft leasing companies  -specialist fringe financiers - made it easier for the banks to convince themselves that they were not exposing themselves to the obvious risks of the overstretched airline companies. They took comfort from residual aircraft values at the end of the lease. Yet the risks have come home to roost nonetheless. One of the more remarkable things in all this is that GPA's management has succeeded in keeping the proportion of non-revenue earning aircraft in its fleet to surprisingly low levels, given the weak market. Yet the immensity of the financial burden has made a nonsense of the effort. And GPA's financial crisis is now compounded by the fact that its business is so structured that any slow down has penal consequences. Large discounts and credits received from aircraft manufacturers become repayable where GPA goes back on its purchase commitments. In selling aircraft to in-vestors, it has guaranteed to meet a proportion of any shortfall against stipulated values on subsequent sale of the aircraft. And since many investors bought aircraft from GPA on the basis of undertakings that the leasing company would remarket the aircraft in due course, GPA's ability to sell aircraft will be substantially damaged if investors conclude that its survival, and its ability to fulfil the undertakings, are threatened by the present financial upheaval. The American humourist Ogden Nash once remarked that bankers are like everyone else, except richer. As one City wag remarked: Should he have said stupider?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GPA GROUP: UP, UP AND AWAY. . .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1975    GPA Group founded by Tony Ryan, a former middle manager with Aer         Lingus, with dollars 50,000 of capital.

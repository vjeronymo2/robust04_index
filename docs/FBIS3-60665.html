A Foreign Office  spokesman said in Islamabad today that Pakistan views the  Pressler Amendment as a discriminatory law. He said Senator  Pressler is likely to visit Pakistan by the middle of this  month, and Pakistan will try to put across its point of view on  the discriminatory nature of this law.    Replying to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan is  continuously negotiating with different governments on different  means to achieve the objectives of nonproliferation in South  Asia,. He, however, said Pakistan has not received any specific  proposal from the United States recently.</p>

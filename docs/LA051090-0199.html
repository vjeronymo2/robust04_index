			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> COUNTY OFFICE IN SOUTH MAY OPEN  </P> <P> Orange County supervisors will discuss next week establishing a special South  County office that will offer an array of services, from answering questions  about parcel maps to performing marriages, according to a report released  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "As South County continues to grow, South County residents are finding it more  difficult to travel to the Santa Ana Civic Center to conduct routine county  business," says the report, which was written by officials in the county  assessor's office.  </P> <P> "Residents are faced with increasing traffic congestion, long commute trips and  limited public parking."  </P> <P> Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley, whose districts include South  County, for months have lobbied to create better services in that area.  Vasquez, who recently established constituent offices in Mission Viejo and  Brea, said Wednesday he welcomes the report's recommendations.  </P> <P> "I think it's an indicator of things to come," Vasquez said. "The time has come  for us to start decentralizing the services that we offer."  </P> <P> The new South County office could open as soon as June and would give area  residents easier access to county records, as well as walk-in service for  questions regarding such things as parcel maps, tax assessment rolls and  general information concerning building codes.  </P> <P> It would cost the county $399,660 to establish the office and purchase  furniture for it. After the first year, it would cost $138,600 to keep the  lease on the 7,000-square-foot space, at 24422 Avenida de la Carlotta in Laguna  Hills.  </P> <P> In addition to its drier, more bureaucratic functions, the office would serve a  more romantic one as well: It would be able to issue marriage licenses and even  perform marriage ceremonies.  </P> <P> "Knowing South County as I do, I'm sure there will be a demand for that  service," Vasquez said.

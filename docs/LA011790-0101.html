			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOT GUNS: No one wants to talk about it officially but Orange County Sheriff's  Department investigators are scrambling to explain an embarrassing theft of  guns from their training academy in Orange. . . . The heist, which one source  said involved as many as 42 handguns, took place about two weeks ago. Then,  sources say, at least four people were arrested in a bust that took place  shortly before midnight last Wednesday at the Best Western Stardust Motel in  Anaheim. . . . Next step: sheriff's officials meet this morning to determine  the status of the investigation. Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / European Bonds: Focus on Danish treaty referendum ATTENTION in the European government bond markets will focus on this week's Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Although the referendum is tomorrow, the results will not been known until Wednesday. As it is seen as one of the biggest potential obstacles to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, a vote in favour would set an important precedent for the other member countries, which must decide on whether to ratify the treaty. Opinion polls over the last few weeks have shown a slight majority for the 'no' votes; as a result the yields on Danish government bonds widened against those on German paper. However, an opinion poll on Tuesday showing a swing in favour of Maastricht for the first time in nearly a month prompted a sharp rally in the Danish bond market on Wednesday. The rally came in a week when various holidays kept the other European government bond markets quiet. A Gallup poll on Friday showed an even stronger swing. If Denmark votes in favour of Maastricht on Tuesday it will pave the way for Danish yield convergence, and Danish government bond yield spreads over German bunds would start to narrow again. S. G. Warburg points out that 10-year yield spreads could narrow by a further 20 basis points. It says a 'yes' vote in Denmark would probably be 'a major signal to start building up exposure in Sweden and Finland', the two Nordic neighbours which have applied to join the EC. The Anglo-Saxon government bond markets showed the best returns in local currency terms last month, according to Kemper Investment Management. Canada was the top-performing market, reporting a 3.23 per cent increase, followed by the US and the UK with gains of 2.27 per cent and 2.23 per cent respectively. For dollar-based investors, Japan showed the highest return, with a rise of 5.41 per cent last month.</p>

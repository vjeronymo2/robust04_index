			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Money supply spectre haunts the ambitious Bundesbank - But M3 goals will not be dropped easily THE Bundesbank may come to be haunted by its ambitious money supply targets. On the one hand, they are fundamental to its monetary policies, intended to curb inflation. On the other, they have led to interest rates which are damagingly high for the rest of Europe and could even harm the slackening domestic economy. The latest figures have caught the central bank rather on the hop. When Mr Helmut Schlesinger, its president, announced cuts in German interest rates two weeks ago - as part of a limited currency realignment - he also held out the possibility that money supply figures would look a little better after the 8.5 per cent annualised expansion of July. Yesterday, however, the bank said M3, the broad monetary indicator, had advanced at an annual rate of 9 per cent in August, with bank lending continuing to move along rapidly. The Bundesbank has set an ambitious target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent for M3 this year. As Mr Schlesinger has ruefully admitted, there is no chance of this being reached. Nonetheless, the Bundesbank is not about to abandon its targets lightly. Even though the figures did not bear out Mr Schlesinger's hope that M3 expansion may have since been 'somewhat less' than in July, it still aims to rein back money supply to a speed which will inhibit future inflation. If it succeeds, interest rates will come down further. The question is when. In view of the unprecedented turbulence on foreign exchange markets in the past few weeks, the Bundesbank's targeting of money supply has, not surprisingly, been the subject of considerable argument. Should the Bundesbank relax its adherence to M3 at such a complex time, which includes the manifold strains of unification, or should it stick to this indicator as one of the only real yardsticks it has? 'In the past,' says Mr Thomas Mayer, an economist at the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, 'M3 has shown its quality as a leading indicator of inflation'. Now, it is less easy to state whether it remains reliable. But he asserts: 'If there is any doubt, the Bundesbank has the duty to err on the side of caution and stability'. Its legal duty, after all, is to maintain price stability. This is what the Bundesbank has been very successful in doing over the past four decades; annual inflation has never exceeded 7 per cent. But then came reunification, a generous conversion rate for East German Marks into D-Marks, and the immense cost of shoring up east German living standards while the economy was put through the immense trauma of moving from a communist system to the free market. Much of the extra growth in money supply reflects this process. Bank lending, a large part going to finance investment in the east, has risen rapidly, with annualised growth of 11 per cent over the past six months. Although this rate is slightly less than in some months this year, 'it is still far too high', says Mr Paul Brunker, economist with Robert Fleming in London. 'I would have expected this to have come down faster.' Much of the investment going into east Germany is helped by special credits and soft lending, rendering it insensitive to changes in interest rates. This worries the Bundesbank, though such spending will eventually contribute to economic growth and create jobs. 'If the money goes into capital investment, it will be less inflationary', adds Mr Brunker. 'But some must be potentially inflationary.' Among the strongly dissenting voices on the Bundesbank's monetary policies is the DIW economic institute in Berlin. The Bundesbank took a roasting from the DIW in July when it was accused of possibly becoming 'a slave of its own money supply concept'. The institute said bank credits for east German investment were highly necessary, and actually still too low. Moreover, they would inhibit inflation over the medium term by adding to production. So far, the Bundesbank has shown little sign of taking any notice. Wedded to price stability, it has always kept policy tight when this objective has been threatened. Only an easing of M3 growth, or immense foreign and domestic political pressure, allied to further foreign exchange upsets, are likely to persuade it otherwise.</p>

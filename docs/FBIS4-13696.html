			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 21, IRNA -- Initial investigations  into a bomb explosion in Tehran on Tuesday show that saboteurs  infiltrating into Iran from Iraq were behind the blast, an  informed source told IRNA Thursday. Members of Iraq-based  terrorist Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) have frequently  used the bases and facilities put at their disposal by the Iraqi  regime for carrying out terrorist acts inside Iran.    "Some clues have been obtained in connection with the bomb  explosion at the corner of Sa'di and Enqelab streets (in central  Tehran)," the source said.    Some 13 people were injured and five cars destroyed when a  percussion bomb went off in rush hours Tuesday. A few hours  after the bomb blast, the terrorist grouplet in a hasty reaction  contacted the Italian news agency (ANSA), AFP and ASSOCIATED  PRESS to deny its involvement in the terrorist act.    Over the past month, MKO in 23 radio contacts monitored by  an  IRNA office near Iran-Iraq border instructed its members to  carry out sabotage and arson attacks on Iranian soil.</p>

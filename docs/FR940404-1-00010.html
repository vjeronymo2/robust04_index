Lots that are exempt from maturity requirements of the import regulations would not be subject to the inspection and certification requirements in such regulations. An imported lot intended for normal commercial channels, or any portion of such a lot, that fails established maturity requirements, could be disposed of in exempt outlets, as specified in the pertinent avocado import requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third copy of the form would accompany the exempt lot to its intended destination. The receiver would certify that the lot has been received and it will be utilized in an exempt outlet. After the certification is signed by the receiver, the form would be returned to MOAB by the receiver, within 15 days of receipt of the lot. The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0167.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the USTR has concurred with the issuance of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule reflects the Department's appraisal of the need to reinstate the suspended avocado import maturity requirements and make the specified changes in the avocado import maturity requirements, as hereinafter set forth, in accordance with section 8e of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 944  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Avocados, Food grades and standards, Grapefruit, Grapes, Imports, Kiwifruit, Limes, Olives, Oranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 944 is proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

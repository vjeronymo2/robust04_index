			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALAMO;  </P> <P> AFTERSHOCKS CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE  </P> <P> Inspectors found toppled chimneys and minor structural cracks Saturday in an  area on the east side of San Francisco Bay rocked by two moderate earthquakes.  </P> <P> The jolts, which struck along the southern end of the small Concord fault  Friday night, measured 4.6 and 4.3 and were followed by several smaller  temblors, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. USGS geologist Rick Lester  said the quakes were considered aftershocks from a similar jolt April 6, which  has been followed by a swarm of about 300 tiny temblors. "This could go on for  a couple of weeks or stop abruptly," said Lester, adding that a similar  sequence in the area in 1970 lasted for several months.  </P></p>

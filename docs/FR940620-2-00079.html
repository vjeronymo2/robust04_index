			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. The Adviser will administer the investments of the Joint Account as part of its duty under its existing or any future investment advisory contracts with each Fund and will not collect any additional fee for the management of the Joint Account. (The Adviser will collect fees in accordance with each Fund's respective investment advisory agreement.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Governing Boards of the Funds will adopt procedures pursuant to which the Joint Account will operate, which will be reasonably designed to provide that the requirements of the application will be met. Each of the Governing Boards will make and approve such changes as it deems necessary to ensure that such procedures are followed. In addition, the Governing Boards will determine, no less frequently than annually, that the Joint Account has been operated in accordance with such procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The administration of the Joint Account will be within the fidelity bond coverage required by section 17(g) of the Act and rule 17g&hyph;1 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Short-Term Investments held through the Joint Account generally will not be sold prior to maturity except: (i) If the Adviser believes the security no longer presents minimal credit risk; (ii) in the case of commercial paper of Tax-Exempt Securities, if as a result of a credit downgrading or otherwise, the security no longer satisfies the investment criteria of all Funds participating in that investment; or (iii) in the case of a repurchase agreement, if the counterparty defaults. A Fund may, however, sell its fractional portion of a Short-Term Investment prior to the maturity of the investment if the cost of such transaction will be borne solely by the selling Fund and the transaction would not adversely affect the other Funds participating in the Short-Term Investment. In no case would an early termination by less than all participating Funds be permitted if it would reduce the principal amount or yield received by other Funds participating in a particular Short-Term Investment or otherwise adversely affect the other participating Funds. Each Fund participating in the Short-Term Investment will be deemed to have consented to such sale and partition of the Short-Term Investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Any Short-Term Investment held through the Joint Account with a remaining maturity of more than seven days will be considered illiquid and, for any fund that is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act, subject to the restriction that the Fund may not invest more than 15% (or such other percentage as set forth by the Commission from time to time) of its net assets in illiquid securities, if the Fund cannot sell its fractional interest in the Short-Term Investment pursuant to the requirements described in the preceding condition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

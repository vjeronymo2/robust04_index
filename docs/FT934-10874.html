			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tarmac's recuperation at a critical point - The troubled construction group's progress on the road to profit THE RECUPERATION of Tarmac, the lossmaking construction and building materials group, has reached a crucial point. The announcement on Monday of plans to float off its Ruberoid roofing materials subsidiary marks the end of a period of surgery during which Mr Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive, will have raised almost Pounds 300m by disposing of unwanted businesses. The next step will be to see how Tarmac's remaining interests perform as the construction market, particularly housebuilding in the UK, begins to improve. The group has savagely reduced costs and made substantial write-downs as it has fought to regain financial health. Net borrowings at the end of last year - including Tarmac's share of off-balance sheet finance of Pounds 100m and Pounds 99.3m of auction market preferred stock - stood at Pounds 677m, equivalent to 73 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 924m. This is expected to fall to about Pounds 260m, compared with increased shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.05bn, should Ruberoid raise Pounds 70m as expected, and following Tarmac's Pounds 215m rights issue. To continue the medical metaphor: the patient is recovered enough to get out of bed but it remains to be seen if he will ever run again. Tarmac's rise and fall has been dramatic. Between 1978 and 1988 its annual pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 393m. Last year, after write-downs, it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 350.3m. The key to Tarmac's future will be the strength of its housebuilding operations, says Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst for SG Warburg Securities, the company's broker. He estimates that capital employed by Tarmac in housebuilding has fallen from a peak of Pounds 750m at the end of 1988 to about Pounds 250m now. Overhead costs in the housing division have fallen from more than Pounds 70m annually to an estimated Pounds 50m this year. Tarmac is already beginning to reap the benefit from this improved efficiency. Net margins on house sales are thought to be about 8 per cent this year compared with a low of 2.5 per cent in the first six months of 1992. Annual output of homes, however, has fallen from a peak of 12,000 in the late 1980s to an estimated 7,500 this year. This total is expected to rise again as the housing market continues its recent recovery. Tarmac will therefore need to use its renewed financial strength to replace its stock of housing land. Elsewhere prospects look less bright. Tarmac's strategy is to concentrate on the three core businesses of housebuilding, construction and quarry products. These last two show limited prospects for improvement, with little recovery expected in construction output outside of housebuilding. Competition for work could become even more intense if the government cuts road building and other large scale infrastructure projects in its unified budget later this month. Cuts in public sector transport and housing investment might also have a detrimental effect on attempts by the big quarry companies - Tarmac, Redland and RMC - to force through higher prices. A cause of the group's collapse was its failure to recognise the intensity and duration of the recession. This meant that management was slow to rein back housing land purchases and investment in commercial property development when property values fell sharply. Tarmac has now announced a complete withdrawal from commercial property development. It has also sold a large part of its Econowaste waste disposal operations along with other peripheral businesses, some of them expensively acquired in the mid to late 1980s. Still to be decided is the future of two other businesses described by Mr Simms as 'non-core'. These are the building materials division, which manufactures bricks and concrete blocks, and the US aggregates and concrete operations in Florida and the Carolinas. The recent decision by Tarmac to swap its clay tile operations for the brick making interests of rival building materials group Marley is seen by some as a prelude to a sale by Tarmac of the entire enlarged brick business. It may, however, decide to keep, or even expand, its US interests, given the recent improvement in the outlook for the US economy. Warburg is forecasting another pre-tax loss of up to Pounds 20m for this year after further goodwill write-offs, mainly against Ruberoid which was acquired for Pounds 141.3m in 1988. The investment bank, however, is forecasting a return to profits of Pounds 95m for Tarmac next year, rising to Pounds 150m in 1995. Tarmac's share price since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September has more than doubled from 61p to 135p, matching a similar rise in the FT-Actuaries construction and contracting share index. The market appears pleased with progress so far but awaits evidence that the company, having got this far, can produce good returns from its reorganisation. To switch from a medical to a legal metaphor: the jury is still out.</p>

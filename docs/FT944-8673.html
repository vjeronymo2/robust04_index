			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New chairman in place at Lucas The final piece in the new corporate jigsaw of Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components and systems manufacturer, slotted into place yesterday when Sir Brian Pearse replaced Sir Anthony Gill as chairman. Sir Brian will oversee a flattened management structure, with six business managing directors. He will report to Mr George Simpson, the chief executive. This system, introduced by Mr Simpson since his arrival at Lucas last April, replaces the previous portfolio management structure under Sir Anthony. The switch in chairmen took place after the annual meeting in Birmingham. 'It is the end of a specific and determined effort to get the top team reformed with some continuity in it,' said Sir Anthony. This is a reference to the decision taken three years ago, largely to meet the recommendations of the Cadbury committee, to split the roles of chairman and chief executive, filled by Sir Anthony since 1987. That it has taken so long to achieve the change reflects the confusion caused by the selection and then de-selection of Mr Anthony Edwards as Sir Anthony's heir apparent. The main focus of power in Lucas now is in the offices of Mr Simpson, fresh from the renaissance of Rover, the car maker, and Mr John Grant, who became finance director in 1992 after Mr David Hankinson, his predecessor, fell out with the rest of the board.</p>

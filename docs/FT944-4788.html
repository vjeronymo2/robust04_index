			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / London is biggest winner of regeneration funds London was the biggest winner in the first competition for funds under the unified Single Regeneration Budget, announced by the Department of the Environment yesterday. Projects in London received commitments of Pounds 36.5m for 1995-96 out of a total of Pounds 125m available. The government has also committed Pounds 225m to the winning projects for each of the following two years. Funding for some long-running projects will last for seven years. Total funding over the seven years will be about Pounds 757m, of which London will receive Pounds 316.7m. The budget, announced earlier this year, unites 20 existing regeneration programmes from five government departments. Projects, led by local authorities, Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), or private sector organisations, had to submit competitive bids, which were then judged by civil servants. More than half of the 469 bids received were unsuccessful, while others received less funding than they had requested. The cross-party Association of District Councils said that many local authorities had wasted time and resources in abortive work. It said this would not have happened if bids were negotiated rather than competitive. The process should be made clearer, it said, and regional regeneration statements should be developed so that in future the budget could be focused on the needs of regions. Sir Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, described the process as 'a series of arbitrary acts of patronage out of place in a democracy'. Saying the money was as welcome to the winners as 'a chance win on the National Lottery', Sir Jeremy pointed out that the announcement came days after the government's revenue support settlement for local authorities had cut Pounds 900m from the amount local authorities could spend on capital projects next year. In London the biggest winners were the 'Thames Gateway' region in east London, which Mr David Curry, local government minister, described as 'an area of real opportunity', and the Upper Lee Valley, straddling the north London boroughs of Haringey and Enfield. Projects in the Gateway region receive Pounds 54m in total over seven years, with various projects to improve skills across east London receiving a further Pounds 17.7m. In the Upper Lee Valley, which will receive Pounds 40m over seven years, funding will go towards two business support centres, and a series of infrastructure and communications projects. North London Tec predicted that 15,000 jobs would be created in the area. Several more rural areas have also won funds. The West Cornwall Initiative won Pounds 2.8m while the Energising Eastbourne scheme received Pounds 1.5m. The Battle for Hastings project will receive Pounds 450m. The Lancashire towns of Blackburn and Burnley won the greatest funding outside London, both with commitments of Pounds 19.5m over seven years.  ------------------------------------------- HOW THE REGENERATION COOKIE CRUMBLED  ------------------------------------------- Region              1995-96            Total              funds (Pounds)   funds (Pounds)  ------------------------------------------- London              36.584m         316.710m North-west          18.267m         143.293m North-east          18.286m          80.667m Merseyside          10.382m          78.004m East Midlands        7.378m          55.876m South-west           4.050m          34.090m South-east           5.263m          31.798m Eastern              2.749m          20.721m  ------------------------------------------- Source: Department of the Environment  -------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Chamber of Deputies floor </F> leader Roberto Maroni by Gianni Pennacchi in Rome; date not  given: "`OK, I Am Running for Prime Minister'"]    [Text] He fires no fusillades, preferring the soft chords  of the electronic keyboard to deafening bursts of fire, but the  music is still the same: He and Bossi are reading from the same  score, and you would have considerable difficulty in finding  dissonances. Malicious tongues insinuate that, in reality, the  floor leader is merely slick at adapting to circumstances,  always acknowledging the supremacy of the leader, but actually  each has his own part to play: One strikes and the other  soothes. One thing is certain, however: Roberto Maroni can  soften even the League's harshest messages.    Thus, while he provides musical interludes, at the keyboard,  of course, during the election rallies, Bossi's candidate for  prime minister confirms his bid: Palazzo Chigi, the bone of  contention between the League and Forza Italia, will go to  whoever obtains the most votes, implicitly, therefore, to  Maroni. Martinazzoli? Nothing doing, there will be no governing  with "the old"; and Spadolini can forget it too, he and his  "institutional" governments. Fini? Sorry, he is still beyond  the Leaguist pale; at the most he could give outside backing to  a minority "freedom alignment" government. But then, why should  the competition between Bossi and Berlusconi come as such a  surprise? Mao would call it "contradictions among the people,"  there is perfect unison on the manifesto, nothing like the  cacophony to be heard from the Left.    [Pennacchi] What are you up to, Maroni? While Bossi totes  his musket about, you play the piano?    [Maroni] It is just two different ways of giving our  opponents an earful. He fires fusillades, and I use the  keyboard.    [Pennacchi] It is official then, you are the League's  candidate for prime minister, designated to Palazzo Chigi by  Bossi?    [Maroni] OK, let us say so. But I am not losing sleep over  it, in fact it has put me in a good mood.    [Pennacchi] Does it not create problems for you with  Berlusconi? You yourself acted as the League's ambassador to  Forza Italia.    [Maroni] And why should it create problems for me? At the  end of the day, what it will all boil down to is who wins the  election. Everyone can pick the candidate they want, but we  cannot say now what will emerge from the vote. So proposing a  name for prime minister just means flying a flag until the  accounts are balanced after 29 March.    [Pennacchi] So what is all this about the war of the prime  ministers, this affirmation of Leaguist pride?    [Maroni] Whatever Giorgio Bocca [journalist] may say, the  League has people equal to any ministerial appointment. So if  the prime minister's job is to head a government team, we have  proved that we have more than one person capable of doing it.    [Pennacchi] Nevertheless, a handicap from which the  progressive alignment suffers now seems to be afflicting the  freedom alignment as well: You, too, are not so united, with  Bossi hurling daggers at Berlusconi, firing point-blank on Fini.    [Maroni] Fini does not form part of the freedom alignment.    [Pennacchi] True, but he is one of the opponents of the  Left.    [Maroni] Martinazzoli opposes the Left too, but he is an  opponent of ours as well. The freedom alignment does not  currently comprise the National Alliance. Nor does Fini seem to  me to be using kid gloves against us; the fact that he is  running against us in all the constituencies in the north shows  that he is outside the freedom alignment.    [Pennacchi] And why is Bossi taking potshots at Berlusconi?    [Maroni] Bossi is stressing something that is a fact: In  this freedom alignment, there is one political body, the League,  that has made a decisive contribution to the defeat of the old  system, and there is another component, Forza Italia, that  emerged a month ago. This is the difference underlying the  League's claim to the political leadership of the alignment.    [Pennacchi] Which nevertheless generates conflict, like on  the Left.    [Maroni] There is conflict, but it does not concern the  manifesto and matters of substance like it does on the Left,  with Bertinotti saying treasury bonds should be taxed and  Occhetto saying they should not, Bertinotti advocating  withdrawal from NATO and Occhetto going off to meet its  secretary-general. This means they have no joint program,  whereas we have, a federalist, liberal program. Our  disagreements do not touch on the things to be done. There are  four of us in the alignment, and we are running separately in  the proportional vote, because there are a few differences, but  they are not programmatic, nor are they as deep-rooted as they  are on the Left.    [Pennacchi] To put it simply, what do you quarrel over?    [Maroni] We quarrel over who is the 100-percent expression  of  what is new, and who expresses the new tendencies, though  without being completely new, as is the case with Forza Italia.    [Pennacchi] By the way, has the Leaguist people's rebellion  against the candidates imposed from above and regarded with  disfavor been quelled?    [Maroni] It was not a rebellion, just a strong protest by  those who found they had to accept not so much the Forza Italia  candidates, but some from the CCD [Democratic Christian Center],  in other words former Christian Democrats. I understand and  appreciate their reaction, but it is the price we have to pay  for the political deal. And I'm telling League militants that  this operation will allow the League to win the election and  enter the government. We must look beyond the boundaries of our  own constituencies and swallow the bitter pill.    [Pennacchi] To hear Bossi speak, the impression is that you  are more willing to govern with Martinazzoli than with Fini.    [Maroni] No, Martinazzoli never. He represents the old.  Fini represents the extremely old, although the fact that he  has never governed militates in his favor. But one thing is  clear: We have chosen our allies first, and there is no chance  of a deal with the others; they are all our opponents.    [Pennacchi] And what if you win the election but cannot  achieve an absolute majority without Fini?    [Maroni] Our experience over the last year leads me to  believe that even a minority government that seeks a separate  majority to vote each individual measure is possible. And if it  were not possible, we would certainly not do deals with the DC  [Christian Democratic Party] or the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left].    [Pennacchi] So you say no to Spadolini's proposals?    [Maroni] In the face of the unstoppable advance of the new,  Spadolini and all the other old blusterers from the old regime  should have the humility to keep their mouths shut. If we had  to take lessons from Spadolini and Scalfaro, the trainbearers to  all the Christian Democrat governments, in how the new Italy  should be governed, we should have no chance. The electorate  will tell us what we have to do on 27 and 28 March. Spadolini  should just thank his lucky stars that he is a senator for life.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (10): The bedroom move that says it all - ICI's community relations strategy seems to be paying off Why should one of the world's biggest chemical companies, manufacturing in 40 countries and selling 15,000 products, consider it has scored a success when an elderly couple writes to it to say they had temporarily moved from the front to the back bedroom of their Redcar semi? For ICI on Teesside, this letter was a sign that the effort it has put into its community relations strategy, bedrock of what it terms its moral licence to operate, is paying off. As Teesside's dominant employer, ICI has had enormous direct and indirect influence on the surrounding population for much of this century. At its early 1960s peak it employed more than 30,000. But, by its own admission, its drop in employee numbers during the 1970s and 1980s to 10,000 on Teesside today (including Zeneca businesses), and its historical reticence about explaining its operations to the public, combined with growing environmental demands from surrounding communities to create problems. These came to a head in 1990 when people living around the Wilton site, on the south bank of the Tees, became angry at flaring from OIefins 6, the Wilton ethylene cracker. A joint BP-ICI venture operated by ICI, the cracker is the second largest in the world. Built in 1979 at a cost of more than Pounds 200m, its capacity almost doubled in the 1980s and flaring, the noisy process in which excess hydrocarbons are burned off during shotdown, increased. Problems following the 1990 shutdown caused more flaring, further annoying local people already unhappy at the Enron project, a plan to build the world's largest gas fired power station at Wilton. ICI realised it had to act to restore its own standing among local people. Since then, under the banner of its community affairs group, it has become much more pro-active and espoused a policy of dialogue with the community. Methods of contact range from liaison plans and a promotional ICI community bus to a free community safety calendar, offering emergency advice to people within one mile of ICI sites and an exhaustive programme of educational links. Before the cracker under- went its shutdown - every third year - this spring, ICI's community affairs group launched a 220,000 leaflet information campaign; the result was zero complaints, and positive feedback, including the letter from the elderly Redcar couple, who moved bedrooms because of the flaring. Chemical industry critics may point out there is more than a little corporate self-interest in this - after all, the purpose and aim of ICI's Teesside community action team, established in 1991, are 'to re-develop employee morale/esteem/community spirit' and 'to protect and develop licence to operate'. But Mr Peter Dunlop, a retired engineer who chairs the Grangetown liaison panel, is in no doubt there has been a genuine change of heart within ICI - perhaps more than the company would like to admit. 'In the past they weren't just complacent, they were off- hand,' he claims. 'Complaints from the community would go to ICI and just be ignored.' Now, he says, the regular liaison panel meetings receive full details of ICI emissions, and ICI experts attend when requested. Significantly, ICI is now seen locally as an example for other local companies. Mr Dunlop is heartened that British Steel is for the first time sending a representative to this month's liaison panel meeting. Mr David Walsh, chairman of Cleveland county council's economic development committee, praises ICI for publicly identifying its emissions and reduction targets. 'It's become a better neighbour,' he says. 'I'm encouraged that one company is prepared to be very open. It's an example which ought to be followed by other companies on Teesside.' Mr Dunlop has never heard of the Responsible Care scheme; he believes ICI's move to a more open approach was heavily influenced by the example set by the American-owned Enron Corporation. He points out that Enron paid for the Pounds 350,000 Grangetown neighbourhood centre in which the liaison panel now holds its regular meetings. The creation of liaison panels like Grangetown's are important in fulfilling one of the aims of Responsible Care - demonstrating that performance improvements are taking place. Mr John Galbraith, ICI's Teesside operations safety manager, who is involved in Responsible Care's north-east cell, says there has been a big change in internal attitudes too in recent years in ICI. 'Ten years ago the feeling could have been there that management put safety in place and the guys did as they were told. It's the involvement of everyone which is the main shift.' Giving priority to health, safety and environment issues means showing management's commitment to these issues, says Mr Galbraith. 'Management can't be seen to be complacent,' he says. A cornerstone of the week is the Friday morning meeting between Mr Sandy Anderson, ICI Teesside operations general manager, and production managers to review the week's operations; the gist of discussions is passed back through a communications cascade system. ICI points out that despite sustained criticism from environmentalists, notably Greenpeace, its emissions to the environment have been cut by 75 per cent in the past 20 years. It admits Teesside's industrial heritage, in which it has played a key role, seriously polluted the Tees. After decades as a 'dead' river, salmon are only now starting to return. But ICI is keen to gain credit for the efforts it has made to reduce emissions; between 1988 and 1992 alone it spent Pounds 100m on environmental improvements. In the next few years it will spend tens of millions pounds more. The biggest investment is Pounds 66m on a newly opened sulphuric acid recovery plant at Billingham, which has eliminated ICI's sea disposal of acidic waste, significantly improving the Tees water quality. The SAR plant is part of the Pounds 110m Monomer 8 project, ICI's biggest UK investment for more than a decade. It is doubling its Teesside manufacturing capacity of methyl-methacrylate to 200,000 tonnes annually and helping establish ICI as the world's leading acrylics manufacturer. Significantly, given the hold that jobs used to give ICI on the surrounding community, this huge investment will permanently employ just 40 people. The Monomer 8 project fits in with ICI's corporate strategy of concentrating on businesses where it has global strength. But ICI faces more difficult decisions about the cost effectiveness of environmental improvements to some of its activities on Teesside, where several plants date from the 1960s. While it expects to make a 64 per cent reduction in Teesside waste emissions by 1996 - outstripping ICI's corporate 50 per cent target - the easy steps have now been taken. 'We are getting to the point where it gets more and more difficult to make improvements,' says Mr Tony Lewis, Teesside environmental services manager. Compounding the problem, as ICI restructures it is under increasing financial pressure to justify all its operations. 'We have to get value for money in terms of environmental improvements,' says Mr Lewis. 'There may be occasions when businesses can't afford the environmental improvements.' He says it would be wrong to blame plant closures purely on the cost of necessary environmental upgrading: it is one element in the equation, not the total sum. However, any factor which may reduce Teesside employment is of concern. But it is striking how high up the general public's agenda - and the legislative framework - environmental concerns have moved. 'Environmental improvement is not an option for us,' says Mr Lewis. 'I don't think we have any choice.'</p>

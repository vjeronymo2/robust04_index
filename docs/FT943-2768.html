			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Root out 'spiv' culture too Sir, It is encouraging that Mr John Major has declared war on 'yob culture' ('Major attacks 'yob culture' in fresh law and order drive', September 10). Perhaps his next campaign could address problems arising from a similarly evident - and equally pernicious - 'spiv culture'. But maybe, as a predecessor, Sir Robert Walpole, discovered in an earlier century, this culture has its roots far too close to home. Neil Kerr, 109 Barnsbury Street, London N1 1EP</p>

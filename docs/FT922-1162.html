			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Equity Issues: Grasim delays issue launch GRASIM, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre group which was hoping to raise Dollars 90m through an international equity offering this week, has had to delay pricing and launching the issue following the recent halt in trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange in connection with the Indian financial scandal. Grasim is the second Indian company to plan an international equity offering, following Reliance, the petrochemicals group which raised Dollars 150m in an equity offering last month. Mr Ralph Fox, head of the equity syndicate at Citicorp, the lead manager to the Grasim offering, said the offering 'would be placed on hold until the Bombay stock market reopens and trading stabilises'. Grasim has already said it will not increase the size of the equity offering above Dollars 100m following complaints about Reliance's decision to increase its issue from Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m. The decision to increase the size of the Reliance issue annoyed some investors who had hoped to be rewarded with a premium on the global depositary shares once trading started. Reliance saw a sharp fall in its share price after the international offering - from its pricing of Dollars 16.35 on May 26 to as low as Dollars 10.50 on June 18.</p>

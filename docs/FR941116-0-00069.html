			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AOPL maintains that the Commission's market power application process is inconsistent with the Act of 1992 streamlining mandate because it violates the Act of 1992's requirements that the Commission ``develop streamlined procedures `to avoid unnecessary regulatory costs and delays','' that ``proceedings address issues raised by parties with real economic interests, and that Staff initiated proceedings be limited to~ ~`specific circumstances.''' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It thus ``submits that the scope of any market power investigation should be limited to (1) rates subject to a valid protest by an entity with a demonstrated economic interest in the pipeline's rate, or (2) markets that do not meet Commission-established screens.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It asserts that the Commission's failure to adopt substantive guidelines does not comply with the Act of 1992's streamlining mandate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments at 25. ARCO, Marathon, and Davis similarly argue that the Commission has fallen short of the Act of 1992's streamlining mandate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission has fully complied with the mandate of the Act of 1992. The Commission has adopted the indexing methodology, which is ``a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines in accordance with section 1(5) of Part I of the [ICA].'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  And, the Commission has adopted streamlined procedures with respect to rates established under that methodology. The market-based ratemaking approach is not generally applicable. Therefore, it must be optional and oil pipeline specific. Indeed, the Commission doubts that it could have adopted market-based ratemaking as the simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology in light of the court's holding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmers Union <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the Commission cannot presume the existence of competition or that a competitive price will be within a just and reasonable range. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In any event, the Commission believes that the present regulations, in the spirit of the Act of 1992, indeed streamline procedures as to market-based rates by filling a regulatory void with respect to procedures and by minimizing burdens by obtaining data at the outset. This should avoid unnecessary regulatory costs and delays and result in informed decisions with respect to all markets in which an oil pipeline seeks to charge market-based rates rather than the generally applicable indexing methodology or, if appropriate, cost-based rates. In addition, the Commission's requirements for standing are applicable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Last, there is nothing in the Act of 1992 even suggesting that the Commission must adopt substantive guidelines for market-based rates, which, as discussed below, are not warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1801(a) of the Act 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Farmers Unions Central Exchange, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> FERC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  734 F.2d 1486, 1510 (D.C.

Disclosure of Confidential Shipper Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AOPL maintains that the NOPR's filing procedures will place oil pipelines in the untenable position of violating their statutory duty not to disclose confidential shipper information in order to comply with the rule. The AOPL asserts that the Commission cannot by rule repeal the statutory protection of confidentiality provided to shipper information by Section 15(13) of the ICA. The AOPL asks the Commission ``to clarify that nothing in the NOPR is intended to require the production of shipper information otherwise protected by ICA Section 15 (13).'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments at 23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 15(13) of the ICA makes it unlawful for an oil pipeline to disclose ``any information concerning the nature, kind, quality, destination, consignee, or routing of any property tendered to'' the oil pipeline for transportation, ``which information may be used to the detriment or prejudice of such shipper or consignee, or which may improperly disclose his business transactions to a competitor.'' However, Section 15(13) provides certain exceptions to allow ``the giving of such information in response to any legal process under the authority of any State or Federal court, or to any officer or any agent of the Government of the United States *&blank;*&blank;* in the exercise of its powers *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is concerned about the possibility that an oil pipeline might violate Section 15(13) and subject itself to a misdemeanor charge under Section 15(14) of the ICA by disclosing statutorily protected shipper information. However, the Commission sees no reason to eliminate the information collection in the proposed rule on that ground. Under the new procedural rules adopted as &sect;348.2, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the oil pipeline must file its application for a market power determination with the Commission and provide a copy of its letter of transmittal, without a copy of the application, to each shipper and subscriber on or before the day the material is submitted to the Commission. Thereafter, the shipper or subscriber must make a written request for a copy of the oil pipeline's complete application, which must be provided by the oil pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will adopt the following additional approach with respect to protected shipper information. First, under the exception provided by Section 15(13), the Commission in this order authorizes an oil pipeline to disclose information and materials necessary for it to file its application, which disclosure in the absence of this order might be deemed to violate Section 15(13). Next, as with all submissions to the Commission that include privileged information, the oil pipeline should file its application for a market power determination with a request for privileged treatment under Section 388.112 of the Commission's regulations. As required by that section, the oil pipeline must indicate the information for which it is seeking privileged treatment, including identification of the material subject to Section 15(13) of the ICA. However, for administrative convenience, the Commission is requiring the oil pipeline to file the original application and three copies in an unredacted form rather than only the original as required by section 388.112(b)(ii) of the Commission's regulations. The oil pipeline must file the remaining eleven copies required by section 348.2(a) of this rule and by Section 388.112(b) without the information for which privileged treatment is sought as required by section 388.112(b)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

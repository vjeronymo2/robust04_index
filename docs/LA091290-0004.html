			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The City Council asked its lawyers Tuesday to research whether there is a legal  way the city can reactivate a request for waiver from federal requirements  under the Clean Water Act, avoiding an expensive upgrading of the city sewage  system.  </P> <P> The lawyers plan to have the research done for a Nov. 1 hearing before U.S.  District Judge Rudi Brewster, said Ted Bromfield, chief deputy city attorney.  </P> <P> Under an agreement between the city and the federal government, San Diego is  committed to building a system capable of secondary sewage treatment. Secondary  treatment removes 90% of suspended solids from sewage. The city's advanced  primary sewage treatment process now removes 80% of the solids from the waste  before it is discharged into the ocean off Point Loma.  </P> <P> The city had temporary waivers from the act's requirements from 1981 through  1986, but the city withdrew its application for a waiver in 1987 when the EPA  indicated that the city's request would not be granted.  </P> <P> An official of the EPA said he if not sure that San Diego will even be allowed  to apply for a waiver now.  </P> <P> "It could be legally impossible to reactivate a waiver at this late date," said  Hugh Barroll, assistant regional counsel for the EPA in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, the San Diego County Grand Jury released a resolution urging the  city to back out of its January, 1990, acceptance of an EPA requirement for  secondary treatment and renew its application for a waiver.  </P> <P> The secondary treatment plant is estimated to cost as much as $2.8 billion by  2003. Many scientists have said that secondary sewage treatment is unnecessary.  </P></p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Biffen challengesclaims of recovery GOVERNMENT optimism about the prospects for the economy was challenged by Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), a former Treasury minister in the Commons last night. Earlier Mr John Major, the prime minister, highlighted the growth in business confidence since the Conservatives secured their fourth successive election victory. During question time he told Labour critics who emphasised the continuing rise in un-employment and the trade deficit that he preferred the views of the Confederation of British Industry and other business organisations who knew 'rather more about it'. Mr Biffen, speaking in the debate on the second reading on the Finance Bill, contended that, even in the most generous terms, the revival in the economy could only be described as tentative. Mr Biffen warned that in seeking to reconcile fiscal, public-spending and monetary objectives the government was engaged in an exercise of increasing difficulty. Acknowledging that interest rates had fallen since sterling entered the 'Lubjanka' of the exchange rate mechanism, he maintained that they were still at an extraordinary level in real terms. Mr Biffen stressed: 'I do not believe that we can have a balanced inter-related economic policy without a reduction in interest rates'. He questioned whether it would be a 'national disaster' if there were some adjustment to sterling's position in the ERM. Mr Biffen said Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, faced a formidable task in the coming negotiations over public-expenditure levels in disciplining the spending departments. The finance bill was given a second reading by a government majority of 52 (308-256).</p>

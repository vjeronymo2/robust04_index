			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Wary US takes longview of outlook for grain FOR THE past decade, US officials have cajoled, threatened and spent billions on agriculture export subsidies in an effort to convince the European Community to phase out farm supports. When the news arrived yesterday in Washington of a deal to begin reform of the Common Agriculture Policy, the reaction was subdued. The immediate response to the agreement was 'mass confusion, maybe long-term hope and maybe long-term heartburn', said Mr Paul Drazek, a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau. He thought CAP reform 'could be the most significant development in the grain trade in the last 30 years,' but he cautioned that its importance 'would depend on how much less production and dumping' there was likely to be. Grain market experts also expressed some scepticism about how a CAP subsidies cut of 29 per cent, instead of the 35 per cent proposed by the European Commission, would be received by Washington in this electoral year. Many farm lobbyists who advise Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, say they will not support any Uruguay Round deal which weakens proposals by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general for deeper subsidy cuts. There is already so much uncertainty in the grain markets because of the changes in eastern Europe that the impact of CAP reform - stretched out over years - is likely to be less important than a drought in Mongolia or snow in Brazil. In Chicago, there was reluctance to predict any price effects on grains. CAP reform was 'certainly encouraging,' said Mr Martyn Foreman, an analyst with Agrivisor, a market advisory service of the Illinois Farm Bureau. 'It would put some underpinning in world prices.' Past US Department of Agriculture studies have forecast a rise in grain prices in the event of a 35 per cent cut in European subsidies, but Mr Daniel Basse, director of market research at AgResource in Chicago, said the USDA was assuming demand would remain constant, a premise that not all analysts share. Even without CAP reform, the outlook for commodity prices is murky, experts believe. Much depends on countries like China and the Commonwealth of Independent States. This year, the CIS wheat crop looks to be 12m tonnes larger than last year's 73m tonnes. China is both the largest wheat producer and importer (94m tonnes and 16m tonnes, respectively, are predicted) but it can easily curb imports, as it has in the past for political reasons. According to Mr Basse, the effects of lower EC prices would not be felt at the earliest until next year's crops. Eventually, reductions in EC grain production and less dumping of excess grains on world markets could help raise exports, particularly of wheat, from other grain producers. Countries such as Canada, Australia and Argentina were considered more likely to see the benefits on exports than the US given that Washington has competed with Europe on export subsidies while other countries have not. Mr John Sault, agricultural counsellor of the Australian embassy in Washington, said his country had been caught in the crossfire between the EC and the US export subsidies, pushing Australian traders out of their traditional markets such as the former Soviet Union and China. CAP reform gave some hope that former markets could be regained.</p>

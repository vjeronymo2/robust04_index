The State Council will single out 100 state-owned  enterprises  of medium and large size for trial practice in setting up a  modern enterprise system which is considered important to China.  The management mechanism of these enterprises will see a change  while state-owned small-sized enterprises will be renovated by  means of leasing, contracting and sale. Those having long-term  loss will be declared bankrupt.    Key to the reform of taxation will lay in the setting up of  systems for central and local taxation. The relationship  between the central authorities and localities, the state and  enterprises and individuals must be made clear in terms of  taxation.    As for monetary reform, the functions of the central bank  have to be improved and strengthened. The central bank must  keep control over the supply of money in order to maintain  stability of the currency. A banking system for the  policy-oriented banks must be set up in a bid to turn the  professional banks into state-owned commercial banks.    The planned system will also come under reform, putting an  emphasis on simplification and reducing the number of planned  indicators but increasing to a little extent the indicators for  macroeconomic general volume. The mandatory plans for  production, circulation and distribution will be shrunken. The  system for order-taking will be developed and improved.    Reform of the investment pattern will put an emphasis on the  strengthening of the status held by enterprises as the main  investment bodies and the scope of investment by the government  must be made clear. The responsibility of taking risks in  investment by legal persons and in credit by banks will be  established.    Mr. Hong pointed out that price reform had not yet been  completed. He added that a grain and food system in line with  the socialist market economy system had to be set up as soon as  possible this year while at the same time a unified price system  for production means had to be carried out. Prices for coal  would continue to open to the market and those for crude oil,  finished oil and electricity were to be adjusted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The presidential election campaign has begun in  Ukraine. The authorities are clearly inspired by the high  turnout during the parliamentary elections and call this a good  example. Western observers have a somewhat different opinion.  For example, American representatives have stated that it was  not possible to elect a genuinly legitimate parliament. The  Americans have reported numerous complaints that candidates from  the parties in power had freer access to the media.    [Correspondent Aleksandr Tachenko] The forecasts of the  early  collapse of Ukraine have turned out to be somewhat exaggerated,  which President Leonid Kravchuk thinks as well.    [Begin Kravchuk recording, in Ukrainian with superimposed  Russian translation] Analysis shows that neither the extreme  left nor the extreme right received a large advantage.  Everything depends on whether the deputies are able to create a  strong center. If they create one -- and I hope they will --  then I hope that there will be no threat of collapse. [end  recording]    [Tkachenko] Other active participants in the political  process in Ukraine commented on the results of the recent  elections in their own way in an interview on the "Itogi"  program.    [Begin recording] [Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of Rukh] The  parliament was elected in accordance with what is probably the  worst electoral law in Europe. Only the Belarusian law can  compete, and these are the results. Then you must not forget  that elections under conditions of an economic recession and the  impoverishment of the population always give opportunities to  extreme forces, both extreme left and right.    [Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] I hope that there will be a  center in parliament capable of halting the tug-o-war  competitions, capable of halting destruction and beginning to  work on the genuine construction of the economy, which Ukraine  needs today. [end recording]    [Tkachenko] After the parliamentary elections, now most  interest is concentrated on whether or not the presidential  elections will take place on 26 June. Among the opponents of  the new electoral campaign is Kravchuk himself, some  nationalists, and even communists. Among its active supporters  are Leonid Kuchma and some of the leaders of the eastern and  southern regions, and left- centrists.    Today, few people risk forecasting how events may develop.    Everyone is waiting and preparing for the middle of May,  when  the new Ukrainian parliament will meet for its first session.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Observer: History lesson No one was more surprised at Observer's item, just before Christmas, suggesting that plans for an NHS Lotto had foundered in 1988, than the staff of the National Hospital Trust who were completing the 235th weekly draw. True, the initial draw was halted for three months by the Crown Prosecution Service which disputed Lovell White Durrant's advice that the lottery was legal. The CPS eventually gave the go-ahead, much to the relief of Lovell's Patrick Phillipps. He must be hoping that his latest gamble - advising Rothschild's bid for the National Lottery - goes more smoothly. For its part, the National Hospital Trust takes comfort from the new freedoms allowed to existing lotteries in the National Lottery Act. No doubt ministers have been reminded of the last time a National Lottery was allowed to become a monopoly. John Blunt, having set up the first really successful government lottery in 1710, subsequently devised the 'South Sea Bubble' scheme to buy up, in part, the government's liability for Pounds 9m worth of lottery prizes.</p>

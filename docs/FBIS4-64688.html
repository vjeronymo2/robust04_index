			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Gerry Adams Allowed To Fight Mainland Ban"] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein's president, Mr Gerry Adams' won  permission yesterday to challenge the Government's exclusion  order banning him from mainland Britain .    Mr Justice Potts gave his lawyers leave to seek a judicial  review, saying there was "an arguable case".    But the judge added: "You will appreciate the result may  well  be that you succeed -- equally it may well be that you fail."    With the pressure group Liberty acting as his solicitors, Mr  Adams is seeking to overturn the exclusion order made against  him last October under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989.    He will also challenge the legality, under European and  domestic law, of the subsequent decision by Mr Michael Howard,  the Home Secretary, not to revoke the order in January.    Yesterday's application for a review was unopposed by Mr  Howard.    The judge ordered an urgent hearing of the case because of  the "points of public importance" raised.    Mr Robin Allen, appearing for Mr Adams, told the court that  the Sinn Fein leader only wanted to pay a brief visit to England  to discuss the political situation in Ulster with MPs, at the  invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP. Mr Allen accused Mr  Howard of "taking a sledgehammer to crack a small nut".    Mr Adams was first excluded from mainland Britain under an  order made in 1982. It was lifted the following year when he  was elected MP for West Belfast but reimposed last year after an  election defeat.    The Government action was illegal, Mr Allen argued, under  European laws which guaranteed citizens freedom of movement and  freedom of expression.    The case marked the first time the English courts had had to  deal with the concept of European Union citizenship, which had  come in for criticism in the country because it created a kind  of federalism and "a citizenship which transcends national  citizenship".    As an Irish national, and therefore a citizen of a European  member state' Mr Adams had the right to move freely within the  UK, unless restrictions were properly authorised under the  Treaty of Rome, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty. There were  no such restrictions, Mr Allen said.    The European citizen's rights enjoyed by Mr Adams were in a  "superior class" and "trumped" the Home Secretary's right to  make orders under the domestic anti-terrorism laws.    At the heart of the case was the question of freedom of  expression.    All Mr Adams wanted to do was to attend a meeting at a date  to be fixed at the Houses of Parliament to discuss the political  situation in Northern Ireland.    "Mr Adams says that however much he may be reviled by  politicians in this country he is a person who ought to have the  right to freedom of expression under Community law."    The Home Secretary had in the past allowed persons subject  to  exclusion orders to attend court and give evidence in England.    "Just as evidence in a court is an essential part of the  democratic process, engaging in political dialogue in one  meeting is also an essential and important part of the political  and democratic process," Mr Allen said.    He said there was also a possibility of the case being  referred to the European Court of Justice, which would add a  two-year delay to the judicial process.    A Downing Street spokesman said later: "The Government's  policy has not changed at all. We will have to see how the  process of the judicial review comes out."</p>

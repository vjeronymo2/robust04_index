			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Underwriter pay points to upturn The best-paid underwriters at Lloyd's of London significantly increased their pay last year, according to Financial Intelligence &amp; Research, the insurance analysts. Ten underwriters received remuneration, including profit-related pay, of more than Pounds 230,000 each. Only six underwriters achieved these pay levels in 1992. The best-paid underwriter, Mr John Charman, whose marine syndicate number 488 is one of the biggest in the market, increased his pay to Pounds 401,000 last year compared with Pounds 306,000 in 1992. Syndicate 488 earned a pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.6m in 1991, the last year for which it has closed its accounts. According to the analysis, eight of the top 10 best-paid underwriters improved their pay by at least 13 per cent. The increases reflect a gradual return to profitability at the insurance market, where insurance rates have increased very sharply over the past two years. Lloyd's last week reported losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year, and will make further losses in 1992, when it reports results for that year in 1995. However, the number of underwriters earning more than Pounds 100,000 a year continued to decline. Separately Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, told a conference yesterday that he expected capacity at the market - the amount of insurance premiums that syndicates are permitted to underwrite - to decline in 1995 from its present level of Pounds 10.9bn. Suggesting that a fall may help sustain profitability at the market, Mr Middleton said Pounds 9.5bn would be an 'optimal' level of capacity. He also said that the market was examining a possible modification in its three-year accounting rules. It is possible that some syndicates might be allowed to close both their 1992 and 1993 years of account next year.</p>

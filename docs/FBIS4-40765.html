			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 7, RIA -- Oleg Soskovets, first  vice premier of Russia, on an official visit in Malaysia, signed  a contract for the supply of 18 Russian combat aircraft to that  country today. Under the contract, Malaysia will receive 16  MiG-29 combat aircraft and two MiG-29UB training planes, as well  as auxiliary equipment and munitions worth 550.5 million  dollars. There is also a provision for the training for  Malaysian servicemen, for which purpose Russian specialists will  be seconded to Malaysia. Malaysia is expected to pay 65 per cent  of the contract value prior to the delivery.    MiG-29 jets will be souped up and will have an in-flight  refuelling feature. They will carry extended-range air-to-air  missiles with infra-red and active homing devices. The missiles  can detect up to 10 aerial targets and lock on two targets at a  time. The aircraft's bomb load will be increased from 2 to 3  tonnes. The angle of attack will be increased from 26 to 28  degrees. The operating range of the aircraft will grow from  2,100 to 2,900 kilometres thanks to additional fuel tanks.    The parties also signed a contract under which subsidiaries  of Russian aircraft-making factories will be built in Malaysia.  It is also intended to set up a joint Russian-Malaysian  maintenance centre to service MiG-29 supplied to that country.  With that in view, the Russian Federation will lease to  Malaysia two aircraft (MiG-29 and MiG-29UB) free of charge for  ten years.    During the visit, an agreement on counter purchase of palm  oil was signed. Under the agreement, 25 per cent of the price  of the aircraft will be covered by exports of Malaysian palm oil  to Russia. Initially, the Malaysian side insisted that palm oil  should account for 400,000 dollars of the contract value, but  the Russian representatives managed to lower the figure to 95.4  million dollars. Importantly, Russia will have the right to  re-export that oil to other Commonwealth states, Eastern  European countries, Cuba, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi  Arabia and Syria.</p>

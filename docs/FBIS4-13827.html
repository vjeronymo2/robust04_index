			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Ian Atalla] </F>   [Excerpt] Amman--The United Kingdom feels that the current  U.N. enforced naval blockade of al-'Aqabah should be modified,  said British Ambassador to Jordan Peter Hinchcliffe Saturday [23  April] at the Amman Chamber of Commerce (ACC).    "My government has felt for some time that the blockade is  excessive, and that Jordan is suffering as a result," said Mr.  Hinchcliffe. "We would like to see a change in the method of  how the U.N. regulations are enforced."    "As well, British exports to Jordan have suffered as a  result  of this blockade," Mr. Hinchcliffe said at the ACC meeting with  a visiting commercial delegation of the South of England  Exporters Association (SEEA).    Mr. Hinchcliffe spoke after ACC President Muhammad 'Asfur  emphasised to the ambassador and the SEEA delegation Jordanians'  sense of indignation and frustration towards the blockade, and  said that since it had begun, "some 1,800 ships have come to  al-'Aqabah, and not one ship was found in violation of the U.N.  resolutions."    Members of the ACC also said that more ways should be found  to address the vastly unequal trade balance between the two  nations. Where England exported JD 127.9 million worth of goods  and services to Jordan in 1993, according to available  statistics, Jordanian exports to England totalled a mere JD 2.5  million in the same period.    The ACC suggested an increase in joint venture projects  between Jordan and Britain to the SEEA delegation as a means  towards alleviating the current situation, but Mr. 'Asfur  cautioned that "we have suffered before in such programmes."  [passage omitted]    Mr. Hinchcliffe told the ACC group that Britain was  currently  working on drawing up a number of mutual tax agreements with  Jordan which would add to facilitating trade between the two  countries.    The SEEA delegation arrived in Amman Friday evening after a  visit to Lebanon, and will stay in Jordan until April 26.</p>

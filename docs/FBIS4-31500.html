			<p>CSO     [Text] The uncertainty surrounding compensation coupons  has been apparent for a while from the decrease in the coupons'  market value. At the beginning of the week, the price of the  instrument approached the 500 forint [Ft] limit, which  corresponds to approximately 30 percent of the face value  compounded by interest. However, on Tuesday, the drop in the  value suddenly stopped, and the average price increased by Ft30.  According to experts, though, if no adequate privatization  inventory is offered for the coupons, the stop will only be  temporary.    According to State Secretary Tamas Sepsey, president of the  National Compensation Office, if there is no adequate offer for  the coupons, the current market value will remain. So far,  compensation coupons were issued in the value of Ft110 billion,  30 billion of which have already been used, and Ft80 billion is  waiting to be invested on the market. The claims for  supplemental compensation "forecast" that compensation coupons  will be issued in the value of another Ft20 billion. What is  known of future offers is that a Ft750-million portion of the  Antenna Hungaria company can be subscribed to starting on 16  May, property in the value of Ft3.9 billion can be acquired in  the Hungarian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation at the end of May,  and after 16 June, a Ft500-million package of stock in the EGIS  Pharmaceutical Factory will be offered in exchange for  compensation coupons. The palette of exchange offers also  includes the Chinoin Pharmaceutical and Chemical Products  Corporation, the Hungarian General Forwarding Enterprise  [Masped] and the Golden Spider [Aranypok textile retail chain],  as well as the Hajdu Dairy Products, Hajdu Grain Products, and  Hajdu Bakeries companies. According to Tamas Sepsey, the land  auctions can be concluded by the end of May, by the time the  extended deadline expires, with the exception of  Szabolcs-Szatmar, Bacs-Kiskun, and Csongrad counties.  Incidentally, the auctions of state-owned land will only begin  in September.    Coupons can be bought for less than 60 percent of face value  only if families need the money to buy food, we heard from  people who tried to buy coupons through classified ads in  Szombathely. This opinion is backed by the findings of the local  office of the State Property Agency, according to which people  carefully consider selling even at face value. According to  local experts, the drop in the market value is due to seasonal  fluctuations: In the slow summer season last year it was  possible to buy compensation coupons for as little as 40  percent; according to forecasts this year, the market value is  expected to be below 50 percent. In Miskolc, many ads appeared  in the newspapers offering 100 percent for compensation coupons.  In some stores, the coupons are also exchanged at face value  instead of the daily market value. In spite of the deteriorating  market value, many people feel that compensation coupons are  worth keeping, because sooner or later the trend will be  reversed.    In Szabolcs-Szatmar county, the best deal was offered at the  land auctions. For instance, in Nagyecsed, as much as  Ft1,200-1,500 was paid in cash for Ft1,000 coupons, while "on  paper" the original owner, in whose name the bids were made,  remained.    According to Laszlo Bekesi, economic specialist of the  Hungarian Socialist Party, compensation must be completed as  soon as possible. State property intended for privatization must  be offered in exchange for the coupons, creating a portfolio  which would exclude property the sale of which could involve  capital as well. The acceleration of compensation could propel  inflation to some extent, but in his opinion, this would still  cause less damage than dragging out the process. The  shareholding program for small investors already involves an  obligation of Ft100 billion for the new government. The  Socialists do not plan retroactive changes if they get into a  position to govern, but they would immediately close down the  program for small investors because they consider this form of  property distribution, which was started as a campaign tool,  extremely damaging.</p>

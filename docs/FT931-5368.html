			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Iran urged to cut trade agreements with UK IRAN was urged yesterday to cancel trade agreements with Britain because of the row over the author Salman Rushdie. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, one of Iran's most outspoken clerics, said yesterday parliament should review economic and trade relations with Britain because of its insults to Islam. Speaking at Friday prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Jannati said a meeting last month between Mr Rushdie and Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister at the Foreign Office, was aimed at 'shattering Islam's dignity and opening the way for anyone to insult Moslem sanctities'. He added that it was a tactic aimed at forcing Iran to submit to Britain's wishes. Britain has recently stepped up its demands that Iran should withdraw the religious ruling, or fatwa, passed by the late Ayatollah Khomeini which calls on Moslems to kill Mr Rushdie for sentiments expressed in his book The Satanic Verses. Ayatollah Jannati said yesterday it was a divine ruling which 'sooner or later, would be carried out'. He added that trade with Britain could be replaced by dealing with other countries. 'Whatever we buy from Britain can very easily be bought elsewhere,' he said. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is expected to meet Mr Rushdie within the next few weeks to underline the government's insistence that the fatwa has to be withdrawn before diplomatic relations between the two countries can improve.</p>

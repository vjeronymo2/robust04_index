			<p>BFN     [Text] Poznan, June 20 -- President Lech Walesa told  journalists in Poznan on Monday that the local elections held on  June 19, "although apolitical, will acquire a political  character when the results are summed up" because parties will  try to demonstrate how many seats they have won, the president  said.    Lech Walesa also pointed out that Polish economy had changed  for good and communists who have turned into wealthy capitalists  will not introduce communism again. According to the president,  the comeback of the old regime is impossible because "that would  need Soviet tanks once again."    Referring to the question of the freedom of press in Poland,  the president assessed that Polish press is entangled in party  alignments and reporters are hunting for sensation. However, he  added "it is a crisis of adolescence one has to go through and  things should improve later."    Questioned about the arrest of Boguslaw Bagsik, Mr. Walesa  reiterated that he had expected a just trial of Bagsik, former  "Art-B" company owner who is charged with pumping huge money out  of the Polish banks.</p>

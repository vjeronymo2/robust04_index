			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly elected Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata called Tuesday on Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama to meet him, in a last-ditch effort to  persuade the SDP to stay in the coalition.    However, Hata indicated to reporters that he seeks to form a  new cabinet Tuesday even without the SDP, saying, "we cannot  spend so much time."    A coalition government without the SDP would be a minority  one.    There are also moves going on to entice elements of the  largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the  coalition, political sources said.    Leaders of the ruling coalition met at the prime minister's  official residence to discuss the SDP's decision to quit the  alliance and decided that Hata should urge Murayama to hold  talks, coalition officials said.    An emergency meeting of the SDP's Central Executive  Committee  Tuesday morning endorsed a decision taken earlier in the day by  its top officials to quit the coalition, party officials said.  The SDP was the largest party in the coalition.    Murayama announced at a hastily arranged news conference  after a meeting by top executives that the party decided to  leave the alliance because it cannot approve of an abrupt move  by some coalition partners to establish a new 130-legislator  parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, which  excludes the SDP.    The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (innovation),"  was formed hours after Hata was elected prime minister by the  Diet on Monday afternoon.    It comprises Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New  Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two  splinter groups that recently defected from the LDP -- the  Liberal Party and Kaikaku No Kai.    The Liberal Party was established by seven rebels who left  the LDP to support veteran LDP politician Michio Watanabe's  aborted attempt to seek the premiership. The party did not sign  a policy platform agreed upon last Friday by the coalition heads  for forming a new government.    Murayama criticized the formation of the new parliamentary  bloc as destroying the coalition structure.    "It is outrageous for a certain political party or an  individual to have destroyed the current combination of  coalition parties while ignoring the process of the  accord-building," Murayama said, apparently referring to  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition  strategist.    The strength of the coalition excluding the SDP stands at  182  seats, compared with the 206 of the LDP in the 511-seat lower  house.    The SDP, which held six cabinet posts in the government of  Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor as premier, has 74 members  in the lower house.    New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which has 15 members in the  lower house, has refused to join the new parliamentary group.  Sakigake, led by Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in  the Hosokawa cabinet, voted for Hata in the Diet but has vowed  not to take a cabinet post.    Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday  afternoon was postponed because of the delay of forming the new  cabinet, Diet officials said.    The seven-party coalition government led by Hosokawa forced  the LDP out of its 38-year-old grip on power last August.</p>

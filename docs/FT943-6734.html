			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / US joins the hunt for Chinese market share: Tony Walker analyses a business initiative When Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, arrives in Beijing today he will be the highest-level Clinton admin-istration official to visit China since renewal in May of China's Most Favoured Nation trading access in the US. But perhaps more important than the status and timing of his visit is the fact that Mr Brown will be following the example of others, such as the Europeans, in seeking to link surging official commercial ties with US corporate aspirations. Mr Brown will be accompanied by the heads of no fewer than 24 leading US corporations in the fields of energy, finance, industry and information systems. These include Mr Robert Denham, chairman and CEO of the US securities house Salomon, Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of Westinghouse Electric, and Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, the car manufacturer. On the government side the Brown party includes the director of the US Export-Import Bank, senior trade officials and the US executive director of the Asian Development Bank. Mr Brown could not be accused of selling his mission short. He described it as 'historic' and predicted it would initiate a 'new era in US-China relations'. 'Active US engagement recognises both the importance of the world's fastest-growing economy to US economic growth and the importance of advancing our interests with the Chinese government and its people,' he said on the eve of his arrival. There is no doubt that the recent renewal of MFN, particularly the 'de-linking' of human rights and trade issues, has opened the way for a more settled commercial relationship; even though Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads on such questions as Chinese intellectual property rights abuses and terms for China's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Human rights issues also continue to be problematical. Mr Brown has said he will raise the question 'in the appropriate way in the appropriate forum'. This hardly suggests that human rights will be a centre-piece of his visit. While American business was dismayed by what it regarded as the administration's initial bumbling approach to relations with China - MFN renewal threatened to become a debacle - it now appears satisfied that Mr Clinton and his advisers are committed to establishing a framework that would facilitate a broader and more productive relationship. Mr Robert Kapp, president of the US-China Business Council, whose membership has grown strongly in the past year, said in Beijing this week that the value of the Brown visit lay in the emphasis it would give to the 'multi-dimensional' aspect of the relationship. Plans to 're-invigorate' the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade with the establishment of working groups in six key areas of mutual business interest, such as services and information technology, were a step in the right direct. The joint commission began meeting again in April this year when Ms Wu Yi, China's trade minister, visited Washington. Sessions were suspended after Chinese troops shot pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's central Tiananmen square in 1989. Like the visit to China last year of Mr Helmut Kohl, the Germany chancellor, whose accompanying businessmen signed contracts worth billions of dollars, Mr Brown's party is expected to initial a wad of agreements. From China's perspective, Mr Brown is a welcome guest. Mr Shi Jianxin, a senior Trade Ministry official, told the official Xinhua news agency that the visit 'reflects the US government's willingness to adopt a more active and practical attitude toward its relations with China.' Mr Shi described prospects for further co-operation as broad. But while Mr Brown will spend much of the time during his few days in Beijing in the warm embrace of Chinese hospitality, including meetings with the country's leaders, he will also be obliged to address contentious issues such as terms for China's Gatt entry. The US and China are still relatively far apart on questions like 'national treatment'; that is the obligation of Gatt contracting parties to accord each other corresponding market access privileges. Gatt talks are scheduled to resume in Geneva next month and China is pressing hard to fulfil requirements for access to enable it to become a founder member of the World Trade Organisation. Commerce Department officials say Mr Brown does not plan to make too much in discussions with Chinese officials of a growing Sino-US trade imbalance, but there is no doubt the issue looms in the background. China last year exported goods to the US worth Dollars 31.5bn (Pounds 20.3bn) compared with imports of Dollars 8.7bn, leaving a trade gap of Dollars 22.8bn. In the six months to June, China had opened up a gap over the US of Dollars 11.6bn, suggesting the balance of trade in China's favour will be much the same this year. Not least of Mr Brown's objectives on this mission will be to seek ways to stimulate US exports to counter the persistent and growing trade deficits.</p>

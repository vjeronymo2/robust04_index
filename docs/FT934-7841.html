			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy After last week's somewhat disappointing news on wholesale price inflation and consumer credit, UK markets were beginning to accept that the chancellor's room for manoeuvre on interest rates was limited. In the light of yesterday's retail prices index, they may have to think again. October's small rise in clothing prices and an actual drop in household goods prices, as well as cuts on food, reveal little immediate inflationary pressure. There is a danger in reading too much into one month's set of figures, but the starting point for the inflationary blip forecast by the Bank of England now looks lower than previously expected. It also appears that, at least in the domestic market, consumers' price consciousness is preventing companies from pushing up margins much. This background will make it much harder for Mr Clarke to resist pressure to follow continental European interest rates lower, especially if sterling continues to rise against the D-Mark. Fierce price competition among supermarkets should also damp inflationary expectations. In theory Mr Clarke could cut rates even if he announced minimal tax increases in the Budget. Since there is little prospect of the PSBR significantly undershooting the treasury's Pounds 50bn forecast, he has in practice an even better opportunity to tackle the deficit as well.</p>

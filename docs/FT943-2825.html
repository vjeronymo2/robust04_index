			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Red Adair of ancient monuments - He came to bury English Heritage, but perversely Jocelyn Stevens is giving it a fuller life It is ten years now since the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission was put to sleep and the more consumer friendly English Heritage was created. Yesterday the nation's biggest guns gathered in London to fire salvos in praise of the heritage. The Prime Minister supplied his vision of the future, viewed brightly through National Lottery glasses; Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber was there to do what he does best, give away money, Pounds 1m of it to help finance the Open Churches Trust, which aims to keep churches unlocked for visitors; and sounding off at full blast, Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, described how he took on the assembled ranks of special pleaders, country landowners, dreamy academics, entrenched interests, and, worst of all, archaeologists, and put them to the sword. Stevens' speech, with some justification, concentrated on the heritage successes of the past few years. It is hardly a coincidence that he was appointed chairman in 1992, a self-styled Terminator Three, determined to shake up a cosy quango. He is now half-way through his allotted five year span ('I'm too old to do another term' - he is 62), and it is two years almost to the day that he announced his personal programme, a programme that caused convulsions inside English Heritage and beyond. This week in his workmanlike office in Fortress House, the defiantly bleak HQ of English Heritage, Stevens marked his performance - and gave himself top marks. 'A hundred per cent of the strategy has been achieved'. For a man who saw off the printers in his newspaper days, and the even tougher cabal of art lecturers during his Rectorship at the Royal College of Art, English Heritage has turned out to be something of a pushover for Stevens. He has trimmed down the staff from 1600 to 1200 and another 200 will go shortly when English Heritage's workforce of skilled craftsmen, stone masons, gilders, and the like, is privatised, perhaps through a management buy out. He has rid English Heritage of responsibility for 45 of its 400 properties, most successfully by transferring its Avebury sites to the National Trust, and he hopes to get rid of another 44 by the end of the year. And he has cut down to size the London Region by handing on its powers over Grade II listed buildings to the boroughs. He was able to boast this week that while only seven London boroughs had so far agreed, with three more ready to sign up, they accounted for half the listed buildings in the capital. London has been something of an obsession with Stevens. You might conjecture that he took on the job to wreak revenge on the London Region experts who so delayed his plans to add an extension to the Royal College that it pushed up the cost by Pounds 2m. 'I loathe bureaucracy', he explains. He talks with horror of friends who needed English Heritage permission to change the door knobs inside their houses. Presumably he believes that the local councils, many of whom lack specialist staff, will be less pedantic. Stevens has dealt with the bureaucracy in English Heritage by being a one man band, a Red Adair for the heritage, swooping on crises and quickly resolving them. He takes credit for getting something done at last about the Albert Memorial. He came up with the short-term cash needed to fix the Crescent in Buxton, currently the most important building in England threatened with demolition but now moving safely into local authority control. 'People say I must be like King Canute. But in my case the water is coming up over my head'. His current pre-occupation is the great Ministry of Defence sell off. It owns over 700 listed buildings, including such historic and costly structures as the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and the army buildings at Woolwich. They could suddenly become somebody else's liability, and English Heritage can hardly dodge its responsibility. It has been here before. By force-majeure it has already started to care, at a cost of Pounds 90m over ten years, for the nation's cathedrals and churches which are too much for a cash-strapped Church of England. So there is a paradox. With one breath Stevens talks of ridding English Heritage of all its sites; with the other he enthusiastically takes on new burdens. He also welcomes direct approaches. The transfer to the London boroughs of mundane conservation matters in theory makes English Heritage more strategic; in practice it is Jocelyn Stevens who dictates policy. When Lord Palumbo finally started this summer to construct his new James Stirling building on No 1, Poultry, no thought had been given to the archaeological potential of a site at the heart of Roman London. Crisis: Stevens summoned Lord Palumbo and after a chat extracted a promise that archaeologists could have 44 weeks on the plot and, on top, Lord Palumbo would pay Pounds 2m towards the cost. This is the role that Jocelyn Stevens loves. He describes English Heritage as 'a shipyard that takes in wrecks, repairs them, and then hands them to someone else to sail'. This workmanlike approach even extends to his flagship site, Stonehenge, which he accepts is 'a national disgrace'. He has rowed furiously with the Ministry of Transport and the local authorities, to say nothing of the Druids and the Army, about his plan to create a 3,000 acre national park on Salisbury Plain over which the public can roam and admire 450 scheduled monuments. The typical Stevens solution is for the project to be financed from the receipts of a visitors centre on the far edge of the area. If he can knock enough heads together, and he seems to be making progress, Jocelyn Stevens is quite happy to transfer the most important heritage site in the nation to a local Trust which will administer the Park, with cash coming from a commercial enterprise running the centre, which could be visited by 750,000 people a year. Stevens sees it as a natural millennium project, ready by 2000. But while Stevens is frantically patching up his ships and shoving them down the slipway others need attention. He has just handed over Pounds 1m to a trust that will cherish Pell Wall Hall, a derelict house in Shropshire designed by Sir John Soane. He recently discovered a forgotten treasure in Danson House, Bexley, which needs rapid attention. Despite his ambitions he will never be able to whittle down his quango to a few strategic sites and probably would hate the consequences if he did. For Stevens pays lip service to devolution and deregulation but loves to interfere. 'Although we have one foot in the past we also have one foot in the future'. He has made up for the disappointment that the National Heritage Fund was given the task of distributing lottery cash to the heritage by taking a keen interest in potential lottery projects. He is giving Richard Rogers redevelopment of the South Bank arts centre a supportive push; he has handed the Tate Gallery money to shore up its planned Museum of Modern Art at Bankside Power station; he is airing an idea for spending lottery money on smartening up the capital's parks. Jocelyn Stevens has a romantic view of his mission. 'There used to be the US cavalry, now there is English Heritage'. Undoubtedly his energy has achieved much. But as in every cavalry charge there are casualties, and not just the local gentry who find it harder to get a grant to repair their roofs; or London's archaeologists, ruthlessly reorganised. There are the experts who could not stand Stevens' abrasive style and took their knowledge elsewhere. There are the problems that will not go away, like the ancient monuments, from Rivaulx Abbey to obscure Bronze Age barrows, that will never find a new owner to cherish them and must remain part of English Heritage's fief. Steven's has proved that the heritage will never become the past. In marked contrast to his declared aims, through his ambition and drive, he is constantly adding to the workload of his diminished band. He came to bury English Heritage; perversely he is giving it a fuller life.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: Modern dance in dire straits - Alastair Macaulay finds the Rambert still adrift while London Contemporary Dance Theatre is facing possible closure Is British contemporary dance flourishing? So it has been recently claimed. The facts suggest a far more alarming situation. For the last quarter-century, the nation's two largest modern-dance troupes have been London Contemporary Dance Theatre (16 dancers at present) and the Rambert Dance Company (17 dancers). Today, both are in conditions of intensive care. Rumours were flying this last weekend that London Contemporary Dance Theatre was about to announce its closure. The company, which reached a peak of glory during the 1970s under the artistic direction of choreographer Robert Cohan, has always exemplified rare standards of sheer dance technique. But it has been seeking a satisfactory new artistic director since the mid-1980s. The crisis is the more acute since it affects the London Contemporary Dance School, which feeds the company with dancers and is among the world's leading centres of modern-dance training. The Rambert, which became a basically modern-dance troupe in 1966, has changed identity several times. Until the 1980s it presented a more histrionic or theatrical kind of dance expressionism, led by such choreographers as Glen Tetley and the gradually emerging Christopher Bruce. During the 1980s, however, it became a more pure-dance troupe, with higher standards of dance technique and musicality. In December 1992, the board of directors of the Rambert sacked its artistic director, Richard Alston. His work for the company as both choreographer (since 1980) and coordinator of a revised repertory and important artistic collaborations (since 1986) had won several awards; and the board's decision caused huge shock-waves, which have still not subsided. There seems little doubt that the reasons behind the board's act were primarily financial. The company had fared poorly at the box-office (both on tour and in London). As from next year, however, a new Rambert is expected to emerge. The new artistic director is to be Christopher Bruce - yes, Bruce of Rambert's pre-Alston days. Bruce has signed to begin work in April 1994. He has made certain conditions: that the company be increased from 17 to 25 dancers, that its orchestra be increased in size, and that a full-time musical director be appointed. His plans are to give the company an international repertory - a sort of 20th-century Masterpiece Dance Theatre - with works not only by himself but also by such foreign choreographers as Jiri Kylian, Ohad Naharin, and the late Martha Graham. These plans are startlingly ambitious and yet thoroughly reactionary. In modern-dance terms, 25 dancers is an astonishingly large company. (Compare it with the leading American modern-dance companies. Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, Mark Morris all have less than 18.) As for the choice of choreographers, Bruce, Kylian, and Naharin, though popular, are scarcely on the cutting edge of dance; and Graham is dead. And does the new Rambert, as is rumoured, plan to dance ballets as well as modern-dance works? It is unlikely that a company based in the work of Bruce, Kylian et al. could do them justice. And will such a company be popular? The new Rambert, we are told, will give more than 100 performances a year. When touring round Britain, it will give six or seven performances per week. (This at a time when most ballet companies have grown scared, for box-office reasons, of giving much time to anything other than such full-length ballets as Swan Lake.) When people talk of the recent success of British contemporary dance, they are chiefly referring to a number of our smaller dance companies - DV8, Adventures in Motion Pictures, Second Stride, the Cholmondeleys, and the groups of Siobhan Davies, Michael Clark and Shobana Jeyasingh. These troupes are almost all shaped around one choreographer. LCDT and the Rambert are, however, repertory companies; and this is part of their long-term problem. You can build a ballet repertory company because there are plenty of choreographers who can employ the same ballet vocabulary. But there are many different modern-dance techniques. Both LCDT and the Rambert have had to keep adjusting their basic styles of dance training. Yet the Arts Council has agreed to the formation of the revised Rambert, and has given notice to London Contemporary Dance Theatre that it cannot currently support two companies on such a scale; or, rather, that London Contemporary Dance Theatre must reduce its size and reconceive itself, or close. The company gives a London season later this month - probably its last London season in its present form. The latest news is that LCDT will continue, but on an altogether smaller scale. The ironies of this situation are many. It is dismaying to find how many of these decisions have been made, not by artists, but by boards and administrators: chiefly non-dance people, shaping the dance world to their will. London Contemporary Dance School trains dancers to a very high level of technical accomplishment: a level that is actually far more virtuoso than suits many of the choreographers on the international new-dance scene. Alston, the first important choreographer to emerge from the School and widely considered to be the finest dance-maker in Britain today, is one of the few choreographers who demands a high level of technique; and yet he remains a freelance choreographer without a company. (He has returned to LCDT, for which he made his earliest works in the 1970s, to create The Perilous Night for the forthcoming season.) Similar problems are to be found in many other countries. Dance today is simply in a dire state: a subject to which I will return. There will be more to say about both the Rambert and LCDT in the near future. At present, the situation must be watched with the greatest concern.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BASS JAMES MORRIS RIDING HIGH  </P> <P> American bass James Morris has been described as a bigger-than-life cowboy  because of his love for wide open spaces and his imposing presence on and off  the stage.  </P> <P> He has also been described as demanding and aloof.  </P> <P> But after a Monday night season opener for the Opera Company of Philadelphia,  Morris was in good spirits -- partly because his wife performed in the same  opera.  </P> <P> Morris sang Count Almavivia ,the philanderer in Mozart's "The Marriage of  Figaro." His wife, mezzo soprano Susan Quittmeyer, sang the role of Cherubino,  a page and an unwitting foil for Figaro.  </P> <P> Quittmeyer said the casting didn't happen by chance.  </P> <P> "These are never coincidences," she said.  </P> <P> Morris agreed, saying scheduling was a problem in their personal lives.  </P> <P> "It's great when we get a chance to be in the same part of the country and even  greater to be together in a production," he said. "I especially like it when we  can both go to Santa Fe because I love the West, too."  </P> <P> The couple lives in New Jersey.  </P></p>

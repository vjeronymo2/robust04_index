			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Du Pont stops fungicide payment DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, said yesterday it would stop making payments to horticultural growers who claimed its Benlate DF fungicide had damaged their crops. The company, which last year took a Dollars 215m after-tax charge because of such claims, said yesterday it had paid more than Dollars 470m in claims from ornamental plant and fruit growers since Benlate was withdrawn from the market in 1991. Du Pont claimed yesterday that its own studies showed the Benlate fungicide did not cause the crop damage. Based on these findings, the company said it would no longer pay any claims. The company said it had initially begun paying Benlate-related claims because its scientists believed at the time there was a high probability that the fungicide would eventually be shown to have contributed to plant damage.</p>

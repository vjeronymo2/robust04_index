			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Tiphook family trust sells shares worth Pounds 143,351 Speculation over the financial health of Tiphook founder Robert Montague was heightened yesterday, after his family trust sold 434,398 shares in the recently-renamed Central Transport Rental Group, raising Pounds 143,351. The shares were sold on Monday, the day on which the Royal Bank of Scotland had planned to serve a bankruptcy petition on the CTRG chief executive. It is understood that the petition will be served later this week, when Mr Montague returns from the US. The Royal Bank is chasing up a Pounds 2.3m loan, but Mr Montague has around Pounds 30m of personal debts. Mr Montague stated at last months annual general meeting that he faced no financial difficulties and the company spoke of an improving trading performance, which makes the timing of the latest share sales somewhat embarrassing. A spokesman for CTRG said yesterday that the share sales were the decision of the trustees, and that Mr Montague had no part in that decision. The Spread Trustee Company sold another 410,000 shares last April, a month after the company cemented the sale of its container leasing business. The latest share sales were at 33p, against yesterday's middle closing price of 37p. The shares were part of Mr Montague's 3.05m shareholding, which has lost 85 per cent of its value in the past year. Mr Montague is understood to be in the US for talks with the lawyers bringing a Dollars 700m class action against him and his company. The legal action is on behalf of US investors who acquired several tranches of Tiphook bonds shortly before a series of profit warnings sent the share price sharply downwards. The law suit claims that Mr Montague and his company 'embarked upon a high profile, multi-media campaign to depict Tiphook, its business and its prospects, in a materially false and misleading manner'. CTRG is 'vigorously' defending the action. While it has made provisions for the legal costs of its defence, it would not be in a position to survive any substantial claim resulting from the case.</p>

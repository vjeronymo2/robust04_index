			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Kurds need Dollars 145m aid say UN officials AT LEAST Dollars 145m is needed to protect and help Kurds in Iraq over the next six months, UN officials said yesterday, AP reports from Geneva. 'The humanitarian programme has got to go on; the guards have got to stay in place,' said Mr Michael Stopford, spokesman for the UN relief programme in Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq's health minister said that 85,942 Iraqis died in 1991 as a result of the UN economic sanctions imposed following the invasion of Kuwait. Mr Omid Medhat Mubarak said 27,473 of those who died were children under five who suffered respiratory infections, diarrhoea and other illnesses because there were no medicines to treat them. Mr Mubarak warned that the death rate would rise in 1992 if the trade embargo continued, the official Iraqi News Agency said. Imports of food and medicine are allowed under emergency measures adopted by the UN Security Council after the Gulf War, but Iraq says it lacks the hard currency to pay for them. The US last week renewed its calls to Baghdad to accept Security Council resolutions that permit a partial lifting of sanctions to allow the government of Saddam Hussein to sell Dollars 1.6bn of oil to buy essential humanitarian supplies. Iraq has refused to accept the terms of the resolutions. Baghdad officials say the amount is not enough and that proposed UN scrutiny of the sales and food distribution would infringe its sovereignty. Some of the Dollars 1.6bn also would pay for UN relief programmes in Iraq and reparations to Kuwait. In Geneva, Mr Stopford urged international donors to help Iraqi Kurds even if they disapproved of Baghdad's policies. 'Never mind the political uncertainties, someone's got to pay for these operations,' Mr Stopford said. Mr Stopford said Iraqi authorities were still preventing UN efforts to aid the Shia Moslem population in the southern Iraqi marshes near the Iranian border.</p>

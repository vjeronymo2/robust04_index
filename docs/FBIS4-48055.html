			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- The three National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] battalions deployed on the East Rand  will be withdrawn Tuesday (tomorrow) and will return to their  Bloemfontein base. The withdrawal was on the instructions of  the Transitional Executive Council, NPKF spokesman Col Connie  van Rensburg said on Monday, and would be completed by Saturday  May 14.    "Once all the troops are regrouped at the De Brugge base,  retraining will start and will continue until the future of the  force is decided upon by the government of national unity," said  Col van Rensburg.    The NPKF, made up of former liberation army guerrillas, SADF  [South African Defense Force] and homeland defence force troops,  and members of the SA Police, has been dogged by controversy  since its inception. This included reports of drunkenness,  mutinous behaviour, and poor training, culminating in the  force's inability to keep the peace in war-torn East Rand  townships.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The government on Tuesday  [15 February] proposed to spend 1,063 billion yen for Official  Development Assistance (ODA) in fiscal 1994, a record low  increase of 4.8 percent over the current fiscal year's initial  budget.    The ODA or foreign aid budget, included in the government's  draft proposal for the overall general account budget for fiscal  1994, which starts April 1, was approved by the cabinet earlier  in the day for submission to the Diet.    Finance Ministry officials said that despite the record low  rise in yen terms, the Japanese currency's 13 percent  appreciation against the dollar over the past year will mean a  significantly higher ODA outlay in terms of the U.S. currency.    They estimated the dollar-denominated increase at 6.3  percent  or more, depending on the manner of calculation. In fiscal  1993, the ODA budget posted a 6.5 percent increase, continuing a  downward trend that began in 1990.    Officials said the proposed budget should provide sufficient  momentum toward achieving Japan's fifth medium-term target of  disbursing 70 billion to 75 billion dollars in ODA to the  developing world between 1993 and 1997.    It is also expected that under the plan Japan will remain  the  world's largest ODA supplier, they said.    Officials said the proposed ODA outlay, which was allowed  the  highest increase rate among major expenditure categories in the  overall budget, shows the government's resolve to strengthen  Japan's international contributions despite severe fiscal  constraints at home.    The various government ministries and agencies engaged in  extension of foreign aid had initially asked the Finance  Ministry to approve an 8.3 percent budgetary increase to 1.098  trillion yen.    A top priority in the fiscal 1994 ODA budget is support for  human resource development in developing countries, officials  said.    They said that explains the relatively high 6.7 percent  boost  to 311.7 billion yen in funding for technical assistance  programs implemented by the Japan International Cooperation  Agency and other organizations.    The budget proposal earmarked an additional 207.9 billion  yen  for bilateral grant assistance, which amounts to a more modest  3.2 percent increase over the figure in the current budget.    But officials pointed out that the bilateral grant figure  includes a number of major hikes, such as 5.3 billion yen for  relief assistance to disaster victims and refugees, up 37.5  percent, and 1.5 billion yen in support for small-scale grant  projects conducted largely by nongovernmental organizations, up  50 percent.    According to the draft, cash contributions and donations to  international organizations are to be increased by only 3.5  percent in yen terms, but by a whopping 19 percent in dollar  terms.    Officials said the beneficiaries will be organizations  tackling such global issues as the environment, population and  aids, as well as human rights protection and refugee relief.    For example, Japan's contribution to the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which is headed by Japanese  national Sadako Ogata, is set to rise by 20.5 percent to 100  million dollars in the draft.    Another example is a 59.3 percent increase to 36 million  dollars in Japan's contribution to a fund set up in the United  Nations for protection of the environment.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata welcomed the budget, saying  the  fresh emphasis on such issues as the environment, aids and the  status of women lends a needed "human touch" to Japan's ODA  program.    Hata said it also reflects the transfer of power to the  present coalition government. He credited coalition members  with strongly promoting new allocations or vast increases in  funding for the various "new tasks faced by international  society."    The most massive increase posted in the budget was a 500  percent increase to 15 million dollars in support for  Palestinian development projects. It was also proposed to boost  relief aid for refugees in the Middle East by 66.7 percent to 20  million dollars.    The government's draft budget suggested that low-interest  loans, a key component of Japan's ODA program, be increased 4.7  percent to 368.3 billion yen.    Officials pointed out that the general account budget for  ODA  is only one indicator of the scale of Japan's overseas  assistance program.    The ODA operating budget, which is normally used for that  purpose, combines funds from the general account budget with  funds from such sources as special account budgets of individual  ministries and borrowings from the government's fiscal  investment and loan program.</p>

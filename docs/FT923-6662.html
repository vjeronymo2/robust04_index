			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bombardier advances 25% BOMBARDIER, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group, says higher sales of consumer products and a turnround in its consumer financing unit brought a 25 per cent gain in second quarter net profit to CDollars 29.7m (USDollars 25.1m), or 19 cents a share. A year earlier Bombardier reported second quarter profit of CDollars 23.8m, or 16 cents a share. Revenues were CDollars 974m in the latest quarter against CDollars 692m a year earlier, mostly due to consolidation of De Havilland Canada and UTDC, a transit equipment builder in Ontario. In the first half ended July 31, profit was CDollars 62.4m, or 40 cents a share, against CDollars 49.4m, or 34 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.9bn against CDollars 1.35bn.</p>

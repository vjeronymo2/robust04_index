			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GET IT IN WRITING  </P> <P> Nicaragua's revolutionary government this week began the complex process of  preparing for a national election early next year. The first steps in the long  process were not easy, and they provide a glimpse of the controversies still to  come as the Sandinista government jockeys for ascendancy over rival political  parties.  </P> <P> The Sandinistas agreed to move up the date of their nation's 1990 election from  November to February as part of a peace agreement negotiated among the five  Central American presidents. To begin carrying out that agreement, Nicaragua's  National Assembly voted Tuesday to amend the nation's election laws. But  opposition Assembly members walked out, claiming that many of the amendments  enacted by the Sandinista-dominated Assembly favor Sandinista candidates.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders are particularly troubled by the proposed membership of a  five-person Superior Electoral Council, which will regulate all aspects of the  campaign and oversee next year's voting. Under existing law, all members of the  council will be named by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. Acknowledging a  stacked deck, Sandinista officials offered to compromise, saying that Ortega  would name any two persons the opposition selected to the council, along with  two Sandinista loyalists. The fifth appointee would be an "independent eminent  person." But when opposition leaders wanted that guarantee written into law,  the Sandinistas refused.  </P> <P> Next year's voting could well be the most pivotal election in Nicaraguan  history. It could mark the end of a decade of political turmoil and violence  that began when the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza was overthrown. The  Sandinistas played a key role in that revolution, but they did not bring the  dictator down without help. Whether the Sandinistas like it or not, the burden  of proof that Nicaragua's elections will be fair and open is on them. That  means they must be ready to compromise with the opposition on all the electoral  disputes that are sure to arise in the months to come.  </P> <P> Ortega could get the process off to a constructive start with a written  guarantee that Nicaragua's Electoral Council will be a truly balanced and  independent body.  </P></p>

Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative, held talks with President Rauf Denktas and  submitted a new document on the implementation of the package of  confidence-building measures at noon today. Gustav Feissel, the  UN secretary general's alternate special representative; John  Paul Cavanaugh, the UN secretary general's special envoy; and UN  experts attended the meeting. Also attending were Ozker Ozgur,  minister of state and deputy prime minister; Atay Ahmet Rasid,  minister of foreign affairs and defense; Presidential Advisers  Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun; and Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Ozer Koray. [passage omitted]    Speaking after his talks with Joe Clark, President Denktas  said that he has received a new document, which contains certain  changes in accordance with the views and anxieties the Turkish  Cypriot side has expressed in the indirect talks.    [Begin Denktas recording] Considering the work we have  carried out with Mr. Feissel, we informed them that they should  brief us on the points they have deemed as important in the  talks we have had for so many days. We said that they should do  so that we may be able to proceed. So, they have made certain  changes to the document. We shall study them and meet again  tomorrow. We have been informed that certain changes have been  made to come closer to our position. However, we shall make an  assessment to establish whether or not the changes will satisfy  us. [end recording]    A journalist asked the following: Is a deadlock possible at  this point? We have asked Mr. Joe Clark this question. He said  that a significant rapprochement has been achieved on basic  principles.    Denktas replied by saying that the new document has to be  studied before that question can be answered. Regarding another  question, Denktas recalled that the Greek Cypriot Administration  has agreed to the establishment of two doors at Nicosia Airport  and noted: The customs formalities behind the door open to the  Turkish Cypriot side will be managed by Turkish Cypriot  officials. Nothing can be achieved if this is not accepted.    Denktas said that he has not received an invitation to visit  New York and described each day and week in the talks as  important. However, he also said that the talks have currently  entered a very important week. Asked to comment on how a change  in the Turkish Government after the local elections on 27 March  may affect the talks in Cyprus, Denktas recalled that the talks  are within the framework of Turkey's policy and noted that they  cannot be suspended just because of a change in government in  Ankara.</p>

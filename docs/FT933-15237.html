			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Microgen down and warns of year's shortfall SHARES IN Microgen Holdings fell 12p to 173p yesterday after the specialist computer services group reported first half pre-tax profits down 14 per cent and warned on current trading. Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said continuing economic uncertainties made it unlikely that trading in the second half would make up the reported shortfall. However, the core computer output microfilm (Com) business was seeing volumes stabilise. Pre-tax profits were down from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 3.76m for the period ended April 30 1993, while turnover rose to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 25m). The smaller electronic print division improved sales to Pounds 8.73m (Pounds 7.16m) partly on the back of higher revenue from new customised services. Mr Lee said the group had been subject to intensified pressure on margins, particularly in the UK and Scandinavia where the recession continued. This had been felt most strongly in the traditional Com business where reductions in revenues and profits had a significant impact on results. The German company had 'performed well', increasing turnover and profit by about 9 per cent in D-Mark and 30 per cent in sterling terms There was some evidence that the onset of recession in Germany would affect the Com business, but this should be offset by the growth in customised services. Mr Lee said Microgen's planned development into a broadly-based provider of computer output management services continued. Looking to the longer term he said the strategy was sound. Although it might take some time for this to show through in terms of progressive profit growth, strong evidence that confidence was well founded was provided by the underlying progress in revenue growth from the new services. Since the half-year end the Scandinavian holding company had bought two computer output service businesses in Norway at a total cost of Pounds 1.76m. These will be integrated and make a first contribution in the next year. At April 30 the net cash balance had increased to Pounds 3.56m (Pounds 2.48m). There was net interest received of Pounds 77,000, compared with payments of Pounds 57,000. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.2p out of earnings per share down at 6.1p (7.1p).</p>

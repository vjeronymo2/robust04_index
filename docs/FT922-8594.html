			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / EC recalls ambassadors from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday acted to isolate the new Serb-dominated state of Yugoslavia by recalling its ambassadors from Belgrade. As fighting reached a new intensity throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina, the EC foreign ministers demanded the withdrawal of the Yugoslav federal army from Bosnia or its disbanding. They called federal forces 'an army of occupation.' In a further diplomatic blow, the EC also shut the rump-Yugoslav state out of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping forces, whose headquarters are in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, said the situation was close 'to an intolerable level in terms of criminality and anarchy'. Gunmen had commandered two UN jeeps and had stolen the peacekeepers' side-arm weapons, he said. The EC shied away from calling on Bosnian Serbs to desert the federal forces in Bosnia, but Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said the aim was for troops to return 'to their barracks or home, without aggressive equipment'. Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreign minister, said the new Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, would also be excluded from next week's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which Yugoslavia has long attended as an observer. Sarajevo suffered another day of heavy fighting as Federal army troops and Serb irregulars continued to tighten their grip on the city. Another four people were killed in the city overnight. At least 1,320 people have been killed in the past 45 days of fighting over Bosnian independence. In the south-west of the republic, both forces were poised to take the city of Mostar. Fighting between Bosnian Territorial Defence forces and Serb irregulars also continued around Brcko, Doboj and Modrica, northern Bosnia. EC officials and UN diplomats stationed in Bosnia appeared increasingly frustrated about the breakdown of last week's ceasefire. Community monitors stationed in Ilidza, a district of Sarajevo, watched helplessly as Serb forces launched rocket attacks about 200 yards from the hotel where monitors and foreign journalists are staying. But EC foreign ministers said there was no question of the Community abandoning its attempt to arrange a political settlement. Although 'ceasefires are signed and broken,' Mr Hurd said, 'eventually people will realise they are not going to gain by attacking their neighbours'. He said although EC monitors had been pulled out of Bosnia for safety reasons, they might return to help with humanitarian aid. Brussels yesterday agreed to give the UN High Commission for Refugees Ecu30m (Pounds 21m) more out of the EC budget. Mr Hurd said Britain was raising its contribution to the UN effort from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 3.3m. The UN will today launch an appeal to aid some 700,000 refugees from Bosnia. Ms Judith Kumin, head of the Belgrade branch of the UN High Commission for Refugees, described the refugee problem caused by the war as 'not only the greatest refugee problem in Europe since the Second World War but one of the biggest problems in the world'.

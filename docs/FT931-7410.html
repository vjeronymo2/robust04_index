			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA futures finished just below a three-month high, boosted by active industry demand which helped to absorb some Ivorian selling. Dealers said there was good two-way business in nearby Ivorian cocoa at between FF600 and FF605 per 100 kilos. Some estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes might have been traded during the day. New York raw SUGAR prices touched contract highs in early trading, touching buy stops and encouraging speculative buying. PLATINUM drifted lower on the London bullion market on continuing bearish technical factors. But it continued to hold initial support after very volatile trade and a Dollars 16 range seen in Tokyo overnight. Analysts said that while Monday's sharp plunge in platinum and PALLADIUM might have condemned both metals to a renewed period of base building, they had held crucial support areas and should avoid a further free-fall. One pointed out that both markets were short, as indicated by firm lease rates. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Put a gold star up on the board next to CBS for televising "Family of Spies."  </P> <P> It was excellent. What a welcome relief from some of those idiotic situation  comedy shows with canned laughter. "Family of Spies" was deserving of Emmy  nominations. Encore!  </P> <P> Frederick D.

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / EC predicts year of no growth: Commission to issue downgraded forecast after Maastricht referendum in Denmark THE EC has sharply downgraded its economic forecast for this year, according to internal estimates which the European Commission plans not to release until after tomorrow's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The revised forecast of zero to 'slightly negative' growth compares with earlier official predictions of 0.75 per cent growth. The slowdown threatens to push EC unemployment beyond its present level of 17.4m, renewing doubts about member states' willingness to follow Maastricht's tough 'convergence' criteria for European monetary union. It also threatens to prompt a crisis in the EC budget, where falling revenues have already forced the Commission to leave 1,000 posts unfilled. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, paid a discreet visit to Bonn last Thursday for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss the deteriorating outlook for the EC economy and how to co-ordinate the position after the Danish referendum. Yesterday, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, came out in favour of amending the convergence criteria. EC finance ministers and the European Commission have generally avoided suggesting that the Emu criteria covering inflation, budget deficits and ratios of government debt to GDP should be changed. They fear undermining budget discipline and upsetting the German Bundesbank, which has ruled out short cuts to a single European currency. Mr Maystadt's comments reflect concern in Brussels about the short-term deflationary impact of the convergence criteria on growth. They are likely to arouse attention because Belgium takes over the EC presidency from Denmark on July 1 and is often seen as a candidate for an inner-core monetary union. The latest European Commission forecasts support the International Monetary Fund's prediction in April that growth in the EC would be flat this year. They confirm the impact of the German recession on the European economy, but are believed to support the UK government's view that Britain is likely to grow faster than its main European competitors this year. Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish Commissioner responsible for economics, has delayed amending his 0.75 per cent forecast until the last minute. Like many of his fellow commissioners, Mr Christophersen has argued that a Danish Yes vote would speed ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the UK, spurring an improvement in business confidence. Mr Delors is expected to use the new, gloomy forecasts to press EC member states to beef up the Community's 'growth package' in the run-up to the Copenhagen summit. The plan mixes national measures such as a shift from current to capital spending on infrastructure and housing, with modest new EC lending to small and medium-sized businesses. The EC budget is already overstretched. The freeze on personnel results largely from a rapid rise in pension costs for retiring EC officials who joined the Community at its inception in 1958. Officials also point to the wave of recent currency devaluations in the exchange rate mechanism. These have reduced the value of the Ecu, the unit in which all EC spending is calculated, by about 5 per cent. Samuel Brittan, Page 12 Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

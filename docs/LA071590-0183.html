			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS  </P> <P> Sir Isaac Newton's theory of gravity tell us that what goes up must eventually  come down. However, there is a special breed of individuals who think that what  comes down ought to go right back up.  </P> <P> They are the jugglers who dot the street corners of Westwood and entertain  along the boardwalk in Venice. The UCLA campus will be the site of the 43rd  annual Jugglers Festival July 17-21. Activities will include "joggling" races,  games, competitions and a parade. The festival will culminate with a "New  Vaudeville" revue featuring topsy-turvy, gravity-defying entertainment. For  information on times and events, call (213) 825-9261 (ticket prices vary).  </P> <P> How about trying a "light" evening of music and theater in Santa Monica?

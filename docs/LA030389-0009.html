			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Emergency legislation to provide $24.5 million to keep open 21 centers for the  mentally retarded and developmentally disabled was signed by Gov. George  Deukmejian. The funding crisis developed as a result of a dispute between the  Deukmejian Administration and the federal government over funding of the  centers. The legislation sponsored by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) provides  that the Administration can use money from the state General Fund or borrow it  from another state-controlled fund until there is a resolution of the dispute.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAW NO BRUISES ON LISA STEINBERG, WITNESS SAYS  </P> <P> The defense rested Friday in the murder trial of Joel Steinberg, who is accused  of beating to death his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> The defense's 13th and last witness was Joseph Thornton, superintendent of the  apartment house where Steinberg and his live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum,  reared Lisa Steinberg.  </P> <P> Thornton testified that he had frequently seen Lisa playing with friends,  walking with Steinberg or riding on Steinberg's shoulders. He said he never saw  bruises on the child and never saw Steinberg mistreat her.  </P> <P> Steinberg did not testify.  </P> <P> After resting his case, defense lawyer Ira London told reporters outside the  courtroom that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that  Steinberg, 47, inflicted the injuries that killed Lisa on Nov. 5, 1987.  </P> <P> State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax scheduled the defense summation for  Thursday. The trial is in its 11th week.  </P> <P> In other testimony, a psychiatrist said Nussbaum had no need of hospitalization  for mental care after Lisa's death.  </P> <P> Azarian Eshkenazi testified Thursday that Nussbaum could benefit from  outpatient psychiatric care, but that in November, 1987, she was oriented and  coherent with "absolutely no thought disorder."  </P> <P> "I did not find any mental disorder that would require her to be  psychiatrically hospitalized," said Eshkenazi, head of mental health services  for women prisoners at Elmhurst Hospital Center.  </P> <P> Steinberg's attorneys have claimed that Nussbaum, 46, who has spent the past  year in a psychiatric facility, is a "malingerer" and a "fraud" who remains  hospitalized to win sympathy and to avoid prosecution.  </P> <P> She had been charged along with Steinberg in the girl's death, but charges were  dropped and she became the government's chief witness.  </P> <P> The prosecution contends Nussbaum was too battered and emotionally crippled to  harm Lisa.  </P> <P> After Thursday's trial session, Steinberg continued his court-ordered  examination by prosecution psychiatrist Martin Brecher, keeping open his  insanity defense option. The first examination interview Wednesday lasted three  hours.  </P></p>

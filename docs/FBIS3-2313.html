I will invite Mr. Li Luye, spokesman for the  session and vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee  Foreign Affairs Committee, to give you a news briefing.    [Li Luye] Ladies and gentlemen, friends, comrades: I give  this news briefing today at the request of the secretariat of  the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Conference. The  second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Conference is  scheduled to open ceremoniously at the Great Hall of the People  in Beijing at 1500 [0700 GMT] on 8 March. The session will last  12 days. The session's main agenda is: Examining the work  report of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing  Committee; attending the second session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] as observer; hearing and discussing the  government work report and other reports; examining and  approving the motion of revising the CPPCC constitution;  examining and approving the report about the handling of motions  submitted since the first session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee; electing additional vice chairmen and standing  committee members of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and  electing a new secretary general; and examining and approving  all resolutions to be made by the second session of the Eighth  CPPCC National Committee. During the closing session, Chairman  Li Ruihuan will give an important speech. During the fifth  session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing  Committee, which closed on 5 March, 30 additional members of the  CPPCC National Committee were elected; and the session also  nominated Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping to deliver the work report  of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee.    Over the past year, people of all nationalities in the  country, earnestly implementing the guidelines laid down by the  14th National CPC Congress and its third plenary session,  continued to march forward along the course charted by Comrade  Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  New successes were achieved in reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization. In that year, under the leadership of  the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core,  the CPPCC National Committee, as the broadest patriotic united  front organization of the Chinese people, rallied all democratic  parties, mass organizations, democrats without party  affiliations, and people of all nationalities in all circles to  earnestly implement the basic line characterized by one center  and two basic points, and to work hard in exploring a new course  for CPPCC organs' operations.    Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee, focusing  on  the state's central tasks, earnestly performed its functions of  providing political consultation and democratic supervision, and  participating in and discussing state affairs. Consequently the  CPPCC National Committee's operations in all fields continued to  develop on the basis of the experiences accumulated by the  previous committees, thus contributing positively to promoting  reform, opening up, and social stability.    Although the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee is an annual regular meeting, it is a very important  meeting to be held at a crucial time when China is accelerating  the pace of building a socialist market economic system. During  this meeting, the committee members will seriously sum up the  work accomplished since the previous session, and will freely  express their views on reform, development, stability and other  major issues having a bearing on the national economy and  people's livelihood. I believe that, under the current  gratifying situation -- exemplified by rapid economic  development, stable political situation, solidarity among people  of all nationalities, and social progress at home -- this  session certainly will be a democratic, truth-seeking, united,  and morale-boosting meeting which will expedite China's  socialist modernization and socialist democratic construction.    Now all the preparations for the second session of the  Eighth  CPPCC National Committee have been made. As of the afternoon on  6 March, 1,265 of the 2,097 members of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee had reported their presence to the secretariat of the  session. To assist Chinese and foreign reporters in their news  coverage, a CPPCC National Committee office has been set up in  the information center of the CPPCC and NPC sessions.    Now I would like to take up your questions with regard to  the  session that will soon be held.    [Li Xiaomin] I am Li Xiaomin, reporter of the ZHONGGUO  [word indistinct] BAO, I have a question to ask: How many major  parts of the CPPCC National Committee Constitution have been  revised? What are the major improvements the CPPCC National  Committee has made with regard to its participation in  administration and state affairs discussions? Thank you.    [Li Luye] I will ask Mr. Zhao Weizhi [deputy secretary  general of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee] to answer your  first question. I will answer your second question.    [Zhao Weizhi, reading from paper] The current CPPCC National  Committee Constitution was adopted in 1982. It is a good  Constitution. Only some parts of the Constitution will be  revised and the revision will be based on the actual  developments and changes over the past 12 years. The principle  of revising the Constitution is based on the guidelines of the  14th National CPC Congress to come in line with the newly  revised PRC Constitution in some important wordings and to  stress the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the basic line of the primary stage of  socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and political  consultations under the CPC's leadership, and the socialist  market economy. At the same time, the new Constitution will  also incorporate the new experiences and new successes China has  gained and achieved in socialist democratic construction and in  developing CPPCC operations since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee. In the new Constitution, some  of the provisions with regard to CPPCC organs' functions in  providing political consultations and performing democratic  supervision will be enriched. It states, for example, that the  CPPCC National Committee is an important multiparty organ  providing political consultations under the CPC's leadership;  the CPPCC National Committee's principal functions are to  provide political consultations and democratic supervision, and  organize member parties, mass organizations, and people of all  nationalities in all circles to participate in administration  and state affairs discussions. Moreover, the CPPCC National  Committee will provide political consultations before decisions  are made on major state and local policies and on major  political, economic, cultural, and social issues. It will also  provide political consultations on major issues when decisions  are being carried out. The motion of revising the Constitution  to be submitted to the second session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee for discussion and adoption was drafted and  redrafted many times on the basis of the views expressed by  persons in charge of all democratic parties, industrial and  commercial federations, and local CPPCC organs, as well as  relevant central authorities.    [Li Luye, reading from paper] With regard to participating  in administration and state affairs discussions, the Eighth  CPPCC National Committee did so in many ways. I will briefly  describe some major one. On participating in administration and  discussion of state affairs, the Eighth CPPCC National Committee  Standing Committee held a total of five plenary sessions in 1993  to discuss issues concerning the state's economic problems and  solutions, international situation, the establishment of a  socialist market economic system, ethical construction, and  crackdown on corruption. Leading comrades of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council who reported at the CPPCC  National Committee Standing Committee included Zhu Rongji, Qian  Qichen, Wen Jiabao, and Wei Jianxing. Standing Committee  members have presented very good opinions and suggestions on  major state affairs. The Standing Committee meetings have made  new headway in participating in administration and discussion of  state affairs. In other respects of participating in  administration and discussion of state affairs, special  committees under the CPPCC National Committee presented 24  important investigation reports in 1993. These reports were  about stabilizing grain and cotton output, rescue and  preservation of historical relics which can be destroyed by the  construction of the Three Gorges Project, the construction of  high-tech industrial development zones, and projects that  minority areas can carry out to eliminate poverty and develop  their economy. The CPC Central Committee and relevant  departments under the State Council have attached great  importance to these reports. Many views expressed in the  reports have been adopted.    [Liu Hanzhen in Mandarin] I am from the SOUTH CHINA  MORNING POST. You just mentioned that the CPC National Committee  was involved in fighting corruption in 1993. What conclusions  have you come up with? How corrupt is the Chinese Government?  What kind of work has to be carried out? Have there been any  CPPCC National Committee members who have been investigated or  found to have committed corruption?    [Li Luye] The CPPCC National Committee not only gives the  CPC  Central Committee and the State Council its all-out support in  their fight against corruption, we have also taken an active  part in the fight. Six investigation groups, with CPPCC  National Committee members as heads or deputy heads, have  investigated the anticorruption struggles waged by four  ministries under the State Council and eight provinces. The  fifth session of the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee  also specially discussed the anticorruption issues, and promptly  reflected the views and requests of people in all circles.  During their discussion on fighting corruption, CPPCC National  Committee members unanimously agreed that the struggle was an  important matter having a close bearing on the survival of our  state. The anticorruption struggle will continue to be a  formidable and protracted mission. With regard to whether any  CPPCC National Committee members have been investigated for  having committed corruption, I can tell you that recently the  National Committee's Standing Committee adopted a decision to  dismiss Liu Huanzhen from his posts as a Standing Committee  member and as a CPPCC National Committee member because of his  involvement in fraud.    [Unidentified Reporter] I am reporter from China Central  Television. Spokesman, since 1993, China has come up with many  measures and plans for reform, such as reform of the financial  and taxation systems. Which of these measures and plans are  based on proposals presented or drawn up by the CPPCC National  Committee for Reform?    [Li Luye] The proposal presented by our Economic Committee  on  the state's economic situation and solutions to the economic  problems -- the proposal on intensifying macroscopic regulation  and control and curbing inflation -- has been adopted by the CPC  Central Committee and relevant departments under the State  Council.    [Huang Zhikuan] I am Huang Zhikuan from the CENTRAL NEWS  AGENCY in Taipei. Does the CPPCC National Committee have any  new plans for its Taiwan operations? And how does the CPPCC  National Committee view the efforts made by the Taiwan  authorities in fighting for international space for activities  [sheng huo kong jian]? Thank you.    [Li Luye] The CPPCC National Committee has been making  positive efforts in supporting the national cause of achieveing  peaceful reunification. In 1993, the CPPCC National Committee  received many countrymen from Taiwan. With regard to promoting  the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the CPPCC National  Committee thinks that it is significant to promote mutual and  common understanding in this regard. We will continue to  intensify our work in this regard. With regard to your question  about Taiwan's fight for survival space [sheng cun kong jian], I  think that this is not a problem about fighting for survival,  but a move attempting to create two Chinas or one China and one  Taiwan.    [Moderator] This news briefing has now come to end an end.  There will be several news conferences. You are welcome to  attend. Thank you all.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Delors warns of 'crisis and stagnation' IF THE Maastricht treaty on European union is not ratified, there will be 'stagnation and crisis', Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, warned yesterday. He predicted that the Community would then turn into a free trade area. 'At the smallest confrontation between member states, there would be a new crisis, until in the end the free trade area itself would disappear,' he said in an interview with Figaro newspaper. Asked about the implications if the treaty were to be defeated in the French referendum, Mr Delors said: 'There would be a general panic, because France has made its mark on the construction of Europe ever since the beginning. And as far as I am concerned, the dream would have been shattered.' Mr Delors acknowledged that he and the Commission had both come in for criticism: 'I am contested, that is true, but so much the better: it proves that I am not an antiseptic and immovable bureaucrat behind his desk.' But he parried the implication that the Commission was to blame for the current crisis in the Community. 'The Commission is under scrutiny, but it is not alone: there is also the council of ministers, the European parliament and the national governments.' A narrow majority among the 17 European commissioners has come out in favour of letting a small number of European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries into the Community, without any further institutional changes beyond those already contained in the Maastricht treaty, writes David Buchan in Brussels. This view, emerging from a confidential Commission discussion on Wednesday, will be relayed to tomorrow's meeting of EC foreign ministers, called to prepare next week's Lisbon summit where enlargement will be discussed. The recent surge in anti-Maastricht opinion has changed the Commission's prevailing sentiment, which had been that key changes like more majority voting - beyond that enshrined in the Maastricht pact - would be needed for a more numerous Community to function efficiently. The predominant Brussels view is now that, for a three or four Efta states to join the EC in the 1990s, only technical adjustment to the number of commissioners and MEPs would be necessary.</p>

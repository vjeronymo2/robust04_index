			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Middle East: Crackdown on Hamasraises stakes for Arafat - The PLO leader's choices Mr Yassir Arafat's crackdown on the extremist Islamic Hamas group has saved the Middle East peace process but has polarised Palestinian politics and raised the prospect of internal Palestinian conflict. Last week's kidnapping and death of an Israeli soldier during a raid by Israeli forces on the kidnappers' hideout, starkly revealed the difficult political choices facing the Palestinian leader. Mr Arafat must keep the peace process going by conceding Israeli and western demands for a decisive blow against Hamas, at least its military wing. However, this would risk conflict or the possibility of continuing delays in the tortuous peace negotiations which each day erode his popular support. Israeli cabinet ministers yesterday praised Mr Arafat's arrests of up to 300 Hamas activists in Gaza and decision to disarm the militant organisation which opposes peace with Israel. The Israeli government, embarrassed by the fact that the kidnapped soldier was being held in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and not, as they had insisted, in Palestinian-controlled Gaza, said they would today lift the closure imposed on Gaza after the kidnapping. The cabinet also said it would resume suspended peace talks in Cairo tomorrow with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said over the weekend that Israel was satisfied with Mr Arafat's 'readiness to counteract the dangers of Hamas'. However, Mr Arafat's moves against the underground movement has divided Palestinian society. Hundreds of Hamas supporters, angry at the continuing crackdown, rioted near a Jewish settlement in Gaza yesterday and threw stones at Israeli police. On Saturday, up to 1,500 Hamas supporters demonstrated outside the Gaza central prison demanding the release of their activists. Palestinian police, anticipating further protests, yesterday increased security across the Strip. Weekend statements by Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, threatened Israel with more kidnappings and Mr Arafat with bloodshed if he continued his crackdown. Hamas officials accused Mr Arafat of being the 'poodle' of Israel, of carrying out 'Zionist' policy by proxy, and of passing information to Israel about the location of the kidnappers. Hamas also blamed Mr Arafat for the death of three of its gunmen in the raid on Friday. 'If these arrests continue, Qassam brigades will reply by setting the Gaza Strip ablaze on the heads of the Zionists and their lackeys,' one statement warned. Despite Hamas threats of violence, both groups know they have more to lose than gain from confrontation. Mr Arafat's aides have repeatedly warned that the benefits of the peace process are still too few and limited to ensure success of the pro-peace forces. Furthermore, Hamas is believed to have at least 15-20 per cent bedrock support in Gaza as well as a motivated and disciplined underground military wing. Hamas has built up an impressive social welfare network across the Gaza Strip and West Bank, of schools, health clinics, the Islamic University in Gaza and benevolent societies that continue to spread the doctrine of Islamic values and build the organisation. Hamas will be cautious to risk a conflict which could see its institutions destroyed and leave it blamed by Palestinians for civil war. 'Hamas and the PLO have to live together in Gaza,' said Mr Roni Shaked, a Hamas expert at the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. 'Both of them know if they cross the red lines they are going to destroy what they have achieved, because civil war inside Gaza Strip means the end of everything, and probably the return of Israeli occupation.' But Mr Arafat must meet Israeli and western demands and strike a blow at Hamas to keep the peace process going. He is clearly hoping to separate the political wing of Hamas from the military wing, and has indicated he will not release detainees associated with the Qassam brigades. If his strategy pays off, and Hamas, concerned about the potential threat to its institutions and convinced that eventually the tide of Islam will be triumphant, allows him to curb Qassam, then the threat of widescale violence could be avoided. In the long term, Mr Arafat knows the battle against Hamas must be fought economically and culturally, alleviating the poverty and sense of alienation which breed extremism.</p>

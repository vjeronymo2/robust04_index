			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Reform of tax on dividends sought THE Institute of Directors has called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take immediate action to reform the system of advance corporation tax. In a submission to the chancellor, it calls the existing system a 'burden' which is distorting company investment and location decisions more seriously in the UK than in other countries. Surplus ACT - tax payments on dividends that cannot be offset against mainstream corporation tax liabilities - has come under increasing attack recently. A study released last week showed that ACT payments among quoted companies rose to 34 per cent of the total tax charge in 1991, compared with 24 per cent in the year before. Mr Lamont has admitted that ACT is a handicap for UK companies earning profits abroad. The IoD says it would prefer a return to the net UK rate system, which operated until 1965, by which the tax repayment to shareholders paying less than the basic rate of income tax was limited to the difference between the UK and foreign tax rate at which they were liable.</p>

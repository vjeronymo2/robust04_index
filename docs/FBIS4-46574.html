After completing the academy, he was assigned Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense Military Structural Development and Reform  Directorate liaison chief. The RF Ministry of Defense  Information-Analysis Center was founded in 1992. Pavel  Semenovich became its Chief -- Deputy Chief of the Military  Structural Development and Reform Directorate.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Pavel Semenovich, I  recently had the opportunity to meet with many leaders of  defense enterprises. We all know that the defense industry is in  an economically difficult position that is associated with the  reduction of orders. The leaders understand the need for these  reductions, however, they are making complaints against the  state which has not defined what it will buy from them. This, as  I understand it, is associated with the absence of a military  doctrine in the Russian Federation and with the uncertainty of  the future structure of our Armed Forces. There probably should  be an Armed Forces structural development program that will be  supported by an arms program. What is the situation in the  Russian Federation on this issue?    [Zolotarev] You are correct, the absence of an officially  adopted Russian military doctrine is already making itself  known. There never was a military doctrine in the Soviet Union  as an integrated, officially adopted document that reflects the  system of fundamental views on the possible nature of war, the  methods for conducting it, military structural development and  preparation of the country and the Armed Forces for war. It was  thought that these issues found adequate reflection in the  speeches of Party and state leaders and in Party and government  decisions. Therefore, the question on the need to formulate a  military doctrine as a separate document was practically never  raised. All the more so that the opinion existed and exists that  this approach can also be preserved in Russia. However, that  point of view is erroneous. And the fact is not only that the  speeches of the representatives of the federal organs of rule  are frequently contradictory in nature and cannot permit us to  compile an integrated picture of views on issues of military  doctrine. The essence is something else. The period of global  confrontation of the two ideologies and the two irreconcilable  systems has quite naturally resulted in adequate clarity of  doctrinal positions.    Now the state's policy in accordance with the RF Law "On  Security" must be structured while proceeding from the need to  ensure the protection of the interests of the individual,  society and the state. Military doctrine must also be  subordinate to that goal. This approach is characteristic for  the majority of the world's developed countries. However, it  suggests the presence of an established mechanism of activity of  the organs of state rule for the analysis of vitally important  interests of the individual, society and the state and the  detection of existing and potential threats to these interests,  the determination of directions for their neutralization in all  spheres of security -- economic, military, ecological, etc.    These directions are normally reflected in the national  security concept. In turn, the national security concept must  serve as the basis for planning the state's activities in the  spheres of politics, economics, military policy, ecology, etc.    In the military policy sphere, the security concept serves  to  form the military doctrine and the Armed Forces structural  development concept. While considering that changes of the  above-named interests and threats to these interests are  sufficiently dynamic in nature, the security concept is made  more precise each year. When necessary, changes are made to  military doctrine and to the Armed Forces structural development  concept.    Unfortunately, that mechanism of activity of the organs of  state rule has not yet been formed in Russia. However, we do  have the fundamental law for the realization of that mechanism.  That is the Law "On the Security of the Russian Federation". The  key organ in that system -- the RF Security Council -- is  building up its capabilities. Therefore, I suggest that in the  near future our organs of state rule will also operate along  that same classic scheme as other of the world's most developed  countries.    Nevertheless, in Russian Armed Forces structural development  we cannot wait until they give us a Russian security concept and  military doctrine. We are also not waiting.    The RF Ministry of Defense Military Structural Development  and Reform Directorate was formed practically simultaneously  with the decision on the formation of the Russian Armed Forces  in May 1992. This was the very first directorate in the Russian  Ministry of Defense.    Two months after the issuance of the RF Presidential Edict  on  the Formation of the Russian Armed Forces, their appearance in  the immediate future and long-term was discussed in the Security  Council. The Ministry of Defense was assigned the task of  submitting an Armed Forces structural development concept to the  RF President by 1 September 1992.    The Military Structural Development and Reform Directorate,  jointly with the General Staff and other Ministry of Defense  directorates, developed that concept and submitted it for the  review of the Russian President on 31 August 1992. It did not  receive official approval but Armed Forces structural  development is proceeding in accordance with its primary  provisions. Active work on the military doctrine began during  the spring of this year under the aegis of the Security Council.  The Ministry of Defense very actively participated in this work.  The primary provisions of the Russian military doctrine should  have been reviewed in the Security Council in October 1993 in  accordance with the President's task. At the same time, work is  proceeding in the Ministry of Defense to make more precise the  previously developed Russian Armed Forces structural development  concept. So, toward the end of 1993, we will have all of the  primary documents that define military policy and Armed Forces  structural development. However, in your question, you linked  military doctrine and the Armed Forces structural development  concept with the plan for weapons and military equipment orders.  The interrelation is obvious but the difficulties with the  defense order are associated not so much with these documents as  with the absence of a defense budget and with inadequate  financing of the Armed Forces. Requirements for weapons and  military equipment are known but the order is being determined  not by our requirements but by the state's capabilities.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Can you note some of  the  distinctive features of the draft military doctrine?    [Zolotarev] Yes, I can. It encompasses not only the Armed  Forces, the concept of military force is being introduced which  includes the Armed Forces, the internal troops, the border  troops, and all other military security support men and  equipment which are prescribed by the Law "On Security".  Therefore, aspects of not only external but also internal  security are reflected in the military doctrine.    The experience of recent years has taught us that the Armed  Forces should not participate in the resolution of internal  problems with the exception of participation in the elimination  of natural disasters, catastrophes, and the transportation of  required men and equipment to reinforce and supply the internal  troops but no more. However, it provides for the accomplishment  of peacekeeping missions by the Armed Forces as it occurred in  South Osetia, Moldova, and also within the framework of the UN  decisions in Yugoslavia.    The military doctrine is based upon the concept of the  state's defense capabilities and not on defensive sufficiency.  Right now we have been compelled to utilize this concept due to  the severe economic situation in the country. When the economy  is stronger, then we will probably return to the concept of  defensive sufficiency.    While assessing possible military threats to the state, the  draft military doctrine views local wars and armed conflicts as  more probable than a large-scale war. A large-scale war is  viewed only as a possible variant of the undesirable development  of an armed conflict or local wars.    Primarily deterrent functions are assigned to nuclear  weapons, that is, they are seen not as a weapon for conducting  war but as a political weapon that is designed for deterrence  from unleashing a large-scale war.    A section dedicated to the political goals of the  utilization  of military force and the state's missions in the sphere of  defense in peacetime, in a threatened period and in wartime is  contained in the first portion of the draft military doctrine.  The new issues of socio-political support of military security  are included in this section.    The second section contains the doctrine's purely military  bases which reflect the purely military aspect. This section  characterizes the possible nature of wars and military  conflicts, the goal of the employment of the Armed Forces, the  distinctive features of the initial period of war and the  missions of the Armed Forces in a large war and in military  conflicts. The principles and directions of military structural  development are reflected in classic form. The draft doctrine  does not provide for revolutionary structural changes of the  Armed Forces. The task is assigned to scientifically  substantiate, by 1995, military reform until the year 2000,  while taking into account the state's material and financial  capabilities.    The section on military-technical policy reflects the  principles of its conduct while considering the fact that the  form of ownership is changing in our state. The RF  military-industrial complex's principles of development are  reflected here.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What is the fate of the  Unified Armed Forces that the CIS previously planned to have?    [Zolotarev] The cooperation of the RF Armed Forces with the  armed forces of the states that we call the "near abroad" is  being carried out both on a bilateral basis and on a  multilateral basis within the CIS and now within the framework  of the Treaty on Collective Security. We think that it is this  Treaty that can and should become the center of  military-political cooperation of all CIS states.    Right now, when all 15 states that signed the treaty on 15  May 1992 have ratified the Treaty on Collective Security, we  face the task of more rapidly stepping up the mechanism for its  implementation. Definite steps in that direction were undertaken  at the Council of Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs  sessions that recently took place. Specifically, decisions were  made to reorganize the CIS Unified Armed Forces High Command  into the CIS Member-States Military Cooperation Coordination  Staff. We have in mind that this staff will become the working  organ of the Council of Ministers of Defense. Its functions will  specifically include summarizing the proposals of the ministries  (committees) of defense of the Commonwealth states on issues of  military cooperation, preparation of draft agreements on these  issues, development of the plans for their implementation and  monitoring the accomplishment of these plans. Decisions were  also made on initial steps for the implementation of the Treaty  on Collective Security and on preparation of a draft Agreement,  in accordance with which the member-states of the Treaty on  Collective Security will --in the event of the emergence of the  appropriate threat -- create Coalition Defense Forces.    So, a separate decision was made on the creation of  Coalition  Defense forces on Tajik territory and the mission, composition  and functions of the Unified Command Authorities of these forces  were defined for the purpose of adopting urgent collective  measures to stabilize the situation in the Republic of  Tajikistan.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do you assess  Russia's interests in the south of the CIS?    [Zolotarev] First of all we are interested in the stability  of these states and the restoration of economic ties with them.  Unfortunately, we still haven't been able to totally preserve  stability. Therefore, interests arise that are associated with  the Russian Federation's military security. We have been  compelled, along with the other CIS countries, to provide not  only protection but also defense in a number of sectors of the  state border of the former USSR. The last CIS Council of  Ministers of Defense session was dedicated to providing security  of the border in the south of the CIS.    I think that the CIS countries have very many, first of all,  common economic interests. Already right now these interests are  beginning to objectively facilitate integration processes and  strengthen stability in the CIS and also dictate positive  progress in politics. It is easier to negotiate the economic and  political crisis together than to get out of it alone.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Do you propose to have  a  document on military reform in the near future?    [Zolotarev] There will not be a separate document. These  issues will find reflection in the Armed Forces structural  development concept.</p>

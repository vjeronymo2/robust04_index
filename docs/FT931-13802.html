			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Unisys posts strong earnings growth UNISYS, the US computer and defence manufacturer, reported strong earnings gains for the fourth quarter and year. It added that it expected significant earnings growth in 1993, setting the company on the path to recovery after three years of heavy losses. Unisys's strong results contrast sharply with the heavy losses reported by IBM a day earlier. Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, said: 'In a very difficult year for our industry, we successfully turned the company round and exceeded all our financial and operational goals.' For 1992, Unisys reported net income of Dollars 361.2m, or Dollars 1.40 per share, including 36 cents per share tax gain from loss carry-forwards. In the previous year, it reported a net loss of Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 9.37, which included a special charge of Dollars 1.2bn. The net income data exclude preferred stock dividends of Dollars 122m per year. Revenue declined in 1992 to Dollars 8.42bn from Dollars 8.7bn in 1991, or Dollars 8.57bn adjusted for the sale of the Timeplex subsidiary in June 1991. While IBM's sales of mainframe computers declined by a double-digit percentage in 1992, Unisys said sales of its mainframe computer showed double-digit gains over 1991. For the fourth quarter, Unisys made net income of Dollars 139.2m, or 58 cents a share, including 15 cents per share from the tax benefits of operating loss carry-forwards. Last time, it recorded net income of Dollars 80.5m, or 31 cents. Revenue of Dollars 2.26bn was higher than expected, the company said, but below the Dollars 2.46bn in the fourth quarter of 1991. Mr Unruh said that '1992 was an outstanding turnround year. Revenue stabilised, profitability improved, and cash flow from operations exceeded Dollars 1.1bn - well over our goal of Dollars 700m'. Debt was reduced nearly Dollars 800m to about Dollars 2.5bn. Debt net of cash is now less than Dollars 1.7bn, the lowest level since the formation of the company in 1986 from the merger of Burroughs and Sperry. Mr Unruh also announced a 'major initiative' to build information services capabilities. 'For 1993, we expect to show further significant progress in profitability and to further strengthen our balance sheet in spite of global economic weakness, particularly in Europe and Japan. We have based our business plans on flat revenues.' The Unisys share price gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 12 5/8 on news of the fourth-quarter performance, but closed at Dollars 12 1/2 for a net gain of Dollars  5/8 on the day.</p>

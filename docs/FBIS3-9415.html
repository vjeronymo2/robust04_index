			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Komnenic, leader of the Serbian </F> Renewal Movement (SPO), by Albena Shkodrova; place and date not  given: "`It Is Possible That Milosevic Is Doing a Deal With  Greece'"]    [Text] [Shkodrova] At the conference of the Helsinki  Civic Assembly you said that Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia must  get together and discuss the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] problem. Was this an invitation?    [Komnenic] Of course, the Macedonian issues are first of all  issues of those who live in the republic and call themselves  Macedonians. We can think whatever we like on this issue, but  this is how they feel. We, Serbs, you, Bulgarians, and the  Greeks must accept this as a reality.    Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia, as neighboring states which  are  on their way to becoming democracies, are responsible for  preventing Macedonia from becoming a second Bosnia. I list only  our three countries, because I do not think that Albania will  cooperate.    We must help Macedonia to find its place within a  politically  and economically stable framework in Europe. We all are related  in this matter, and our interests depend on one another.    I am convinced that after the experience in Bosnia there  will  be no war in Macedonia or Kosovo. However, democratic Serbia is  prepared to facilitate the solution of any problem in the  Balkans, even the Macedonian one. This is a major issue for  Bulgarian policy and you cannot ignore it. Naturally, we  respect this. Simultaneously, however, Serbia should not get  involved in the Macedonian issue.    Greece's decision to impose an embargo on the republic is  not  prudent at all. On the other hand, Bulgaria's immediate  recognition of Macedonia -- I think that this was proposed by  your current ambassador to Rome, Stefan Tafrov -- was a very  prudent step.    The three states must do everything possible in order to  preserve the balance in the Balkans and facilitate the  withdrawal of the U.S. "Blue Helmets" from Macedonia. I think  that we could ensure peace here much easier than U.S. soldiers.    [Shkodrova] Do you think that the three states could reach  an agreement on Macedonia?    [Komnenic] It is not our business to resolve this issue.  However, we must manage our relations with Macedonia very  prudently -- without any expansion claims. We must be  exceptionally careful and restrained, rather than follow an  aggressive policy like Papandreou's present one. It is my  personal conviction that Serbia will never enter a conflict  because of Macedonia.    [Shkodrova] Do you really think that Yugoslavia will follow  the policy that you outline?    [Komnenic] This is the policy of Serbia's democratic  opposition. I am not describing to you Belgrade's official  position.    [Shkodrova] Does Serbian public opinion coincide with yours?    [Komnenic] No. Perhaps only that of part of the people. In  Serbia there are radical nationalists who consider Macedonia a  southern Yugoslav province, precisely as there are Bulgarians  who think that not only Pirin, but the entire Macedonia is part  of the Bulgarian culture, nation, and territory. The same  apples to Greece.    I support the idea of a united Europe, in which borders will  not be important. We in the Balkans are still prisoners of  factors that have already been overcome. I would like to see  the day when at Kalotina [Bulgarian-Serbian border checkpoint] I  will not have to show my passport, precisely as Frenchmen do not  show their passports when they enter Germany.    Integrated in such a way the Balkans could join Europe. This  is why the Yugoslav issue is so tragic. Yugoslavia should have  entered Europe as one entity -- then it would not have been  important whether Serbia, Croatia, Serbian Krajina, and Bosnia  were parts of it.    It does not appear to be important for 21st century Europe  how many citizens Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece have.    For example, I am very proud of the fact that many young  Bulgarian intellectuals from Bosilegrad and Dimitrovgrad are  members of my party. Some of them were candidates at the last  parliamentary elections.    [Shkodrova] Nevertheless, if Milosevic remains in power,  which is very probable, do you think that Serbia will have any  claims on Macedonia?    [Komnenic] No. I do not believe that Milosevic would like  to fight on several fronts.    [Shkodrova] However, what will happen if the war in Bosnia  somehow expands?    [Komnenic] The Kosovo issue will certainly emerge -- not a  conflict, but the issue. This is the greatest Serbian issue,  greater even than the Bosnian one. As you know, Kosovo is not  only a territory and its population, but that part of the  country where Serbian culture was founded, and where most of our  monasteries are. Thus, for us Macedonia is a secondary problem,  if it is a problem at all. It only consists of respecting the  human rights of the Serbian minority. However, we think that  this issue should be resolved in accordance with the Helsinki  Agreement.    Thus, I do not think that Milosevic has any claims. The only  thing I do not know and I cannot say anything with great  certainty is whether Milosevic is making a deal with the Greeks.  Pure logic compels us to assume the existence of such a  possibility.</p>

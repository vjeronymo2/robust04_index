			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker caution on Gas A CAUTIOUS line adopted by the company's own broker, Hoare Govett, together with some sizeable and determined selling by a number of the big US investment houses, left British Gas the worst performer in the Footsie. Gas shares dropped almost 5 per cent, closing 13 lower at 252p with turnover approaching the 10m-mark. Dealers said Hoare Govett had triggered the slide by telling its clients it expected British Gas to face an investigation by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). Also upsetting the shares were suggestions - denied by Hoare Govett - that the broker had been selling stock on behalf of British Gas employees. The continuing mild weather in the UK, which has brought worries of impending profits downgrades for 1992, was another factor depressing the shares. Hoare Govett said it had been expressing caution after the recent strong rise in Gas shares, 'given the distinct possibility of an MMC reference in the light of the stance adopted by Ofgas, the industry regulator.' British Gas and Ofgas have been at loggerheads since the regulator insisted on a series of measures to encourage competition in UK gas markets. Wellcome setback Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome lost some of its recent hefty gains after doubts surfaced over the success of a new anti-AIDS drug cocktail. The shares rose to a new high in early trading but fell back after a newspaper report suggested tests on the new mixture were halted because they had failed. The shares slipped 34 to 1091p on turnover of 2.6m. Wellcome sought to minimise the damage caused by the report, stating: 'Failed is the wrong word ..We were looking for one thing and we found another.' The mixture combines Wellcome's herpes treatment acyclovir and anti-AIDS drug Retrovir. Wellcome was testing acyclovir on the CMV (herpes) virus in AIDS patients but found that a mixture of acyclovir and Retrovir together had an effect on AIDS itself. Wertheim Schroder, the US house, said that Retrovir's use in Aids was a small part of Wellcome and becoming smaller. By 1993 the broker forecasts a Wellcome share price in excess of Pounds 15 a share. Sainsbury shock The food retailing sector saw early gains replaced by hefty losses after J Sainsbury, the UK's leading supermarket and superstores chain, outlined details of another bout of price-cutting. Dealers said the big institutions had recoiled from the prospect of yet more reductions in profit margins for the supermarket groups. A wave of selling pressure left Sainsbury shares a net 14 lower at 359p; earlier in the session the stock touched 375p. Turnover for the day totalled 3.5m shares. Of Sainsbury's main rivals, Tesco, driven up to 236p at the outset, turned off to close a net 7 down at 225p, after 224p on turnover of 7.4m shares. Argyll, which controls the Safeway chain of supermarkets, fell away to close 8 lower at 274p, having been as high as 282p. Asda, which many retailing specialists view as the most vulnerable of the big food stores to another price-cutting war, settled a penny lower at 32p. Analysts said the latest outbreak of price-cutting came as no real surprise; 'January usually sees a series of price promotions and until the details of Sainsbury's move are revealed, such as what lines are being targeted and how big the price cuts, it's difficult to quantify how damaging this move could be,' said one. He added that if the marketing promotions involved a large number of key, staple foods, such as bread and baked beans, 'then it will obviously have a major impact on profits'. Last year saw a series of 'mini' price wars, principally triggered by Tesco and Asda. The supermarkets also have to contend with increased costs caused by Sunday opening and an attack on UK food retailing by overseas groups such as Germany's Aldi. Chemicals group Laporte dipped sharply in a rising market in reaction to trimmed profit forecasts from broker James Capel, which had previously been at the high end of analysts' forecasts. Mr David Ingles of Capels said he had reduced earnings per share estimates for 1991 by 2.5p to 41.4. and for 1992 by 5p to 50p. The move, made before Christmas but re-iterated by Capel's sales team yesterday, reflected dull trading towards the end of the year and the expectation that early 1992 would continue to be difficult. Mr Ingles added that the stock had become over-valued. The shares fell 17 to 608p with just under 1m traded. Kleinwort Benson was said to have been the main force in the retailing sector after issuing a series of forecast changes. These were said to have included downgrades for Kingfisher and and WH Smith. The latter, due to announce interims later this month, dropped 7 to 447p, while Kingfisher slipped 9 to 464p on heavy turnover of 2.6m. Dixons, scheduled to report interims on Wednesday, gave back some of their recent gains, closing 5 off at 204p. Ratners, the troubled jewellery retailer, dipped 2 more to 22p with a hefty 5.3m shares moving through the Seaq system. On the plus side Sears rose a further 5 to 97p, reportedly boosted by a Hoare Govett recommendation while Storehouse added 6 at 97p. The attack by the Labour Party on the profitability of the regional electricity companies failed to cause as big damage to the individual stocks, but damaged the water stocks. There were suggestions, however, that one of the big integrated securities house was preparing a note suggesting a switch out of the regional electricity stocks and into the power generators, National Power, PowerGen, Scottish Hydro and Scottish Power, all of which showed rises of around 2 during the session. Water stocks, on the other hand, attracted persistent selling with fund managers said to be increasingly worried by the prospect of a Labour victory which could lead to the water companies being renationalised, as Labour has consistently said it will do if it is elected. South West fell 7 to 307p. Grand Metropolitan picked up sharply after the wines and spirits group said it had agreed to purchase the 75 per cent of shares in the Cinzano company it does not already own. The stock closed 20 higher at 898p. Other brewers outperformed the market as investors considered that recovery prospects for the sector look more cheery than in many other areas. Some traders pointed to a buy note from Daiwa, the Japanese house. Although Japanese investors were celebrating their new year holiday, the note, which focused on Grand Met, Guinness, Allied-Lyons and Whitbread, added pressure to a sector with very few sellers. Guinness rose 23 to 542p on turnover of 3.5m. ICI was boosted in early trading by a positive report in the British medical press on one of its drugs used to treat breast cancer patients. However, the impact of the report, which is said to be the world's largest collaborative cancer study, faded later as ICI slipped in New York. The shares in London closed 5 better with 1.8m traded after being up 16 at one stage. British Aerospace was one of the weakest stocks in the FT-SE 100. The shares fell 15 to 291p, almost 5 per cent, amid continuing concern about the long term trend of the dollar and the company's cash position. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (36).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that China has  always opposed illegal emigration and will stop any such  activity it discovers with effective measures.    In reply to a reporter's question at the foreign ministry  news conference, Wu Jianmin said: China has also noticed that  illegal emigration is an international phenomenon. Ringleaders  of some illegal emigration rackets and their headquarters are  not based in China. China would like to join hands with other  countries in stopping illegal emigrants, especially cracking  down on ringleaders and organizations involved in illegal  emigration.    Wu said: If illegal migrants discovered are confirmed to be  of China nationality, China would like to cooperate with  concerned countries in bringing them back.</p>

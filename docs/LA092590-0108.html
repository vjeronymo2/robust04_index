			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA;  </P> <P> BOY FREED OF CHARGE IN PLAYMATE'S DEATH  </P> <P> At the request of the victim's mother, Orange County prosecutors on Monday  dismissed criminal charges against a 12-year-old La Palma boy accused of the  fatal shooting of his best friend.  </P> <P> The boy, who faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, was scheduled to go on  trial Monday before Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney said that he discussed the case with the  victim's mother, Paula LaFortune, and learned she did not want the prosecution  to continue.  </P> <P> The critical issue, Romney said, was whether the youth had the knowledge that  what he was doing could be dangerous.  </P> <P> "The victim's mother told us that the two boys were so close, he would never  have pointed the gun at her son if he'd known he could have hurt him," Romney  said. "She said this boy had suffered enough for what he'd done and she hoped  we would not go forward." JERRY HICKS  </P></p>

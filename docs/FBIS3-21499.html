The end of the Cold War has created new  opportunities for arms control and disarmament. One of Japan's  major goals is to strengthen the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty] system for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.  That is why one of the first international policy decisions I  made after becoming prime minister asserted Japan's strong  support for the indefinite extension of the NPT beyond 1995.    There have been reports in the last few days that Japan  might  change its policy should North Korea arm itself with nuclear  weapons. I wish the people who write such reports would come to  Japan and talk to our people. Then they would realize how deeply  we feel about this issue. Let me be very clear on this point: I  see no possibility that Japan would decide to become a nuclear  power. Such a policy would be against Japan's national interest.  We, like you, are very concerned about the current situation on  the Korean peninsula. And we are determined, working closely  with government leaders in the Republic of Korea and America, to  help settle this issue.    On the issue of conventional arms control, Japan also is  actively involved. We are the only major nation in the world  which is not selling any weapons to other countries. We have  proposed a UN-supervised system to make it easier to monitor  international sales of conventional arms. We want to broaden  this system, to make it more effective.  [passage omitted]</p>

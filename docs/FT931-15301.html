			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / N Sea Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn investment 'at risk' NORTH SEA oil and gas producers yesterday warned the government that offshore investment of Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn is at risk if it tries to stop the development of gas-fired power stations as part of its energy review. 'Government intervention in the free market for gas could risk the abandonment or delay of 25 North Sea projects . . . and imperil 55,000 jobs,' said Mr John Parziale, president of the UK Offshore Operators Association and managing director of Marathon Oil's UK operations. The jobs affected would be in the design, construction and servicing of North Sea projects as well as 5,000 permanent jobs on platforms producing gas. Mr Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada Hess's UK arm, said he was having difficulty in selling gas from two of his fields because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the review. 'Gas is noticeably more difficult to market than it was three months ago,' he said. Offshore operators say they are worried that any government intervention will damage confidence in the industry to such an extent that companies will take their investment elsewhere. The row between British Gas and its regulator, Ofgas, has cost about 5,000 jobs and a fall in turnover of Pounds 100m among the gas contracting and manufacturing industries, said Mr John Cull, president of the Society of British Gas Industries.</p>

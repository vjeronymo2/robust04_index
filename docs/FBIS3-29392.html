Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and Russian Vice  Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov are scheduled to meet in Moscow  Monday and Tuesday to discuss both nations' claims to a handful  of Russian-held islands off the eastern tip of Hokkaido.    It will be the first working-level session to be held since  last September's visit to Tokyo by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin.    Fukuda and other Japanese negotiators are expected to  propose  expanding visits to Japan by the residents of the disputed  islands and to let citizens of both countries know about a  jointly-edited collection of historical materials regarding the  territorial dispute, the sources said.    If the talks progress, Hata will probably visit Moscow on  March 19-21, the sources said.    Tokyo will also be watching to see what influence Russian  conservatives and rightists, who are opposed to the reversion of  the islands to Japan and who did well in last December's  parliamentary elections, have on the territorial discussion.    Both sides are also expected to exchange views on bilateral  trade, North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program,  and strife in the Balkans, the sources said.    Tokyo claims Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai  group, which were overrun by the army of the former Soviet Union  at the end of World War II.</p>

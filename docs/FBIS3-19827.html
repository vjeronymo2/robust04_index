			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso by </F> Pedro Oliveira in Brussels--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Unidentified announcer] The enlargement of the  European Union [EU] reached deadlock today with the entry of the  four new members being vetoed by Britain and Spain, who fear  losing the capacity to block decisions. Over to our Brussels  correspondent Pedro Oliveira:    [Begin recording] [Oliveira] [passage omitted] Everything  has  been postponed to next weekend's meeting in Ioannina, Greece,  where the EU foreign ministers will have their last chance to  avert a crisis. [passage omitted]    There is a possibility of adding political appendices which  would meet the objections of Britain and Spain, but these would  have no formal legal guarantees, and London and Madrid want  guarantees. Britain actually wants population sizes taken into  account -- the large versus the small, in other words. Portugal  is adamantly against this:    [Barroso] Any compromises introduced at this stage taking  population figures into account, lending greater weight to the  larger countries, cannot and will on no account be accepted by  Portugal.    [Oliveira] Durao Barroso thinks London and Madrid are being  unrealistic if they think the other 10 members will change their  mind. [passage omitted] The Portuguese foreign minister is  averse to additional protocols and amendments, but admits that  there may be a political way out.    [Barroso] We are open to a binding compromise of a political  nature, provided that -- and I repeat -- no idea of  discrimination among the member states is brought in through the  back door.

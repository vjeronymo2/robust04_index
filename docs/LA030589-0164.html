			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: WESTSIDE GROWTH SLOW  </P> <P> Despite all the new apartment buildings going up in Mar Vista, Palms and  Brentwood the Westside has grown by only about 79,000 since the 1980 census,  according to a new study by the Los Angeles County Department of Regional  Planning.  </P> <P> Every Westside community except Marina del Rey -- which dropped from 6,693 in  1980 to 6,285 in 1988 -- gained population during the 8-year period. The  Westside's population rose from 966,150 in 1980 to 1,045,425 last year.  </P> <P> County analyst Terry Bills, a Mar Vista resident, was initially surprised by  the figures, noting that three-story apartment buildings had replaced many of  the single-family houses: "The data is right. It's simply that when we live  close to construction, we tend to see it as more pervasive than it is." David  M. Kinchen  </P></p>

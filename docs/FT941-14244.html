			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Avon council to fight its abolition The government's reform of the structure of local government is to face a further legal challenge. Avon County Council is to seek leave to apply for a judicial review of the proposals to replace it by four unitary authorities. The council has called on the government to reconsider the whole basis and process of the changes in England. It calls for the status quo to be retained because transitional costs have been 'significantly underestimated', running costs will not be reduced, and 'democratic accountability will be eroded and not strengthened'.</p>

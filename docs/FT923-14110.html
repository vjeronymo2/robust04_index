			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Ulster talks set for move to Belfast NORTHERN Ireland's unionists will this weekend march in celebration of William of Orange's victory over the Roman Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. Less than 24 hours later, their leaders will face Irish ministers over a negotiating table in Belfast. The juxtaposition - unprecedented in Northern Ireland's troubled politics - follows an agreement struck yesterday at a further session of talks involving unionists, nationalists and the UK and Irish governments in London yesterday. Negotiations have been suspended until next Wednesday, partly so that the Irish ministers can attend to other duties and partly not to clash with the drums and sashes and bowler hats of Orangemen's marches next Monday and Tuesday. The province's politics have taken an important step forward this week with all shades of unionist opinion represented in talks with the Irish government for the first time in 70 years. But yesterday's meeting appeared to have been dogged by disputes over leaks of the participants' position papers. It was 'much too early' to talk about solutions, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, said. 'What we did expect was a frank statement of everybody's positions. It was never on the cards that there would be any question of deals or compromises.' Mr John Wilson, Irish deputy prime minister, said the discussions had been 'splendid'. Wednesday's arrival of Irish ministers at Stormont, perhaps by helicopter or in limousines up the mile-long drive to the Stormont parliament buildings - seat of the former Northern Ireland government - will have particular poignancy for the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party. In 1965, he threw snowballs at Mr Sean Lemass, then Irish prime minister, who was visiting Stormont.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: April is the cruellest month - Video Beginnings are trickiest. I know because I have been staring at a blank computer screen for five minutes before tapping out 'Beginnings are trickiest.' And this is just a video column. What of a book? A symphony? A feature film? How do you make that first scratch on the page/scoresheet/script? The poet who wrote that April is the cruellest month must have had a premonition of this month's video releases. So many of them use that popular opening plot device: death or violent accident. Krzystof Kieslowski's Three Colours Blue (Artificial Eye) starts with a car crash which bereaves its heroine (Juliette Binoche) of her husband and child, awakening her to a new and frightening 'liberty.' Made in France, this is part one of the Polish director's tricouleur trilogy, soon to be followed by Equality and Fraternity. Hollywood's Forever Young (Warner), putting the cry into cryogenics, has its hero (Mel Gibson) volunteer for 50 years' deep-freeze after the death of his girlfriend in a street accident (c. 1940). Will he meet her again in the Future? Then there John Sayles's Passion Fish (Curzon), all about a writer (Mary McDonnell) finding herself after a disabling accident; Andrew Birkin's domestic black comedy The Cement Garden (Tartan), in which Dad's demise and Mum's interment in the cellar help four children to grow up in peculiar ways; and, going further back, Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (Warner), with a child's death catapulting a couple into a mystical pilgrimage, and Neil Jordan's Angel (Channel 4), in which a young man's quest for revenge and self-discovery is sparked by his witnessing of a girl's murder. Death in reel one is a triple-effect device. It is an aesthetic surprise: you do not expect a story to begin with an ending. It is an emotional shock: telling you that your feelings are to be knocked about by this story, starting now. And it leaves the surviving character(s) vulnerable and perversely renewed: so it is a kind of birth. Kieslowski's film is all about hope clambering forth from the womb of despair. It is shot like a luminous mosaic: memories and fragments from the heroine's life are assembled - a thought, a snapshot, a family chandelier, some lost chords from her composer husband's last work - in a dazzling kinetic collage. And Juliette Binoche's blank face, seeming to hold no emotions itself, becomes a kaleidoscopic reflecting surface for the life animating itself all around her. Hollywood may not go in for high art, but it knows a heart-tugging device when it trips over one. In films like Forever Young the thinking is this: 'If we start by giving the hero and the audience something they think they can't recover from - and then help them recover from it - they'll be mush in our hands by the time the final violins sing.' So we are. We grab our handkerchiefs and blow into them, drowning out the string section as Mel swoops into the arms of his 'new' beloved, finding love and hope growing from the depths of despair. But there is one big difference between High Art and Mush Art. In the first, bereavement precipitates a new life, with its terrors as well as fulfilments. In the second it just cues a quest to re-find the old life. Where a formula product like Forever Young goes round in a giant sentimental circle, filmmakers like Roeg in Don't Look Now or Neil Jordan in Angel truly shoot their main characters out into a void. (Roeg's 1973 Venice mystery trip is still a dazzler). And in-betweeners like John Sayles, a sort of Hollywood drop-out (City Of Hope) who sometimes likes to drop back in (Alligator), find a mood somewhere between cosiness and catalysis for their tales of emotional rebound. Of course there are some films in which no one dies and everyone has a good time. Since this is spring and the sun is shining, let me end by commending The Wedding Banquet, Dennis and Bambi. A gay comedy of errors; a straight comedy of teenage mischief (with Walter Matthau receiving the custard pies); and a comedy-romance-cartoon about beautiful Nature. Oh no, wait. Someone does die in Bambi. Ma Deer, and very memorably. Sorry. Handkerchiefs out again.</p>

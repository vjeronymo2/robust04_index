			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Treuhand urges pay opt-out THE TREUHAND agency responsible for the privatisation of eastern German industry has recommended that managers of enterprises under its control implement, wherever possible, the opt-out, or 'hard' clause. Implementation of the clause, forged after a wave of strikes in eastern Germany's steel, metal and electrical sectors, is an attempt by the Treuhand to allow loss-making enterprises a chance to pull out of wage contracts designed to equalise eastern and western wages by mid-1996. Losses from 300 metal enterprises under the Treuhand already account for two-thirds of turnover. The recommendation is also aimed at containing the debts, and higher than expected deficit, incurred by the agency since it was set up in 1990. Treuhand officials have confirmed that by the end of next year, when the agency is due to be dissolved, its total deficit could reach DM270bn (Dollars 166bn), or DM25bn above target. Linde, the German industrial conglomerate, is to build a DM100m (Dollars 61m) fork-lift truck factory in China with an annual capacity of 15,000, shareholders were told this week, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. The plan was just one of a series of projects under preparation in the far east, Mr Hans Meinhardt, chairman, told the annual meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a "synthesis" of the "Strategy for Poland" </F> economic development program, released by the Government Press  Office on 7 June]    [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jun--(1) Poland, opening up to the world,  is continuing along its road toward democracy, toward a social  market economy, and toward free enterprise by property sectors  with equal rights. The distribution of the costs of  transformation and the sharing out of their still limited  results give rise to reservations. This is the spirit in which  the public expressed itself during the last elections.  Consequently, a reduction in the social costs of the reforms is  a key issue for the government.    (2) Poland particularly needs a longer-term perspective  today, a strategic conception of economic development that sets  three objectives: rapid economic growth, institutional and  macroeconomic stabilization, and an improved standard of living.  That is precisely the kind of program the government is  presenting to society, which is going to be implementing it in  its own long-term interests. It is Strategy for Poland that  opens a new phase of Poland's transformation.    (3) One of the fundamental values on which Strategy for  Poland is based is the principle of distribution of results of  labor through negotiation.    In principle, conflicts of interests in the economy occur  between various social groups rather than between groups and the  state or the government. The government proposes solutions that  establish a partnerlike system of labor relations and wage  regulation. This means a decentralized wage regulation  mechanism based on negotiation, in which representatives of  employers and employees conclude collective agreements, while  the state plays the part of an arbitrator that settles disputes.    (4) Rapid economic growth should lead to an increase in the  gross domestic product [GDP] in 1994-97 of about 22 percent;  that is an annual average of about 5 percent (in constant  prices). A speeding up of the current positive trends will be  furthered through a policy of mobilizing national savings and,  in addition, through foreign investments. An improvement in the  efficiency of utilizing these resources will be assured through  improved administration of the state assets, including the  following:    --owner supervision exercised by the State Treasury, which  will gain a separate institutional identity;    --widespread use of management contracts and agreements  between state enterprises and tax offices;    --continuation of ownership transformations, including  privatization and the State Investment Funds program.    Consolidation of development trends will be furthered  through  investment in human capital, especially in improving staff  qualifications and employee retraining, as well as in scientific  research and health care.    (5) Macroeconomic stabilization and institutional stability  will meet the expectations of economic entities.    Its first aspect is the need to reduce the rate of growth of  the public debt so that, prospectively, the debt does not exceed  60 percent of the GDP by 2004. This will be ensured through an  increased domestic product and mainly through successive  reductions of the budget deficit, which should fall to about 2-3  percent in 1997 from the level of more than 6 percent in 1992  and approximately 4 percent in 1994.    The debt will also be reduced through the use of mechanisms  that turn some of it into shares in privatized state property.  This will also lead to an acceleration of structural changes  and an influx of foreign investment.    The second aspect of the policy of macroeconomic  stabilization is the reduction of price inflation under the  conditions of complete liberalization of prices. The financial  policy is directed at reducing inflation to single figures in  1997. Reducing the rate of price increases, with a simultaneous  policy of maintaining positive rates of interest in real terms,  will promote a growing trend toward savings by all entities,  stimulate investments, contribute toward growth in productivity,  and reduce the costs of servicing the public debt.    The third aspect of macroeconomic stabilization is gradual  balancing of the balance of payments and the current turnover  account so that, in 1997, the continuing negative balance of  this account should reach the level of 1.5 per cent of the GDP.    The government is consistently stabilizing the principles  of economic play and the expectations of the entities that take  part in it.    (6) Improving the standard of living is the social backbone  of Strategy for Poland. Its successful implementation will make  possible an increase of nearly 11 percent in the average real  wage in 1994-97 and a perceptible increase in the purchasing  power of the average old-age or disability pension after their  increase by about 7 percent in real terms in 1994. The  distribution of earnings has to guarantee for all at least an  elementary sense of social safety, the loss of which in recent  years has been the main cause of public frustration.    The government is undertaking the difficult and complex  reform of the system of social protection that has been  continually postponed for several years now. The realization of  the intentions in the field of economic growth creates an  opportunity for an effective and least painful implementation of  this reform.    A program of active countermeasures against unemployment has  been launched. Unemployment should decrease from nearly 16  percent now to under 14 percent at the end of 1997. We are  gradually entering a phase during which new--and often modern  and competitive--jobs will be created more quickly than old jobs  disappear.    (7) In the longer term, the international competitiveness of  the economy is a measure of economic success and a source of  cultural progress. Export production, as one of the forces that  stimulate the economy and a source of financing for imports  expenditure and efficient servicing of foreign debt, will be  given institutional, especially financial, preferences.    One of the policy instruments improving the Polish  producers'  competitiveness will be an increased influx of foreign capital,  especially of direct private investments.    (8) Poland is and always has been a part of Europe.  Consequently, its striving for early membership in the European  Union is natural. The realization of Strategy for Poland will  bring us closer to this objective, especially as its direction  is compatible with the long-term European Union program "Growth,  Employment, Competitiveness."    The integrational experiences of the past three years,  despite the financial assistance provided to Poland, have not  been completely satisfactory. The time has come when our  striving to participate in the European Union should be met with  a greater opening of its markets. We, for our part, are  intensifying adjustment activities, especially in agriculture.    (9) Reform of the economic center is a precondition for the  realization of Strategy for Poland. A reform of the economic  center will be carried out, consisting, among other things, of  the establishment of a strong State Treasury, with a separate  institutional identity, a Ministry of Economy, and a Ministry of  International Economic Integration.    (10) Historical experiences of the countries that have  already scored successes in the economic field clearly show that  the sources of success were hard work by society and enlightened  policies by those in power.    We also need lasting social peace. In time, the results of  Strategy for Poland will ensure such peace themselves. Today,  however, we also need the goodwill of all proreform forces.  These store tremendous social energy. This has to be focused  on creative efforts directed to the future.    An integral part of Strategy for Poland are 10 crucial  programs. These are directed at specific issues and operations.  Apart from these, the government package contains sets of  sector and departmental programs, as well as economic and social  policies, the implementation of which are the responsibility of  specific ministries. By assigning specific tasks to economic  ministries, Strategy for Poland itself focuses on the crucial  problems and a macroeconomic and macrosocial approach.</p>

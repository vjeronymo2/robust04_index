			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: North Sea tax change surprise THE chancellor yesterday took the oil industry by storm with a large-scale overhaul of North Sea petroleum taxes. The industry had no inkling that he would propose such sharp reductions in taxes accompanied by a virtual elimination of tax allowances. The chancellor said he would reduce the petroleum revenue tax rate on existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and eliminate it for new fields. He also said he would abolish PRT rules that allow expenditure on new exploration and development to be set against profits of existing fields. Mr Harold Hughes, head of the UK Offshore Operators' Association, an industry group, said the changes would put a 'substantial burden on the industry at a time when it is stretched economically by low oil prices and high costs'. The chancellor's changes will vastly simplify the tax regime in the North Sea, cutting 300 pages of bureaucratic legislation on PRT and updating the tax rules. 'It will be brilliant,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director of Monument Oil and Gas. 'It will make the system so much more simple.' Large companies such as British Petroleum could gain as much as Pounds 130m from the change, according to some analysts. But the operators' association believes exploration costs in the North Sea could quadruple. This would hit the smallest companies hardest and cut drilling activity. The chancellor said existing PRT rules had cost the exchequer Pounds 200m in 1991-92, rather than providing the revenue stream that was intended when PRT was introduced in 1975. He said the changes would bring Pounds 300m into the government's coffers in 1994-95 and Pounds 400m the following year. The chancellor said PRT had become increasingly anachronistic since its introduction and represented a marginal tax rate of 83 per cent.</p>

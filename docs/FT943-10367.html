			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Insomniacs win farming deals Sir, David Richardson made some useful observations on the qualities needed by our new agriculture minister ('Waldegrave has the right pedigree', August 2). I would have thought the best quality would be insomnia - all the most crucial decisions that affect UK farmers are made during all-night sessions of the council of European Union agriculture ministers, and invariably the country that has the minister with the greatest stamina wins the best concessions during these discussions. I wonder whether Mr Waldegrave has this in his armoury. Josh Stratton, JM Stratton &amp; Co., East Farm, Codford, Warminster, Wilts BA12 0PJ</p>

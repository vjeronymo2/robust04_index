			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (9): One-way street for imports - Car manufacturers' fears Turkey's vehicle manufacturers are reluctant to be guinea pigs. The unique and unchartered prospect of customs union with the European Union without full EU membership has little appeal to an industry which has enjoyed high tariff barriers, a growing market and government incentives. 'We are not opposed to competition, nor are we against customs union,' says Professor Ercan Tezer, secretary-general of the carmakers' association (OSD). 'We do not want to delay customs union. All we are asking for is a reasonable period to adjust within a proper programme and schedule.' The industry is worried that sudden deregulation will be a one-way street, resulting in a flood of imports, especially from eastern Europe, Japan and Korea. Lada and Skoda already account for over 50 per cent of the import market and this would climb rapidly if Turkey were to adopt the EU's common commercial tariff for third countries. The OSD, which represents Turkey's 15 passenger, commercial, light goods and tractor manufacturers, has been lobbying the government and Brussels for a reprieve. It recently commissioned a report by McKinsey's, the US management consultancy, which concluded that the industry needs another five years to consolidate its investment programmes and prepare for customs union. The motor industry has been Turkey's fastest growing manufacturing industry with an average annual growth rate of 12.5 per cent between 1987 and 1992. In terms of production, it ranks third after food processing and textiles and provides employment for more than 0.5m people. The two largest companies, Tofas - a joint venture with Fiat - and Oyak Renault together enjoyed a market share of 73.9 per cent in 1993. Total car sales in 1993 were 441,829, a 40 per cent increase over 1992 with demand fuelled by Turkey's high growth rates, the availability of credit and rapid urbanisation. In addition, the number of cars per 1,000 people stands at 35, one tenth of the average in western Europe, highlighting the potential for sales growth. So why the fuss about customs union? The runaway rise in production and sales flies in the face of the general European trend, which has been quite in the opposite direction. 'There has been a long-term programme of investment in the Turkish car industry,' says Mr Jan Nahum, general manager of Tofas. 'Twenty-two years ago there was no auto market, even 10 years ago a viable auto sector was unimaginable.' Tofas, which in 1993 cornered 44.1 per cent of the domestic market, produces three main series - the Bird, based on the Fiat 131, the Tipo and the Tempra series with different models in each category. Tofas and its main competitor, Oyak Renault, are the only producers achieving close to optimum capacity. In order to benefit from economies of scale and to remain competitive, the two producers have been improving their production, expanding capacity and modernising their manufacturing and assembly lines. Both argue that they need more time to establish their projects and to consolidate these investments. Tofas plans to introduce the Uno series to its range in the last quarter of this year. The company has spent over Dollars 140m of its Dollars 500m allocation for plant modernisation by reinvesting retained earnings and credits in the industry. Renault is also expanding its range in Turkey - adding the Renault 19 to its existing 9,11,12 and 21 series. The launch is scheduled for September and falls within a Dollars 300m investment plan for increasing capacity and modernising its plants. The spur to investment and modernisation has also been prompted by the arrival of other producers, attracted by the growing market and keen to establish a foothold in Turkey before the advent of customs union. The local Ford licensee, Otosan, began producing the Escort model late last year following a Dollars 25m investment programme at its Istanbul plant. A joint venture between Turkey's Sabanci Holding and Toyota of Japan is building a production plant near Istanbul while Honda and Hyundai have recently obtained government approval for two new car plants under 50 per cent joint ventures with local concerns. Hard on the heels of these new investments came a damaging blow. The auto industry's anxieties over the possible effects of customs union were heightened at the start of this year when the sector experienced the shock of a sudden, steep drop in sales. The 12 per cent devaluation of the lira and a sharp rise in interest rates stopped car sales in their tracks. Consumer lending virtually dried up and car sales fell during January and February, leaving manufacturers with mounting stocks, an almost unknown phenomenon in Turkey. The economic uncertainty had an immediate and brutal impact - Tofas workers were put on paid leave and Renault cut production by bringing forward paid leave and working a shorter week. The country's economic difficulties were compounded by the political uncertainty with no prospect of an upturn in sales until well after the municipal elections at the end of March. The unexpectedly good showing of prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller at the polls and the prospect of a stabilisation programme provide only the faintest glimmer of hope for the car industry. 'Disastrous' is the most frequently used adjective to describe the first quarter of 1994 for the industry. The possible effect on investment together with the prospect of lay-offs have armed the sector with more ammunition to argue for an adjustment period to customs union. Meanwhile, other industries are joining the chorus, cautioning that customs union may not be as beneficial as at first appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     Turkey's car industry  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 Dec 1993     Jan 1994     February 1994***  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Production        38,116       34,197       15,739 Sales             40,237       27,015       12,098 Stocks             3,436       10,618       15,086  --------------------------------------------------------------------- To February 15 only Source: Turkish Daily News  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: The failure of economic scientists - the alchemists of the 20th century Sir, In his consideration of the qualifications of the new team in Washington, Michael Prowse ('A wake-up call from Laura Tyson', January 18) touches on a most important point, the role of the economic scientist in 20th century government. The 'science of economics' is in the same stage of development as was pre-Renaissance chemistry, otherwise known as alchemy. Alchemy was pursued as a way to make gold, literally: so is economics, though more figuratively and with more impact on most people. Both fail for the same reason. The alchemists ignored (ignore means 'did not know') facts or behaviour of the elements, so they failed to devise ways of control over what the elements would do. So no gold. The economists ignore the facts of behaviour of people, especially collectively, so fail to devise rules which result in correct predictions. Often this is not for want of trying. But meanwhile, both economists and those who look to them for wisdom fail to see the failure and more and more fog is generated by a self-perpetuating group of like-minded people. Consulted, passionate, with no agreement among themselves, diverse, earnest and wrong. So no gold; just like the alchemists] A spark of light may be indicated by the most recent award of the Nobel Prize for Economics to Gary Becker. He studied human behaviour first and drew out supportable rules for prediction of economic consequences: just like the early chemists looking for consistent behavioural rules, rather than relying on fantasy equations and projections of hindsight. When predictions become good enough to demonstrate predictable control rather than just change, economics will become a useful tool of government. Economists have far to go to be worthy of the title 'scientist'; that is, one who knows. Jonathan Virden, Court Lodge, Yalding, Kent ME18 6HX</p>

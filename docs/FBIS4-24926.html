			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin met with King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath  Sihanouk of Cambodia here at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here  this afternoon.    Jiang and King Sihanouk spoke highly of Sino-Cambodian  friendship and hoped that the friendly cooperative relations  between the two countries will be further developed.    Welcoming the king and queen on their official good-will  visit to China, Jiang said that the visit is a big event in  bilateral relations, which he believed will push the relations  to a new height.    Jiang said that in the past year, historical changes have  taken place in Cambodia. Under the leadership of King Sihanouk,  he said, the country, which had undergone chaos caused by war  for years, has entered into the stage of restoration and  reconstruction.    The Chinese president said that China appreciates King  Sihanouk's view of a comprehensive national reconciliation and  his efforts for such goal. "We hope that under King Sihanouk's  leadership, the various political parties will properly settle  the domestic problems by peaceful means and build Cambodia into  an independent. Peaceful, unified, integrated and prosperous  country," he said.    China hopes that the efforts made by the international  community will be helpful in promoting Cambodia's national  reconciliation and peace and stability in the country, Jiang  said.    China and Cambodia have had long-term traditional friendly  relations, Jiang said. During the Bandung conference in 1955,  King Sihanouk got to know the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai  and they opened a new page of bilateral relations between China  and Cambodia.    Jiang said the king had visited China many times and had  made  valuable contributions to the friendship between the two  countries.    The Chinese president expressed China's willingness to work  with Cambodia to further develop the friendly cooperative  relations in all fields, on the basis of the five principles of  peaceful co-existence.    Sihanouk said that the Cambodian people were very grateful  to  the Chinese people and government, as well as to Deng Xiaoping  and President Jiang, for the support and help in the country's  reconstruction, and would never forget it.    Briefing Jiang on the situation in Cambodia and the recent  Pyongyang round-table conference, Sihanouk noted that the urgent  task at present in Cambodia is to realize a ceasefire and peace.    Without peace and stability in the country, said Sihanouk,  there is no way for restoration and reconstruction.    The king said that holding the round-table conference was to  seek peace, adding that the first conference was over now, but  future efforts were also needed.    Sihanouk pointed out that the Cambodian issue can only be  solved by negotiations and peaceful methods.    Taking part in the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of  China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, and  senior Cambodian officials accompanying King Sihanouk.    Before the meeting, President Jiang presided over a ceremony  welcoming the Cambodian guests. This evening he hosted a  banquet in their honor at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.</p>

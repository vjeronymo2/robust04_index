			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Future of Work: The Asian rivals to Euromen - Victor Mallet finds women in modern factories pose a formidable threat European manufacturing workers may think their jobs are threatened by millions of skinny, poorly-paid Asian men toiling in the sweatshops of the East, but their real rivals are much more formidable: Asian women in modern factories. In the factories and electronics plants of Asia's cities, as in the rice-fields of the Asian countryside, women do most of the manual labour. Thailand's Alucon Manufacturing is no exception. It makes aluminium tubes and aerosol cans for consumer products, including toothpaste, deodorant, K-Y lubricating jelly, duplicating ink, glue and instant gaskets. Most of the managers and technicians at Alucon's factory on the outskirts of Bangkok are men, but most of the workers are women. Aunreuan Punfak, 45, has been employed for 24 years by the company, where she now inspects the final product before it leaves the plant. On the day of my visit the factory had been making Colgate toothpaste tubes (by impact extrusion) and painting them by machine for the Thai market. Like many of her European counterparts, Aunreuan is entitled to 30 days' sick leave a year. Has she ever been off sick? 'Never,' she replies. Hartmut Schneider, chairman and managing director of the company, is a firm believer in the value of female employees. 'Women in Thailand are much better than men,' he declares. 'They are much more 'with' the job, they are more loyal, they are more interested in keeping the job. They think about what they are doing. They are interested in producing something beautiful. We have many employees, especially women, who have not been sick a single day in five years.' Some of the cliches about Asian workers are true: they are hardworking (doing up to 130 hours overtime a month); they are loyal; and they earn less than their western competitors. The legal minimum daily wage in the Bangkok area is 125 baht (Pounds 3.30), and the German-born Schneider reckons the 850-strong workforce at his two plants account for about 22 per cent of total costs, compared with as much as 60 per cent in some European factories. But there is much more than cheap labour to the success of companies such as Alucon. Although Alucon took advantage of a shortage of capacity in the west and exports some of its products to Europe and the US, its main markets are in the booming economies of China and south-east Asia. 'A lot of the industries that use our containers have relocated to this part of the world and it's logical that they are looking for local suppliers,' says Schneider. 'You have a huge increase in demand for consumer products.' Alucon is meeting this demand for quality consumer goods not - as jealous European workers might believe - by employing more cheap labour, but by mechanising plants as it expands. That is one reason why capital depreciation is Alucon's main expense. Thai workers are five times as expensive as those in China, Vietnam and Indonesia, and complex machines are needed to produce the quality and consistency required by customers such as Colgate. Alucon's factory near Bangkok is no sweatshop. Most of the workers are at one end of a machine, loading it, or at the other, packing the finished product into boxes. As Asian workers become wealthier and their industries become more mechanised, their hopes and concerns begin to sound more and more like those of western counterparts. Thailand, just like European countries before it, stands to lose hundreds of thousands of manual jobs in the textile industry to mechanisation and to competition from lower-paid workers elsewhere in Asia. Workers at the Alucon plant, often migrants from farming districts in the north-east, say they like the job security and benefits of working for a large but friendly company. They worry about traffic jams and paying the rent. Benjawan Prayadsap, aged 19, moved to the factory five months ago to find regular work after an unsteady job in a cake shop. Wearing jeans and a casual shirt, she is putting rubber seals on to plastic caps with her fingers. 'There's nothing in my dreams,' she says on being questioned about her ambitions. 'I just want to work and save money for the future.' Some of the women workers have started to listen to music through the headphones of their personal stereo machines, prompting Schneider to worry that the practice may distract them and affect their work. Engineers and skilled workers, in short supply in Thailand, are already almost as expensive as their European equivalents. 'They are getting spoilt in a similar fashion to workers in Europe, where people try to work as little as possible and get as much money as possible,' says Schneider. Attitudes to leisure in Asia and the west are converging, too. 'I think American-style,' says a cheerful Choompol Veeranuvatana, assistant general manager. 'Work is work and relaxing is relaxing.' Perhaps it is time to discard the myth of the nauseatingly diligent Asian worker. Asked what he liked to do in his spare time, Choompol replied: 'I like to go out with my friends and get drunk.'</p>

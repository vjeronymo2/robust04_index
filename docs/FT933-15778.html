			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Moran administration order discharged by High Court The High Court yesterday discharged the administration order in place since last August on Moran Holdings, the tea producer, freight forwarder and property developer. Mr Justice Harman approved a rescue plan following approval by shareholders of a refinancing at an extraordinary meeting on Monday. Moran plans to raise Pounds 2.3m from an underwritten rights issue and with a further Pounds 1.1m loan from Darnforth, a British Virgins Islands-based subsidiary of Volkart Brothers. Partners from accountants Touche Ross were the administrators and lawyers from Lovell White Durant were also involved in preparing the rescue. Touche said that a last minute injunction issued in Calcutta from a minority shareholder of Moran Tea Company (India) failed to stop the extraordinary meeting taking place.</p>

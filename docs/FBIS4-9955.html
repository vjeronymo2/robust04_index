			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We are moving toward a straightforward rejection  of the resolution of the Coordinating Committee for National  Mobilization, a resolution enjoining parliament to implement  Article 149 of the Constitution. The main political bloc within  the Chamber of Deputies, the socialist bloc, is adhering to the  parliamentary plan waiting to be ratified in the Senate of the  Republic. Daly Valet who had an interview with the president of  the socialist bloc, Deputy Duly Brutus, tells us more:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The Easter season had a  calming effect on all the political sectors that were pressuring  the parliament to implement Article 149 and close the file on  the 16 December [1991] president. The Easter season has ended  and the political battle has resumed. No new solution has been  proposed. The same ideas are being discussed. The political  leaders are ruminating over the same proposals. Thus, the plan  of the Action Committee for National Reconciliation, the Front  for Haitian Advancement and Progress, and the Mobilization for  National Development, which have formed an alliance, has a  chance of being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies this week.  This plan, which provides for the formation of an ad hoc  government, has every chance of being rejected in the Chamber of  Deputies because the principal political blocs remain attached  to the parliamentary plan that was approved by the Chamber. On  that score, the position of the president of the socialist bloc  is quite clear.    [Brutus] As president of the socialist bloc, I can tell you  that for the time being, our position remains unchanged.  [passage omitted] Our position remains the same; that is, we are  supporting the plan that was accepted in Washington among  parliamentarians and was ratified in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Valet] The U.S. Government's arbitrary position, that is,  involving itself in getting a plan signed that it will later  boycott, has caused some parliamentarians to be apprehensive.  These parliamentarians say they cannot understand why the U.S.  Government says it supports the parliamentary plan, but has  proposed a new plan called the synchronous plan. But in the  opinion of other parliamentarians, like Duly Brutus, there is  not much difference between the parliamentary plan and the U.S.  plan. If there is any difference, the deputy says, it is in the  way the two plans have been written and in their length.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / EU takes Italy to court over stock exchange rules The European Commission has finally lost patience with the Italian government and opened a European Court case against Rome, for failing to change discriminatory stock exchange rules. Last June, Brussels promised to take action in the European Court of Justice if the rules - which force foreign stockbrokers to set up special offices in Italy - were not changed by January 15. The Commission confirmed yesterday that the rules had not been changed and that a complaint had been lodged with the Court in Luxembourg - three years after the Commission's first letter of complaint to the Italian government. The final decision was taken by one of Italy's two commissioners in Brussels, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, who is responsible for financial services. 'He was convinced we had to do it,' said a spokeswoman. Italian officials said yesterday the government had promised to push through a parliamentary decision on the so-called SIMs law - named after the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, the new type of securities house it created - by the end of June. 'Now the Commission has introduced this letter (to the court), we shall wait and see what the court decides. We don't consider ourselves any longer bound by our commitment (of June 30),' said a Brussels-based diplomat. The official explained that changes to the SIMs law had been tabled as part of legislation aimed at translating European directives and rulings into Italian law. But a vote on the draft legislation had been held up by pre-election turmoil in the parliament. He added that Rome had objected on principle to the Commission's attempt to put pressure on national parliamentary procedure. The UK government formally complained to Brussels about the SIMs law in September 1991, arguing that it was an unacceptable barrier to freedom of establishment and free provision of services in the union. The rules cover equity trading on the domestic market and sale of securities of any type to Italian investors other than SIMs or banks. Italy's failure to change the rules may come as a surprise as most opponents of the SIMs law had begun to detect a change of heart in Rome, following the adoption of directives liberalising securities trading last year.</p>

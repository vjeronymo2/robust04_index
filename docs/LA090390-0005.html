			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING CLASS SIZES IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> In response to William Trombley's News Analysis, "No Simple Answer to Class  Size," Aug. 26:  </P> <P> As a teacher with 17 years experience in the classroom and a parent of young  children just about to enter the school system, I am deeply concerned about the  issue of class size. I am completely fed up and somewhat jealous when hearing  from friends who are teachers and parents in other parts of the country who  teach or have children in classes of 15 or 20 students.  </P> <P> Instead of traveling to Japan, why doesn't Gov. Deukmejian visit other school  districts in this country and find out how they do it?  </P> <P> Also, I believe that if any administrator, school board president, taxpayer or  governor would spend a minimum of six weeks in any classroom teaching 30 to 35  children, he or she would beg, borrow or steal the funds necessary to reduce  class size.  </P> <P> I would like to offer a solution to this problem: Drastically reduce the number  of school administrators. Assign two credentialed teachers to each classroom of  30 to 32 students. No new classrooms need to be built, our students will be  served in a far greater capacity and teacher morale will skyrocket.  </P> <P> ROZANNE LANCZAK WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P></p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Israel steps up troop withdrawals: Move out of occupied territories boosts peace process Middle East peace efforts gained urgency yesterday as Israel stepped up withdrawing and redeploying troops and equipment in the occupied territories in preparation for Palestinian self-rule and the arrival of the first contingent of Palestinian policemen. The move will add momentum to regional peace talks after months of delay and bitter wrangling and marks Israel's first concrete steps towards winding down more than a quarter century of occupation of the territories, where 1.9m Palestinians live. Israel's actions bolstered the confidence of Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, who said he was making plans to return to the territories next month and be based in Jericho. The rapidly unfolding Israeli withdrawal also caused Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, concerned that Israeli-Palestinian progress would leave Syrian-Israeli talks in a backwater, to fly to Cairo for talks with Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. In both the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, soldiers yesterday loaded up equipment and furniture on to trucks and evacuated prisons, police and military facilities to prepare for up to 500 Palestinian policemen expected to arrive this week. Palestinians also said the Israeli army was close to completing the evacuation of 600 prisoners from the Ansar II prison camp in Gaza city to a detention facility in Israel's Negev desert. The Ansar camp is to be used by Palestinian policemen as a training and command centre. Some Palestinian youths stoned soldiers packing up equipment, but at other places crowds of teenagers gathered round the departing Israeli troops clapping and chanting Palestinian nationalist slogans. PLO leaders welcomed the long-awaited change on the ground. 'It can be seen that the Israel army is evacuating a lot of areas, thinning out many forces,' Mr Soufian Abu Zayda, a PLO official in Gaza, told Israel radio. 'That says the agreement is beginning to be implemented in the field. That is what is important.' Israeli military officials said the government had instructed them to be prepared to complete evacuation of the Gaza-Jericho area by April 14  - the date originally agreed in the peace accord signed last September. The army said it had been told the final evacuation moves should be finished five days after Israel and the PLO conclude negotiations under way in Cairo on a self-rule agreement for Gaza-Jericho. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator in Cairo, said he foresaw smooth progress and expected agreement within two weeks. However Mr Yossi Sarid, Israeli minister of the environment, said he expected the Cairo talks would only be finalised by the end of April allowing for a Israeli military withdrawal to be completed two or three days later. Talks on the deployment of the first contingent of Palestinian police continued into the night in Cairo, with the PLO drafting into the negotiations two of its most senior military officers, Major-Generals Nasr Youssef and Abderazzak al-Yahya. PLO officials have said they expect a force of more than 400 men to arrive in Gaza and Jericho 'within a week' with an advance party of officers due in earlier. Officials from Norway, Denmark and Italy, which are to supply the 160 international observers for Hebron, also met yesterday in the Egyptian capital, but gave no indication when the first of their officers would arrive in the West Bank town. Israel also said it would allow 46 Palestinian activists deported from the territories for political activity to return to their homes today. The deportees are expected to cross from Jordan into the West Bank and from Egypt into Gaza. Reflecting the stepped-up pace of negotiations in recent days, Mr Arafat told Palestinian students yesterday of his plan to return to his Palestinian homeland next month, saying he would be based in Jericho. For Israel, Mr Sarid confirmed that Mr Arafat might be able to return in May once the Cairo negotiations and the Israeli withdrawal were completed. Violence flared again in Hebron, site of February's massacre of 29 Palestinians by a fanatical Jewish settler, as Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 18 Palestinian demonstrators. Israel has agreed with the PLO to allow 160 armed observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy into the town, the flash-point of Arab-Israeli violence. However the cabinet yesterday decided against discussing the possible removal of 415 extremist Jewish settlers living in Hebron and surrounded by 110,000 Arabs.

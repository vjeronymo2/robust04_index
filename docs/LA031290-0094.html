			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PARK PACT AIDS CHEVRON, CITY  </P> <P> The oil derricks that pump along Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach have  always seemed strangely out of place along the lovely shoreline. But they are  especially so these days for a city trying to polish its image as a tourism and  convention site after last month's offshore oil spill.  </P> <P> But an agreement just announced between the city and Chevron USA, a company  whose derricks are near where workers had to mop up British Petroleum's oil  after the spill, is certain to polish the city's oceanfront facade. It will  result in the capping of 25 oil wells and the removal of derrick equipment to  make way for a bluff-top park.  </P> <P> Parks before oil derricks -- now there's an image that fits in the  environmentally conscious 1990s. The agreement scores a public relations point  for Chevron and also strikes a good deal for the oil company, which retains the  rights to do slant drilling at some unspecified future date and gets the city  to contribute up to $650,000 of the cost of the closure.  </P> <P> It may be true that the more than $1 million worth of oil the company says  remains untapped is a relatively insignificant amount. But the gesture is a  positive step, nonetheless, because it works for the city's benefit. What  Huntington Beach must be careful to do is use its power of planning and  regulation wisely later on -- when and if the oil company exercises its option  to put in directionally drilled wells.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Huntington Beach will get its park, and remove some of the  concerns about safety that have accompanied pedestrian traffic near the wells.  The city's efforts to close a similar deal with Shell Oil Co., which still has  four wells operating in the area, should be made easier by the Chevron  agreement. In the process, Huntington Beach is demonstrating for other cities  in the Los Angeles basin with active oil fields that there are creative ways to  balance land use with the presence of oil reserves.  </P></p>

Initial evaluation visits by a registered nurse for the purpose of assessing a beneficiary's health needs, determining if the agency can meet those health needs, and formulating a plan of care for the beneficiary are allowable administrative costs. If a physician specifically orders that a particular skilled service be furnished during the evaluation in which the agency accepts the beneficiary for treatment and all other coverage criteria are met, the visit is billable as a skilled nursing visit.

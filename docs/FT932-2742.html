			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 'Lean and efficient' structure for Forte FORTE, the hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced a further series of changes designed to sharpen management focus on its core businesses. The most significant move is the replacement of the separate hotels and restaurants divisional structures with individual business and service units reporting to a newly-created operating board. Mr Rocco Forte, group chairman, said yesterday that the changes would provide 'a lean and efficient structure' enabling the company to 'concentrate its resources in the hotel and restaurant sector and on businesses within it which can build or sustain a leading position.' The new board will include Mr Alan Hearn and Mr Tony Monnickendam, the present divisional heads, as group directors with responsibility for the business and service units, as well as Mr Bob Leinhard (strategy), and Mr Richard Power (communications). Mr Hearn and Mr Leinhard will also become members of an office of the chairman being formed to assist Mr Forte in the executive management of the company. Each of the new units will manage a brand or group of brands, increasing customer focus and shortening lines of communication. Appointments include Mr Randolf Guthrie, former managing director of Shangri-La hotels, one of the leading Asian groups, who will head Forte Grand; Mr Herman Jenny, former chairman and chief executive of Copthorne hotels, who will run Forte Crest.</p>

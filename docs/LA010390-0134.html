			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TAX TO SPUR RECYCLING HELD LIKELY  </P> <P> President Bush, who has repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes, is likely to  propose a levy on industry for the use of certain raw materials to encourage  recycling, Administration sources said today.  </P> <P> The proposal is expected to be part of Bush's fiscal 1991 budget blueprint,  which he will present to Congress on Jan. 29, said officials who spoke on  condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Bush pledged repeatedly in the 1988 campaign and again last year not to raise  taxes. He said a few weeks ago in a year-end interview that he hoped to stick  with that resolution. The sources said they considered a levy on raw materials  for recycling more in the nature of a user fee than a tax.  </P> <P> The aim of the proposal, reported by the Wall Street Journal in today's  editions, would be to make it cheaper for industries to use recycled, rather  than new, materials.  </P></p>

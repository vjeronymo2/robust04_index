			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Privatising Post The green paper on the future of the Post Office published yesterday contains no surprises. The government's preferred option is to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail, with a regulator and statutory guarantees to protect universal service. The counters division would be hived off into a separate, state-owned body to meet concerns about wholesale closures among Britain's 20,000 sub-post offices. The object, now widely agreed, is to free the Post Office to act commercially, while meeting public concerns about the maintenance of a universal postal service and village post offices. The government's favoured plan meets that object in all respects. There is no good reason to delay legislation beyond the next parliamentary session. The green paper sets out two other options: first, to privatise the Royal Mail in its entirety; second, to keep the utility wholly within the state sector, with guarantees of greater commercial freedom. A case could be made for either course, but neither is practicable in today's circumstances. Public opposition to a sale, already evident, might become irresistible if complete privatisation were proposed. In any case, the usual practice is to sell a company the size of the Post Office in more than one tranche. Once 51 per cent has been floated, it would be open to a future government to seek parliamentary approval to proceed further. The other option - commercialisation within the state sector - is more problematic. On the continent such a policy has worked effectively; and since the Post Office will remain, for most of its business, a monopoly utility, it has attractions. However, obtuse Treasury restrictions make it a non-starter in Britain. It was difficult enough getting the Treasury to agree to allow fishing licences to be sold across Post Office counters. There is no chance of it allowing Post Office managers to run their business like others aiming for strong medium-term growth and profitability. The green paper's proposal - under all three options - to give the Post Office's counters division greater freedom is to be welcomed. Far better to allow sub-post offices to offer more banking services and sell lottery and concert tickets than to profess an undying commitment to their future while closing them by stealth. However, the future of the Post Office's letter monopoly is inadequately treated by the green paper. The monopoly currently extends to all addressed letters costing less than Pounds 1 to deliver. The government says it wants to reduce that towards the price of first-class postage. How far towards it? And does such a reduction imply that the monopoly will rapidly wither on the vine of inflation? Those questions, vital to the future of competition and universal service, need to be addressed directly before legislation is introduced.</p>

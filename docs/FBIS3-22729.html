The moduli are bound for  energy plants in China to be used in boilers [ketel] in which  electricity is produced. Mannesman has been working on this  order for seven months. The moduli, with a total weight of  2,000 tonnes, were loaded on four pontoons which will transport  the moduli from the Ghent-Terneuzen canal to Vlissingen  [Netherlands]. There the parts will be loaded onto a ship which  will sail to Hong Kong. Finally, ships will transport the  freight to the cities of Shunde and Fushan [placenames as  published] in Guangdong Province.</p>

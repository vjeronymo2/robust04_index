			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Crest Nicholson losses sharply reduced to Pounds 1.7m CREST NICHOLSON, the Surrey-based housebuilder and property developer, reduced its loss before tax from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 1.69m for the half year to April 30. Last time the group made Pounds 21m of provisions against falling land and property prices. The interim dividend is passed. Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, said it would be restored as soon as prospects improved. Losses per share fell from 30.68p to 2.87p. Net assets per share declined from 116p to 85p. At the October 31 year end the value was 91p. However, the company reported operating profits of Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 6.66m losses) on lower sales of Pounds 120m (Pounds 126m). Mr Callcutt said: 'We now feel our house is in order and we are operating in a stable, if rather unexciting, market. We remain cautious about the future although we are hopeful of further growth.' After reviewing the company's assets no further write-downs were required. The lower interest charge of Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 6.24m) was due to the sale of Pounds 50m worth of commercial property. Borrowings declined from Pounds 104.1m to Pounds 54.5m, reducing gearing to about 50 per cent. The group felt confident enough to spend Pounds 13.5m acquiring land for nearly 700 units at 23 sites. On the residential side the company made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m compared with Pounds 10.4m before provisions. Sales of 570 houses at an average price of Pounds 76,000 compared with 549 houses at an average price of Pounds 81,000. Commercial property continued to suffer from economic uncertainties and reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2m compared with Pounds 3.3m before provisions. Construction improved from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 2.55m. The division had orders in excess of Pounds 50m which, while below the level planned for, were well ahead of the corresponding period. An extraordinary Pounds 2.36m charge related to the sale of the lossmaking En-tout-cas, the sports surface and leisure business.</p>

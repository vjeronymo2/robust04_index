			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow has pledged to take necessary steps to stop  the sales of Russian jewelry diamonds in the world market in  circumvention of the 1990 agreement with the South African De  Beers company. The promise is made in a joint communique  following the Moscow talks between the Russian government and  company representatives.    At the moment under the agreement Russia is exporting 95  percent of its diamonds through the central marketing  organization of De Beers. However, during the past two years  the South African side has been criticizing Russia for the  appearance of small quantities of unregistered Russian diamonds  in the world market.    The Russian delegation to the talks was headed by the acting  Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin and the South African by the  head of the De Beers central marketing organization Nicholas  Oppenheimer.    The communique says both sides remain loyal to the stability  of the international diamond market and recognize their  responsibility for its future.    Participants hoped that the talks that should continue in  the  nearest future will lead to the restoration of a stable  foundation for the continuation of bilateral cooperation.</p>

The term does not include computer software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Computer program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Computer software <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer software documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Computer software documentation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Detailed manufacturing or process data <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Developed <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed'', the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Development exclusively at private expense <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Under fixed price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm fixed price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at Government, private, or mixed expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Developed exclusively with government funds <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Developed with mixed funding <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Form, fit, and function data <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics, (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Government purpose <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.

In an interview with the MBC Television on its 32nd  anniversary, President Kim said North Korea's nuclear  development should be thwarted by all means inasmuch as the  question is directly linked to the survival of the 70 million  Korean people.    "At the moment, we can be neither pessimistic nor optimistic  about the resolution of the controversial issue," Kim said.    Looking back over the reforms he engineered in the past nine  months, the president said, "you cannot wash away in mere  several months all those defects that had piled up over a period  of 30 or so years."    He said there needs a longer period of time to change the  people's way of thinking. The president stressed there must  especially be a change in conscience and notion on the part of  politicians.    President Kim implied that he won't change the nation's  educational system rather hastily. "Our educational system had  undergone changes too often, which had brought about much  problems in itself," he said.    The president also said the basic flow of the Korean economy  appears to have entered a rightful track. Nevertheless, he  cautioned the people not to expect any overnight improvement of  the economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Text] During recent negotiations on the new agreement  between Israel and the European Union [EU], Israel has been  encountering difficulties in its attempts to be accepted as an  associate member to EU research and development plans.    According to reports from various European capitals which  arrived in Jerusalem recently, the talks are being held up  because Britain has been impeding the talks on approving  Israel's acceptance to the research and development plans.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin is leaving this morning  on a four-day visit to Britain, where he will hold discussions  on promoting the Israel-EU relations and bilateral relations  with Britain.</p>

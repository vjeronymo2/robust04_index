			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (8): Material threats to exports - The textile industry has been hit by rising costs HONG KONG, the home of cheap clothing manufacturing for decades, has rapidly been pricing itself out of the market. Exorbitant land costs, labour shortages, and worryingly high levels of inflation have eroded the clothing industry's competitiveness and turned buyers' attention to lower cost manufacturing centres in southern China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Such cost pressures have not been unique to textile and clothing companies yet - unlike manufacturers in the toys and electronics industries - they have been unable to relocate in low-cost China because of the 'country of origin' quota restrictions imposed by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and various bilateral trade agreements. In the absence of a loosening of the labour market through an inflow of foreign workers, the rising cost pressures will not be easy to reverse. Many in the textiles and garment industries are pessimistic about the future for manufacturing in Hong Kong believing it has already become the centre of 'last resort' for many buyers. Mr James Tien, vice-chairman of the Textiles Council who also runs the privately-owned Manhattan Garments, says: 'Our industry's prices are already the highest in the region and I take a dim view of the future because of the high inflation rate. It will be very difficult for the garment industry to survive if we take a 12 per cent hike in wage costs each year.' Mr Ronald Chao, managing director of Novel Enterprises, adopts a similarly downbeat view. 'If there were no quotas you would not see any textile production in Hong Kong,' he says. At first impression the erosion of Hong Kong's competitiveness is a serious problem because the clothing industry represents the colony's biggest employer and export-earner. Last year 223,840 workers - or more than one-third of all employees in the manufacturing sector - were employed in the clothing industry. Exports of HKDollars 75.8bn made garments the biggest exporting industry in Hong Kong, accounting for one-third of the total. The textiles industry ranks as the third biggest export earner, accounting for Dollars 17.6bn or 7.6 per cent of total domestic exports and employing 62,438 workers. Although these industries are clearly under threat they will not be eliminated overnight. Hong Kong is sheltered from the full force of market pressures because of the international quota agreements that operate in many clothing categories and which are only marginally modified from year to year. 'Because Hong Kong was an early starter it has a historical advantage over the newcomers, which have to start from zero quotas,' explains Mr W B Lam, company secretary of Winsor Industrial, Hong Kong's biggest integrated textile and clothing company. 'In one way it limits Hong Kong's growth but on the other hand it protects us from our competitors.' Hong Kong companies have also tried to escape international cost pressures by moving from the commodity end of the clothing market into higher value-added sectors - as shown by a decline in exports in volume terms but an increase in dollar terms. But industry observers argue that there is a limit to this evolution. The industry's infrastructure has not been built on the basis of low-volume high-value production and Hong Kong lacks the design skills and creativity to rival France or Italy as a centre of high fashion. Individual clothing companies have reacted to changing market conditions in typical Hong Kong fashion by showing great flexibility and diversifying into other fields. Some companies, which have been sitting on valuable industrial real estate have transformed themselves into property developers by turning textile factories into office blocks. Manhattan Garments, for example, now derives two-thirds of its profits from property with only one-third from clothing manufacturing. Lai Sun, which built up a big business exporting jeans to the US, has now diversified into property, retailing and hotels. Other companies have sought to take advantage of the quota system itself. Because textile products are all but worthless on the international market without the authorisation to export them, quotas have become as valuable as gold dust. Some textile companies, which have high quota allocations because of a long history of manufacturing, now make more money from selling their quotas to other manufacturers than they do from making products themselves. A string of 'quota brokers' have also sprung up creating a grey market for the necessary export documents. If the whole industry shows as great a flexibility as many of the individual companies then the future is probably not as bleak as some imagine. In the longer run, as the quota system fades away Hong Kong companies will be able to establish a greater presence in other low-cost countries and southern China - much as Novel Enterprises is already doing by building a textiles factory in Shenzhen, just across the border in Guangdong province. This joint venture between two Hong Kong, two Chinese and one Japanese partner is rated a big success by its founders and is stepping up production from 3m yards a month to 4 1/2 m yards. Labour and land costs in China are less than one-fifth of those in Hong Kong, although electricity, water and transport are becoming increasingly expensive. Of course, it is not only Hong Kong companies that can take advantage of the economic flowering of China but overseas companies still face considerable obstacles to doing business. As Mr Billy Hung, a director of Lai Sun garments, says: 'When you go to Guangdong you do not have a phone line, the only language is Chinese, you have to sit in a dingy 1950s' Chevrolet on a bumpy road for five hours before you get to the factory and at the end of a long day there is no hotel.' He argues that Hong Kong will retain its importance in the industry by acting as a clothing enrepot with close ties to China, excellent communications, a knowledgeable labour force, high language skills and the sheer convenience of 'coming here and seeing everything'. Mr Jim Brown, who heads a 64-person buying office in Hongkong for Next, the UK fashion chain, tends to agree. Although he says his company is increasingly buying clothes from other countries in the Asian region it is unlikely to move to another centre. 'Manufacturing of some higher quality and higher priced garments will always remain in Hong Kong but basically it will develop into a service centre for China,' he says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Wio Joustra: "Brinkman's Fall Probably Due </F> to Excessively Early Launch"]    [Excerpts] Is the role of CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]  leader Elco Brinkman over? At one time he was the most popular  politician in the country. That is because in the Netherlands,  popularity is synonymous with fame. And Mr. Leendert Cornelis  (Elco) Brinkman was a famous Netherlander as minister of  welfare, public health, and culture in the Lubbers I and II  cabinet. The most junior member of those cabinets, he was only  34 in 1982, he always sought publicity. [passage omitted]    Exactly 10 years ago this week, he showed his contempt for  the parliament during an interview, casting serious doubts on  the functioning of the Chamber, "Sometimes, the parliament is  like one big clique," he said.    The question is whether Brinkman will continue to constitute  part of this clique for much longer. Can a political leader  whose party has plunged from a representation of 54 seats to the  dramatic low-point in CDA history of 34 seats stay on as leader?    In the speech he gave upon hearing of his defeat, a deeply  dejected Brinkman gave no indication of whether he blamed  himself for the result. The possibility of a "putsch," maybe  inspired by the Catholics, cannot be ruled out. The party could  have swallowed losing 10 seats. The "Lubbers effect" was worth  the same amount. And after the Arscop affair (joining the board  of Uncle Arie's company), their representation dropped to 40  seats. But 34, a loss of 20 seats?    How did the bright and brilliant young man of the CDA come  to  fall so far? Certainly, Brinkman was put, maybe  unintentionally, under considerable pressure by the outgoing  prime minister. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers recently admitted  in his own words that he had launched his crown prince much too  early. As a result, Brinkman found himself in an impossible  position as party leader.    On the one hand, he had to support the CDA/PvdA [Labor  Party]  coalition; on the other, he had to profile himself as the future  leader who wished to distance himself from policy that had  become adrift, and frequently gave the impression that he would  much rather team up with the VVD [People's Party of Freedom and  Democracy] than with the PvdA. Which almost succeeded in the  WAO [Law on Labor Disability] affair, about pensions.    The Brinkman shuffle was suspected by show-off Frits Wester  and on Monday [2 May] it was announced that he had left the  ship. This marked the start of an old-fashioned American  campaign aimed at stepping cleanly into the shoes of Lubbers, as  leader of the largest party, with nobody able to ignore his  claim to the prime minister's job. However, what may have been a  dream turned into a nightmare in which Brinkman himself again,  Lubbers and Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin commanded the  rather unedifying main roles.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Ruping (0491 2485 1627): "The Storm To Clean </F> Up Government Will Not Blow Over Soon"]    [Text] The storm to clean up the government has been  sweeping the nation since August 1993. From the perspective of  the People's Congress deputies and the Political Consultative  Conference members who are taking an active part or a  consultative role in government, what picture does this storm  paint?    No doubt, in this storm the anti-corruption campaign has  produced outstanding results. Based on detailed data provided by  Mijiti Kuerban, People's Congress deputy and Xinjiang's chief  procurator, show that In 1993, the region handled 2,161  corruption and bribery and other economic crime cases; 933 cases  were filed and investigated and 621 cases were tried and closed.  The largest corruption case involved 1.89 million yuan and the  largest bribery case involved 215,000 yuan. Thirty county- and  section-level cadres were tried as criminals.    This storm has shaken up the land north and south of  Tianshan. In the meetings of the People's Congress and the  Political Consultative Conference, anti-corruption and  advocation of honest government is still a hot topic. At those  meetings, we hear a lot of "jingles." What these jingles  describe are not accurate summations; in many ways they may even  be biased. But they nevertheless express what the people have in  mind. They prove that corruption has not been swept away by the  storm; the "hotbeds" that breed corruption have not been  thoroughly sterilized; party-mass relations and cadre-mass  relations need to be further reinforced and strengthened. We  must not over-estimate the initial success of the  anti-corruption campaign, nor should we under-estimate the  dangers of corruption.    According to People's Congress Deputy Matao Haiguoen, most  prefectures and counties in the autonomous region are in  financial red ink and are unable to come up with the money to  fund education and health care and other undertakings, but they  have the money to buy expensive cars and build fancy public  buildings; some towns and townships are copying them. Some  township government officials do not want 212 jeeps; they prefer  luxury cars which do not even run well on bumpy country roads.  They just want to show off.    People's Congress Deputy Muheiti Manlike said frankly that  today, leading cadres get new cars more often, and they get more  expensive cars every year; they move every time a new house is  built, but meanwhile some enterprises can't even pay wages, and  the masses are very upset. The cadres' work-style must change  radically; otherwise the gulf between the leadership and the  masses will only widen.    Rampant unhealthy tendencies make it difficult for honesty  to  plant a foothold. Without righteousness and honesty, corruption  will inevitably run amuck. This is the philosophy lesson society  has taught us as it develops.    Abusing power for private gains, using money to buy power  and  using power to make money, money-worshipping, and hedonism are  like "smelly tofu"--they smell bad to others but taste good to  those who are enjoying them, and that is why these phenomena are  hanging around like ghostly spirits. After this big  anti-corruption storm, members of the People's Congress and the  Political Consultative Conference will pay even more attention  to creating an honest government.    What is the crux of the problem?    Jiusan Society's Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party  Committee  spoke up before the Political Consultative Conference that the  key to whether we can staunchly continue the anti-corruption and  honest government campaign will depend on the Communist Party  which is the ruling party. If the party members can discipline  themselves and stay clean and honest, then the party's work  style will be upright, and the anti-corruption and clean  government campaign within the party will be a victory, and  there will be hope for the nation's anti-corruption struggle.  Jiusan Society's Xinjiang Party Committee even came up with  three 14-article suggestions on fighting corruption.    The deputies and conference members also reached the  consensus that in attacking corruption and building an honest  government, it is important to cure the symptom and the causes  at the same time. We must link attacking crime, punishing  corruption, and constructing a hard-working and clean government  together.    "It is not enough to rely on education alone to ensure  honesty in government. We must have a healthy system of rules  and regulations and legal measures to constrain and regulate  behavior," said An Qingming [1344 1987 2494], People's Congress  deputy.    Members of the Political Consultative Conference advised  that  we must do something so that, one, the masses of public  employees do not want to be corrupt (we can provide proper  spiritual and material civilizations conditions); two, they must  not be corrupt (we must amplify the legal system and  supervision); three, they dare not be corrupt (we must impose  harsh punishment and publicly expose them.)    The People's Congress and the Political Consultative  Conference meetings happen to coincide with Secretary General  Jiang Zemin's important speech against corruption before the  Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee's Central  Advisory Commission. The deputies and the committee members are  greatly encouraged, but at the same time, they also realize that  anti-corruption is not a war that can be won in a single battle;  rather, we must take one step at a time and do a thorough job  and push forward in stages. But no matter what, the  anti-corruption and honest government campaign will not be a  perfunctory gesture, as feared by some deputies and committee  members. This storm will not blow over soon.</p>

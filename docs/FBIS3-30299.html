			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariya Barutchieva] </F>   [Text] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- Lack of markets, the  enterprises' low adaptability to free-market conditions, and a  delay in privatization and structural adjustment caused a  shrinkage in production and sales in 1993, Dimitur Fratev,  spokesman for the National Statistical Institute (NSI) and head  of the NSI Finance and Lending Statistics Department, told BTA.  Significantly, the share of private sector production and sales  increased in 1993. Private sector output, excluding farming,  rose 22 percent.    Production dropped about 8 percent (excluding agriculture),  the drop in the state sector alone being 10 percent, Mr. Fratev  told a news conference today. Industrial output dropped 10  percent from 1992 and sales went down 9 percent. The shrinkage  in production was greatest in the food, machine engineering and  textile industries. A total 8 percent growth in production was  reported in power engineering, ferrous and nonferrous  metallurgy, and the chemical and oil-processing industries,  which account for 45 percent of the aggregate output.    The private sector accounted for about 4 percent of  industrial output in 1993. Sales in the private sector exceeded  9 billion leva (3.5 percent of industrial sales), a 29 percent  rise over 1992 at comparable prices. At 57 percent the share of  the private sector was biggest in retail trade, up from 46  percent in 1992, an increase by nearly one quarter, Mr. Fratev  added.    Inflation dropped 15.6 percent, from 79.5 percent in 1992 to  63.9 percent in 1993. Last year inflation began to be computed  on a different basis from the 1990-92 period, when commodity  turnover was the key indicator. The consumer price index,  adopted as a key indicator of inflation in 1993, is calculated  on the basis of monthly observations of the actual retail prices  of a basket of 1,400 commodities and services. Food prices went  up by an average 60.38 percent, non-foods 55.94 percent, and  services 93.66 percent. Heating and energy outlays accounted for  about 4 percentage points of the total consumer price increase.    The upward trend of redundancies in the state and  cooperative  sector persisted in 1993, Mr. Fratev said. The employment  figure for the state and cooperative sector (excluding  agriculture) was 1,322,000, a drop of over 10 percent (about  152,000 persons) on 1992. Private sector employees numbered  750,000. The latest figures (by September 30, 1993) show  unemployment in Bulgaria at 814,000, including 50,000 pensioners  and 14,000 students seeking jobs.    State and cooperative enterprises' obligations amounted to  167 billion leva by September 30, 1993, as against 125 billion  in 1992.    NSI forecasts do not envisage GDP growth in 1994.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The European Market: Data protection raises EC hackles - Many organisations and businesses have been frightened by a draft directive designed to ease the cross-frontier flow of information OCCASIONALLY the European Commission produces draft legislation which makes even Brussels' hardened lobbyists rub their hands at the prospect of new accounts and fat fees. The data protection directive - published in September 1990 - is just such a measure. So far the directive has frightened charities, direct marketing companies, airlines, banks, trade unions, human rights groups and the media. More than 150 amendments were submitted by MEPs at its first reading in the European Parliament's February session, many inspired by the gripes of specific industries. When it came to the vote last month, 131 of those changes were adopted. The Commission, which hopes to win member states' approval for the measure before the end of this year, is now wondering which amendments it should incorporate into a revised draft. The directive is intended to ease the cross-frontier flow of information, much of it computerised, by harmonising national data protection laws. It also extends the scope of some national legislation from computerised to manual data - although officials claim it is not intended to regulate the contents of every filing cabinet in Europe. Without a harmonising measure, Brussels argues, countries with a relatively high level of protection - such as Britain or Germany - would restrict data transmission to their less well protected EC partners on the grounds that it could be misused. But many argue that the Commission's original draft set unduly high standards, putting its second aim - protection of the individual - above the need to ensure an open market. The parliament seemed to agree. The broad thrust of its amendments last month was to relax the directive's restrictions in the private sector. To take one example, the original draft requires the express consent of 'data subjects' before information about them can be communicated or processed. There are exceptions: publicly available information, for example, and 'contractual or quasi-contractual relationships', such as with one's bank or mortgage-broker. But the parliament's amendments would go further and introduce an element of 'implicit' consent. They would also exempt the media from the measure, thus meeting investigative journalists' concerns that the need to inform data subjects about files might make their jobs impossible. In addition, companies would be able to give customers the option to object to further processing and communication of personal data. This is the 'opt-out' clause favoured by direct marketers, who, as voracious data-users, are among the most vociferous critics of the legislation. But though apparently sympathetic to the often exaggerated problems of individual sectors, the Commission sees little need to distort what it believes should be a broad and coherent framework directive with nit-picking amendments. So a complete exemption of the media would be 'excessive', in the words of one official, and specific rules on direct marketing would come 'at a different stage'. Officials point out that, in its first published draft, the directive mentions no specific sectors, allows member states much scope in the application of the measure, and provides for follow-up committees to fine-tune the legislation and make further recommendations. This solution itself worries the critics, who fear that committees made up of national officials and hardline data protection commissioners would be unable to resist tightening the measure. Parliament is pressing for such advisory committees to include representatives of other interest groups. 'Certainly there will be a follow-up (to the directive),' says one Commission official in defence of the proposed system. 'What I'm contesting is that this follow-up will necessarily be restrictive. It will represent a fair compromise between the different interests involved in Europe.' There will have to be more than one compromise. Criticised for being too restrictive in the private sector, Brussels is also under attack for allowing public authorities too much leeway to do what they want with personal data. 'There are extremely strict rules on the private sector, but it has basically become a data-abusers' charter in the public sector,' warns Mr Douwe Korff, a UK-based human rights lawyer who also represents Amnesty International. If parliament's amendments are adopted, Mr Korff believes they could undermine the directive's principal aim of establishing a level EC playing field in data protection, and create constitutional problems by overriding stricter human rights legislation in some member states. Most critics acknowledge that the Commission - perhaps without realising the scale of the task at the outset - will have to face up to some tough problems, not to mention some ruthless lobbying, before the data protection directive is approved by member states. But, as Mr Korff points out, that is what legislators are paid for.</p>

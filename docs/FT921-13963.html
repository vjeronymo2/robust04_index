			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Micrelec shares rise 8p on possible bid MICRELEC GROUP, which serves the petrol forecourt trade and has just announced a first half loss, has been approached by third parties which may lead to an offer being made for it. Yesterday its shares on the USM moved up 8p to 121p, putting a value on the group of a little more than Pounds 16m. Mr Peter Beck, the chairman, said the second half was also likely to show a trading loss but he was confident of a return to profitability in 1992-93. The group had a good future on its own, he added, but 'opportunities that exist in the market place could be such that they would be more rapidly addressed as part of a larger group'. The directors were examining all options open to them, he said. The group's main business is the manufacture of electronic pump control, point-of-sale, funds transfer and management information systems for use at petrol stations. In the half year ended September 30 1991 the group suffered as a result of the much reduced expenditure by oil companies. On a 27 per cent drop in turnover to Pounds 8.34m (Pounds 10.6m) there was a downturn from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.11m to a loss of Pounds 442,000. Losses per share came to 2.5p (earnings 5.51p) and the interim dividend is again 1.35p. Mr Beck said the sale of Normond CMS, the tank gauging division, for Pounds 7m was a most significant development.</p>

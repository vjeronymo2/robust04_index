			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Kantor may drop dumping inquiry MR Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, may withdraw a request by his Republican predecessor that the US International Trade Commission perform an in-depth study on the impact of US dumping and subsidy rulings. Republican members of the House ways and means committee, meanwhile, have prepared for the possibility that the request will be withdrawn, by pushing for congressional action which would allow the non-partisan ITC to proceed with the study. They have asked for a preliminary report by January 1994. In a letter to Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the ways and means sub-committee, Congressmen Bill Archer and Phil Crane say the study is needed to evaluate proposed changes in US trade laws resulting from an end to the Uruguay Round. Generally, the requests of the minority are honoured as a congressional courtesy. The Washington trade community has been stirred up since it became public that Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, had proposed the dumping study five days before her departure from office. Only the US trade representative, the Senate finance committee and the House ways and means committee can request ITC studies. The 'fair trade' regime is controversial; many Washington lawyers who defend foreign companies are convinced its procedures are intrinsically biased towards American companies and sometimes, politicised. Those who generally defend domestic companies see the laws as the only legitimate weapon against predatory imports. Mr Kantor sees the fair trade laws as a necessity. Trade apostle, Page 17</p>

Gross domestic product increased by 12 per cent in 1992 after adjustment for inflation, the State Statistical Bureau said. This is exactly double the cautious rate of growth set by Soviet-trained Premier Li Peng in his keynote speech to parliament in March, and far above the 7.7 per cent rate achieved last year. State Statistical Bureau spokesman Zhang Zhongji said China would have fast growth next year as the boom continued.</p>

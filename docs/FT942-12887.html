			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: S. Africa attracts heavy buying The Johannesburg industrial index recorded an all-time high yesterday as voting began in the country's first all-race elections. The index ended up 226 or nearly 4 per cent at 6,257, while the overall index added 172 to 5,240 and the gold index 60 to 1,906. The market will be closed today. Voting continues today and tomorrow, with initial results expected on Friday. Other factors aiding the strong run in shares were a higher Wall Street and gold's firmer showing. Among the session's best gains, Anglos improved R16.50 to R232, Kloof added R2.75 to R46.25 and SAB gained R2 to R94. De Beers rose R3.75 to R112. Sappi added R3 to R45 in spite of passing its full year dividend and reporting sharply lower earnings. Dealers said that the results had largely been discounted.</p>

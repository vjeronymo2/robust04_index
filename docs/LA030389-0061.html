			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An early-morning fire Thursday in two abandoned buildings, at the corner of  Kettner Boulevard and Broadway in downtown San Diego, is believed to have been  caused by transients, fire officials said.  </P> <P> It took firefighters 15 minutes to bring the fire, which began in vacant  one-story businesses, under control, said Larry Stewart, Fire Department public  information officer.  </P> <P> The Metro Arson Strike Team suspected that the fire was set by transients who  frequent the building. Two transients, who returned to the scene and claimed  they were sleeping inside the building when the fire broke out, were treated  for smoke inhalation.  </P> <P> There was no estimate of damages to the buildings, which are scheduled to be  demolished, fire officials said.  </P></p>

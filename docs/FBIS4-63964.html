			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- Opposition leader Vyacheslav  Chornovil, said that what had taken place during a closed  parliamentary session was a communist coup carried out under the  leadership of Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. In his  view, the election of deputy chairmen of the Supreme Council was  carried out with numerous procedural violations, without  announcing a continuation of plenary sittings of the Supreme  Council, and the discussion of candidates lasted for only 30  seconds.    As the leader of Rukh said during a conversation with a  UNIAR  correspondent, the Supreme Council Secretariat was not issuing  copies of the verbatim record of the sitting to representatives  of the Center group and the right-wing bloc. Chornovil believes  that the possibility of falsifying the record exists.  Representatives of four deputies' groups, Rukh, Center, Reform,  and Statehood protested against the violation and said they were  not prepared to take part in plenary sittings unless the  election is declared invalid. Mr. Chornovil also said that  obviously, deputies of the Center group and right of center  groups would have to refuse to participate in forming the  Cabinet of Ministers.</p>

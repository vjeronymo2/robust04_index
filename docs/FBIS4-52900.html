			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- As the chances increase  that Washington and Pyongyang will meet again late this month to  discuss the latter's nuclear program, Seoul reaffirmed Friday  that the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks should  be held in parallel with inter-Korean dialogue.    Future North-South dialogue should take the shape of either  a  Joint Nuclear Control Committee meeting or a high-level  inter-Korean meeting to discuss problems related to implementing  the joint declaration of denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula.    These are among the items agreed at a high-level unification  and security policy meeting presided over by Deputy Prime  Minister and Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday morning.    It was also agreed to revise the North Korean defectors  protection law to help Northerners, including those fleeing from  Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, resettle in South Korea.    Through his Spokesman Kim Hyong-ki, Deputy Premier Yi said  the nuclear dispute has become "delicate and subtle" and that  the government would continue pursuing a quiet approach to the  issue of North Korean loggers, without embarassing "the third  country."    Attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu,  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Director Kim Tok of the Agency  for National Security Planning, Chief Presidential Secretary Pak  Kwan-yong and Senior Presidential Security Secretary Chong  Chong-uk.</p>

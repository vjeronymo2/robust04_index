			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEIR WALK DOWN THE AISLE BEGINS IN IRISH CASTLE  </P> <P> For 60 years Aunt Betty rued the day her mother-in-law tagged along on her  honeymoon. Imagine her reaction if not only both mothers had shown up, but 70  others too.  </P> <P> But that's exactly what happened last fall when Jeannette Tirico Bean traveled  6,000 miles to walk down the aisle, accompanied by guests who bought a tour  package for an odyssey of lodging in Irish castles, sing-alongs in pubs,  medieval dinners with pageants and touring in jaunting carts, culminating in a  wedding at a 13th-Century castle.  </P> <P> In a creative fervor, the groom turned a marriage celebration into a travel  adventure and a happening for a little town called Cong. The wedding  invitation, designed as a travel brochure, promised "A Wedding Happening in  Ireland" that was "unmatched in the annals of Irish wakes and weddings." A  postscript declared: "No gifts, but it will cost you!"  </P> <P> The embryo of the trip began seven years before when Allan Armstrong, a  widower, became captivated by the lush majestic grounds of Ashford Castle in  Cong. He and his brother had just returned from a round of golf, skirting sand  traps shaped into four-leaf clovers. Allan said, "I don't plan to marry again,  but if I do, here's where I want the ceremony."  </P> <P> </P> <P> He Pops the Question  </P> <P> Seven years later, when he popped the question to Bean, he also laid the ground  rules for the ceremony: "We can either spend $20,000 feeding 200 fat people who  don't need to eat, or we can take the family to Ireland."  </P> <P> The guest list ballooned to include extended family and friends, with requests  (not granted) from such varied characters as a chief of police across the state  who heard reports of the impending happening.  </P> <P> The odyssey began at Shannon Airport, where we boarded buses for the ride past  enchanting scenes of silence: swans gliding in meandering rivers visited by  swallows and water hens; lazy sheep grazing on rocky green hillsides; heather  and lichen clinging to granite boulders, and meadows crisscrossed by rows of  gray rocks gathered from the surrounding hillsides and stacked neatly into low  walls. From crevices between rocks sprouted lacy yellow and pink flowers.  </P> <P> The groom-to-be belted a continuous rendition of "Get Me to the Church on  Time," with the wedding enclave chiming in with the chorus as we traveled in  dual motor coaches from Shannon to Limerick, to the Lakes of Killarney, along  the rugged Cliffs of Moher to Galway, and ending on the shores of Lough Corrib  at romantic Ashford Castle.  </P> <P> There, on the eve of the festivities in the castle's Dungeon Bar, rousing  choruses of "Rose of Tralee," "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling" and "My Wild Irish  Rose" were climaxed by a final and perfected bravura cantata of "Get Me . . . "  by the ensemble.  </P> <P> The arrival at the castle the next day proved almost as stirring as the  ceremony at the little abbey.  </P> <P> Entering the grounds through the 15-foot walled massive gate, our buses  meandered over a narrow driveway winding over soft hills shaded by immense  gnarled elms. Ashford Castle, with its castellated battlements, loomed ahead at  the crest of the hill.  </P> <P> In castle-like protocol, we received a royal greeting by footmen attired in  livery who attended to the luggage.  </P> <P> Inside, thick carpets, chirping birds and colorful modern paintings helped  create the ambiance of a family home, dispelling the cold draftiness of most  stone castles. Antique furniture and objets d'art reflected the castle's early  history as Ashford House. Armor from the early days of the castle stood guard.  </P> <P> The grand foyer/reception hall, where we were received by the staff, was built  by the Arthur G. Guinness family of the famous black stout and "Book of World  Records." From the hall, where welcoming scones were served on an elaborate  silver tea set, we viewed the majestic manicured emerald lawns that stretch  down to a tranquil lake.  </P> <P> A hunting and fishing preserve, Ashford lies in 700 acres of forest and golfing  greens, 45 minutes north of Galway along the banks of Lough Corrib, the second  largest lake in Ireland with its hundreds of islands, bays and coves.  </P> <P> Built in French chateau style with battlements carved by ancient stonemasons,  the castle traces its beginnings to the 13th-Century de Burgo Castle.  Downstairs in the dungeon, which was transformed into the bar where the wedding  revelers would sing that evening, was the site of the original lounge built for  the king's private entertainment of a few honored guests.  </P> <P> Though most of its reconstruction occurred over 30 years in the 19th Century by  Lord Ardiluan, Ashford's sleeping accommodations have recently been modernized.  </P> <P> The grandest room of all, the Presidential Suite, named for the stay of Ronald  and Nancy Reagan, was reserved for the bridal couple. The suite is decorated in  yellow and white French antique furniture replete with a living room and  fireplace, king-sized bed on a pedastle atop a sitting area, and a separate  dressing room with closet 30 feet long. A bay window overlooks flaming gardens  of hydrangeas and roses extending to Lough Corrib.  </P> <P> While the bride and groom finalized the next day's plans, we strolled through  the formal gardens and across stone bridges along the banks of the Cong River.  </P> <P> On the grounds sits a tiny village of houses enveloped in climbing vines, built  for the filming of the movie "The Quiet Man." The cottage where John Wayne once  swept the raven-tressed Maureen O'Hara off her feet, and where he fought  raucously with Victor McLaglen, is a gift store. The other bungalows are homes  for groundskeepers.  </P> <P> The next afternoon, with an air of merriment, our wedding party filed into St.  Mary's Church in Cong through a subterranean door in a wall of a medieval  abbey. On the outside the small stone chapel, sheathed in gray stone, blended  with the ancient wall. Inside, the chapel was startlingly modern, with stark  white walls, angled glass and skylight.  </P> <P> Father Brian Kavanagh, a retired university professor filling in for the ailing  rector of the parish, officiated. While the groom cried, the priest regaled the  congregation with jokes until the bride and groom composed themselves. "We  don't want Allan to claim duress later," he warned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Phenomenon for the Town  </P> <P> The wedding turned into a phenomenon for the little town of Cong as well. The  villagers looked forward to this momentous American event. The groom, with  typical Irish devilment, had hoodwinked the newspapers into reporting that  there were "six millionaires who (had) jetted into Ireland to wish the couple  well." The town folk made ready.  </P> <P> Following the ceremony they came rushing out of their homes to join the  merrymaking, waving dish towels and children in their arms. One man dashed from  his dinner table with a napkin still tucked under his chin. A matron, arms  filled with sacks of rice and not sure which of the two buses held the bridal  couple, pelted both.  </P> <P> Back at the castle, as part of the wedding banquet, we were feted to a 25-pound  challah bread baked earlier that day by a member of the wedding party.  </P> <P> The California champagne, toasted at the dinner, had been toted into the  country by our group. Acceptance of the wedding invitation included an  agreement to carry one bottle of champagne supplied by the wedding couple.  Since Ireland levies an exorbitant duty on imported champagnes, champagne at  weddings is unheard of in this country.  </P> <P> Though this area of Ireland normally experiences "soft weather" (Irish for  rain), even the elements celebrated the American union with a two-week gift of  sunshine.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Irish castles offer fanciful nuptial settings. Ireland has a three-week  residency requirement, so it is recommended that couples arrange a civil  ceremony before leaving the United States, followed by religious rites at the  castle of choice.  </P> <P> Reservations are more difficult to get at Ashford Castle. When Jeanette Bean  made her reservations only one date was open, and that was a year later.  </P> <P> Arrangements should be made at least a year in advance, taking into  consideration that April, May and October are generally the driest months. For  more information about the castle, write to Mary O'Donovan, Sales and  Promotions, Ashford Castle, Cong, Country Mayo, Ireland.  </P> <P> Though the Bean-Armstrong nuptials were Catholic, the castle often hosts other  denominations. A stately Gothic wooden chapel on the grounds accommodates  Protestant weddings. Inquiries should be directed to O'Donovan. Jewish couples  may contact the head rabbi in Dublin for assistance: Rabbi E. Mirvis, Stratford  Schools, 1 Zion Road, 6 Dublin.  </P> <P> Wedding requests to St. Mary's Church, as well as other Catholic churches, must  be accompanied by a letter from an American parish priest certifying the "good  standing" of the applicants.  </P> <P> Men's formal attire may be rented and reserved by writing to Patrick Ryan  Haberdashery, Galway, Ireland. Renting a complete cutaway package, including  top hat and gloves, is about $20 U.S.  </P> <P> Travel arrangements may be made through a travel agent or by calling an Aer  Lingus sales manager. CIE TOURS International, the tour company of the Irish  government, can arrange seven-day-plus package tours.  </P> <P> For information about weddings at other castles, plus general information on  travel to Ireland, contact the Irish Tourist Board, 757 3rd Ave., 19th Floor,  New York 10017, (212) 418-0800.  </P></p>

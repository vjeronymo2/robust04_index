			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Atlas seeks Pounds 11m as profits dip ATLAS Converting Equipment yesterday launched an Pounds 11m rights issue as 1992 pre-tax profits, eroded by soaring interest costs, fell from Pounds 6.67m to Pounds 5.03m. Reduced volumes, a sharp increase in net interest charges to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 70,000) and a disappointing result at its General Vacuum Equipment subsidiary accounted for the sizeable part of the profits' decline, explained Mr Chris Rogers, chairman. Turnover slipped to Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 48.4m). The 1-for-4 rights issue at 550p a share, underwritten by Hoare Govett, will eliminate Pounds 8.6m of short-term borrowings and meet expenditures of, for example, Pounds 1m on a manufacturing facilities at Hurley-Moat. The shares closed unchanged at 690p. Earnings fell to 41p (55.1p). A final dividend of 15p makes a 22p (21p) total.</p>

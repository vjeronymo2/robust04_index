			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Europe's case of the Danish blues: The implications of Poul Schluter's resignation For a country with only 5m people, lying in Germany's shadow on the northern periphery of Europe, Denmark has acquired an uncanny knack for holding the EC's future in its hands. The resignation of Mr Poul Schluter, conservative prime minister since 1982, has confounded hopes of a period of relative political calm inside the European Community. His fall as a result of an obscure scandal involving the treatment of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka has injected fresh uncertainty over the development of the EC. The impact should not be exaggerated, since Mr Schluter headed a shaky minority government and Denmark's EC policy has always been the product of bargaining between the principal parties in the Folketing, the powerful Danish parliament. But Mr Schluter's resignation blurs what just four weeks ago appeared to be a clear road map for the Community. Last month at the Edinburgh summit EC leaders agreed to spell out legally binding Danish opt-outs on the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union, paving the way for a second referendum to be held around April 27. The new year passed, Denmark took over the EC presidency, and national polls showed Danish voters overwhelmingly in favour of the treaty. With a Danish Yes in the offing, prospects improved for quick parliamentary ratification by the UK and the implementation of the treaty by late autumn. The odds still appear to favour approval of Maastricht. True, no one inside or outside Denmark is quite sure how the extended text differs in substance from the treaty rejected narrowly in last June's referendum. But seven out of Denmark's eight political parties back the Edinburgh deal which sets out exemptions on monetary union, a common defence policy, EC justice and home affairs and common citizenship. More important, the main parties, notably the opposition Social Democrats, have pledged to campaign wholeheartedly for Maastricht. Last year they were content to let Danish business and the civil service defend what many Danes thought was an unsatisfactory treaty. In June, almost 60 per cent of Social Democrat supporters failed to back the treaty, either because of a lack of enthusiasm or hostility towards Mr Schluter's conservative-liberal coalition. If the Social Democrats form the next government, they would be likely to push Maastricht hard, recognising that the next referendum is Denmark's last chance to come back into the EC fold. Or so the argument in Copenhagen goes. But as the events of the past few months demonstrate, nothing in Denmark is quite what it first seems. The country meets the exacting standards required for European monetary union on inflation and budget deficits but appears unwilling to take part in a single European currency. It vigorously supports the single European market but has serious reservations about common European citizenship. Danes can be dour (listen to Mr H O A Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council talking about improvements in Denmark's pig slaughtering capacity); or they can be frivolous. The economic minister created a diplomatic incident recently when he joked about dispatching the Danish navy unless neighbouring Sweden shut down a nuclear power station near Copenhagen. The 'Tamilgate' scandal contains similar contradictions. Mr Schluter, 63, was not directly involved in the affair which began in 1987 when Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, then justice minister, ordered civil servants to delay entry visas for the wives, children and relatives of Tamil refugees. The Tamils had an explicit right under Denmark's liberal immigration law to bring their families into the country. But Mr Ninn-Hansen, judging that the prospects for peace in Sri Lanka were improving and that the Tamil refugee flow might ease, decided to delay consideration of the cases. The affair only became serious when it emerged that efforts had been made to prevent the parliamentary ombudsman investigating the affair. Mr Schluter sealed his fate when he declared to parliament in 1989 that 'nothing has been swept under the carpet'. Mr Mogens Hornslet, the High Court judge appointed by Mr Schluter to uncover the truth, last Thursday delivered a verdict so damning that the prime minister had no option but to resign. Having misled parliament so clearly, few believe that Mr Schluter can come back, though he might stay on as a caretaker until a new prime minister is found. Danish officials this week were unsure whether to display pride in the open nature of Danish government or dismay that it had cost their country one of the its most experience leaders since the second world war. One foreign ministry diplomat recalled Mr Schluter entering office in September 1982, ending the Social Democrats' 50-year domination of Danish politics. 'Nobody gave him six months,' he said. In the event, Mr Schluter proved to be one of Europe's great survivors, a conciliator who presided over a period of political stability and rising prosperity as Denmark recovered from its huge budget and foreign debt burdens. On the bright side, the Tamilgate affair is a working model of Danish arguments in favour of more transparency in European Community decision-making and more accountability. Not many other countries would be prepared to sacrifice a prime minister to defend the rights of Tamil immigrants, one EC official said. But the same official acknowledged that it was far from clear whether the majority of Danes viewed Tamilgate in the same light. Indeed, one interpretation is that the scandal is more a product of Denmark's tortured liberal political culture. For despite its liberal immigration laws, most Danes are wary of immigrants. This week a poll showed 70 per cent in favour of tighter immigration laws. Mr Helvig Petersen, a former leader of the Radical Liberal party who supports the country's liberal immigration policy, fears that a post-Tamilgate election campaign could lead to an ugly debate about the numbers of Turks, Pakistanis, Yugoslavs - and Tamils. 'We are a very homogeneous population,' says Mr Petersen, 'we are not used to black people coming in and we have experienced more difficulties than we would have liked.' As party leaders in Denmark struggled to resolve the political crisis yesterday, Mr Ivar Norgaard, chairman of the Folketing's market committee which oversees the EC, stressed the continuity in Danish EC policy and played down the potential damage to his country's presidency. The priorities were already set, he said. Enlargement talks with Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway are to start next month; all Danes are looking forward to being joined by their Scandinavian neighbours who will, they believe, redress the southern tilt caused by the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain. Moreover, all parties emphasise the need for EC decision-making to be more transparent and to be devolved to the lowest level. If the Social Democrat opposition, led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, forms the next government, some change is certain. Initiatives to promote employment and to strengthen the environment will be given priority; free marketeers such as Mrs Anne Birgitte Lundholt, industry minister, will doubtless go; and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will gain new allies in Copenhagen. On Wednesday morning, Mr Delors met Mr Schluter and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the effervescent Danish foreign minister, to discuss the Danish presidency's plans for the next six months. Once again Mr Ellemann-Jensen, who predicted confidently that Maastricht would be approved last year, showed a fatal attraction for forecasting. Asked about Tamilgate, he asked what the fuss was about. 'I have every confidence that next week and next month the prime minister will still be Poul Schluter and yours truly (as foreign minister).' His EC colleagues will be hoping that Mr Ellemann-Jensen's confidence in the future of the Community will prove more reliable.</p>

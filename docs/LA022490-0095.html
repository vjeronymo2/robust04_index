			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL SEMIFINALS;  </P> <P> DOS PUEBLOS STOPS HARVARD WITH SURGE IN FINAL QUARTER  </P> <P> Mark Estabrook scored 12 of his game-high 27 points in the fourth quarter to  lead Dos Pueblos High to a 76-65 upset of top-seeded Harvard in a Southern  Section 3-A Division semifinal playoff game at San Marcos High on Friday.  </P> <P> Dos Pueblos (15-13), the fourth-place team from the Channel League, held a  48-47 lead heading into the fourth quarter, but an 11-4 run in the first four  minutes sparked the Chargers to the win.  </P> <P> Dos Pueblos converted 16 of 18 free throws in the fourth quarter to seal the  victory and finished 27 of 32 for the game.  </P> <P> Conversely, Harvard (23-3), the San Fernando Valley League champion, attempted  only nine free throws, making six.  </P> <P> "They were phenomenal at the free-throw line," Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard  said. "We haven't seen shooting like that all year."  </P> <P> It was a close battle throughout, with Harvard holding its only lead of the  game at intermission, 34-33.  </P> <P> Estabrook made a quick basket and a free throw in the first 11 seconds of the  third period and Harvard never led again.  </P> <P> Estabrook and 6-6 forward Chris Gaines (24 points and 13 rebounds) spurred the  Chargers in the final quarter, outscoring the Saracens, 28-18.  </P> <P> Harvard guard Mike Wolf scored a team-high 24 points, and the only other  Saracen in double figures was center Andres Carlo, who had 14 points and 10  rebounds. Rick Osterloh, the team's leading scorer, was plagued with foul  trouble and scored only eight points.  </P> <P> "They played well, they played smart, and they took away what we do well,"  Hilliard said. "We couldn't get our running game going and we didn't get back  on defense." PAUL OLSON  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: India spices the market for foreign investors - Reforms of its capital markets have added to the sub-continent's attraction Sweeping reforms of the Indian capital markets have fuelled the speculative rally in the country's stock market, making it the best performing emerging market in March and in the first quarter of 1992, according to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank. The Indian government's capital market-oriented budget of late February included the following measures: the partial convertibility of the rupee; allowing foreign pension funds to invest in Indian equities; the abolition of controls on the amount of equity Indian companies can raise in the domestic capital markets; the simplification of the country's tax structure and the reduction of income and import taxes. Mr Sridhar Venki, emerging markets analyst at Olliff &amp; Partners in London, a specialist broker in off-shore country funds, says that a large amount lot of foreign money is now flowing into Indian equities and that trading volume has increased substantially. He cautions, however, that the crop of corporate results in the coming weeks might not meet the market's unrealistic expectations. Disappointments on the earnings front could cool the market down in the near term, but its long-term outlook remains attractive. In the January-March period, Brazil came a poor second to India, held back by a steady devaluation in the local currency and by restrictions on foreign investment. IFC data show that the Brazilian stock market rose by 166.6 per cent in local currency terms in the first quarter but by just 46.2 per cent in dollar terms. Dr Roberto Faldini, the new president of the Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission, told a group of investors in London yesterday that while he was in favour of a further opening up of the stock market to foreign investors, he was unable to give an exact timing. Furthermore, priority would be given to investors from Latin American countries. Dr Faldini said he planned to improve the policing and transparency of the stock market, as well as improve protection for minority shareholders. On the positive side, investors in Brazilian equities have been encouraged by evidence in March that inflation was coming under control and that the privatisation programme was back on schedule. News that Telebras and Aracruz will issue American Depositary Receipts later this year has also attracted attention. Venezuela was the worst performer on the IFC table last month, losing 26.3 per cent in dollar terms. The market has been depressed by political uncertainty following a failed coup and a run on the bolivar. Pressure on the currency has eased, but Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities remains cautious about the market which he says is vulnerable to speculators and any changes in the political situation. The worst performer in the first quarter in dollar terms was Turkey, which fell 26.4 per cent, followed by Pakistan which dropped 23 per cent.</p>

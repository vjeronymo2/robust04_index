			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, 11 May (TANJUG) -- At its 40th session held  on 10-11 May in Brcko, the people's assembly of the Srpska  republic [RS] adopted conclusions in which it defines the  platform of the RS at future peace talks, advocating the  cessation of hostilities, equal treatment of the RS, and  elimination of pressure on the Serbs, including sanctions. The  following are the conclusions of the RS assembly:    1. The platform on further moves of the RS delegation at  peace talks, which the RS people's assembly adopted at a session  held on 20 April 1991, remains the basic working document of the  RS delegation.    2. There are no preconditions for the general cessation of  hostilities and for the resumption of the peace process, but the  RS delegation has been charged with a task of ensuring that the  RS is given equal treatment at the talks; that is, that all  forms of pressure on the Serb people, including the sanctions,  are eliminated.    3. Future talks on former Bosnia-Herzegovina are to be  conducted within the framework of a new peace conference. The  results so far of the peace conference on former Yugoslavia --  agreed to by the three sides in the conflict and by all the  relevant international factors -- must be taken into account.  The basis for a territorial separation remain the actual  situation on the ground and other relevant factors, such as the  existence of two independent state entities in the territory of  former Bosnia-Herzegovina: the RS and the Muslim-Croat  federation.    4. Brcko and Posavina are the component parts of the RS and  are of vital national importance. The assembly therefore rejects  any attempt on the part of the international community to alter  these territories as something other than vital territories for  the entire Serb nation.    5. The bombing of Serb positions by NATO and missile attacks  on Serb civilians in the vicinity of Tuzla by an UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] unit are hostile actions against the Serb  nation, and all such actions must cease.    6. The assembly most strongly condemns the atrocious attack  on Brcko by the Muslim army at the time the RS assembly was in  session, which took the lives of four innocent civilians while  several civilians were seriously or lightly injured.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> LIN Plans Spinoff: LIN Broadcasting Corp., which has interests in television,  cellular telephone service and publishing, said its board has approved in  principle spinning off its seven TV stations as a separate company. The  company, a frequent subject of takeover speculation, said the spinoff would be  "for operating purposes aimed at maximum development of the company's two  principal businesses, each of which will operate as an independent publicly  held company." Wall Streeters pushed the company's stock sharply higher on the  news, and LIN's stock rose $4.75 a share to $101 in over-the-counter trading.  Analysts have said the company's cellular telephone business has proven  increasingly attractive as that fledgling industry has expanded rapidly.  </P></p>

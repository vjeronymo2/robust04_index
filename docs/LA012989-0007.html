			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: ROAD WARS;  </P> <P> REMEMBER WHEN NEW YORKERS MARVELED AT L.A. DRIVERS' COURTESY?  </P> <P> COSMOLOGISTS TELL us that life on our planet will someday be snuffed out either  by fire or ice, with fire being the most likely.  </P> <P> Neither prospect is more frightening than the end foreseen by Shirley Schieber  of Corona del Mar: "The world will not end by fire or ice," she writes, "but by  a giant traffic jam that stretches across the United States from California to  New York and from Chicago to New Orleans and which will create a gridlock that  backs up to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, Canada and the Gulf of  Mexico."  </P> <P> One day, she foresees, the mass of vehicles will exceed the available  thoroughfares, and all transportation will come to an end. This geometric  profusion will escalate worldwide, the country with the most cars succumbing  first, and so on down the line.  </P> <P> It is true that our streets and freeways are becoming more crowded every day.  The congestion seems much worse than it was a year ago. Working at home, I am  not obliged to go forth on the freeways at rush hours. In past years, I  sometimes felt as if I had the freeways all to myself. Now every hour is a rush  hour.  </P> <P> There is little gain in taking surface streets. They also seem to be getting  more and more congested, and the drivers are becoming more reckless and  arrogant. Today, when I get a green light, I routinely wait to make sure no one  is going to squeeze through, at high speed, on the red.  </P> <P> But when you fly across the country, looking down at Earth from 30,000 feet,  you are reassured that the West, at least, is still a wilderness. Few cars can  be seen even on the long highways. So the nation still has plenty of room; the  trick is to get people to live in the desert.  </P> <P> Before we subside into terminal gridlock, I suspect, we will begin to desert  such metropolises as Los Angeles for the backwater towns that are still  underpopulated. When we settled the West, we built cities on bare land. John  Wayne or Henry Fonda would stand beside his girl on a rise and say, "Someday,  Clementine, there's gonna be a city out there."  </P> <P> Why does every immigrant to America have to gravitate to the big city? Probably  because he seeks the warmth and support of his own kind, those who have already  established a foothold here. Perhaps, if they were to go to smaller towns  outside the metropolitan area, they would find more prejudice and less  opportunity. But at least they wouldn't be contributing to the fatal gridlock,  finally becoming enmeshed in it themselves.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Fred A. Glienna of South Pasadena offers several ideas for  ameliorating our traffic mess. He thinks we should have smaller and more  maneuverable buses that would run more frequently. We should restore and use  the hundreds of miles of railroad track that still crisscrosses our city. We  should stagger our work hours. We should insist that drivers improve their  skills and use courtesy and common sense.  </P> <P> All of which, of course, is easier said than done.  </P> <P> Perhaps the one proposal that I would most like to see achieved is an  improvement in our driving skills, courtesy and common sense.  </P> <P> In a society that confers the right to drive on every citizen over the age of  15, there is no way to guarantee that every driver has skill, courtesy and  common sense.  </P> <P> But I remember when people from other parts of the country, especially New  York, used to wonder at the courtesy of Los Angeles drivers. We did not run red  lights. We did not block intersections after a light change. We did not run  through crosswalks when pedestrians were in them. We didn't lean on our horns.  </P> <P> That state of grace has vanished. The streets are an obstacle course. We are  impatient, up-tight, selfish, arrogant. Gunfire is the ultimate symptom of our  stress. Perhaps overpopulation is the cause. Perhaps the intensity of our  computerized lives.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, let us pray that some genius comes along to invent us out of our  quagmire.  </P> <P> Before all of us find ourselves stalled from coast to coast in the ultimate  traffic jam, I predict that we will discover a whole new means of  transportation, as revolutionary as the automobile was in its day.  </P> <P> It will come before the year 2001.  </P></p>

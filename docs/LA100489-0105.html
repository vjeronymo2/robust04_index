			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center last week received  approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin testing a laser  manufactured by Tustin-based Trimedyne Inc. for opening clogged blood vessels  in the heart. Fountain Valley is the 11th medical center approved for the  coronary laser trials. The hospital long has used the Trimedyne laser in legs  and has had a high success rate, a hospital spokeswoman said. Dr. Steven  Schiff, a Fountain Valley staff cardiologist, is the chief investigator.  </P> <P> Trimedyne marketing director Bill Worthen said coronary trials of the laser  catheter have been under way for two years and are expected to be completed at  the end of this year. Worthen said the company has asked for approval to expand  the trials to 15 centers to collect more data. "You can never have enough data  when it comes to this," he said.

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Daewoo to build cars in Romania Daewoo, the South Korean industrial group, has taken a 51 per cent stake in a Dollars 306m joint venture with state-owned Automobile Craiova (AC), Romania's second car manu-facturer. The deal is by far the biggest direct foreign investment in Romania since the end of communism in 1989. Total investment in the project, which aims to produce up to 200,000 cars a year by the end of the century, could rise to Dollars 900m, according to AC officials. AC, which was set up with Citroen in 1976, will contribute its assets and factory in Craiova, 250km west of Bucharest, to the new venture, Rodae Automobile Daewoo. Korea's third car manufacturer will pay Dollars 156m for its stake. It will raise much of this from the sale of 20,000 cars on the Romanian market, Romanian privatisation officials said. Additional financing will come from the South Korean Exim bank. Daewoo will initially assemble a version of its 1500cc Cielo model, a small family car, at the plant. From 1996, it also intends to produce a new small car presently under development. The investment is part of a Dollars 5bn Daewoo plan to quadruple its worldwide production capacity to 2m by the year 2000. The company plans to build two lines to produce transmissions and engines at the Craiova plant. Initially the Cielo would be 35 per cent integrated in Romania, but local content would rise to 80 per cent by 1999. Daewoo aimed to export more than half of its production to western Europe. Romania is one of six former east bloc countries with an association agreement with the European Union, giving it preferential trading rights with the EU ahead of full membership. Romania amended its foreign investment law to offer the South Koreans generous investment incentives.</p>

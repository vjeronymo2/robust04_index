			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKET FIRM CHANGES COURSE AFTER LAUNCH PAD BLAST;  </P> <P> SPACE: A FAULTY FUEL VALVE CAUSED AMROC'S FIRST ROCKET TO BURN ON THE LAUNCH  PAD. THE COMPANY NOW JUST WANTS TO SELL ROCKET ENGINES IN A BUSINESS IN WHICH  RELIABILITY IS EVERYTHING.  </P> <P> American Rocket Co., a Camarillo concern whose first attempt to launch a  commercial rocket failed when the 58-foot-tall craft burst into flames on the  launch pad Oct. 5, has put off plans for a new rocket launch and will try  instead to stay in business by selling rocket motors.  </P> <P> But AMROC will have to convince potential customers, from aerospace giants like  McDonnell Douglas to small private launch companies, that its motors are  reliable, which might not be easy after the launch failure.  </P> <P> "My gut feeling is they're going to have to recreate the credibility of that  design," said one potential customer, former astronaut Donald K. (Deke)  Slayton, who runs Space Services, a small Houston company that last year  successfully launched a rocket made from an assortment of government missile  parts.  </P> <P> In the private commercial rocket business, according to Slayton, "The most  important thing we have to sell is reliability. You can't afford to be  perceived as not reliable."  </P> <P> Since the rocket fire, AMROC has laid off about 50 of its 80 regular employees,  said Paul Estey, AMROC's president. AMROC also let go about 40 people it hired  temporarily for the launch. Estey said the company has enough money on hand for  a year of development work on the engines.  </P> <P> Last fall AMROC was intent on trying to jump into the new commercial rocket  business. It spent $15 million to ready its first unmanned, suborbital launch  attempt. But the launch attempt at Vandenberg Air Force Base never got off the  ground. The rocket caught on fire, and its liquid oxygen tanks were punctured  when the rocket toppled over.  </P> <P> After the space shuttle Challenger accident, the federal government opened the  way for private, commercial rocket launches. Since then three major companies  -- McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta and General Dynamics -- that have been  building missiles for decades have lined up business to launch commercial  satellites into space.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a handful of smaller companies, such as AMROC and Space Services,  have tried to develop their own rockets to launch smaller payloads into space,  such as medical experiments or small satellites. In April, Orbital Sciences,  based in Arlington, Va., plans to launch a rocket carried aloft by a B-52  bomber.  </P> <P> Last month Estey replaced interim AMROC president James Bennett, who took over  the company after the death of AMROC founder George Koopman in an auto accident  last July. Estey was AMROC's vice president of engineering.  </P> <P> One reason AMROC is putting off another launch attempt is the high cost. Just  renting a pad and tracking services on launch day last October cost AMROC  $100,000. And Estey said the company believes it will have an easier time  finding customers, such as the major rocket companies and its smaller rivals,  to buy AMROC's motors than it would have finding companies with payloads to put  into space.  </P> <P> Estey said his company's rocket failed due to a faulty liquid oxygen valve that  led to the fire that consumed the rocket. "It's a relatively easy problem to  fix, and people realize that," he said.  </P> <P> But AMROC has yet to complete any rocket motor sales.  </P> <P> The AMROC motor burns a combination of liquid oxygen and a solid fuel that is  like tire rubber. It burns only when sprayed with the liquid oxygen from a  separate tank. Because the rubber fuel doesn't tend to burn by itself, the  motors can be assembled and shipped without the extraordinary precautions that  are necessary for some highly combustible fuels. Estey said the engines, made  to order, could cost from several hundred thousand to several million dollars.  </P> <P> In addition to looking for sales to private rocket launch companies, AMROC also  plans to bid on a contract to develop a hybrid engine for NASA. The space  agency may eventually replace the solid-fuel boosters on the space shuttle with  hybrid solid and liquid fuel motors. The NASA contract wouldn't call for work  until October, at the earliest, and could range in size from $3 million to $16  million, Estey said.  </P> <P> But for small concerns, the commercial rocket business is anything but stable.  Last November, Slayton's company suffered a failure in its second rocket  launch. The rocket had to be blown up because the payload separated from the  motor too early, due to a guidance system problem.  </P> <P> The failure hasn't prevented Space Services from scheduling another launch in  May. "But if we'd had a motor failure on that flight, then we would end up  having to go back to the drawing board," Slayton said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar' has declared that the Arab League Council adopted  a resolution calling on the international community to put  pressure on Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  and place its nuclear weapons under international inspection.  This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states'  demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons.    In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab  League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council  had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to  renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may  not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons  of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and,  therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests.    On the Arab position toward France following its recent  agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel,  al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable consolidation  of French-Israeli ties recently and following the Israeli  massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time when we  are discussing the peace process and despite the fact that  Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons and is  occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that the  matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab  League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one  that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms  Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance.

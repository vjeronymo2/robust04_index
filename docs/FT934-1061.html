			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: US fund to invest in all levels of corporate capital CHASE Securities, a division of Chase Manhattan Bank, has joined Crescent Capital, a Los Angeles money management concern, in setting up one of the first US institutional funds to invest in all levels of corporate capital, including bank loans and high-yield securities. Mr Mark Gold, managing director of the New York office of Crescent Capital, which will manage the fund, said it 'provides the portfolio manager with the flexibility to not only identify the companies in which to invest, but also select the most appropriate part of the capital structure in which to invest'. The new limited partnership, Crescent/Mach1 Partners, has raised Dollars 530m through the private placement of Dollars 400m in class A senior notes and Dollars 40m in class B senior subordinated notes, as well as Dollars 90m in equity supplied by Chase and other sources. To generate profits, the fund will function much like a bank, reinvesting the money in financial instruments which bring higher returns than the cost of obtaining the capital.</p>

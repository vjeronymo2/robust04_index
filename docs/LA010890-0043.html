Jury selection  was to begin today in the case of Robert T. Morris Jr., 24, of Arnold, Md., the  first person to be tried criminally under the 1986 federal Computer Fraud and  Abuse Act. Morris, suspended from graduate studies at Cornell University at  Syracuse, N. Y., is accused of designing and disseminating in November, 1988, a  rogue program or "worm" that immobilized some 6,000 computers linked to a  research network, including some used by NASA and the Air Force.  </P></p>

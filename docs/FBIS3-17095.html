According to Karasin, Posuvaluk had transferred a personal  message from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to PLO  leader Yasir 'Arafat. The message calls for renewal of the  talks and confirms the intention of the Russian co-sponsor to  contribute to implementation of the UN Security Council's  resolution 904.    Russia believes that the adoption of this resolution, in  particular providing for international participation in ensuring  safety for Palestinians living on the occupied territories,  creates the necessary atmosphere for a move forward in the  Arab-Israeli dialogue, the Russian Foreign Ministry's  representative Karasin said.</p>

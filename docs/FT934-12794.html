			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Electric charge The embarrassment of riches in the regional electricity companies must be giving rise to some discomfort in a number of boardrooms. Strong cashflows mean that many RECs will have net cash within the next couple of years. Yet financing such utilities with equity alone gives rise to an unacceptably high cost of capital. The RECs thus need to find ways of increasing gearing and returning the excess equity to shareholders. Possibilities include share buy-backs and one-off mega-dividends, but the companies argue that they cannot consider change while the current regulatory review is under way. Offer, the electricity watchdog, however, is likely to view cost of capital as an important component of its review, and may not take kindly to RECs which agree price caps one week and radically alter their capital structures the next. There must be kudos for the REC which comes forward with capital reconstruction proposals that benefit both shareholders and customers. Interestingly, gearing would also be increased if one REC bid mounted a cash bid for another. Some company managements have ambitions, and a merger would certainly produce cost savings. However, the premium one REC could afford to pay for another would be limited. A bid battle might well tempt in a more highly rated raider who could afford to pay more for a REC's cash generation and stable UK earnings. That leaves the question of the government's golden share, which does not expire until 1995. Given the history of previous golden shares, though, that might well prove a paper tiger.</p>

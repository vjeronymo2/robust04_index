			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEN BARKE; LED FORD'S BRITISH SUBSIDIARY  </P> <P> Allen Barke, 86, who rose from a car factory timekeeper to be chief executive  of the British subsidiary of the U.S. auto maker Ford. In 1932, Barke  hitchhiked 180 miles to Dagenham in East London, where Ford's huge complex was  under construction.  </P> <P> He asked at the factory gates of Briggs motor bodies -- then the supplier of  most of Ford's auto bodies in Britain -- for any job they had. He was hired as  a timekeeper and rose through the company. In 1953, when Ford's British  subsidiary took over Briggs, Barke was given the job of merging the companies.  He became director of Ford's product division in 1959 at a time when the  company's plants were being increasingly hit by wildcat strikes. But in 1965,  Barke contracted hepatitis, and poor health soon forced him to resign. In  London on Jan. 29.  </P></p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: A princess who shops to survive In certain female circles, shopping is a survival mechanism. And its consequences, in terms of bulging wardrobes, tend to be limited only by how tough it is to survive, and by resources. This is not shopaholism. That is directionless, wasteful and leads to penury. This is shopping therapy. Men do not understand it. The Prince of Wales does not seem to. He is, according to reports apparently based on his sieve-like friends, shocked and irritated to discover, thanks to an audit on behalf of the Inland Revenue, that Princess Diana's 'grooming bills' add up to Pounds 160,000 a year. It may amount to only one third of what the Daily Mail last week calculated he spends on clothes, massages, polo ponies, hunters, Georgian silver, watercolours and Trumpers Extract of Lime toilet water, but it is a lot of money. It is around 200 times what Di-look-alikes - the check-out girls, the factory workers and the office drudges who are Diana's most adoring fans - earn in a long and tedious year. Yet it is small beer compared to what is spent by many other women of the international set. The glossy consort, the trophy on the arm demands a lot of upkeep. In Britain, however, such an investment in appearance, in clothes, haircuts, cosmetics and therapies, is contrary to the make-do-and-mend mentality of most women raised in a puritanical tradition. This is particularly true of the class from which Lady Diana Spencer comes. Her erstwhile rival in love, Camilla Parker Bowles, is much more typical with her bare face, bad haircut and crumpled clothes. There are exceptions, of course, but they are rarely among the ranks of non-working wives or ex-wives. They tend to be women who are earning their own money and, if they have a husband, are in a position to lie to him about what their clothes cost. Most well-groomed and partnered women halve the true cost and then round it down. It is only kind to do so. British men think frocks and blonde highlights should come at slave-labour prices. It distresses them to find out they do not. It is because most British dependent wives would heartily agree with their spouses about prices, that Britain's fashion industry, particularly its few couturiers, limps along for ever on the edge of disaster. For the big spenders are foreigners. What a Gulf princess or the wife of an Italian or a Japanese industrialist spends on 'grooming' makes the princess look economical. The princess was reported to be embarrassed and contrite and to have set in train cost-cutting measures. Perhaps, given the political and economic climate, she was wise, even valorous, to opt for discretion. But if ever a woman was encouraged to become a spendthrift, it was Diana. She married into a family which elevated dowdiness to an art form. Diana's beauty and stylishness (something she had to work to cultivate) sent the international media hysterical. They bayed for more. More Diana, more frocks, more jewels, more smiles, more leg, more pictures. And because she wore British clothes, the British fashion industry benefited. It egged her on to become an ever more visible, ever more idolised super-mannequin. Looking gorgeous was perceived as an important part of her function. She did her best. One may speculate whether her relentless pursuit of physical perfection started as a strategy to win the stinted admiration of her husband. It may have ended as a ploy to prove to him and to the rest of the world what he had lost. But it has also become a habit, a way of life, and a comfort. She opted out of work because she felt she needed space and now she finds that space is empty. Many lonely women fill their days with shopping and beauty treatments, but a woman does not have to be lonely to understand the value to her psyche of shopping therapy. It is an affirmation of one's worth if only in one's own eyes.</p>

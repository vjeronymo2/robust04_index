			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-CIGARETTE DECISIONS AND SMOKING BANS  </P> <P> I was appalled to read that Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs rationalized his  opposition to a restaurant smoking ban by dismissing it as a matter of exposure  to "a few hours of smoke." As a physician who cares for the victims of smoking  on a day-to-day basis, I would like to assure the councilman that the issues  involved in the exposure of the public to environmental cigarette smoke are far  more profound than he apparently realizes.  </P> <P> One need not be a physician to realize that thousands of restaurant workers  confront far more than "a few hours" of exposure and that they are not in the  least protected by voluntary nonsmoking areas. Recent evidence on the effects  of passive smoking suggest that these workers may face an increased cancer  risk. Customers' exposure to passive smoke, although less than that of  employees, adds up over months and years.  </P> <P> The failure of the Beverly Hills restaurant smoking ban demonstrated the  hazards of a piecemeal approach to this problem. A statewide restaurant smoking  ban would eliminate restaurant owners' concerns about smokers' boycotts of  restaurants in communities with smoking bans. In the meantime, local efforts  such as Braude's will protect some of us from the hazards of passive smoke  exposure and will pave the way for broader action.  </P> <P> DANIEL J. STONE, M.D.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

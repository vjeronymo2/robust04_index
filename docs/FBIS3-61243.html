			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the commission </F> of the Ukrainian parliament for foreign affairs, by Taras  Petriv, GOLOS UKRAINY correspondent; place and date not given:  "Dmytro Pavlychko: 'No One Should Dictate His Own Will'"]    [Text] Two years have already passed since the  residents of Ukraine declared for independence on a wave of  renewal and national enthusiasm. It is well known that any  transformations do not come easily. But it is even more  difficult given the significant influence of subjective factors.  And it is a pity if the paths of social changes are not chosen  entirely correctly and the existing opportunities are used  irrationally. However, even in the most difficult times, it is  not necessary to lose faith and reference points--so thinks  Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the commission of the  Ukrainian parliament for foreign affairs, with whom our  correspondent met--but it is necessary to search for mechanisms  of resolution for both foreign and domestic problems.    [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, first of all, let us dwell on  the relations of Ukraine and Russia--after all, clouds have  gathered over them in the course of recent years, and they have  not yet dispersed. Every time the leaders and the ministers of  foreign affairs of the two states meet, it seems that finally  common sense will prevail, and that a compromise will be found.  But everything remains as it was: Russia "presses," and Ukraine  distrusts its northern ambitious neighbor more and more....    [Pavlychko] At one moment these clouds get thicker and at  another they scatter. But it is a pity: They are not  disappearing, and we should not expect that there will be a  sunny day soon. However, I believe: Everything is in motion;  therefore, normal relations will be established between Ukraine  and Russia. For example, the Odessa negotiations of A. Zlenko  and A. Kozyrev were very positive. At this consultative meeting,  the parties explained that about which they are guessing, but  which they are not formulating clearly. The Russian side, for  example, was always emphasizing: The Black Sea Fleet is an  integral structure. But today, as it turned out, it can perceive  the idea of a divisible fleet, and that it is necessary just to  find the mechanism for this division. And this is  understandable, for all previous agreements, as in part the last  one, the Massandra agreement, are unacceptable to both  countries. Although the Russian leadership is further insisting  that it is necessary to rely precisely on it. But when it comes  to the fact that Russia would have to pay more than $15 billion  for half the Black Sea Fleet, the Russian representatives throw  up their hands. It is necessary to note that misunderstandings  keep coming up relative to the nuclear legacy as well. Russia  does not in any way want to recognize Ukraine as the owner of  nuclear weapons.    [Petriv] After the ratification of the START-1 treaty,  Moscow  accused our state of violating agreements. Russian diplomats  headed a campaign of bringing pressure on Ukraine. A. Zlenko,  the head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department, was also  compelled even to declare that there is not a particle of truth  in Russia's accusations....    [Pavlychko] Ukraine has already given up tactical nuclear  weapons and did not receive any kind of compensation for them.  Therefore, we cannot once again agree to the same thing. We also  think that now the nuclear weapons deployed on our territory  play a definite deterrent role. And therefore, we insist that  joining the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons be  carried over into the future. And, at the same time, we are  going toward a nuclear-free status. But this road can be  determined only by us, and no one should dictate his own will to  us. We should transform the nuclear weapons on our territory  into political guarantees of independence. For as a people and  as a nation, we are under a threat.    [Petriv] Could not the quick signing of an interstate treaty  at least somehow stabilize Ukrainian-Russian relations?    [Pavlychko] Such a document is already half prepared. Work  is  continuing on points that deal with border questions. In our  view, the existing borders between Ukraine and Russia should be  guaranteed with this treaty. And it is again strange: The  Russian side is trying to get by in this case with some general  phrases, but we are proposing the exact wording that was  recorded in the Ukrainian-Russian treaty of 1990. Unfortunately,  this also indicates that the Russian side intends in the future  to return to the territorial issue.    [Petriv] The question arises: Why does Ukraine not come out  more actively for military cooperation with Western countries,  and first of all with its neighbors--Poland, Hungary, Slovakia,  and the Czech Republic?    [Pavlychko] Russia is trying in every possible way to  restore  the empire: At one time by means of the CIS structure, and at  another, by means of an economic union. In my opinion, I think  that it is necessary at any price to develop the closest ties  with our close neighbors. If we will be able to arrange  political, cultural, and economic contacts with them, then this  will gradually free us from an excessive Eastern orientation.  After all, the newest technologies and social democracy can come  to us from Europe.    However, our strategic path, after uniting with our Western  neighbors, is not to create an anti-Russian alliance, but, on  the contrary, to establish good relations with Western Europe in  the Russian Eurasian space through a Black Sea-Baltic system.  Through a unique Europeanization of Ukraine, Russia would be  closer to Europe. Let us recall history. Europe and Russia have  always adjoined on Ukrainian land, and here European  civilization was victorious at one time and Russo-Mongolian at  another time. And, therefore, it is necessary that these two  planes not destroy each other, but harmonize.    We must compel the silence of the Moscow imperialists. And  it  is necessary to do this not only with the help of a compromising  policy, but also through a firm will. Therefore, it is necessary  to emphasize: If Russia is democratic, Europe will be calm, and  if it strives to dominate, this will serve as a reason for fear  among the new independent states and a pull toward NATO.    [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, the election campaign for  seats  in the new parliament is now proceeding at full speed. Is this  not the reason why the work of your commission has abated?    [Pavlychko] Actually, we are not working as intensively as  formerly. It must be said that over these years the activity of  the commission has been quite intense. Although its staff is  rather polarized, and it is very difficult to work. It  frequently could not reach an agreement. At the same time, in  critical moments, such as, for example, a decision of the  Russian parliament regarding Sevastopol, it was able to come  together. And therefore, I want to note that the commission did  a lot in its field.    [Petriv] In your opinion, what will the new Supreme Council  of Ukraine be like?    [Pavlychko] The first trouble with the old parliament is  that  it was not structured. And now the parties have still not grown  numerically. The fact that the Supreme Council did not go for a  mixed system, but voted for a majority system, reflects the  position of the parliamentary majority and, in particular, of  those who want to speak in their own name, for they are  brilliant individualities. In their opinion, people will vote  for them. Therefore, I fear most of all that we will once again  represent ourselves in the new parliament, when every deputy  will represent only his personal program, and not a specific  political force. Then we will again pull each other by the  forelock ad infinitum, instead of parliamentary groups gathering  and deciding what should be done.    [Petriv] In this case, neither the president nor the  chairman  of the Supreme Council insisted on a mixed electoral system....    [Pavlychko] Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch, as well as  the  representatives of the president in the localities, remain  indifferent to political parties. But our leaders do not want to  think of themselves within the framework of any kind of party.  We say that now there is a so-called party of power. Then let  these people gather and say that we are organizing into some  kind of structure, and there is no clarity, but there is  vacillation. Ukraine is going into the elections when the voters  are in absolute perplexity. However, despite all of this, I  believe that the next Supreme Council will be better.    [Petriv] Will the democratic forces, given the disunity of  ideas and leaders, unite in one centrist-reformation bloc that  would not let either the extreme left wing or the extreme right  wing win a majority in parliament?    [Pavlychko] I think that if we do not go into the elections  as a united democratic bloc, then we will lose. And it is  important not only for the parties to unite, but also for  individuals. Going into the elections, we understand that it is  necessary for the democrats to establish some kind of  coordination council so that we would not fight each other,  because, for example, the situation will be entirely different  in Western Ukraine than in the East. Is a variant possible where  democratic forces will come out in the elections as a unified  political force, and afterwards structure themselves in  parliament? It is better if we unite in a single political  party. And it is necessary to conduct a congress even before the  elections. Then we would easily be able to win seats in  parliament and be victorious in it.    [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, have you already decided to  put  forward your candidacy for the new parliament? Since it is  rumored that allegedly you will head the Ukrainian diplomatic  mission to one of the countries of the West....    [Pavlychko] I will not go as ambassador to any country. For  I  would not feel very good. The people are in trouble, and if I  agreed to a position that, possibly, I have even earned, then I  would look like a deserter. Therefore, I decided to go into the  parliament.    [Petriv] Are you prepared to put forward your candidacy for  the post of president of Ukraine in June 1994, if the elections  are held?    [Pavlychko] It is necessary to consider the situation  realistically. I am convinced that the leader of the state must  not yet be very old, he must possess economic knowledge, and he  must have a number of good qualities. I am already 65;  therefore, I am convinced it is too late to talk about this. I  think that the elections will be held. Because Leonid  Makarovych, probably, will not do what was done by the Russian  leader who at first announced the elections, but afterwards went  back on his word.</p>

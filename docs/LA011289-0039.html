			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RANCHO BERNARDO  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn its complaint against  Northern Telecom Electronics, a Rancho Bernardo firm that had faced a $20,000  fine for allegedly violating federal Clean Water Act guidelines by dumping  3,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide into city sewers last April.  </P> <P> EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald in San Francisco said Wednesday that the spill  was not as dangerous as the company first thought when it voluntarily reported  the incident.  </P> <P> "The original complaint was based on information they themselves provided to  us, and there were some errors in their data," she said. Among other things,  the waste-water discharge didn't contain the high levels of acidity that were  first believed, and the waste did not upset sewage treatment at the Escondido  plant that treats Rancho Bernardo's sewage.  </P> <P> She also noted that the company, which manufactures computer chips for  telecommunications purposes, has corrected the deficiencies that led to the  spill.  </P></p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Alert after Serbs set off dam mines CROATIAN forces captured a strategic dam yesterday but said retreating Serb troops had set off three demolition mines at key points, threatening the structure with collapse. Military and civilian government sources in the regional town of Sinj, 15km south of the Peruca dam, said Croatian forces had won control of the dam from rebel Serbs in the Krajina enclave. In Sinj evacuation of more than 20,000 people in the valley below the dam was being considered. Experts were being rushed to the scene to examine cracks in the dam from which water was spilling. The heavily-mined dam provides electricity for its southern and central Adriatic coastal cities. Artillery and mortar duels between Croat and Serb forces erupted on Wednesday night around the 65-metre high dam, which Serb rebels rigged with explosives last year. If the dam ruptures, more than 500m cubic metres of water in the 12-mile-long reservoir would endanger tens of thousands of people. Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency said Croat long-range artillery fire had hit the sluice gate adjacent to the dam. The dam lies at the far southern end of the self-proclaimed Serb state of Krajina ten miles outside the UN Protected Area. UN officials say Krajina leaders in November 1991 warned that the dam had been rigged as a guarantee that Croat forces would not seize it. Although damaged in the 1991 Serbo-Croat war, the Peruca dam is a crucial source of power for much of Dalmatia. General Satish Nambiar, the commander of UN peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, said: 'I am afraid it's a very grim situation.' He was critical of the seven-day-old Croatian offensive into the disputed Serb enclave of Krajina. 'I have to tell you quite frankly that this has been an immensely rash and ill-advised action. 'It could have destructive consequences which we have not yet witnessed,' he said. The Croatian government claimed that Serb fighters had driven 50 Kenyan peace-keepers from the Peruca dam, but that could not be confirmed. Krajina's Serb commanders yesterday said they had halted the Croat military offensive across UN lines, reported Tanjug. 'This creates conditions for a counter-offensive,' said their statement, adding that Serb militia had retaken several villages seized by Croat forces since Friday. In Bosnia, meanwhile, Moslems and Serbs were again involved in artillery and infantry attacks along the Drina River border with Serbia.</p>

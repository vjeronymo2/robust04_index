			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Mar (EFE) -- The National  Civil Registry Office has reported that the nomination of former  [Economic Development] Minister Ernesto Samper Pizano as the  official presidential candidate of the governing Liberal Party  of Colombia for the 8 May elections was consolidated today after  the counting of 89 percent of the party votes cast on Sunday [13  March].    With its latest communique, the election organization  considered the counting of votes cast by Liberal Party members  in response to the "internal primary" carried out by the party  during the parliamentary elections to be concluded. The primary  was independent of the parliamentary elections and was made upon  a request from the party's board of directors.    Out of 2,562,694 votes counted, the 43-year-old Samper, a  former ambassador to Spain, obtained 1,245,283. Humberto de la  Calle, who was government minister until two years ago,  concurring with the period when Samper was development minister,  followed with 335,165 votes.    Samper Pizano, one of the seven presidential hopefuls who  participated in the "internal primary," will be officially  proclaimed party candidate on Friday during the celebration of  the party's national convention in Santa Fe de Bogota.    In May the Liberal Party candidate will compete with 10  other  candidates from the various political parties who want to  replace President Cesar Gaviria as president of Colombia on 7  August for the 1994-1998 period. Polls show Samper and Andres  Pastrana, of the Social Conservative Party, as the people's  favorites.    National Registrar Luis Camilo Osorio explained today that  his office will not issue any more bulletins on the votes for  the liberal candidates because he has much work to do with the  final count of the votes for the Senate and the Chamber of  Representatives.    During Sunday's elections, in addition to absenteeism of 70  percent, 14 percent of the votes were either void or blank.  Osorio has attributed this to the cumbersome ballots that  contained more than 5,300 names of candidates to the Senate and  the Chamber of Representatives.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Liberal Party voting:                                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Votes                    |Percentage               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ernesto Samper           |1,245,283                |48.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Humberto De la Calle     |335,165                  |12.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carlos Lleras de la Fuen-|202,925                  |7.85                     |  |te                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |David Turbay             |172,096                  |6.66                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carlos Lemos Simmonds    |129,283                  |5.03                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rodolfo Gonzalez         |72,573                   |2.80                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gloria Gaitan            |65,456                   |2.53                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Blank votes              |160,751                  |6.22                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Voided votes             |198,472                  |7.68                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                    |2,562,694 [as received]  |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

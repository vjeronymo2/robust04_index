A joint announcement by the leaders of both parties -  Stanley  John of the SVLP and Dr Ralph Gonsalves of the MNU - said  Vincent Beache, a former trade minister and SVLP leader, was  chosen to lead the alliance.    The alliance will contest the 15 seats in the House of  Assembly with the SVLP providing nine candidates and the MNU,  six. In the just dissolved Parliament, neither party was  represented.    Despite formation of the alliance, the two parties will  retain their identities "but will present a common manifesto and  share a common campaign platform," the statement said.    "This agreement was facilitated by the "Concerned Citizens  Committee", a group of prominent Vincentian business persons,  professionals and members of clergy who have recently come  together to ensure good governance in the state," the statement  added.    John will continue to function as leader of the SVLP and  Gonsalves as head of the MNU.</p>

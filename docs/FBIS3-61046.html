That is, while  the country had an obvious excess of weapons, it did not have an  army capable of quickly and effectively pacifying the country.    On 31 October 1992 there were 2.5 million servicemen in the  Russian Army. There were over 600,000 in the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs], but when 5,000 paratroopers, motorized  riflemen and other such men were needed for the operation in  Ossetia-Ingushetia, the General Staff and the MVD scraped them  up with tremendous difficulty, company by company and platoon by  platoon, from Russia's cities and garrisons. Still earlier, by  the way, in January 1990, partial mobilization had to be carried  out in the Northern Caucasian Military District for the  operation in Baku. The former Soviet Army found itself totally  unsuited to lightning-fast peacemaking operations.    The military reform, which was planned to pursue a leisurely  course until the year 2000, was seen more and more clearly as  being inconsistent with the requirements of the times.  Circumstances forced Russia's military leadership to improvise  as the events unfolded, as one peacemaking operation blended  into the next. But in general, the plan for reform by the year  2000 was in a certain sense completed: The Russian Army became a  mixed army, consisting of both conscripts and professionals.  Even numerical strength corresponded approximately to what had  been planned--1.5 million persons. By the way, this is not  counting the highly expanded forces of the MVD, as well as the  local national-tribal auxiliary formations in the outlying areas  (in Central Asia, in the Caucasus, in Ukraine etc.).    Professional mobile combat units became the Russian Army's  main strike force in the year 2000. The first such combined  units (then still experimental) were formed in 1993-1994 out of  soldiers serving on a contract basis. But the first complement  of contract soldiers was generally unsuccessful: Common  ill-disciplined people, often with a criminal past. Elite combat  units could be hammered together out of such rabble only through  merciless disciplinary measures. This required professional,  highly paid junior officers, but there were none in the Russian  Army then.    However, the army was almost perpetually at is business, and  these random people were gradually sifted out. In Russia, as we  know, improvisation often produces better results than planned  measures. By the year 2000 the army's strike forces consisted of  five "old" airborne divisions, 20 brigades and 15 separate  helicopter regiments. By the end of the century the tactics of  intervention had been fully worked out: Peacetime generals  managed to gain some experience. The operation to pacify the  Northern Caucasus is still considered to be one of the best  examples of a total air-land operation. In it, by the way, the  Russian Army made its first use of "invisible" ground-attack  aircraft, built according to "stealth" technology to penetrate  the air defense system armed with S300 surface-to-air missiles,  which the Confederation of Nations of the Northern Caucasus had  purchased from Ukraine earlier. (The first flying prototypes of  Russian "stealth" aircraft were tested back in the late 1980's,  but because of insufficient funds the aircraft could not be  introduced into series production until the mid-1990's, with the  support of France's Dassault and Israel's military-technical  assistance. After this, "stealth" technology began spreading  successfully through the world arms market.)    Mobile peacemaking strike forces didn't usually stay in one  place very long. An effort was made to replace them in regions  of operations as quickly as possible with "conventional"  brigades and divisions of ground forces and MVD, consisting  mostly of conscripts, as well as with volunteer formations made  up of local proponents of integration of the former USSR into  the "new" Federation. Thus the General Staff almost always had a  reserve at its disposal for unforeseen complications. By the  way, mobile peacemaking forces were used extremely rarely in the  territory of the Russian Federation itself (with the exception  of the Northern Caucasus). The unity of the Russian Federation  was fully ensured by special MVD units by the year 2000.    As in 1993-1994, the unemployed, adventurers, vagrants,  mercenaries who had managed to make war in various hot spots,  and other unreliable persons sought the opportunity to enlist in  the prestigious mobile forces. Special units were created for  this contingent under the principle of the French Foreign  Legion, which accepted all physically healthy men who were  citizens of any independent country. The mobile peacemaking  forces protected the enlistee from prosecution by the law, and  provided him with "clean" documents. However, during the  contract period professional junior officers maintained the  strictest possible discipline in the special units, essentially  having uncontrolled life and death power over their soldiers.  Also, a sizeable number of women were serving on a contract  basis in "conventional" combined units of the mobile forces.    By the year 2000, pacification of the former USSR was  practically complete, and the now-stronger Russian Armed Forces  had once again become the strongest army in Eurasia.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Russian reformists denounce call to ban Communist party Russia's Choice, the leading reformist group in the Russian election campaign, has sharply criticised Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, for calling for the banning of the Communist and other parties for their attacks on the draft constitution. In doing so, it has distanced itself from Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president - who had threatened to deprive parties of television airtime for criticising the draft. The move, which puts Russia's Choice in the same camp as other conservative and reformist parties - both in opposing a ban and the loss of airtime - shows that it has decided it may be better to demonstrate opposition to the president rather than to democratic practice. Meanwhile the latest poll - by the 'Mnenie' organisation - showed both main reformist parties, Russia's Choice and the Yabloko group of Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, losing ground compared to their position in mid-November. The poll also showed a surge of support for the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. However, the poll is of doubtful value as it recorded nearly 50 per cent of respondents as 'Don't knows'. Publication of further polls will be banned from today until election day, December 12. Mr Shumeiko's call for a ban on the communists has been rejected by the electoral commission. However, the call electrified the pre-election atmosphere; it followed a warning by President Yeltsin of the loss of the free broadcasting for all 13 groups contesting the election. Mr Yeltsin had also proposed that the two chambers of parliament meet in two buildings far apart - a proposal also criticised by Russia's Choice as hindering efficiency. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister who heads the group, said on Tuesday night that criticism of the constitution was no grounds for banning a party. Mr Gennady Burbulis, a former close aide to Mr Yeltsin and another leader of Russia's Choice, yesterday apologised for Mr Shumeiko, condemned his call and said it did not reflect the position of Russia's Choice. Mr Gary Kasparov, the chess champion who is a Russia's Choice candidate, went further, saying that 'the whole group will suffer' for Mr Shumeiko's action, which he said was 'irresponsible'.

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador's banana exports defy crisis fears CONTRARY TO forecasts by industry experts, Ecuador's banana exports did not plummet in response to the European Community's import restrictions. In fact exports up to the end of September were slightly up on the same period last year. The recovery of the world's largest banana exporter came after sales earlier this year slumped considerably in anticipation of the EC restrictions. Between January and September 1993 exports totalled 1.978m tonnes, compared with 1.977m tonnes exported in the first seven months of 1992. The sales increase for Ecuadorian bananas in the world market is partially in compensation for production losses in central America, where Hurricane Gert destroyed large tracts of banana plantations. Meanwhile, new markets in Asia and the Middle East helped offset losses caused by EC restrictions. At the same time Ecuadorian bananas have become more competitive worldwide. According to Mr Jose Riofrio, head of promotion and marketing for bananas in the ministry of agriculture, the government's price cut of 40 US cents a box  -nearly 9 per cent - in June has had a beneficial effect on sales of the country's fruit. In addition, Ecuador has increased its productivity by phasing out inefficient plantations and has reduced the cost of fumigation. While the area cultivated was reduced from 140,000 hectares last year to 103,000 hectares by this September, production during that period actually increased slightly. Earlier this year the Union of Banana Growers and Exporters, representing central America and Columbia, had criticised Ecuador, which had increased its banana cultivation area by 30 per cent since 1991, for oversupplying the market. Reductions in unit costs will not be sufficient to enable the producers to sustain the June reduction in the price they are paid by exporters. Producers and exporters are to meet shortly with the agriculture minister, Mariano Gonzalez, to discuss the new price adjustments. The National Banana Association has demanded that the reference price paid to producers for a box of bananas be taken back to USDollars 4.50 from Dollars 4.10. It is unlikely, however, that this will happen. While producers have taken a cut in revenues the country has not experienced anything like the forecast sales crisis. Government estimates had placed potential losses resulting from EC import restrictions at Dollars 70m a year. The government now forecasts total exports for this year will be between 2.52m and 2.55m tonnes, up from 2.51m in 1992.</p>

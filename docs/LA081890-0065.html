			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEST PILOTS' MONUMENT DRAPED IN SECRECY;  </P> <P> COMMEMORATION: GRANITE 'WALK OF HONOR' ON A LANCASTER STREET TO HONOR FIVE  AVIATORS.  </P> <P> The secrecy surrounding preparations for the "Aerospace Walk of Honor" in  Lancaster, a sidewalk monument display that will honor Edwards Air Force Base  test pilots, rivals the secrecy of the pilots' experimental flights.  </P> <P> Next month, city officials will launch the project by unveiling five granite  monuments along Lancaster Boulevard honoring five distinguished pilots. The  tribute is modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame and celebrity "walks"  elsewhere.  </P> <P> This week, officials showed off the official logo that will appear on aluminum  medallions affixed to each monument. It depicts a test pilot staring off into a  sky streaked with jet trails.  </P> <P> But the names of the five pilots to be honored and the 10 other nominees remain  a closely guarded secret. Officials have not disclosed the identities of the  seven members of the panel that voted on the nominees; in fact, none of the  members know the names of their colleagues on the panel.  </P> <P> Even the exact location of the Walk of Honor is unclear. Planners will only say  that "pedestrian-size" monuments designed by a City Hall graphics artist will  be placed along an unspecified three-block stretch of Lancaster Boulevard  downtown.  </P> <P> "We are trying to keep it strictly confidential," said Assistant City Manager  Dennis Davenport. "The intent is to maintain the integrity of the program. We  want to avoid any pressure from peers or the public and prevent anyone from  lobbying on behalf of nominees."  </P> <P> Many of the nominees, whose service spans 48 years of flight testing at the  base 20 miles north of Lancaster, are internationally known and include pilots  who later became astronauts, officials said.  </P> <P> Asked if the list includes Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) or Chuck Yeager, two of the  most widely known test pilots, Davenport said: "People who have accomplishments  like that are certainly being considered. These are the best of the best in a  profession that is extraordinary."  </P> <P> But Lancaster spokeswoman Nancy Walker said fame is not the only qualification.  </P> <P> "They are looking at a history of achievement in the field, people who have  been continuously outstanding, not just one thing that brought them media  attention," Walker said.  </P> <P> The Aerospace Walk of Honor is believed to be the first such tribute in the  nation, officials said. There is an aviation Hall of Fame in Ohio, officials  said, but Lt. Col. Jan Dalby of Edwards Air Force Base said, "As far as we  know, there is no other test-pilot walk of fame in the country."  </P> <P> City Council members first proposed the idea in 1982 but then shelved it  because of the need to revitalize the aging Lancaster Boulevard commercial  strip. Like other old downtown areas, Lancaster Boulevard had deteriorated with  the growth of outlying shopping malls. A performing arts center under  construction and a historical museum are among recent redevelopment projects in  the area that has been chosen for the monuments.  </P> <P> City officials hope the monuments will draw tourists to the area by promoting  the Antelope Valley as an aerospace center and capitalizing on Edwards and  Plant 42, a Palmdale manufacturing center for experimental military aircraft.  They are targeting aerospace buffs who already visit a museum at Edwards and  drive long distances to watch space shuttles and the B-2 Stealth bomber  flights.  </P> <P> The selection panel consists of military, commercial and private aviators, an  aerospace historian, a representative of the locally based Society of  Experimental Test Pilots and two civic leaders. If the project goes well, five  more pilots will be honored next year, Walker said.  </P> <P> The Walk of Honor will cost the city about $60,000 when complete, Davenport  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> URGES BIGGER SOVIET CUTBACK;  </P> <P> BAKER FAILS TO HEAL RIFT WITH BONN ON MISSILES  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III failed Friday to heal a rift with West  Germany over nuclear missiles, leaving a shadow over the May 29-30 summit  President Bush will attend with other Western leaders.  </P> <P> "If we had bridged the gap I would tell you," Baker told reporters after he met  with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He said the security  of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could be at risk if the allies let  their nuclear defenses down.  </P> <P> Baker, in comments echoed by other NATO foreign ministers, described Kremlin  leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to withdraw 500 short-range warheads  from Eastern Europe this year as a good but "very modest" step given Soviet  numerical advantage in that field.  </P> <P> Speaking at a news conference after briefing the ministers on his two-day trip  to Moscow last week, Baker said the cuts had to be compared with NATO's  unilateral reduction of 2,400 warheads this decade.  </P> <P> He also suggested that Gorbachev's short-range nuclear forces (SNF) proposal  was flawed in that there was no commitment to destroy the warheads or to  withdraw them any further back than the European territory of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Asked if he was reconsidering U.S. opposition to early talks with Warsaw Pact  nations on reducing short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, Baker said: "Maybe  it's time for more unilateral reductions on the part of the Soviet Union. That  would be welcome."  </P> <P> In Britain Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe also said Gorbachev's offer was  welcome.  </P> <P> "But it is a proposal to withdraw warheads which could, of course, be returned  again," Howe said.  </P> <P> Baker called the news conference apparently with an eye to denying Gorbachev a  clear public relations victory with his arms proposals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Deeds, Not Words  </P> <P> He rejected a reporter's assertion that Gorbachev was upstaging the Bush  Administration with his new proposals.  </P> <P> "Our view is that because of the big imbalances that exist in weaponry across  the full range there is no way we are going to win by trying to play a public  relations game of outbidding the Soviet Union with respect to arms control,"  Baker said.  </P> <P> "We must keep our attention focused on the security of the West. Where we see  deeds as opposed to words we must be prepared to react. But we are entitled to  look for deeds and to probe and look for real evidence of the so-called new  thinking," he added.  </P> <P> The United States and Britain are resisting pressure from front-line West  Germany and other smaller European allies to hold early talks with the East  Bloc on cutting short-range weapons.  </P> <P> Baker conceded that in separate talks Friday with West German Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher that no compromise had emerged to bridge the  differences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Security Issue Stressed  </P> <P> He said that while U.S. differences with West Germany posed political problems,  "what would be a worse disaster is if we let domestic politics endanger the  security of the alliance."  </P> <P> After their discussion, Genscher said that while the Lance modernization issue  was no closer to agreement, "it was not the aim of this meeting to make  progress."  </P> <P> Baker said that after a "full exchange" on the issue, he hoped that Genscher  "better understands our position." He said he was still hopeful for a  settlement before the NATO meeting in two weeks.  </P> <P> He also met Friday with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek, whose  country is one of several NATO members trying to mediate in the modernization  debate.  </P> <P> The Dutch official said he had "good hope" the issue will be resolved and  didn't think Gorbachev's proposal "will have a direct influence."  </P></p>

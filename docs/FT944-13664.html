			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Shorts receives Pounds 50m order from Kuwait Shorts, the Belfast-based aerospace company, has received a Pounds 50m order for air defence missiles from Kuwait. The announcement of the order came at the end of a visit to the emirate by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. The order was said to be a surprise to the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Export Services Organisation and Shorts. The company will supply Kuwait with the Starburst shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile. Starburst - the immediate successor to the Javelin system, which Shorts has sold to more than 10 countries - has been developed to destroy high-performance low-flying aircraft as well as attack helicopters. The Starburst is a competitor to the US-made Stinger missile, which was used by rebels in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft. Mr Terry Stone, Shorts Missile Systems chief executive, said: 'We are delighted that Starburst was selected over its rivals to win this prestigious multi-million pound contract. 'Its forward hit capability and unjammable laser guidance clearly proved it is in a class of its own and we value highly the Kuwait government's endorsement of Starburst's effectiveness.' Shorts, which has been promoting Starburst in the Middle East, particularly Kuwait, since 1991, said the contract would not affect plans to cut 240 jobs at its plant in Belfast.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Projected Patriot Deployment in S. Korea Denounced"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  [CPRF] released a statement today warning that if the U.S. and  South Korean bellicose quarters brought Patriot missiles into  South Korea and persistently sought a war in spite of the strong  opposition of people at home and abroad, they would have to pay  dearly for it.    Viewing their aggressive arms buildup and war provocation  moves as a heinous criminal act to disturb the peace and  security of the Korean peninsula and Asia and plunge the Korean  nation into a nuclear war holocaust, the statement says:    The United States is openly bringing nuclear weapons into  South Korea and scheming to continue nuclear war games. This  indicates that it seeks a solution to the issue not through  negotiation but by strength, unilaterally reneging on its  promise to refrain from threatening the DPRK with nuclear  weapons which was stipulated in the DPRK-USA joint statement.    The South Korean puppets continue introducing U.S. nuclear  weapons into South Korea to slay the fellow countrymen in the  North with the help of outside forces. This is an anti-national  criminal act which can be committed only by flunkeyist traitors  without a shred of national independence and an unpardonable  perfidious act of unilaterally denouncing and reducing to a  sheet of waste paper the North-South joint declaration on  denuclearization banning the production, introduction and  possession of nuclear weapons.    If the strained situation is to be relaxed in Korea and a  correct solution to be found, the U.S. hostile policy toward the  DPRK must be changed and such flunkeyist traitors as Kim  Yong-sam be removed from power in South Korea to be replaced by  pro-reunification, democratic forces, national independent  forces which value the sovereignty of the Korean people.    The United States and the South Korean puppets would be well  advised to stop running riot, clearly mindful that with no  amount of military threat, can they frighten the Korean people  united in one mind around the party and the leader or stifle  Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES: EASTERN EUROPE, 1989;  </P> <P> CHAPTER 4 POLAND;  </P> <P> 'IT'S THE END OF AN AGE' -- AND A NEW START;  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY'S OVERWHELMING VICTORY MOVES THE COUNTRY INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY.  </P> <P> Two days after the vote, virtually everyone in a key political position in  Poland, on either side of the political divide, knew that the country was  moving into uncharted territory.  </P> <P> The results of the vote became fully known to insiders by Monday night, June 5,  although official results were not to be released for another day. On June 6,  Rakowski met over breakfast with his inner circle, and they had just been hit  with the full scale of the disaster. The group was weary, and the sense of loss  hung in the air. One participant, acid-tongued government spokesman Jerzy  Urban, summarized the news.  </P> <P> "This is not just a lost election, gentlemen," he said, "it's the end of an  age."  </P> <P> "We looked at the situation and came to the conclusion that a government should  be formed by Solidarity," another participant, Labor Minister Ireneusz Sekula,  said later. "But this was not a motion that was going to be accepted by the  party."  </P> <P> They saw the situation as hanging in the balance and extremely dangerous. There  were fears of a party rebellion -- perhaps even of action by the army or  police.  </P> <P> At the same moment that Rakowski and his colleagues were conferring, Kiszczak  was meeting with representatives of Solidarity.  </P> <P> "He told us," Solidarity's Geremek recalled, "that the situation from the  government point of view was very difficult. He asked us if it was our  intention to take power. Our answer was that we would keep to the round-table  agreements as they were established."  </P> <P> The part of the accord Geremek referred to was the agreed balance of power in  Parliament -- the 65%-35% split between the Communists and Solidarity. The  ignominious defeat of the national list candidates threw the balance out. Now  both the government and Solidarity were stuck with trying to find a solution.  </P> <P> On June 8, the Magdalinka group convened to work out the problem.  </P> <P> "You could feel the tension in the room," one Solidarity leader said. "Kiszczak  opened the meeting. He said Solidarity had conducted a confrontational  campaign, had violated the spirit of the round table. He said we should know  that on that morning, the committee for the defense of the country was sitting  and that some military units were on alert."  </P> <P> Walesa was ready with an answer.  </P> <P> "General, we have been through all this many times since 1981," Walesa said.  "It is not our fault the national list lost. It lost because, for the first  time, the people could make a choice without manipulation. That is why, when I  had the chance, I marked out your name, not once, but so many times I had holes  in the paper."  </P> <P> Walesa's comment, which brought a laugh from at least the Solidarity side,  lowered the tension. And Solidarity made it clear it would accept any solution,  as long as it had a legal basis. It was up to the Communists to find it.  </P> <P> The meeting went from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. In the end, 33 new candidates were  simply added to the Communist ballot in the second round of the elections. It  solved the immediate problem, but psychologically, a corner had been turned. In  effect, Solidarity had bailed out the party.  </P> <P> As some pointed out, Solidarity paid a price with its supporters, most of whom  wanted to see the Communists thrown out immediately. The task of the  leadership, Geremek said, was "to avoid a triumphant tone." It was largely  successful, but pressure was building from "mid-level" Solidarity activists and  vociferous rank-and-file followers.  </P> <P>  In Budapest, a solemn crowd estimated at 200,000 paid tribute to Imre Nagy,  prime minister for 13 tumultuous days during the 1956 Hungarian revolt.  </P> <P>  Convicted in a Communist show trial, hanged and buried face down in an  unmarked grave in 1958, Nagy and four associates, executed with him, were  reburied as heroes, on a day the authorities declared a "national day of  mourning."  </P> <P>  For more than three decades Nagy's name had been taboo in Hungary.  </P> <P>  In Prague, in closing remarks to a Central Committee meeting of the  Czechoslovak Communist Party, Milos Jakes, the party chief, said that pessimism  and nihilism were creeping into the minds of Czechoslovak Communists for no  reason.  </P> <P> The next problem to arise was Jaruzelski, who announced that he would not be a  candidate for president, pointing out -- correctly -- that most of the public  associated his name with the hated period of martial law and not with the  reforms he had pushed through the Communist Party. The party immediately passed  a resolution urging him to reconsider.  </P> <P> On July 3, a front-page editorial in the Solidarity newspaper argued that in  exchange for giving the presidency to the Communists, Solidarity should be  allowed to choose the prime minister and form the government. Now, in the  Solidarity camp, the issue was openly debated.  </P> <P> After three weeks, Jaruzelski agreed to stand for the presidency. The  parliamentary vote on July 19 was a cliffhanger: He won with the absolute  minimum of votes -- and only because some Solidarity members stayed away or  actually cast votes for him. The narrowness of the vote was yet another  important sign.  </P> <P> Less than two weeks later, Jaruzelski nominated Kiszczak as prime minister. But  by now a full-scale rebellion was under way among the Communists' erstwhile  allies in the Sejm: the United Peasants and the Democratic parties.  </P> <P> What happened next was one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of  Polish politics. Views of it differ, according to the perspective of various  participants, but the accounts match in the essential points.  </P> <P> Solidarity's parliamentary leaders had been quietly working the corridors in  what was looking like a promising effort to pry the United Peasants and the  Democrats loose from their Communist allies. Their advances were directed at  Alexander Bentkowski, the floor leader of the United Peasants, and his  Democratic counterpart. Both were receptive to cutting a deal. Bentkowski,  especially, saw no future for his party in a continuing partnership with a  Communist Party that was in obvious decline.  </P> <P> The Parliament's vote on Kiszczak was set for Aug. 2. On the day before, it  appeared to Bentkowski that an agreement had been reached. A lawyer by  profession, intense and nervous by nature, his immediate concern was to sell  the proposition to the 75 other United Peasant Party deputies.  </P> <P> Both the Communists and Solidarity would offer generous rewards to his party,  but, Bentkowski said, "Poland needed a political shock" -- a clear change in  direction.  </P> <P> "There were cameras in the hallway of the Sejm, outside the room where we were  meeting," he recalled. "And a reporter asked me if the Peasants were going to  vote for Kiszczak. We had not made a decision, but I decided we must go ahead,  so I said that at least 60 Peasant Party deputies and perhaps as many as 12  Communists would vote against Kiszczak."  </P> <P> The news shot through political circles. Mieczyslaw Rakowski, newly installed  as Communist Party leader, raced to the Sejm from a hospital bed and read the  riot act to a joint meeting of the coalition. He told them, Bentkowski said,  that their defection would be the cause of an "unnecessary growth in tension in  this country" -- a choice of words that some deputies considered a veiled  threat of martial law.  </P> <P> The next day, Solidarity leaders believe, Bentkowski either lost his nerve or  decided to delay and press for a bigger price for his cooperation. According to  the plan, Bronislaw Geremek was to open the Sejm meeting with an announcement  that Solidarity was prepared to welcome the United Peasants and the Democrats  into a new Solidarity-led coalition.  </P> <P> But Geremek's statement contained no such bold declaration, only a statement  that Solidarity would vote against Kiszczak.  </P> <P> At last, Kiszczak's nomination was introduced and passed easily. Only a handful  of United Peasants' Party deputies voted against it. Bentkowski was furious.  </P> <P> And so, indeed, was Walesa.  </P> <P> His closest aides said he first began to talk of a Solidarity government the  day after the June election, in a state of near-euphoria. But the trade union's  brain trust, including Geremek and longtime activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki,  counseled against it, arguing that Solidarity was not prepared to run a  government and that the trauma would be too great for the Communists, who might  overreact in opposition to it. Walesa went along. But as events unfolded, it  seemed to him the time had come.  </P> <P> The night of the United Peasants' Party's aborted revolt, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a  newly elected senator and one of Walesa's closest aides, drove to the country  home outside Warsaw where Walesa was staying with his wife's family. He got the  Solidarity leader out of bed at midnight to tell him the story and to warn him  that the United Peasants' Party was under heavy pressure. Walesa, Kaczynski  said, had left instructions with the Sejm leadership to call him if a deal was  about to be made. To his consternation, no one had called.  </P> <P> From this point on, Kaczynski said, "Walesa decided to take this matter into  his own hands." On Aug. 7, he issued a statement inviting the United Peasants  and the Democrats to join a coalition that would exclude the Communists.  </P> <P> Two days later, Kaczynski left Warsaw and met in northern Poland with Walesa.  Also present was Kaczynski's twin brother, Lech, and another key Solidarity  aide.  </P> <P> "Walesa was now convinced," Kaczynski said, "that if he wanted to do this, he  was going to have to go around the top leadership. So we worked out a plan, and  I was assigned to go back to Warsaw and carry out the talks to arrange it.  </P> <P> "We talked about who should be prime minister, and it was decided -- Walesa  decided -- it should be Mazowiecki. Later, there were other names mentioned,  but the decision was Mazowiecki. It was always Mazowiecki."  </P> <P> But Kaczynski, his brother and the other aide "were convinced that Walesa  himself had to be the bait -- he had to offer himself for the job of prime  minister. He was very nervous about this. He did not want the job. We told him,  'Look, you're just the rabbit. Don't worry.' We talked from noon until about 5  p.m. He agreed."  </P> <P> Certainly, when the upper-level Solidarity activists speak candidly, they did  not welcome the idea of Walesa as prime minister either. One said of him: "He  sings the tune, the rest of us march." The niggling, endless detail of the job,  they all agree, "would drive Lech nuts." And yet the notion that he might take  the job was the last, the irresistible, force. The deal, from that moment on,  was essentially done.  </P> <P> Tadeusz Mazowiecki, at that point the editor of Solidarity's weekly paper, was  a close Walesa ally. Also important, he was close to the Roman Catholic Church.  He was modest, never ambitious for power or influence, and Walesa trusted him.  </P> <P> Kaczynski returned to Warsaw and cut the deal with the United Peasants and the  Democrats. On Aug. 11, the Soviet ambassador in Warsaw met with the heads of  both parties, apparently reassuring them that Moscow would not block their  defection from an alliance with the Communists that went back 40 years.  </P> <P> Two days later, Walesa came to Warsaw and sealed the alliance. That night he  met with the Solidarity presidium in the Sejm. There was a long discussion, and  at the end of it, Walesa said he would submit three names to Jaruzelski as  candidates for prime minister.  </P> <P> The next day, Walesa returned to Gdansk, and Czeslaw Kiszczak resigned.  </P> <P> On the night of Aug. 16, the arrangement complete, Solidarity, the United  Peasants and the Democrats met in the Sejm in a joint caucus. This time Walesa  arrived, triumphant, and played the act to the hilt. Walesa told the assembly  that he would accept the post of prime minister. Referring to himself in the  third person, Walesa said: "I never dreamed that Lech Walesa could be prime  minister."  </P> <P> Once the formal ratification of the new alliance was done, however, his tune  changed. When, as he left the building, he was asked by journalists if he was  going to be the new prime minister, he said, "Naw, there are . . . better men  for the job."  </P> <P> The next day, Walesa met with Jaruzelski. He handed the general a slip of  paper. Three names were written on it.  </P> <P> "This is my nominee," Walesa said, indicating Mazowiecki. "You can also say you  considered the other two."  </P> <P> The next day one Solidarity leader encountered Mazowiecki on the stairway of  the Sejm. He remembered that, not long before, Mazowiecki had been among the  four or five men who had reasoned most persuasively that the time still was not  right for the government to be taken by Solidarity. Now, Mazowiecki had been  chosen to lead it. How did it happen?  </P> <P> Mazowiecki said it had happened on the night the leadership met with Walesa in  the Sejm.  </P> <P> "He came to me in the night, after the meeting," Mazowiecki said. "He said, 'I  want you to be prime minister. You have a night to think about it.' "  Mazowiecki smiled tiredly.  </P> <P> "What else could I do?"  </P> <P>  In Prague, rumors circulated widely that police would be issued live  ammunition to control crowds at a planned demonstration to mark the 21st  anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion on Aug. 21, 1968. Vaclav Havel took them  seriously enough to issue a public appeal to cancel the protest. Ominously, the  Czechoslovak government warned diplomatic missions in Prague that foreign  tourists and journalists could be endangered by "illegal" demonstrations  planned for the anniversary.  </P> <P>  On Aug. 21, about 10,000 people demonstrated in Wenceslas Square. Police broke  up the march by employing the usual method -- the truncheon -- and arrested 320  Czechoslovak citizens and 50 foreigners.  </P> <P> </P></p>

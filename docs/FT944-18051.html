			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Travel losses push CSI down Shares in Cannon Street Investments fell from 26 1/2 p to close at 15 1/2 p yesterday after the mini-conglomerate revealed a decline in operating profit for the 28 weeks to July 16 and failed to announce its long-awaited debt restructuring and acquisition package. The group said substantial losses from its travel business had reduced pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 217,000. The figure last time, however, included Pounds 4.32m profit from disposals. Turnover fell to Pounds 87m (Pounds 99.6m) while trading profit from continuing business was sharply lower at Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 2.88m). The company had been forecast to make Pounds 7m for the full year. It had also been expected to combine the announcement with details of an acquisition, which will almost certainly require shareholder funding and the restructuring of the Pounds 25.7m preference shares held by the Bank of Scotland. This package is now likely to be revealed at the end of October. Profits from the core electronics business declined from Pounds 3.25m to Pounds 2.72m. However, Altai, which accounted for about 60 per cent of the division's profits, experienced strong growth in its European markets, where sales volumes rose by 35 per cent. Any acquisition is likely to be aimed at building on the strength of this core business. Food and drink distribution contributed Pounds 553,000 (Pounds 323,000), but the hotels and leisure operations lost Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 86,000) after a Pounds 800,000 loss from Cotsworld Travel. The division is expected to be profitable in the second half. Losses per share were 1.41p (3.01p earnings). Outstanding preference dividends amount to Pounds 4.48m, and the company cannot fund acquisitions, or resume dividends, until the preference shares are restructured.</p>

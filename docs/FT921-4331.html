			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Nuclear Electric forced to halt auction of contracts NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, yesterday froze its latest auction of long-term supply contracts after being criticised by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, for squeezing the market. Prof Littlechild, presenting his annual report, said the generator had caused difficulties for customers by putting a very high reserve price on the two auctions it had held. He said: 'This is a matter of concern. I am therefore monitoring Nuclear Electric's dealings in the contract markets and will wish to ensure that there is no undue restriction of contract availability.' The generator has been offering contracts, mainly to regional electricity distribution companies, for the 1992-93 period. Fewer than half the contracts on offer in the first auction were sold because of the high prices set by Nuclear Electric. High prices in the second auction led to few additional sales. Nuclear Electric has also drawn fire from large industrial power users, which feared it was helping to cause an overall rise in power prices. Although the group has only a 20 per cent share of the overall power market it has a strong influence over the contract market. Other generators channel much output to the domestic market, in which Nuclear Electric does not compete. Prof Littlechild said he would discuss with Nuclear Electric more appropriate ways of selling its contracts. He said the group's licence should contain similar requirements to those of the other generators about plant availability.</p>

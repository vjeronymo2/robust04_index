			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions Last week, we highlighted a large sale in Polypipe, citing it as one of the few building material companies to have prospered in the recession. Ironically, this week features a large sale in Spring Ram, the bathroom and kitchen specialist, which has proved itself adept at bucking the trend in that sector. Last June, William Rooney, the chairman and co-founder, sold 22m shares at 105p. Since then, the share price has continued to rise, and Ronald Farr sold 1m shares at 162p. In terms of timing, it would be difficult to improve upon the sales of Donald Lewin. As chairman of Clinton Cards, a greeting card retailer, he sold a total of 500,000 shares in May last year at prices between 297p and 300p. In retrospect ,this marked the very peak for the shares, which have since fallen sharply. The company slipped into the red in the year ended January 1992. Three other directors, including the managing director, have now bought a total of 60,000 shares at 60p, 80 per cent lower than the level at which their chairman sold. For those who follow directors' dealings, Astec (BSR) has proved a rewarding investment. Directors were buying at 10p in December, and accumulated more stock in January at around the 12-13p mark. The latest purchases were at 17p.

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Final approach to be made to Germany over fighter BRITAIN, Spain and Italy, three of the four nations in the troubled European Fighter Aircraft programme, agreed yesterday to make a last-ditch attempt to bring Germany, the fourth member, back into the project. However, there appeared to be differences between defence ministers over how the project should proceed. Spain has apparently taken the side of Germany in demanding at least a 30 per cent cut in the price of each aircraft. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, and his counterparts, Mr Salvo Ando from Italy, and Mr Julian Garcia Vargas from Spain, called in a joint statement after a London meeting for more talks with Germany. Later Mr Rifkind met Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, although he would not say in advance what would be discussed. Last week Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said the participation of France, which is building the Rafale advanced fighter aircraft, might solve the problems with the EFA project. After their meeting yesterday, the three ministers proposed that officials and industry 'should study possible ways of (continuing with the project) within a lower ceiling price'. Germany, which said this month that it did not intend to participate in production of the aircraft, says the EFA is too expensive. But disagreements emerged between the three defence ministers over what to do if Germany reaffirmed its decision to pull out of EFA. Mr Rifkind said if this happened 'we all go to the three-nation project', but Mr Ando said the remaining three countries would only decide what to do after any German reaffirmation. All three ministers agreed, however, that the next step was for Germany to decide whether it was prepared to hold more talks with its EFA partners. Mr Rifkind said he expected to hear from Mr Ruhe 'within a few days'. These talks could then be held 'in weeks rather than months'. Mr Garcia Vargas said that if Germany did pull out, a new partner should be found, not necessarily from Europe. He said Spain would remain in the project if each aircraft cost 30 per cent less than is currently projected. This is in line with German proposals. Last week, Mr Ruhe said he wanted an aircraft that was 30-40 per cent cheaper than EFA, for which estimated prices vary between Pounds 25m and Pounds 45m, depending on whether running costs and inflation are included. The three ministers said that 'to have a European aircraft programme continues to be an important objective both to provide a cost-effective military capability and to keep European industries in the forefront of aerospace technology'. They emphasised the importance of maintaining 'the original four-nation collaborative structure of the common air fighter whilst welcoming any other Western European Union nation which might wish to join'.

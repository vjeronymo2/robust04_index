			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KENNEDY JR. ARGUES FIRST CASE IN COURT  </P> <P> John F. Kennedy Jr., who recently passed the state bar exam on his third try,  has argued his first case in court, a published report said.  </P> <P> Kennedy, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, argued for 10 minutes  Wednesday before three judges in the state appellate court that a  purse-snatcher's conviction should not be overturned, the New York Post  reported. The judges will hand down a verdict in January.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old son of slain President John F. Kennedy went to work for the  district attorney in August, 1989.  </P> <P> He had failed the grueling New York bar exam twice and was in danger of losing  his prosecutor's job if he flunked a third time.  </P></p>

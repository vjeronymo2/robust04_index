			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, measures will be taken prior to or during the proposed extended AOT for those fire regions that rely on one or more safe shutdown methods which would all be unable to safely shutdown the plant with inoperable loops of the ESW and RHRSW systems or the inoperable systems that ESW or RHRSW support. These measures will offset the increased risk of a fire event occurring in the vulnerable areas, during the fourteen day versus three day AOT period. Therefore, the proposed extended AOT does not adversely affect the approved level of fire protection as described in UFSAR Appendix 9A (Fire Protection Evaluation Report).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A special procedure will be written to administratively control the requirement to maintain the operability of specified components and implementation of any appropriate compensatory measures which are deemed necessary during the proposed AOT. In addition, operations personnel are fully qualified by normal periodic training to respond to and mitigate a Design Basis Accident, including the actions needed to ensure decay heat removal while LGS Unit 1 and Unit 2 are in the operational configurations described within this submittal. Accordingly, procedures are already in place that cover safe plant shutdown and decay heat removal for situations applicable to those in the proposed AOTs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) Study was performed for an ESW and RHRSW loop being out-of-service for 14 days on an operating unit. This analysis includes EDG D12 being aligned to `A' ESW and HPCI and RCIC not requiring room cooling. No other deviations from the bounding assumptions used in the base PSA model were made. The Core Damage Frequency (CDF) increased by 2.7x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &hyph;6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , from 5.11x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &hyph;6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /reactor-year to 7.8x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &hyph;6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  /reactor-year. In absolute terms, this is not a significant increase in risk. In addition, the modifications to be installed during this proposed extended AOT will allow for future maintenance and inspections to be performed on the ESW and RHRSW loops without removing an entire loop from service, which will reduce risk in the future. For example, if the ESW loop unavailability, due to testing or maintenance, is reduced by half, the CDF will decrease by more than four percent. It will also minimize the potential need for future AOT extensions on these systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the implementation of the proposed one-time TS changes will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> J.W.

Specifically, the proposed changes are: (1) Revise the TS section titles in the Table of Contents to agree with the TS section titles in the body of the TS. (2) Revise TS Section 3.5.A.1 to provide proper reference to the revised TS Section 3.5.F. (3) Revise TS Section 3.5.A.3 to provide proper reference to the revised TS Section 3.5.F. (4) Revise TS Section 3.5.B.1 to delete the reference to TS Section 3.5.F.3. (5) Revise TS Section 3.5.F to require the limiting condition for operation (LCO) governing minimum low pressure cooling availability when irradiated fuel is in the reactor vessel and the reactor is in the cold condition to be identical with the corresponding LCO in NUREG&hyph;1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' (6) Revise TS Section 4.5.F to require the surveillance requirements (SR) governing minimum low pressure cooling availability when irradiated fuel is in the reactor vessel and the reactor is in the cold condition to be identical with the corresponding SR in NUREG&hyph;1433. (7) Revise TS BASES 3.5.A to delete the reference to the core spray subsystem as also providing a source for flooding of the core in case of accidental draining because the information is being added to TS BASES 3.5.F. (8) Revise TS BASES 3.5.F to be consistent with the corresponding TS BASES in NUREG&hyph;1433. (9) Revise TS BASES 4.5 to be consistent with the corresponding TS BASES in NUREG&hyph;1433. (10) Revise TS Section 3.7.A.1 to provide proper reference to the revised TS Section 3.5.F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed changes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are administrative in nature and involve no technical changes to the TS. These proposed changes do not impact initiators of analyzed events or the assumed mitigation of accidents or transients events. Therefore, these changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed changes 5 and 6 will not increase the probability of initiating an analyzed event or alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident or transient event. These changes will not alter the operation of process variables or systems, structures, or components (SSC) as described in the safety analyses. These changes do not involve any physical changes to plant SSC. TS requirements that govern Operability or routine testing and verification of plant components and variables are not assumed to be initiators of any analyzed event. The proposed changes will not alter the operation of equipment assumed to be available for the mitigation of accidents or transients by the plant safety analysis or licensing basis. The proposed changes establish or maintain adequate assurance that components are operable when necessary for the prevention or mitigation of accidents or transients and that plant variables are maintained within limits necessary to satisfy the assumptions for initial conditions in the safety analysis. These changes have been confirmed to ensure no previously evaluated accident has been adversely affected. These changes will not allow continuous plant operation with plant conditions during a unit outage such that a single failure will result in a loss of any safety function. Therefore, the changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type of equipment will be installed or removed) and will not alter the method used by any system to perform its design function. The proposed changes do not allow plant operation in any mode that is not already evaluated. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed changes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are administrative in nature and will not involve any technical changes. These proposed changes will not reduce a margin of safety because they have no impact on any safety analysis assumptions. Because these changes are administrative in nature, no question of safety is involved. Therefore, these changes do not reduce the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed changes 5 and 6 add some new requirements and make some existing requirements more restrictive. These changes will not impact any safety analysis assumptions. Adding new requirements and making existing ones more restrictive either increases or does not affect the margin of safety. As such, no question of safety is involved. Therefore, these changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed changes 5 and 6 also make three less restrictive changes. The first change deletes the requirements for the containment cooling system when the reactor is in the Cold Condition. The containment cooling system is necessary to maintain primary containment Operable to mitigate the release of radioactive material following a DBA [design basis accident].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / French franc surges The French franc yesterday strengthened on the money markets to reach FFr3.409 against the D-Mark, its highest level since last summer's European currency crisis. Yesterday's gains, which were fuelled by the D-Mark's weakness and the announcement of a healthy current account surplus for France in September, marked a continuation of the franc's recent strong performance which has taken it back above its old floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark before the extension of the European exchange rate mechanism trading bands. The Paris stock market also benefited from the announcement by the Finance Ministry of a FFr9bn (Pounds 1.02bn) current account surplus for September and of a FFr56.53bn surplus for the first nine months of the year (against FFr4.02bn for the same period of 1992). The CAC-40 Index rose by 1.23 per cent during the day to close at 2,223.47. Economists said that investors' sentiment towards France had improved in recent weeks, reflecting cautious confidence in its recovery potential and relief at the successful outcome of the Gatt negotiations. However, they said the franc and French equities had also benefited from technical adjustments as investors have tried to balance their investment positions before the end of the year. 'The surge of interest in France is part of a general interest in European investments,' said Mr Christopher Potts, chief French economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'But it's also fair to say that the franc has been helped by the gradual realisation among investors that the Balladur government really is committed to maintaining stability with the D-Mark.' The mood of cautious confidence was reinforced by the publication of the latest economic forecast from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which predicted a modest recovery for the French economy in 1994, with growth of 1.1 per cent in gross domestic product. However, the OECD warned of a further increase in unemployment from its present record of 12 per cent of the French workforce to 12.5 per cent during 1994. It does not expect to see the unemployment rate fall until 1995, when it forecasts GDP growth of 2.7 per cent for France.</p>

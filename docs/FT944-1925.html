			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Man plans appeal ED&amp;F Man is to appeal against a decision by the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee to reclassify the agricultural and financial services group from the Food Manufacturing to the Other Financials sector. Mr Harvey McGrath, managing director, said that over two thirds of Man's profits come from the food business. However, the committee said a review of Man's operations over the past five years showed that most of the group's revenue was earned from financial services. The current year's revenues were unusual in that the group's fund management business had underperformed.</p>

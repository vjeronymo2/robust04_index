			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Motoring: The eight-seater that acts like a car Peugeot's new people-carrier, the 806, is just 2in (5cm) longer than a 405 estate and a full 18in (45cm) shorter than the old 505, a jumbo-sized estate regarded highly by parents of three or more children. They know only too well that to travel legally, safely and comfortably en famille with luggage, you need three rows of forward-facing seats and a reasonable boot. Cars with these are few and far between. The 505 and the equally spacious Citroen CX went long ago, although Renault still has the three-row 21 Savanna estate. Otherwise, it has to be a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) such as the Toyota Previa, Renault Espace, Nissan Serena or, if you live on mainland Europe, Chrysler Voyager. The same criticism applies to conventional estate cars (Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Rover Montego, for example) having a pair of child seats that pull up from the load floor. These face backward and children tend not to like them for anything but short trips. Parents worry about their vulnerability to rear-end collisions - with good reason, I would think - and luggage space disappears. For 10 years, the Renault Espace has been Europe's best-selling MPV. Arguably, it is still the most stylish, but this week it came under assault. Peugeot's 806 'monospace' MPV, which has up to eight seats, went on sale in France priced between FFr139,000 (about Pounds 15,850) and FFr202,000 (Pounds 24,630). That is FFr5,000 to FFr7,000 (say Pounds 610 to Pounds 850) cheaper than a comparable Espace. The 806 - and its soon-to-appear Citroen, Fiat and Lancia clones - has been a joint PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) and Fiat project because neither group could have afforded to go it alone. For the same reason, Ford and Volkswagen have got together to produce their own MPV, due for launch in 1995. At the moment, the 806 is offered only with 16-valve two-litre petrol engines, one of them turbo-charged, although a diesel follows soon (and, perhaps, a V6 later on). Unfortunately for British families, 806s with right-hand steering are at least a year off although a few left-hand drives will be available before then. Holiday-home owners who spend a lot of time driving on mainland Europe might well fancy one. The 806 has a well thought-out interior offering a family freedom of movement. There are two normal front doors, two large sliding ones for the middle and back row passengers, and a large tailgate. The seats can be moved around or taken out as needed. Getting in and out is particularly easy. The floor is flat, the gear lever sprouts from the fascia, and the hand-brake is tucked away between the driving seat and door. A high seat gives the driver an unusually commanding view of the road. This apart, an 806 goes just like a car. Trying both models in France last week, I found them unperturbed by rough surfaces, nimble on curving, hilly lanes, and pleasantly quiet at autoroute cruising speeds. The 150-horsepower turbo-charged version was particularly lively and pulled like a train up gradients. The 123hp non-turbo engine was muscular enough driving two-up, although I suspect it might have to work fairly hard when propelling an 806 crammed with people and baggage. The ride was as good in the middle and back-row seats as it was up front with generous leg, knee, head and elbow room. Standard power steering and large exterior mirrors made parking this roomy, but far from bulky, car very easy. A hard-driven MPV will always use more fuel than a sleeker, more slippery saloon but a sensibly-driven, non-turbo 806 should average 28mpg (10 l/100km) and the turbo 27mph (10.46 l/100km). While in France, I also tried the latest versions of Peugeot's big luxury car, the 605. This has had a modest, mid-life face-lift and has been given two new engines: a two-litre, multi-valve, petrol four-cylinder and a 2.5-litre turbo-diesel with two balance shafts. The 605 has not made much of a mark in Britain, one possible reason being that it is easy to confuse with the cheaper and less prestigious 405. But it is an urbane and very comfortable car with a superb ride and an enormous boot. I thought the two-litre went well but the turbo-diesel was better; higher gearing made it quieter and more relaxed on the autoroute. Alas, the ultra-refined, 130hp, 2.5-litre turbo-diesel 605 will not come to Britain. Executive-class car drivers in France do not mind manual gearboxes, but most in the UK insist on automatics - and Peugeot does not have one that can cope with the 2.5's huge torque (pulling power at a given engine speed).</p>

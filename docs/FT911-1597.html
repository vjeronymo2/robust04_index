			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (4): Gamekeeper turns poacher / Alan Maidwell a former bank manager with a new niche ALAN Maidwell is something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. For 20 years he worked for Midland Bank, latterly as corporate banking manager for the north-east where he advised many companies throughout Tyneside, Wearside and Teeside. When the opportunity to take early retirement - he is 57 - came last year, he decided to put into practice for himself the business skills he had been urging on others. 'It was one thing to tell others how to do it but quite another to demonstrate that I can run a business successfully myself,' he says. Mr Maidwell chose to go into a franchised operation far removed from the popular image of fast-food chains: Pirtek, a franchised distributorship supplying replacement Pirelli hydraulic hose and fittings to customers in the Tyneside and Wearside area. 'We are geared to the construction, plant hire and demolition industries which use an extensive range of hydraulic machinery and equipment,' says Mr Maidwell. 'We are also increasingly supplying the opencast mining companies in Northumberland like Taylor Woodrow, Budge and Crouch Mining.' Other customers include local authorities, who have a range of dustcarts, grass cutters, gritting machines and even grave digging equipment which use hydraulics. The Pirtek franchise was developed in Australia, where it was discovered by Mr Forbes Petrie, a former director of Prontaprint. 'I was looking for another industry which was as behind the times as the instant printing business was a decade ago: one in which people competed on discounts rather than quality and was therefore open to a franchise operation which gave customers a better service,' he says. Pirtek concentrates on the profitable parts of the hydraulic business: supplying the hoses and fittings rather than a whole range of hydraulic products. 'It certainly isn't the most glamorous business to be in, but we are the niche specialists in what remains a pretty stable business,' says Mr Petrie. Recession has not, so far, dented the business since it was set up two years ago. 'Paradoxically, we are benefitting from the recession because we operate a small specialist supply service rather than the mass-market, commodity type of operation that most hydraulic supply companies are seeking,' says Mr Petrie. Pirtek's franchise operations depend on speed and mobility in providing a customer service: radio-linked vans with spares and engineers can replace faulty hydraulic hose quickly on site. 'We operate on the just-in-time concept,' says Mr Maidwell. 'We get there quickly and get the job done so the machinery can be back in action as fast as possible.' Mr Maidwell's distributorship cost about Pounds 160,000 to establish - including stock and three vans - of which he put up Pounds 75,000 from his own resources. 'To start with we have been making losses, as you would expect,' he says. 'But we hope to be in a break-even situation soon and into profits after that. Obviously it is very competitive in the north-east at the moment because of the recession, but I believe we have the edge with the speed and quality of our service.' Mr Petrie, who has set up nine franchised distributorships so far in the UK, recalls his reaction when first approached by Mr Maidwell: 'You can imagine my surprise when the bank manager said he wanted to come and see me. I thought he was going to moan about how our account was being run, not that he wanted to buy a franchise]'</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UN steps up aid drive in Bosnia THE United Nations yesterday launched a humanitarian offensive following the Bosnian government decision to reject aid for Sarajevo until further emergency relief reached Moslem enclaves besieged by Serb forces. UN officials blamed all three sides - Serbs, Croats and Moslems - for sabotaging the delivery of humanitarian aid, but singled out Serb leaders for blocking relief to besieged Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special envoy of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), pledged to step up pressure on the leaders of Bosnia's three ethnic groups as well as their patrons in Croatia and Serbia to ensure that aid reaches the victims of the ten-month war. 'We cannot wait for a political solution while people are dying, suffering, being expelled and subject to all kinds of violence and harassment,' he said in Belgrade, the federal capital. He vowed to push ahead with relief deliveries regardless of whether warring leaders gave their permission to pass. He said: 'We will present Serb leaders with a schedule of convoys. . . and explain the need to reach all besieged enclaves with no restrictions' at a meeting on Sunday in Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold near Sarajevo. Mr Mendiluce estimated that up to 200,000 people were trapped by the Serb stranglehold of the Moslem pockets in eastern Bosnia. 'The food situation in some of the areas is as dramatic as in Sarajevo. . . there is a complete lack of medical supplies.' He dismissed as 'cynical' the claim by Bosnian Serb leaders that they had opened a humanitarian corridor for refugees from Cerska, in the hills over the River Drina, to Tuzla, 100 miles north-east of Sarajevo. 'We see it as an ethnic cleansing corridor,' he said. 'They crossed the front line of minefields, under enemy fire without any belongings in freezing temperatures,' he said of the 6,000 refugees, many of whom arrived in Tuzla suffering frostbite, scabies, head lice and hepatitis. He said Tuzla had also threatened to join the boycott of UNHCR aid called by the Bosnian government on Thursday. The government said it would accept no more aid for Sarajevo out of solidarity for people cut off from the outside world by the Serb siege. Mr Mendiluce said relief workers faced a harrowing task delivering aid in Bosnia. 'This is a very serious humanitarian tragedy. . . We will go ahead despite the risks, the shelling, shooting and all threats we are suffering every day when just trying to feed women, children and the elderly,' he said. 'The UNHCR in its 41-year history has never been in a situation so radicalised, so polarised with such a high level of hatred and lack of humanitarian behaviour.' As Mr Mendiluce appealed to all sides to allow the humanitarian aid to reach some 3m people, clashes continued in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia. Croat and Serb forces fought artillery duels in the Dalmatian hinterland around Maslenica, which was seized in a Croat offensive last month. Fighting was also reported between Serb and Moslem fighters in northern and eastern Bosnia. Artillery barrages on Sarajevo yesterday appeared to ease after fierce fighting on Thursday. A French UN soldier died from injuries he and three compatriots suffered at the city airport, bringing the death toll to 27 UN peacekeepers in Bosnia and Croatia.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: Karadzic talks peace but killing goes on Sir, It must be the climax of western perversion that after the complete failure of our politicians to stop the killing in Bosnia that the Financial Times should give Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, a chance to publish an article (Personal View, June 9). How can one dare to give a war criminal such an opportunity, given the the reality of the past 14 months of killing, torturing, raping and ethnic cleansing, mostly by Serbs. Do you really believe this is the way to prove our democratic system? The Serbs must be laughing. A meeting in Luxembourg of foreign ministers of the EC is followed by a meeting of the Nato foreign ministers making all the well-known declarations. Meanwhile, the Serbs are closing in on Gorazde and are using captured Moslems as human shields while advancing on the town - and Mr Karadzic in his article is talking about peace. I am completely puzzled about what you intended by publishing the article. I must be very naive to have believed that the news media, and especially newspapers, should have played a more forceful role in condemning the inaction of our European politicians. The article you published is just doing the opposite. I still cannot understand how we have allowed these crimes to be committed after the atrocities of the Germans during the second world war. We witness them every night on TV and yet the world looks the other way. I am deeply disappointed that you chose to publish the article. Who other than a courageous press should point out the bigotry and hypocrisy displayed by the 'civilised' western world in the Bosnian conflict? I have just heard on the radio that Serb forces are attacking three 'safe havens' - Zepa, Gorazde and Srebrenica. And Mr Karadzic talks of peace.

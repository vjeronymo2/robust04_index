			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS SHOULD CENTER ATTENTION ON BULLPEN  </P> <P> It has come to my attention that the Dodgers have four center fielders (Gibson,  Gonzalez, Javier and Gwynn). Since Fred Claire doesn't believe in buying or  trading for quality relief pitchers, maybe some of the center fielders should  be given a chance in the bullpen.  </P> <P> BRAD STERN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

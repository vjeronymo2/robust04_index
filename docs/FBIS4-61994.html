			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Schegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi 11 May TASS--"The process of refugees' return  to Abkhazia is already on, without waiting for the results of  the work done by the Commission for Refugees and Displaced  People," head of the Abkhazian delegation Leonid Lakerbaya told  ITAR-TASS today after the commission resumed its work.  According to Lakerbaya, about 24 thousand people have returned  to the Galski District alone from areas controlled by Georgia.    Members of the commission have begun reviewing the  registration procedures of the people wishing to return to  Abkhazia. They are also discussing legal aspects of the issue.    "We demand only one thing: At the time of filling  registration papers these people must commit themselves to  respect laws of the Republic of Abkhazia and must not take up  arms against lawful authorities," Leonid Lakerbaya added.    "We know the mood of our population. We are very much  alarmed, when the talk turns to a massive inflow of refugees.  The Republic cannot accept all people at once, as houses are  destroyed, and there is a shortage of food and fuel. We are  prepared to accept refugees, but in those settlements, where  specific conditions have been created for settling them. We  will continue this work, but in stages and without unwarranted  hurry," the Abkhazian vice-premier noted.    The parties considerably differ on determining the number of  refugees who intend to return. For example, the protocol of the  expert group session on the question of registration procedures,  the number of refugees is shown to be 290 thousand. At the same  time it is assumed that 250,000 people must return to Abkhazia  from areas controlled by Georgia.    The Abkhazian side emphasises that currently there are no  more than 120,000 people in Georgia, who were forced to leave  Abkhazia, and another 65,000 in Russia. Thus, according to  Abkhazian records, the total number of refugees, who would wish  to return, does not exceed 185,000.    The commission plans to hold its next session on 30 May to  discuss the question of determining the extent of losses  suffered by refugees and forced migrants.</p>

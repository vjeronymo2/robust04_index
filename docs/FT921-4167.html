			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Holiday Inn upgrades software for reservations HOLIDAY Inn, the international hotel chain owned by Britain's Bass group, yesterday announced a Dollars 60m (Pounds 34m) upgrading of its computer reservation system. One advantage, according to Holiday Inn, of new software is its ability to factor in the desired length of stay, as well as price and room availability on a given night. The company explained yesterday that a customer who wanted a room, at a certain price, for several days would currently be turned away if it were not available on the first of those nights. The more sophisticated software, however, would check whether such a room was available for later nights, and then adjust back to offer a different room, at the given price, for the first night. Holiday Inn acknowledged that the new system might reduce average room rates, but claimed that improved occupancy levels - estimated at three percentage points - should outweigh that. It calculated lost revenues of around Dollars 125m in the US as a result of the current inability to include length-of-stay considerations. Installation of the improved hardware and software, which are financed by Holiday Inn and come at no cost to franchisees, will begin in the autumn, and should be in all properties within two and a half years.</p>

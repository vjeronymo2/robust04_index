Mock stressed this on Monday  [31 January] in talking to the newly appointed ambassador of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to Austria, Hadzo Efendic, who paid his first  visit to the foreign minister. Efendic is the first ambassador  of his country accredited to Austria.    Mock stated that there is certainly no guarantee for a  speedy  peace. However, as the development has shown, deviating from  the aforementioned principles would not bring a solution closer  in any way.</p>

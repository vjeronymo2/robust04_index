			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Fashion: A laddish hi-tech style for town and country - Nick Ashley inherited a famous fashion name. Now he has his own shop Nick Ashley, son of Laura and Bernard Ashley, tried to introduce menswear into the Ashley store chain at least twice during his 15-year reign as the company's design director. Each time, the grey suits in the boardroom stamped on the idea, perhaps rightly concluding that mixing floral frocks with men's clothing would not work. Having left the family company two years ago, 37-year-old Nick has decided to go it alone and at last has achieved his long-held dream and opened his own menswear business. One might expect the heir of industrial tycoons to have no shortage of cash to throw at a new venture. But, just as Laura and Bernard began by designing dresses on their kitchen table, Nick has had to start on a small scale. He has funded the venture himself and says that, in spite of recent reports about vast inheritances, his 'net worth is little more than what I'm standing up in', though he still owns some shares in the old family company. The shop is small and unassuming though not 'in a way that shows some trendy, Shaker influence, it looks more like a Welsh pub'. It is in an unglitzy part of town at 57 Ledbury Road, Notting Hill, west London and there have been no fancy interior designers - 'just a lick of paint, keeping it minimalist' and no marketing men designing clever logos. The carrier bags are plain brown. Nick's design philosophy is based around 'old styles for modern living'. He is specialising in practical, durable outerwear, ideal for the sporting life and wet and windy weekends in the country. However, he wants to erode the differences between town and country clothing by combining the purely functional with urban style and comfort. The resulting cocktail could be described as gamekeeper-meets-motorcycle courier or Mulberry-meets-Dr Marten Clothing. The clothing sometimes seems amateur and home-made, what the Japanese call a 'high-touch product' but Nick, whose hobby is motorcross racing when he is at his country home in Wales, is excited by this concept and believes he has discovered a niche in the market. 'I designed the collection for myself and my friends,' he says from his flat in Kensington, London, which he shares with his wife, Ari, and 2 1/2  year-old daughter, Lily. 'I want to do away with the need for separate wardrobes for town and country, one sophisticated and one frumpy.' The collection includes reefer coats, drape coats, tailored hacking jackets, cotton trousers, fleece work shirts and accessories such as shoes, boots, hats, gloves and retro-style motorcycle helmets and goggles. The predominant colours are black and navy, although traditional country greens and browns are available. Prices range from Pounds 60 for a shirt to Pounds 350 for a jacket. However, the collection's most novel feature lies in its use of fabrics. Nick has taken high-performance fabrics, such as Ventile and Polartec, used by mountain climbing clothing specialists, and applied them to everyday outerwear. By doing so, he has cut out the need for the oily, smelly weather-proofing treatments so prevalent in much huntin', shootin' 'n' fishin' clothing. In effect he has borrowed the technology of tough practical, functional clothing and smartened the designs up, giving them a fashionable, but not too fashionable, edge. 'Clothes,' says Nick, 'should not say too much about you. People who wear corduroy trousers, tweed jackets, poplin shirts and brogues are immediately pigeon-holed as public school types. My kit functions well out of doors but it does not give off any social message.' Nick studied fashion at St Martin's College of Art and Design where he was a contemporary of Rifat Ozbek. But he claims he learnt most about clothes, and tailoring in particular, while working part-time for the late Tommy Nutter, the Savile Row bespoke tailor. When he was design director at Laura Ashley he built a team of 10 designers into 60 as the company expanded into more and more areas. By the time he left, his department was responsible for 2,500 fabrics each year and the company had 450 shops around the world. However, in spite of his background in the family business, his plans for his own label are more modest. He has inherited a distrust of wholesaling clothes from his parents and he claims he will only offer consumers the range through his own shops. 'My parents wasted 20 years wholesaling through the 1950s and 1960s,' he says, quoting the much-used retail dictum: 'Sales are for vanity but profit is for sanity.' He knows his clothes will never appeal to the mass-market - laddish types rather like himself are his main target - so he has no designs on the high street. He plans ultimately to expand internationally with just one shop in each of several important cities - if London is a success he will look for a more central shop and after that will come New York, San Francisco, Paris, Milan and Tokyo. His father Bernard, who is still running Laura Ashley, is at hand to offer marketing advice. That company began life with the forgettable name of Bernard Ashley Fabrics Limited. Bernard changed to the more romantic Laura Ashley only when his wife wanted to design nighties. 'Dad refused to put his name to anything so sissy,' says Nick.

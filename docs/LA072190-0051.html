			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE MIGHT BE A COURT, BUT SOME READERS SAY SHE SHOULD NOT JUDGE  </P> <P> Speaking of cheap shots, why does Mike Downey require a full column to slam  Margaret Court's sense of values? In a society that tends to dismiss people  with strong convictions as bigoted fanatics, I find Margaret Court's comments  to be a rare expression of great courage, integrity and dignity that are the  marks of a great champion.  </P> <P> A cheap shot is when a nationally recognized sports columnist devotes an entire  column to humiliate such an expression and to air his fears that the  convictions of a past tennis champion will somehow threaten a person's right to  choose his or her lifestyle orientation.  </P> <P> DAVID SHINODA  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

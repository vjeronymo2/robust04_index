			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Advertisers oppose ITV concentration Sir, Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV (Letters, October 6), brought out some key points which undermine the lobbying by certain ITV companies to get changes in the takeover rules. He pointed out that there is now a clear majority of ITV companies rejecting ownership rule changes. What is surely equally important is that a large majority of advertisers - the companies which fund ITV - oppose changes in the ownership rules. The reason is clear: advertisers know that viewers will continue to be more loyal to ITV if they have confidence in the regional company serving them - not a large conglomerate with no real local identity. Also, advertisers do not want to see new cartels and monopolies develop within the ITV system when we have only just got rid of the old monopoly structure, which did so much harm. I hope very much that ITV will take note of the views of their customers. If there are economies to be made - and we are extremely doubtful about the imaginary Pounds 100m savings - then it is the duty of the ITV companies to remove this cost now, and invest the sums saved in programmes or in better dividends to shareholders. But these savings are probably a myth since we all know 'big is beautiful' is a doubtful argument. Let us remember, if we want to see competition and choice in ITV, as in broadcasting generally, it would be foolish to allow ITV to merge into a small number of groups, dominated by a few large ITV companies.

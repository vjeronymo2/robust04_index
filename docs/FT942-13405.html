			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Outlook for dollar remains the focus - Currency Markets The dollar will be the focus of attention this week as markets ponder the weekend G7 meeting, the release of US GDP figures, and the likely election of a new Japanese prime minister. Although G7 meetings rarely produce any comment on currencies, markets were nervous last week that rumours of concerted central bank intervention to support the dollar might presage some sort of G7 initiative. Extensive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan have kept the dollar fairly steady at Y103 to Y105 in recent weeks. Increasingly, though, the danger for the dollar is seen to lie on the downside, with many analysts predicting that it will test the Y100 level. An important factor will be the confirmation today by the Japanese parliament of Mr Tsutomu Hata as the new prime minister. Mr Hata, formerly foreign minister, said last Friday that the passage of the budget, delayed over the past month, would be a priority. He also said the trade dispute with the US should be resolved by the time of the G7 summit of industrialised nations in July. Successful resolution of these two issues should help the dollar. In the nearer term, the release on Thursday of the advance US first quarter GDP figure will be closely watched. A robust growth figure - the market is looking for about 3.5 to 3.7 per cent - will certainly hasten the prospect of a further tightening of policy by the Fed. It is doubtful, though, whether this will help the dollar. Recent dollar weakness appears to have been a function of uncertainty in US equity and bond markets. The outlook for the dollar is, therefore, likely be determined by how these markets respond to the GDP figure. Both fell after the last policy tightening. Unless the risk of a capital loss in US equity and bond markets is reduced, the dollar is likely to remain under pressure. In Europe an important event will be the release on Friday of the French unemployment figure for March. A deterioration from last month's figure of 12.2 per cent will intensify pressure for a relaxation of monetary policy. If this is resisted, the franc is likely to come under renewed pressure. In Germany the release of M3 and inflation data is expected to bolster the case for further monetary easing. Elsewhere, attention will focus on South Africa's first democratic elections. A relatively peaceful election, and an uncontested outcome, will probably result in a sharp apprecia-tion of the commercial and financial rands. Violence and dissension, however, could well have the opposite effect.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Some 54.3 percent of the  Japanese polled support Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority  government one month after its inauguration, but 37.4 percent  voiced disapproval, a KYODO NEWS SERVICE opinion poll showed  Wednesday [25 May].    Hata's cabinet, which could be toppled by an opposition  no-confidence vote at any time, came in fourth place concerning  public support for new governments since the first poll in 1974  but is still far ahead of most Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  governments in the past.    Higher support directly after assuming power had the  cabinets  of former Prime Ministers Morihiro Hosokawa with 79.0 percent,  Noboru Takeshita with 58.6 percent and Zenko Suzuki reaching  58.3 percent.    Hata's disapproval rate, though, exceeds by 5.5 percent the  worst results for the administration of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, last March.    KYODO's regular poll on political attitudes was taken in  personal interviews nationwide last Saturday and Sunday covering  3,000 men and women aged 20 or more. Respondents came to 2,055  or 68.5 percent, with 47.5 percent of them being male.    Taking a closer look, support for Hata as prime minister  appears rather shaky as more than one-third of his supporters,  33.9 percent, said they backed him "for lack of another suitable  personality."    Another 31.7 percent said, though, they trust the prime  minister.    Of Hata opponents, 27.8 percent criticized the instability  of  his minority government, and another 26 percent said the prime  minister lacks leadership qualities apparently reflecting the  widespread notion that Shinseito policy maker Ichiro Ozawa pulls  the coalition strings.    But while 16.6 percent had no confidence in Hosokawa's  economic policy in the last poll in March, only 6.0 percent  believe Hata's economic policies are no good.    Satisfaction with the economic performance of the new  cabinet  has obviously been boosted by Hata's freeze on unpopular hikes  for public service charges.    Despite Hata's experience as finance and foreign ministers,  voters' expectancies in these areas are only slightly higher  than for the Hosokawa government.    Only 8.4 percent expect Hata to carry out political reform,  down more than 10 percentage points from Hosokawa times when  crucial reform bills were under deliberation in the Diet.    As for party support, the largest opposition LDP and the  coalition defector Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ] have been able to turn around their downward trend in  public support.    The LDP rose from 25.4 percent to 29.7 percent and the SDPJ  recovered from 8.5 percent to 12.3 percent.    But while Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) made a  2.2-point gain to 14.3 percent, Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP)  has lost three in four supporters who opted for the party during  its prime last September shortly after Hosokawa's coalition  ousted the LDP after four decades in power.    The JNP now stands at 4.6 percent, down 8.6 points from the  previous KYODO poll, and seems doomed to play only a minor  government role.    Support eroded also for coalition members Komeito, backed by  the Buddhist lay organization Sokka Gakkai, and the small  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). Komeito's support declined by  1.7 points to 2.7 percent, while the DSP has lost 0.6 point to a  1.3 percent support rate.    Two newcomers founded by LDP defectors, Foreign Minister  Koji  Kakizawa's Jiyuto (Liberals) and New Party Mirai mustered 0.8  percent and 0.2 percent in support, respectively.    New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], led by former Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, which supports the Hata government  but refused to join the cabinet, slipped from 7.2 percent to 6.9  percent.    The opposition Japanese Communist Party (JCP) registered a  slight 0.1 point decline to 2 percent.    The portion of those who do not support any political party  increased from 19.4 percent to 21.5 percent.</p>

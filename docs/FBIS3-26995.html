The Chinese side will  step up "preparing its own package [ling qi lu zao 0659 6386  3619 3501], and will reorganize the three-tier councils on 1  July 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law.    After attending a New Territories Heung Yee Kuk Spring  Festival gathering yesterday, Zheng Guoxiong answered reporters'  questions, saying: The Chinese side has repeatedly stated that  on the issue of arrangements for the 1994-95 Hong Kong  elections, the Chinese side has hoped right from the very  beginning that an agreement would be reached through talks.  But, as everybody knows, the British side unilaterally  announced the end of the talks and tabled the political reform  proposals in Legco, resulting in the termination of the talks.  In this situation, whatever resolutions Legco may adopt, and in  accordance with whatever resolutions the three-tier councils are  to be established, their tenures will only continue until 30  June 1997. On 1 July 1997, the Chinese side will reorganize the  three-tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the  Basic Law. This is the Chinese side's firm position. The  Chinese side will make preparations in keeping with this plan.  He urged the people of Hong Kong to strengthen communication  and solidarity and jointly carry out this work properly.    Zheng Guoxiong reiterated: The Chinese side has consistently  taken a positive attitude toward things that have a bearing on  Hong Kong residents. Cooperation between Guangdong and Hong  Kong and between Hong Kong and Shenzhen in traffic, public  order, and antismuggling operations is there for all to see. He  said that the Chinese side adopts a positive attitude to promote  cooperation between the two sides so as to resolve livelihood  problems that have a bearing on Hong Kong residents. He urged  Hong Kong residents to rest assured that the Chinese side will  be devoted to maintaining Hong Kong's social prosperity and  stability.    Asked about the financial arrangements for the new airport,  Zheng Guoxiong said that the Chinese side is currently studying  the fourth new airport financial proposals put forward by the  British side. He held that the fact that Guo Fengmin, chief  representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, recently  proposed first holding a meeting of the expert group of the  Airport Committee is a responsible attitude and a pragmatic  practice. He said that if the two sides hold Airport Committee  meetings on the basis of the expert group's studies, they are  heading forward in the direction of resolving problems.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Trial-weary City says world has changed THE OUTCOME of the Blue Arrow trial was greeted with surprise yesterday in the world of corporate finance, four of whose former City of London stars were convicted for their role in disguising the failure of the employment agency's 1987 rights issue. Institutional investors, meanwhile, confessed to a kind of 'litigation fatigue', noting that the Blue Arrow rights issue occurred more than four years ago and the events leading to the Guinness trial which collapsed on Tuesday happened in 1986. The chief executive of one leading securities house, who would not be named, said: 'I was rather surprised: I thought they were going to get off.' The head of corporate finance at another added: 'The judge's summing up made it look as though it was going to go the other way.' But investors generally cheered the efforts at prosecution, saying the mere fact charges had been brought had changed City practices forever. 'The trials have sent a warning to those who were tempted to sail close to the wind,' said Mr Charles Nunnelly, deputy chairman of Robert Fleming Asset Management and chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association. Indeed, investors say the world has changed since the events of the Blue Arrow rights issue, where the brokers attempted to hide a large unsold block of shares. 'In placings, acquisitions and takeovers, one can ask the right questions and expect honest answers,' said one institutional fund manager. 'The mere possibility of prosecution should act as a deterrent, even if they are not found guilty.' Another corporate finance chief said: 'If a deal goes wrong in that way, it's much more significant for you even than what happens to the individuals concerned. There is a great deal of disenchantment with the legal process which has led to this. The most effective sanction of all is commercial failure, rather than this attenuated and unsatisfactory legal process.' Mr Nunnelly said: 'These trials have been badly mishandled. The fact that it's taken so many years for these cases to come to trial is absolutely unacceptable.' He joined those urging City fraud cases to be heard by a judge and two professionals, saying they bore little resemblance to common criminal cases. Mr Gareth Williams, QC, chairman of the Bar Council, called for urgent reform. 'It is intolerable that these fraud trials last for such a long time, thereby not only using up a great deal of public money but also placing an intolerable burden on all those involved, particularly the jurors. The jury is, and must remain, the cornerstone of our legal system, but a better system, which retained jurors, must be found.'</p>

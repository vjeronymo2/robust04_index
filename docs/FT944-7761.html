			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher chairman receives Pounds 514,000 Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, was paid a total of Pounds 514,000 in the year to August 31 - a rise of 44 per cent. The Pounds 156,000 increase, revealed yesterday in the company's annual report and accounts, has angered some fund managers. One described the rise as 'totally inappropriate considering the size and state of the company'. Albert Fisher's share price has underperformed the FT All-Share Index by 30 per cent since the beginning of this year, and the company is currently capitalised at approximately Pounds 300m. Pre-tax profits for the year to August 31 were Pounds 34.8m compared with Pounds 26.9m. The increase in Mr Walls' total emoluments was due to the payment of a Pounds 48,000 bonus and a Pounds 150,000 pension contribution. The amount he received as 'salary, fees and other benefits' actually fell by 12 per cent from Pounds 358,000 to Pounds 316,000. The report states that Mr Walls' bonus was 'based on the achievement of stated personal objectives'.</p>

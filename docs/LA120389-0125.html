			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OF 24 DRUG DEFENDANTS PUTS COURTROOM SECURITY ON THE DOCKET  </P> <P> One of the most exceptional criminal trials in American history is unfolding in  a tense, crowded courtroom here in western Louisiana.  </P> <P> This is a trial where most of the defendants wear shackles, where the judge  often wears earphones and where the jury spends part of each day listening to  piano selections by Chopin.  </P> <P> On trial are 24 men, many considered so dangerous that they are chained to  their chairs. They are charged with taking part in an extensive international  conspiracy to smuggle 1.5 million pounds of marijuana into the United States  from Colombia.  </P> <P> Mark Neuberger, court security inspector for the U.S. Marshal's Service in the  5th Circuit, said drug smugglers are a new breed of criminal in America. They  pose an unusual threat to the U.S. court system.  </P> <P> "They are worse than the organized-crime threat," Neuberger said.  </P> <P> "Narcotics criminals have less regard for the judicial system. And they are  more inclined to disrupt the judicial process," he said.  </P> <P> The moment one enters the federal courthouse in downtown Lafayette, it is  apparent that this is no ordinary criminal trial.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies guard the outside of the building.  </P> <P> Every visitor must pass through a metal detector sensitive enough to spot  something as small as a penny.  </P> <P> "We're being extra careful," explains a guard as a visitor empties his pockets.  </P> <P> Inside, armed marshals patrol the hallways and screen everyone who enters the  courtroom.  </P> <P> The entire right side of the courtroom, including the spectator area, is filled  with defendants and their defense attorneys.  </P> <P> To accommodate the large number of defendants, federal officials installed a  tiered platform at the rear of the courtroom to hold additional desks and  chairs.  </P> <P> The case has strained the resources -- and the resourcefulness -- of court  officials.  </P> <P> For example, court officials needed to find a way for the judge, prosecutors  and defense attorneys to confer privately when there is a disagreement over  procedures.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, they would simply gather around the judge's bench and speak quietly  among themselves. But that is not possible here because of the large number of  participants.  </P> <P> The solution: headsets and microphones for the judge and the attorneys. When a  dispute breaks out between lawyers, the judge orders: "Let's go to headsets."  </P> <P> Judge and attorneys then whisper into small microphones. To make sure that the  jury cannot overhear the consultations, jurors listen to music over their own  specially installed headsets.  </P> <P> For added security, a cassette recording of "Chopin's Favorites" blares over  two loudspeakers.  </P> <P> The trial, which began late in October, could last for six months or more.  </P> <P> Even then the case won't end, for officials have also charged some 20 others  who still await their day in court. Altogether, 170 people are listed on the  grand jury indictment; but nearly half that number are unknown -- listed only  as John Doe. Some of the John Does reside in Jamaica, Colombia, and the Cayman  Islands, and have not been found. Of the 90 persons who were apprehended, more  than half pleaded guilty.  </P> <P> Officials say that as the drug war heats up, and drugs continue crossing the  nation's borders, trials like this will become more common. Drug smuggling  often involves dozens, or even hundreds, of conspirators.  </P> <P> The criminal case here is the largest in Louisiana history, and one of the  largest in the nation's history. It follows on the heels of a similar federal  drug case in Nevada, which also involved multiple defendants.  </P> <P> These trials challenge the ability of the 2,000-member U.S. Marshal's Service  to provide security. The marshals are responsible for protecting federal  judges, court officials, witnesses and jurors at 520 locations in the United  States.  </P> <P> Here in the Lafayette district security usually is in the hands of the five-man  marshal's office. But this trial forced the marshals to call for help from as  far away as Chicago, Milwaukee and Washington State.  </P> <P> Marshals took no chances here.  </P> <P> They rated this a "maximum level 4" trial, requiring the tightest possible  security. Preparing the courtroom and courthouse for the trial required  $100,000 in alterations, including:  </P> <P> * A 9-foot chain-link fence. The fence was topped with barbed wire and was  erected to protect the automobiles of court employees.  </P> <P> * New locks. All locks in the courthouse were changed.  </P> <P> * Exterior alterations. Modifications now make the walls of the courthouse more  difficult to climb.  </P> <P> * Video cameras. More monitors were installed outside the courthouse, and a  remote camera was put in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Neuberger said these precautions are essential because "narcotics gangs  increase the risk for all parts of the judiciary."  </P> <P> "In the last five years, the criminal element has changed drastically," he  explains. Drug criminals also "have the resources to effect escape and assault.  So these individuals are a more serious risk than others we have seen."  </P> <P> The marshal's service backs up those claims about drug gangsters with facts and  figures.  </P> <P> The number of threats to members of the judiciary has increased more than 100%  -- from 152 five years ago to 331 in the latest fiscal year that ended Sept.  30, the marshals report.  </P> <P> These threats require that juries be sequestered more frequently and that  security be heightened for judicial personnel and buildings.  </P> <P> Marshal's service records show that by far the largest number of threats came  from drug criminals.  </P> <P> In the last year, for example, there were only 19 threats against the judiciary  made by members of organized crime. But drug cartels made 143 threats.  </P> <P> The increased danger is costly to taxpayers. Earlier this year, the trial of a  violent drug gang known as "The Company" in Reno, Nev., cost the government  more than $1.1 million just for added security measures. And the price of the  Louisiana trial could be even higher.  </P></p>

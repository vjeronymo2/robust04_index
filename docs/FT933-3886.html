			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Global warrant for ex-BCI chief MILAN magistrates have issued an international arrest warrant on a charge of alleged corruption for Mr Enrico Braggiotti, former chief executive of Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the leading state-controlled bank, writes Robert Graham. Mr Braggiotti is the second senior banker to be caught up in investigations into bribery and corruption surrounding the 'Enimont affair'. This involved the 1990 sale at an inflated price of the Ferruzzi group's 40 per cent stake in Enimont, a chemicals venture with Eni, the state oil concern. A local arrest warrant was issued for Mr Braggiotti on September 3, but this only came to light yesterday when the banker was formerly declared a fugitive from justice. Mr Braggiotti, also a former board member of Mediobanca, is currently chairman of Compagnie Monegasque de Banque. According to leaks from Milan magistrates, Mr Braggiotti is wanted in connection with a pay-off worth up to L5bn (Pounds 2m) made on the orders of the late Mr Raul Gardini, then chief executive of Ferruzzi-Montedison, to Mr Vincenzo Palladino, former deputy chairman of BCI. Mr Palladino was last week released from jail after being arrested on July 29 on allegations that he pocketed the money from Montedison while he was a court-appointed custodian of Enimont shares in November 1990. This was the moment when a deal was being worked out between Mr Gardini and Eni for Ferruzzi-Montedison's stake that subsequently led to political pay-offs totalling L150bn. Mr Braggiotti is alleged to have helped smooth Mr Palladino's relations with Mr Gardini and then aided the former in receiving up to L2bn from Montedison by putting him in touch with a Panamanian company that accepted a false billing. It was also announced yesterday that Mr Diego Curto, the deputy head of the Milan courts jailed last Friday on charges of accepting L320m for his part in the Enimont affair, had been stripped of his pay and suspended from all judicial functions. Mr Curto was the judge responsible for ordering a freeze on Enimont shares in November 1990 and placing them in the hands of Mr Palladino.</p>

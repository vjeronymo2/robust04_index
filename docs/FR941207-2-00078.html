The Applicant was organized as a corporation under Maryland law on June 3, 1970, and dissolved as such on April 7, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On February 26, 1971, Applicant filed a registration statement under Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act and, on February 26, 1971, registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified investment management company. Also on February 26, 1971, Applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, registering 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $10,00 par value. This registration statement was declared effective on September 14, 1971 as of June 19, 1971. The initial public offering commenced September 14, 1971.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On May 20, 1992, Applicant's Board of Directors unanimously approved the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation (``Plan'') and recommended it for shareholder approval. On September 21, 1992, at a Special Meeting of Shareholders, 546,533.8323 shares out of the 690,437.4839 shares outstanding on the record date of August 4, 1992 (constituting more than the two-thirds of the shares outstanding that was required under Maryland law to approve the Plan), voted in favor of the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. As of October 22, 1992, Applicant had one class of Common Stock outstanding, constituting 3,916,201.91 outstanding shares. The aggregate net asset value and net asset value per share were $49,323,348.86 and $12.5949, respectively. Applicant's only security holders were Phoenix Home Life Mutual insurance Company's (``Phoenix-Home Life'') Separate Account B, Separate Account C, and Separate Account D (collectively, ``Separate Accounts'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On October 21, 1992, the Commission issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief from Section 17(a) and permitting the transfer of Applicant's assets to The Phoenix Edge Series Fund Growth Series, a Massachusetts business trust organized on February 18, 1986 (``Growth Series'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On October 26, 1992, under the terms of the Plan, Applicant transferred its assets on the Growth Series. Under the Plan, Applicant's security holders, the Separate Accounts, become Growth Series security holders. In consideration for the transfer, the Growth Series assumed all of applicant's obligations and liabilities to the extent they existed on or after the effective date of the reorganization and delivered to Applicant full and fractional shares of the Growth Series, par value $1.00 per share, equal to that number of Growth Series share determined by multiplying the outstanding number of Applicant's shares by the exchange ratio. The exchange ration was the number determined by dividing the net asset value per share of Applicant's shares by the net asset value per share of the Growth Series shares, such values determined as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on October 22, 1992 (the last business day preceding the reorganization). Applicant distributed such Grow Series shares pro rata to its security holders and simultaneously Applicant's shares held by its security holders were cancelled. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the transfer of assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicant has retained no assets after October 26, 1992, and has no security holders. Applicant does not have any debts or other liabilities which remain outstanding.

Phoenix-Home Life, the parent company to the Adviser, paid all of the direct and indirect expenses of the reorganization, including any brokerage fees relating to transactions resulting from the reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Other than as described above, during the past 18 months, Applicant has not, for any reason, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of the Applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicant has made all filings under the 1940 Act, including Form N&hyph;SAR filings, for each period for which such filings were required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

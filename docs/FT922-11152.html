			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Far Right Edges Towards Negotiations SOUTH AFRICA'S ultra-right Conservative party has taken a step towards negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution following its decisive defeat last month in the all-white referendum on political reform, Patti Waldmeir writes from Johannesburg. However, the party yesterday expelled its most enthusiastic supporter of negotiations, Mr Koos van der Merwe, a maverick MP who has argued for immediate participation in constitutional negotiations. The move illustrates the realignment in white politics since the referendum, in which the ruling National party gained an overwhelming mandate to abolish apartheid. With the first ever multi-racial elections expected to take place by early next year, white politicians are jockeying for position. Last week five white members of the liberal Democratic party joined the African National Congress, while the Conservative party has so far expelled two moderate MPs. At a caucus meeting at the weekend, the Conservative party decided to enter talks with the National party on setting up a white state, or volksstaat. This would be the first step to entering negotiations in the multi-party Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). It is understood that the pro-negotiation faction within the Conservative party has gained the advantage over hardliners, who refuse to negotiate about anything other than white self-determination. The party said Mr van der Merwe, who has long favoured negotiations, was expelled for repeatedly breaching party discipline. During the referendum campaign, he advocated policies in sharp contrast to the official CP platform. Several CP members of parliament are believed to support Mr van der Merwe's position, but it is not clear whether they will now join him to form a right-wing party which would eschew the more radical CP policies.</p>

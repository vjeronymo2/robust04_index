			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Herbert Kremp editorial: "Minor Power"] </F>   [Text] The following was more obvious in the Anglo-Saxon  and the French world than in the German one, which is quite  naive regarding power-political considerations: As a result of  the Balkans conflict, not only Russia but the old policy of  balance has returned to world diplomacy.    The United States, Russia, and France are drafting the big  moves of conflict settlement without Germany, and they are  gaining influence and securing their positions for the future.  The election campaign in Germany and its uncertain outcome  contribute to that. If a changeover of power should take place  in October, two possible developments are likely: A growing  unworldly introversion of German policies and a strong French  leadership in the mediating diplomacy between the European Union  and the Atlantic Alliance.    In the runup to the NATO ultimatum, a remarkable  rapprochement between the United States and France took place.  Relations between the two countries seemed to have reached a  critical stage weeks ago that lasted until after the NATO summit  in January. When the ultimatum expired, Russian diplomacy  succeeded in claiming the change in Sarajevo as its achievement.  It was possible for the withdrawing Serbs to pretend that they  were following Moscow's advice and not giving in to NATO  pressure. Politically, the situation of the Serbs has improved  at the expense of the Bosnians and the Croats. Nobody will  question their territorial conquests. Paris, London, Moscow, and  finally also Washington are seeking a solution on the basis of  the current military status.    In fact, it will take a great deal of time to achieve that  but the Slovenes and the Croatians already know at this point  that their hopes for further support from Germany -- beyond  efforts to ensure their recognition -- will not be fulfilled.  The truth is that the power at the center has been pushed to  the margin.</p>

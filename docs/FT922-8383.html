			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Few clues to a Royal whodunnit WHODUNNIT? Was it Sir Robert Fellowes, HM's Old Etonian private secretary, wielding a quill pen in his book-lined office overlooking Buckingham Palace's garden? Or was it some ambitious young Scottish speechwriter in Mr Douglas Hurd's office, distractedly dreaming of an exotic posting? The great royal storm in a porcelain teacup has all the Edwardian flavour of a game of Cluedo. But hopes of a republican plot to undo the monarch's political neutrality were quickly dashed. As the buck of responsibility about the early briefing on the Queen's speech to the European Parliament was passed around the high offices of government, it became obvious that blunder, not malice, lay behind the row. As early as Monday night, Buckingham Palace was saying that the offending language - most crucially words suggesting that the different parliamentary traditions of the EC states were insignificant - was Whitehall's work. The prime minister's office first said that the speech was all the Palace's doing, guided by the Foreign Office and shown to Downing Street as a mere courtesy. But it changed its tune yesterday morning. It conceded that briefing papers misrepresented the sentiments the speech would express. In short, it was the Foreign Office poorly reporting its own text. After all, Downing Street said, when the speech was delivered, from the original text, it was differences in the 'style' of national parliaments that were deemed insignificant, not their traditions or practices. In 30 years' time, when the Cabinet papers are finally published, one can be sure that it will be some redfaced ambassador who will choke with indignation on his whisky and soda when he reads the authorised version.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CULTURE DOWN ON THE FARM? YEP, YOUTH FESTIVAL AT KNOTT'S  </P> <P> Yes, that was Snoopy standing next to the piano, but it wasn't Peanuts Gang  prodigy Schroeder at the keys, just Michael Fennelly, a talented San Clemente  High School senior who will be performing April 29 at Orange County's first  Children's Cultural Festival.  </P> <P> Fennelly and violinist Sachiko Tanaka, a Mission Viejo High School sophomore,  were on hand at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park earlier this week for the  announcement of the festival schedule.  </P> <P> The daylong event at Knott's will benefit the Orange County Philharmonic  Society, South Coast Repertory Theatre and the Children's Museum at La Habra.  </P> <P> Most of the series of events feature young performers such as Fennelly and  Tanaka, who gave the representatives of various arts organizations at the  luncheon a sample of their work, courtesy of the Philharmonic Society.  </P> <P> After posing with Snoopy, Knott's mascot, Tanaka and Fennelly played three  brief selections.  </P> <P> They included Dvorak's familiar "Humoresque," a piece frequently used as  background music in cartoons -- usually played just before an unsuspecting  character is clobbered by a large piece of furniture.  </P> <P> In addition to the young classical musicians, festival visitors will be able to  sample everything from Chinese dancers and Japanese drummers to Broadway show  tunes, a Dixieland band and Appalachian Mountains clog dancing.  </P> <P> Other cultural events scattered through the park will include marionettes, a  mime, a storyteller and an original musical play called "When I Grow Up," about  the choices and pressures that children face.  </P> <P> Also available will be a Nature Walk Exhibit from the children's museum,  featuring real stuffed North American animals, and an art workshop.  </P> <P> Discount tickets, priced at $13.95 for adults and $11.95 for children 3 to 11,  entitle visitors to Knott's other attractions.  </P> <P> The tickets may be purchased from the three arts organizations or at the park  April 29 for those who ask for the special order forms.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 642-8232.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov and Besik Urigashvili: "Russia </F> and Georgia Agree on Military Cooperation"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- The main event of Boris Yeltsin's visit  to Georgia is the signing of a treaty of friendship,  good-neighborliness, and cooperation, and also a number of  documents on economic ties.    Most interesting of all are the military aspects of the  treaty, which state that the two sides commit themselves to  taking measures designed to guarantee each other's security and  defense organizational development. The treaty also envisages  joint protection of Georgia's foreign borders, which are also  the borders of the CIS. The result of the preliminary  consultations between Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and  Shevardnadze was an agreement on establishing three Russian  military bases on Georgian territory. The number of troops at  these bases will not exceed 20,000 men. Nothing has yet been  announced about the purpose or size of the bases or the terms of  the lease, but at this preliminary stage, the members of the  Russian delegation indicated, we are talking about Air Force and  Naval bases. The Russian troops stationed in Georgia will  occupy their former positions and guard railroad lines.    Russia will provide Georgia with assistance in setting up a  national army and equip it with weapons, hardware, and  technology without the right to transfer these products to other  countries. It is generally supposed that this point of the  treaty will displease both Abkhazia and a number of North  Caucasian peoples who are supporting the Abkhazian separatists.  This military "tethering" of Georgia to Russia, the opposition  believes, will increase Shevardnadze's dependence on Moscow's  policy even more.    The majority faction in the State Duma has expressed its own  position on this issue by noting the obviously anti-Abkhazian  bent of the military cooperation. There can be no doubt that  the treaty will run into difficulty at the ratification stage in  the parliaments of both countries. However, Boris Yeltsin  intends to resolutely follow up the promises he has made and he  stressed that the present treaty is in no sense a military pact  against anyone.    Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze also discussed the  prospects for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. They  expressed restrained approval of the UN Security Council's plans  to increase the number of international observers in Abkhazia to  88, but they did not hide their disappointment that the UN is  delaying its decision to send "blue helmets" to the conflict  zone.    In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Georgian Foreign Minister A.  Chikvaidze noted that the situation is deadlocked. The United  Nations does not want to give its mandate to the Russian Army  until it can see real progress on the political settlement  front. But the settlement process has now come up against the  problem of refugees who are afraid to return to their homes  unless peacekeeping forces appear on the banks of the Inguri.    In September last year Pavel Grachev proposed to Eduard  Shevardnadze that Russian troops should be sent to Abkhazia, but  the Georgian president declined this proposal. Tbilisi now  recognizes that this was the wrong course of action.    In Tbilisi, despite the security measures taken in  connection  with Yeltsin's visit, terrorist acts are still taking place.  The night before the arrival of the Russian president, Colonel  Nikolay Kekelidze, an aide to one of Georgia's deputy defense  ministers, was blown up after stepping on a mine in the porch of  his home.</p>

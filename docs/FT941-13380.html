			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Common salary bargains sought The Local Government Management Board, the employers' body, has drawn up an industrial relations strategy seeking single-table bargaining and a common pay-review date for all sectors of employment. Mr Charles Nolda, the board's head of negotiations, said it aimed to have a system in place by April 1996. One of the main difficulties is agreeing a pay-review date. White-collar staff settle in July and manual workers in September. The board wants a unified date of April 1, with negotiations completed earlier to allow authorities to build their results into budgets. The strategy - likely to involve more than 1.5m employees - has been developed in response to government pressure on local authorities to move away from a nationally negotiated framework. The board wants to preserve a national framework around common core conditions, including a single pay spine. One proposal is to divide the national agreement into two parts, imposing core conditions universally but allowing others to be modified at local level. Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said yesterday it was time to abolish the 'officers and men' mentality that permeated its national agreements. He added the association remained committed to national collective bargaining.</p>

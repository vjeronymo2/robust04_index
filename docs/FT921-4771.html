			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses extend losses on economic slowdown fears BOURSES mostly extended Thursday's declines yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff, as worries about interest rates on the Continent were joined by concerns about European economic growth rates. Some analysts took yesterday's drop in Germany as a correction. But Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, said that Europe did have to consider the continuing slowdown in the German economy and the effect on its neighbours. 'Our figure for west German growth this year is only 0.75 per cent, and that requires a brisk upturn in the second half,' he said. FRANKFURT fell by more than 1 per cent, the DAX index closing 18.85 lower on the day and little changed on the week at 1,745.95. This followed a midsession decline of 2.63 to 711.73 in the FAZ, up 0.3 per cent on the week. Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, MM Warburg in Hamburg and James Capel in London saw this as part of a brief correction before the DAX tested the 1,800 level. But Mr Bell's Frankfurt colleague, Mr Jurgen Rothig, saw the market going down in the near-term. Interest rates were going to stay at record high levels for the foreseeable future and company earnings were poor, he said. February inflation data yesterday from two key states, showing month-on-month rises of 0.6 and 0.7 percentage points, were another bad sign. German shares are on a 1992 p/e of some 16 against 13 per cent for Europe as a whole, according to BZW, not outlandish given the strong D-Mark and heavy provisioning habits which keep earnings per share artificially low. Volume fell from DM7.9bn to DM5.6bn yesterday as the Bundesbank's average bond yield rose 3 basis points to 8.08 per cent. Yesterday's falls were led by blue chips, Allianz dropping DM33 at DM2,425, Deutsche Bank DM9.50 at DM727 and Daimler DM9 at DM765. PARIS suffered from a bout of nerves after Wall Street's overnight fall. Good US job data in the afternoon failed to lift spirits. The CAC-40 index fell 6.13 to 1,966.91, down 0.8 per cent on the week. Absenteeism linked to school holidays kept turnover at FFr2bn. Elf fell for the third day in a row following the government's sale of a 2.3 per cent stake next week. Dealers expect the new stock to be priced at FFr360 per share. The stock fell FFr4.90 to FFr365.10. Alcatel was the most active stock, losing FFr3 to FFr614 on profit-taking after its gains earlier in the week. Euro Disney was also active, picking up FFr1.2 to FFr160. Havas fell FFr5.90 to FFr495.10 on domestic selling while Air Liquide, popular some weeks ago, added FFr11 to FFr760. ZURICH fell on profit-taking ahead of the weekend. Further worries about high Swiss interest rates hit banks and dragged the rest of the market lower. The all-share SPI index fell 10.2 to 1,136.7, down 1.1 per cent on the week. Bearers in CS Holding led the active list and fell SFr40 to SFr1,990 in spite of a 57 per cent jump in profits at Credit Suisse, its main subsidiary. Alusuisse bearers fell SFr21 to SFr877 after Russia cut aluminium export tariffs for the fourth time this year. Earlier this week Alusuisse attributed part of a 62 per cent 1991 profit slump to cheap aluminium exports from the Soviet Union. MILAN, predictably, fell yet again as parliament's failure on Thursday to pass a modified car insurance reform weighed heavily on insurance stocks. The Comit index fell 5.57 to 514.87, down 3.9 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than Thursday's L89.5bn. In the insurance sector, Fondiaria fell L735 to L34,000 while Generali closed L580 down at L29,900, reaching L29,700 in the after market. Among banks, Banco di Roma and Banco di Santo Spirito showed a small recovery after recent losses linked to their share-exchange plans. AMSTERDAM closed mixed in moderate volume, with trading concentrated in Heineken and Philips. The CBS Tendency index closed at 128.0, down 0.1 on the day but up 1.1 per cent on the week. Heineken closed Fl 10.40 up at Fl 177.00, just below an all-time high of Fl 177.50 hit earlier in the day, following news this week of a 12 per cent rise in 1991 net profit and a bonus share dividend. Its smaller rival, Grolsch, gained Fl 4 at Fl 196. Philips closed 80 cents lower at Fl 187.20 on news that it was involved in a refinancing package for its loss-making video subsidiary, Super Club. After the close, Philips said that it was issuing new shares to finance a buy-out of Super Club minority investors. STOCKHOLM overcame an uncertain start and advanced in heavy trading. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 2.6 to 983.2, up 4.6 per cent on the week. Turnover eased, but was still heavy at SKr533m after SKr554m. BRUSSELS closed lower in slow trading ahead of the end of the forward market account on Monday. The Bel-20 index closed down 7.55 at 1,215.02, up 0.4 per cent on the week, in low turnover of BFr530m after BFr982m. A big agency cross in Petrofina showed up on London's Seaq trading system; a block of 260,000 shares changed hands in London, worth Pounds 47.5m and equivalent to 1 per cent of Petrofina's share capital. Smith New Court was said to have executed the trade. The stock eased BFr75 to BFr10,750. COPENHAGEN saw DDL, the part-owner of Scandinavian Airlines System, put on DKr400 to DKr2,860 following SAS's announcement on Thursday that it hopes to sell its 40 per cent share in the Inter-Continental hotel chain, writes Hilary Barnes. The CSE index put on 0.62 to 344.01. ISTANBUL fell slightly after a quiet session. The 75-share index closed at 3,620.77, down 6.29 on the day and down 1.2 per cent on the week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                 FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 6  --------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm    close 1165.29  1166.04  1164.83  1163.66  1162.59  1162.61 1163.27 1162.10  --------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1166.54    Day's Low  1161.59  --------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 5     Mar 4    Mar 3     Mar 2     Feb 28 1169.56   1176.33  1176.44   1169.17   1169.95  --------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

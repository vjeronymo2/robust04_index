			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe up to Pounds 27m after currency gains BOWTHORPE, the UK-based international electronic and electrical components group, brushed aside difficult first- half trading conditions to post a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and raise the interim dividend. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 22.42m to Pounds 26.99m in the six months to June 30 on turnover which grew by 30 per cent to Pounds 163.6m (Pounds 125.6m) including Pounds 891,000 from acquisitions. Earnings per share increased by 15 per cent to 9.05p (7.88p) and the group is to pay an interim dividend of 1.88p (1.79p). The shares gained 4p to close at 360p yesterday. Currency movements added Pounds 16.4m to turnover in the first-half and Pounds 3.1m to pre-tax profits. A further, smaller currency gain is expected during the current half. Mr John Westhead, chief executive, commenting on the results said, 'we are pleased to have produced a useful improvement in performance in what has been a difficult operating environment. 'For 1993 as a whole, we expect to report further modest organic growth. In the US demand shows steady growth, but Germany continues in recession. In the UK the recovery is patchy but continuing.' Group operating profits rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 21.9m), while net interest payments totalled Pounds 594,000 (Pounds 548,000 receipts). UK operating profits increased to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 4.8m) reflecting the acquisitions made in 1992 and a small degree of improvement in general economic conditions. UK operations contributed 25 (22) per cent of group profits while sales increased by 37 per cent to Pounds 50.7m. In the US, generally improving demand, together with improved efficiency and market penetration produced higher operating profits of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 6.3m) on sales which grew by 45 per cent to Pounds 51.6m. However operating profits from Bowthorpe's Continental European operations - mainly in Germany - slipped by 3 per cent to Pounds 8.8m, with gains on currency offset by the effects of the recession. Despite acquisitions which totalled Pounds 4.8m and Pounds 10.5m of capital expenditure during the first half, the group generated Pounds 7.5m (7.4m) in net cash. Net borrowings totalled Pounds 16m at the end of June, down from Pounds 17.2m at the end of December, giving gearing of 14 per cent. COMMENT Bowthorpe continues to outperform expectations with profit gains in the US and UK more than offsetting the downturn in Continental Europe. Sales and operating profits from electronics now represent about two-thirds of the total with electrical products holding the balance - a reversal of the postion three years ago. Meanwhile Bowthorpe's highly selective acquisition strategy will continue. Full year pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 50m producing earnings of 17.1p and a lofty but deserved prospective p/e of 21.</p>

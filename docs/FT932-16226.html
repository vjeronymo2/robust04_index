			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Hopes rise for lower EC air fares THE European air fares spat of the last few weeks is a rare sign that competition and recession may be able to cut costs in Europe's notoriously expensive airline network. The first shots in the battle were fired in February by UK carrier British Midland. It introduced a cut-price three-day return fare to its 12 international destinations. Many of its competitors, such as KLM and Air France, cut their own fares to match during March. This week, British Airways turned a small scale price tussle into something larger by cutting fares on seven routes between four UK cities and the rest of Europe. A business class return fare between London and Paris, for example, costs Pounds 240, compared with Pounds 318 a few weeks ago. The fares war is unusual in two respects. First it is on short-haul routes. Outside the US, short-haul has been a heavily regulated market and in Europe has traditionally accommodated just two carriers on each route, one from each of the countries. Competition is limited and passengers almost always find both carriers charging the same high price. Limited deregulation in Europe has now increased competition, and the price cuts are almost all on routes on which British Midland competes with larger carriers. BA's lowest business class return fare to Paris is now Pounds 240, but that to Frankfurt, slightly further but with less competition, is Pounds 330. British Midland's presence is not enough to explain all the differences. French and German business executives buying a return business class ticket to London in their home countries rather than the UK pay FFr2,780 (Pounds 339) and DM1,128 (Pounds 465) respectively. Perhaps more curious is the phenomenon of a fares war in business class. Traditionally, airlines have regarded business class tickets as not price sensitive. Business class passengers got a flexible ticket - if they missed a plane, they could catch the next one - as well as faster check-in and higher baggage allowances. But business class bookings have sagged in the recession. The latest figures from the 23 member Association of European Airlines indicate that business class bookings have fallen below one third of the total for the first time since the organisation began collating records in the mid-1980s. The trend has been downwards since 1989, when 38 per cent of tickets were sold at full price.</p>

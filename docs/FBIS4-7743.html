			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Felix: "Not Selling Like Hot Cakes"] </F>   [Text] It is virtually impossible to rate the performance  of the State Property Agency [AVU] to date because--in the  absence of a real market--the value of the firms it privatizes  can only be estimated. Our tabulation examines the present  situation in the individual industries within the food industry  group and establishes what has been privatized to date and what  has yet to be privatized.    The AVU regards the food industry group as one of the  success  stories of privatization. Most of the group's 162 state or  municipal enterprises have been transformed into corporations.  Only 56 of them were sold by the end of 1993, but they accounted  for 46 percent of the 162 firms' combined registered capital. It  is practically impossible to judge whether the experts of the  AVU handled a specific sale well or badly. After all, there is  no basis of comparison: A developed market that could determine  the real value of a firm is lacking. Thus the AVU is able to go  about its business practically without any risk, and only rarely  is it forced to admit that it goofed.    According to the data provided by the AVU, the net worth of  the food industry corporations can be estimated at 157 billion  forints. Of this amount, 72.2 billion forints worth of assets  were sold by the end of 1993. Except in a few insignificant  minor cases, there has been no suspicion of any corruption. This  is the more commendable because AVU employees are exposed to  exceptional temptation: Each chief counselor-deputy director  prepares the privatization of assets worth billions.    Several basic principles for privatization within the food  industry group had been laid down as guidelines back in 1991,  but the indications are that the AVU is not paying much  attention to them. Basically the decisive factor is money,  although officials at the AVU are able to cite numerous examples  of rejecting the highest bid. Some experts are of the opinion  that, in most cases when it was truly "interested," foreign  capital managed in the end to get what it wanted.    It may be said to be a general practice at the AVU to offer  25 percent of the equity, plus one vote, to a specifically  targeted large-scale agricultural producer, when a large firm is  being privatized. But experience indicates that raw material  producers are not really interested in acquiring such a small  stake. Others are of the opinion that it would hardly be  possible to devise something better than the AVU's extremely  pragmatic approach. Admittedly, it does seem expedient in  principle to give control of individual food-processing firms to  groups of domestic capitalists who would be able to gain  significant markets for both the underlying agricultural  activity and trade. However, the managements of the  undercapitalized and debt-ridden agricultural cooperatives and  food industry firms respectively would be ill-suited for this  role. Most agricultural cooperatives are glad merely to be able  to survive; in the extremely unlikely case of being given a food  industry firm free of charge, they would have no opportunity  (money) to finance the firm's production.    In these circumstances it is no wonder that--instead of  complying with the laid-down principles--the AVU is selling  everything for which effective demand exists. Understandably,  foreign capital is seeking primarily safe businesses in the  apparently risky Hungarian market. Thus foreign capital's  attention has focused mainly on the tobacco and distilling  industries, whose products are taxed; on the sugar industry,  which consists of a few players and produces a foodstuff of  strategic economic importance; and on the vegetable-oil  industry, primarily because earlier only one firm had been  established in Hungary for the processing of oil seeds, and it  enjoys an absolute monopoly to this day. For instance, five  international corporations--Philip Morris, Austria Tabakwerke,  RJR Nabisco, BAT [British-American Tobacco] and Reemstra--now  own the four tobacco factories in Hungary. The better-known  distillery firms also have attracted foreign capital. (It will  suffice to mention Peter Zwack's purchases.)    The immensely keen Western interest in sugar factories is  more difficult to explain. Indirectly, three large concerns  share most of the market in the sugar industry: Sud  Zucker-Agrana (21 percent); Tate Lyle-Amylum (18 percent); and  Eridania Beghin Say (34 percent). First Hungarian Sugarmaking  and Trading Consortium comprises 60 growers and holds the  majority interest in five sugar factories, which enables it to  claim 27-percent share of the market. Some people are assuming  that this unexpected "craving for sugar" was triggered by alarm  among the world sugar industry's multinationals over the  Austrian Agrana's sudden appearance in Hungary, causing them to  acquire small or substantial stakes in Hungarian corporations,  merely to establish their presence in East Europe. The  Hungarian sugar industry does not hold out much promise of big  business opportunities, especially not if we consider that three  or four of the 11 sugar factories in Hungary will have to be  shut down in the near future because there is simply no demand  for that much capacity.    Besides the sugar-industry consortium, in the entire food  industry group there were few other examples of the AVU selling  all the shares in a firm exclusively to Hungarian investors.  Precedents existed primarily in the meat industry. In addition  to Zala County Meat Corporation, the Vas County Meat Industry  Corporation, and the Papa Meat Corporation, however, the shares  of the Dunakeszi Refrigeration Industry Corporation, the Hajdu  County Grain Corporation, and Vardadrink Rt., a manufacturer of  alcoholic beverages, are also 100-percent Hungarian-owned. It is  not surprising that the meat industry has the most domestic  players. Processing capacity is estimated to be three times  greater than what is actually needed, and--sooner or later--a  significant proportion of the processing plants that are being  offered for sale will inevitably go bankrupt. Lately, with the  decline of export opportunities to East Europe, the significance  of the domestic market has increased perceptibly, and there was  relatively greater interest in acquiring equity only in those  firms that earlier had gained significant market shares, even  though they too are not very sound economically. Thus the shares  of Vas County Meat sold for 105 percent of par; those of the  Papa integrated meat plant for 165 percent; and the initial  public offering of Pick Szeged Rt. shares on the stock market  was likewise successful. With the exception of a few larger  meat-industry firms--Gyula Integrated Meat Plant Corporation and  Debrecen Meat Corporation, for instance--not much foreign  interest can be expected in the remaining ones when they are put  up for sale. Perhaps there might be interest in the firms that  are wholesale meat distributors.    Like in the meat industry, the situation is difficult also  in  the dairy industry, because it too has considerable excess  processing capacity. For the time being, foreign capital appears  to be skimming the bargains, picking out the firms with the most  promising markets and developed secure supplier bases. Parmalat,  for instance, has established its headquarters in  Szekesfehervar, by acquiring Fejer County Dairy Corporation. In  the dairy industry, including also the successors of the former  dairy industry enterprises, the AVU had earmarked 48 firms for  privatization. It sold 21 of these firms by December 1993, and  will put another 21 on the block in the first half of 1994. At  present, 21 players share the dairy market. Up to the end of  1993, privatization brought 1.5 billion forints of additional  capital into the industry. The monopoly of Budapesti Tejipari  Vallalat (Budapest Dairy Industry Enterprise) has gradually  weakened during the past two years, and today several provincial  dairy firms also have significant shares of the capital's  market. According to experts, really harsh measures have yet to  come in the dairy industry. The trimming of surplus capacities  will become inevitable in 1994. That will be accompanied by a  substantial rise in unemployment in some regions.    The situation is ambiguous also in conjunction with  privatization in the grain industry. Originally the grain  industry comprised 20 county grain-trading and flour-milling  enterprise (GMV's), and a number of firms servicing them. The  GMV's operated 117 flour mills, 67 feed-mixing plants, and 181  separate granaries. In March 1993, the AVU board of directors  approved a detailed plan for the grain industry's privatization.  On its basis, 71 flour mills, 36 feed-mixing plants, and 154  separate granaries were earmarked for decentralized  privatization. According to a summary report prepared in  mid-January, 48 flour mills but only 14 feed-mixing plants and  29 separate granaries have been privatized so far. The AVU  attributes the conspicuously meager interest in the feed-mixing  plants and granaries to the drought and the livestock  population's decline.    By the end of last year, 15 of the 20 GMV's had been  transformed into corporations, and the one in Veszprem County is  in liquidation and is expected to be wound up by June 1994.  However, only two of the transformed GMV's have been sold so  far. The shares of Hajdu County Grain Corporation were bought by  its MRP [Employee Stock Ownership Program] organization; and the  state's stake in Hungarograin Rt., into which the Komarom County  GMV had been transformed, was bought by a consortium comprising  the MRP organization and a Hungarian company. In the opinion of  the AVU, future foreign interest can be expected only in Cerbona  Rt. It is hoped that domestic investors will buy the remaining  firms, if there is effective demand for them. In the near future  the AVU intends to make initial public offerings of the shares  of three companies: Alfold Grain Corporation, South  Transdanubian Grain Industry Corporation, and Pannonian Grain  Corporation.    There seems to be hardly any foreign interest in the state  baking industry, with the sole refreshing exception of Danube  Bread Corporation. The AVU does not even know how many players  there are in the market, because the number of private firms in  the baking industry has increased dynamically since 1991. It is  estimated that at present the private firms jointly have  approximately a 60-percent share of the market and account for  55 percent of the industry's total capacity. At the commencement  of privatization, incidentally, there were 37 enterprises in the  baking industry, and 19 of them were assigned to the so-called  program of self-privatization [enterprise-initiated  privatization]. Mainly the firms with smaller capacities were  assigned there, while the privatization of the 18 larger  corporations is being handled by the AVU itself. So far the  success of the AVU's efforts has been very modest: Only four  firms had been privatized by the end of 1993.    Of the nine refrigeration-industry corporations in which the  state holds a majority interest, only six have been privatized.  The investors include the multinationals Unilever and Shamrock;  domestic entrepreneurs own the refrigeration plants in Gyor and  Dunakeszi; while the refrigeration plant in Szekesfehervar has  been purchased, for compensation bonds, jointly by individuals  and legal entities. It is undeniable that the  refrigeration-industry firms, which earlier had enjoyed a  monopoly, have lately been forced to compete both on the  domestic and the foreign markets. On the basis of the earlier  invitations to tender, the AVU estimates that the refrigeration  industry will attract nearly 1 billion forints of foreign direct  investment in 1994. As a result of this among others, the AVU  believes that export earnings this year could reach as high as  $70 million, after last year's very modest export of $30 million.    In professional circles opinions are divided about the pace  of privatization within the food industry group, just as they  are about the pace of privatization in general. Many people find  it amazing that the AVU has at all been able to sell so many  firms in financial straits. Others believe that the AVU is  following the path of least resistance, selling off assets on  the principle of "let us be glad we have a buyer," instead of  privatizing individual industries on the basis of comprehensive  conceptual plans. The future will determine who was right on  this issue. In any case, practically every political party has  already announced that, once it came to power, it would  investigate the earlier practice of privatization within the  food-industry group.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Court told of taped sales meeting A US CUSTOMS undercover agent explained at the Old Bailey yesterday how he secretly tape-recorded a meeting between British-based executives and Iraqis during an alleged plot to export nuclear detonating devices to Iraq. Mr Daniel Supnick posed as Mr Dan Saunders, export manager of CSI, the US manufacturer that made electrical capacitors allegedly wanted by the Iraqis. He said yesterday that with the authorisation of British Customs and Excise he put a miniature tape recorder under his clothes before going to London's Cavendish Hotel for an 8am meeting in September 1989. It was allegedly attended by two Iraqi engineers, the president of CSI and two business executives, Mr Ali Daghir and Ms Jeanine Speckman. The meeting, which lasted 2 1/2 hours, was 'to find out more about the sort of capacitors they were seeking', Mr Supnick told the jury. Mr Daghir, aged 49, a managing director, of Esher, Surrey, and Ms Speckman, aged 41, of Addlestone, Surrey, together with Mr Toufic Amyuni, aged 37, of London, have all denied conspiring to attempt illegally to export 40 electrical capacitors between September 1 1988 and March 29 lastyear. All three were executives of Euromac Company, based at Thames Ditton, Surrey. Mr Supnick said he learned from the US State Department for Munitions Control that the devices were considered to be munitions and a licence to export them from the US to Iraq would have been rejected. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Books: Under the influence PURSUED BY FURIES: A LIFE OF MALCOLM LOWRY by Gordon Bowker HarperCollins Pounds 25, 672 pages FIRST AND foremost, Malcolm Lowry was a drunk - so much so that he deserves a capital D. Second, he was a gifted writer of immense promise and tragically truncated achievement. It is impossible to doubt that the booze killed the books. He produced a promising 'young man's' novel, Ultramarine; a masterpiece, Under the Volcano; and a posthumous succession of brilliant stories and unfinished manuscripts. That's all. Gordon Bowker's biography of Lowry is very long, pedestrian, exhaustive, exhausting, often but not always interesting. (Dear God, why have biographers forgotten that the essence of their trade is selection? Do we really need to know that Bleriot flew the Channel three days after Lowry's birth? And how many readers, apart from a tiny minority of publishers and fellow writers, are interested in day-by-day negotiations over book contracts 50 years ago?) The story of Lowry's self-destruction is terrible and terrifying: every page of this history is soaked in alcohol and, by association, in misery. The focus never wavers, and is best expressed in a sentence from a letter from Mexico attributed to the drunken ex-consul Geoffrey Firmin - that is to say, Lowry's alter ego - in Under the Volcano:  - 'And this is how I sometimes think of myself, as a great explorer who has discovered some extraordinary land from which he can never return to give his knowledge to the world: but the name of this land is hell . . .' That is indeed the subject of Under the Volcano, and Lowry will be remembered for having succeeded, in that novel, in giving his knowledge to the world. There lies his main achievement. His father was a Liverpool businessman: Malcolm Lowry was not the first artist to rebel against the bourgeois family and yet to live off their money for all his life. As a mixed-up adolescent before Cambridge, he went to sea, and for the rest of his life made too much of that brief experience. In fact the single trip lasted less than five months and was fairly disastrous (his blurb writers still make it 18 months before the mast); he exaggerated, understandably, rather as Hemingway for ever fantasised about his brief service in the First War. But it produced his first book, Ultramarine, a mildly experimental, unsurprisingly derivative, heavily autobiographical description of the voyage. He was already drinking. He fell under the influence of the American poet Conrad Aiken, whom Mr Bowker believes to have been his Dark Angel as well as a surrogate father. He was sexually immature and inhibited. He loathed his parents. He had a close bisexual friend in whose suicide he seems to have been implicated and for which he would suffer lifelong guilt. From these early days, he was a solitary. He would spend most of his life in chosen exile. He first visited Mexico in 1936, discovered Cuernevaca (which he fictionalised as 'Quauhnahuac'), and one day saw an Indian dying at the roadside who was being robbed of a handful of bloodstained coins: that was the germ of Under the Volcano. His best years were in a simple shack on the seashore north of Vancouver with his second wife, Margerie Bonner, a one-time silent-screen actress who may be alternatively seen as an hysteric or a heroine. The shack was to be their base from 1941 to 1954 and when Lowry was there, with Margerie, he managed to keep the bottle more or less at bay. She believed that she was the keeper of his genius and he became dependent on her, though that did not stop him trying to kill her from time to time. When he was dead, she published the manuscripts he had been fiddling over interminably - Hear Us O Lord From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place, in 1961, Lunar Caustic (1963), Dark As The Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid (1968) and, more controversially, the unfinished October Ferry to Gabriola (1970). (Picador keep Lowry's books available in Britain in paperback). Lowry died, aged only 47, in 1957, after aversion therapy, truth drugs, ECTs, etc. It must surely have been suicide, though even his biographer is not certain; 20 sleeping pills were missing, leave aside the gin and the barbiturates and the vomit. Some years before he had written, 'I have to confess that I am going steadily and even beautifully downhill: my memory misses beats at every moment and my mornings are on all fours . . . In a nutshell I am only sober and merry in a whisky bottle . . . I have now reached a position where every night I write a novel in my imagination, have total recall, but am unable to write a word . . . ' Mr Bowker believes that 'almost certainly Lowry is the least-known British literary genius of the twentieth century'. Hence this labour of love. I wonder whether he protests too much. We are offered comparisons with Joyce, Proust, even Faust. But I suggest we should be more cautious, even if we grant that Under the Volcano, in which the last day in the life of the alcoholic diplomat Geoffrey Firmin is given a transcendent universality, is certainly one of the great novels of this century. Once the Volcano was achieved, Lowry staggered from one manuscript to another, never settling on the successor which his publishers needed. Everything he wrote, as Bowker agrees, was essentially autobiography: he surely did not possess that wider creative imagination of the greatest novelists, and nothing he wrote ever suggested that he was interested in developing that wider dimension. Which is not to deny that he had a lovely talent. If you are new to Lowry, I suggest you turn to 'The Forest Path To The Spring', the concluding short story in Hear Us O Lord From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place, an episode which Lowry claimed would hold the Paradiso position in his never-written six-novel scheme. Bowker describes it, rather nicely, as a 'prose anthem' to his wife and their simple life in British Columbia. It survives re-reading, and suggests a happier interval in a sad life. It ends: 'And I remembered how every evening I used to go down this path through the forest to get water from the spring at dusk. Looking over my wife's shoulder I could see a deer swimming towards the lighthouse. 'Laughing we stooped down to the stream and drank.'</p>

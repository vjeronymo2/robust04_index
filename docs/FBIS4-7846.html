			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 6 (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic supported on Wednesday peace negotiations  between the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia, voicing  confidence that their success would mean an undoubted defeat of  the war option.    During his meeting with RSK President Milan Martic and its  Prime Minister-designate Borisav Mikelic in Belgrade, Milosevic  underscored that negotiations were the only right way of  resolving the crisis in former Yugoslavia, it has been reported.  In this context, Milosevic said an overall normalization of  Serb- Croat relations was of utmost importance for peace and  stability in the region.    On March 30, the Republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia signed  at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb an agreement on the cessation  of hostilities, which took effect on April 4. The  Krajina-Croatian conflict broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's  forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and its decision to  downgrade Serbs to a national minority, after which the Serbs  proclaimed the Republic of Serb Krajina in their ethnic and  historical lands. The Republic of Serb Krajina has been a U.N.  protected area (UNPA) since March 1992.    The Serbian president pointed out the danger coming from  certain extremists who were working against interests of the  Serb people, and, in this context, mentioned the activity of  some members of the Serbian Radical Party, an opposition party  in the parliaments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its  federal unit, Serbia, and of irresponsible groups and  individuals in the RSK. "Extremists compensating for their moral  and political defeat in Serbia by behaving in a barbarous way in  Krajina are a serious threat to Krajina's interests," he said.    The Serbian Radical Party, headed by Vojislav Seselj and  headquartered in Belgrade, maintains a very strong branch in the  RSK. Last autumn, Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia -- which  is the biggest party in Serbia and Yugoslavia -- bitterly  criticized the Serbian Radical Party for its fascist ideas,  raising paramilitary units and committing crimes in war zones in  former Yugoslavia. He said it was necessary as soon as possible  to push to the margin the extremist forces in the RSK and put  them under control of the RSK authorities, whereas legal  proceedings should be instituted against individuals who had  broken the law and sunk deep in crime.    Serbs, who are proud of their heroic past, must not allow  extremists and criminals to strip them of their honour -- the  Serbian president underscored. Martic and Mikelic advised  Milosevic of their efforts aimed at peace and at stabilizing the  RSK politically and economically.</p>

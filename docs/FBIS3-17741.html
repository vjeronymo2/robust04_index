This was reported to the press by the commission chairman  Ivan Yemets.    However, "several district commissions suggest holding the  second round already this week, on 2 April." In these  circumstances the Central Commission is not going to insist on  its opinion, Yemets said. Moreover, district commissions will  have a chance to hold elections at a time suitable for them.    "They will be free to organize voting this weekend or the  next, but 10 April is the latest possible date under the law,"  the official said.    According to preliminary reports from district commissions,  47 out of 450 members of the new parliament were elected in the  first round. Thus, a second round of voting will be held in 403  electoral districts.    Fourteen of the elected members of parliament are Socialists  and Communists. They were elected mostly in Donetsk, Lugansk  and other eastern regions.    Thirteen members from Western Ukraine belong to  national-democratic organizations.    There are also two members of the radical Ukrainian National  Assembly.</p>

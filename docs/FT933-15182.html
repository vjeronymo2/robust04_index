			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading WHILE German and French futures markets notched up strong performances, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 could only stand on the sidelines and watch, ending two points down at 2,849 from its previous day's close, writes Christine Buckley. Traders were disappointed in its showing - which was also set against a buoyant Wall Street - and volume was thin at 7,741 contracts. American players made a significant dent with their desertion of the UK contract in favour of buying into Germany's market. A general lack of buyers was also blamed for dull action in stock index futures. The contract hit its trading high in mid-morning, rising just above the 2,859 mark. One trader said that its poor achievement could be explained partially by the fact that it had to drag itself up from a low of the previous day of 2,828, but even that, in the face of strong markets abroad, did not excuse a 'lousy rally'. September started the day at 2,851 and its close of 2,849 left it at about 4 points below its fair value premium to cash, which is around 7 points. Life was slightly faster in traded options, with a respectable volume of 32,387 lots against the previous day's 22,075. Stock options had some strength, with Hanson at 4,189 lots and Tesco at 3,243. The FT-SE 100 option saw 5,448 contracts change hands.</p>

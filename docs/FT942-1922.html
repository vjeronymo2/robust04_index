			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Rifkind accused of laying ground for Rosyth closure Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, was accused in the Commons yesterday of making political preparations for the closure of the Rosyth naval base, in Fife, instead of fighting for its survival. At the same time the Rosyth naval dockyard took its diversification from warship refitting a stage further by launching a company to carry out steel fabrication for outside customers. The attack on Mr Rifkind was made by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, who said that the government's intentions had been made clear by Mrs Susan Bell, the Conservative candidate in the Monklands East by-election. Mr Salmond said she had described the Rosyth base as 'yesterday's installation, unable to meet the demands of tomorrow'. Mr Rifkind said the future of the base was being examined with that of other installations as part of the 'front line first' study of defence support costs. He expected final proposals to be announced next month. Babcock Facilities Management, which operates the dockyard, has invested nearly Pounds 5m in new steel fabrication facilities and yesterday announced a Pounds 3m contract to supply steelwork for upgrading the Forth road bridge, close to the yard. It expects the subsidiary, Babcock Rosyth Fabricators, to win contracts for modules for offshore platforms and other work. The contract for the Forth road bridge involves supplying 1,600 tonnes of structural steel over 20 months to Grootcon UK, the contractor upgrading the towers of the bridge to take increased traffic. Babcock Facilities Management, a subsidiary of Babcock International, employs 3,500 people at Rosyth. About a quarter of the dockyard's work is for civilian customers, and it would like this to increase to 40 per cent. The dockyard already refurbishes trains for London Underground and makes joinery products. Babcock Rosyth Fabricators is building rudders for ships, modules for gas turbines and the hull of a highspeed ferry for Hong Kong. Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Facilities Management, said diversification spread the costs of the yard's overheads more widely and improved its viability. In the Commons Mr Rifkind insisted that no decision had yet been taken about the Rosyth base. He told Mr Salmond that he was in danger of 'giving humbug a bad name'. Mr Menzies Campbell, defence spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said that closure of the naval base would raise strategic issues of 'profound and irreversible importance'.</p>

According to  available information, trading sessions will be suspended after  the exchange rate goes beyond this mark.    Will this really happen? After all, as "people in the know"  are telling us, Ukraine has merely replicated in a grotesque  form the actions Russia took to stabilize the monetary and  credit system. The Russian leadership has had time to assess all  the drawbacks and advantages of this measure by turning to  Ukrainian experience. However, we must say that the liberal  press of Moscow has done everything in order to portray the  policy of the Zvyahilskyy cabinet in the most negative light.    The Moscow press wrote on this account: "The memorable  abolition of the rate of the karbovanets set on the exchange has  ultimately robbed it of the attributes of a banknote."    On the eve of the election campaign, the issue of  feasibility  or unfeasibility of the regulated exchange rate was once again  up for discussion, turning into a heavyweight argument in the  battle for deputy seats. They embarked upon accusing the  government of an administrative approach and encroachment on the  principles of a market economy. However, the trouble was that  contrary to gloomy predictions, the exchange rate of the  karbovanets stabilized, becoming the main argument in the  election battle.    Let us quote some numbers. On 31 December 1993, one dollar  fetched 27,000 karbovantsy; a month later, this ratio did not  change. By the end of the month, the exchange rate of the dollar  went up somewhat and came to 30,200 karbovantsy.    The average monthly rate of inflation also testifies to the  condition of the Ukrainian economy. Beginning at 50 percent last  year, the Zvyahilskyy government succeeded in bringing it down  to 19 percent in January and 12 percent in February.    This is how all of this has influenced common consumers. The  cost of the minimum "basket" consisting of 22 consumer goods  which are the most essential for living changed in the following  manner: 4 January--412,000 karbovantsy, 3 February--426,000  karbovantsy, and 3 March--432,000 karbovantsy.    It would be proper to recall how the current government  started out. The conventional belief is that Kuchma resigned in  the fall of last year. However, in essence only the formal act  of surrendering the attributes of power occurred at that time.  The introduction of a fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets in  August amounted to the real resignation (do not confuse this  with the suspension of trading sessions on the currency  exchange). As a result of the action taken, the government  acknowledged the bankruptcy of the policy it had pursued, and at  the same time lost Mr. Pynzenyk, who considered it impossible to  remain faithful to the ideals of economic romanticism in the  midst of "Red directors" and other supporters of state  regulation.    The decision of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National  Bank to introduce a fixed exchange rate of the Ukrainian  national currency brought about its record leap. From 5,970  karbovantsy, the exchange rate plummeted to 19,050 karbovantsy  to the ruble [as published], and the cost of the noncash ruble  rose to 15 karbovantsy at the time.    Yet another sad record is associated with the activities of  the Kuchma government: Ukraine came to rank second in the world  in terms of inflation rate, overtaking such countries as Zaire  and Somalia (Serbia ranks first).    In 1993 the emission of currency went up by a factor of 17,  whereas the exchange rate of the karbovanets against the dollar  fell by a factor of 36. How can this be? The answer is simple:  The difference represents the volume of capital exported from  Ukraine. This is what ill-conceived actions in the area of  currency regulation and foreign economic activities have brought  about. However, the statistics given do not reflect the whole  picture because they fail to account of such a phenomenon as  dollar inflation in Ukraine. Last year the exchange rate of the  dollar fell by a factor of 2.77. If we put this indicator  together with the index of a decline in the karbovanets, it will  turn out that purchasing power of the national currency in real  terms fell by a factor of approximately 47.    We should add that during 1992 and 1993 the National Bank  extended large emission credit to the Kuchma-Pynzenyk government  in order to subsidize industry, transportation, and agriculture.  A considerable proportion of these subsidies were used to  produce export products. In the process, exporters who sold  products for freely convertible currencies drew additional  income due to the decline in the exchange rate of the  karbovanets and state subsidies, as well as due to exemption  from payment of value-added and excise taxes.    It is not at all surprising that the fixed exchange rate  failed to produce the desired result, but instead greatly  discredited the very idea of state regulation in the area of  monetary circulation in the eyes of the public. It would appear  that most countries of the world, such as Austria, Sweden,  Hungary, Finland, Poland, and others, which can hardly be  suspected of being "nonmarket," use regulated exchange rates as  the main instrument for financial stabilization. Both America  and Japan have gone through this.    However, it is precisely the point that for Prime Minister  Kuchma this was a forced measure, an act of desperation not  bolstered by other undertakings. The absence of a comprehensive  approach to solving economic problems was the main flaw in the  activities of that Cabinet of Ministers.    Prime Minister Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy took office with this kind  of inheritance. First off, the government embarked on currency  regulation which was expert and justifiable under the current  conditions; it is one of the most significant ways to achieve  macroeconomic stabilization and a reduction in the rate of  inflation. It was suggested that the interbank currency exchange  take a "pause" because its operation facilitated the buildup of  the inflationary spiral.    The government proceeded to take this measure, which was  unpopular in banking circles because the exchange rate of the  karbovanets against the dollar and the Russian ruble that was  artificially understated on the exchange was not in line with  the ratio of the real purchasing power of these currencies,  since there were extremely few real transactions to sell  currency. This had to do with the fact that transactions  concluded came at best to just 5 percent of the entire currency  turnover of the country.    Experts estimate that the exchange rates of the dollar and  the Russian ruble were overstated by no less than a factor of  2.5, which did tremendous damage to the economy of Ukraine.  Therefore, a tender committee allocating currency for targeted  uses in the interests of the entire economy of the country  appeared instead of a monopolized group acting on the exchange  in keeping with a preliminary agreement. A restructuring program  appeared, which reduced the risk of the use of financial funds  proceeding from the arbitrary motives of "comrades in the  leadership." Two more reasons may be named among those that  influenced the relative stabilization of the karbovanets: first,  restrictions on intermediary surcharges, which resulted in a  veritable economic war between the government and traders in  "black gold," and, second, the containment of monetary emission.    However, the seriousness of the intentions of the  Zvyahilskyy  government and the deliberation of the steps taken by it can be  verified soon. Russia has banned the use of foreign currency in  settlements for transactions. This is when the test of strength  for the karbovanets will be administered.    As far as the hryvnya is concerned.... Recently, I happened  to ask Deputy Prime Minister Landik about its fate. His response  was: "I promise you that this will be done on a Thursday. I  cannot say precisely when, but definitely on a Thursday."</p>

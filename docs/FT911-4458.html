			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / BR approaches the market junction: Divide and sell - British Rail's operations will be segmented before they go to the private sector / How might it be done? Privatising British Rail was never going to be easy. This week's news that BR's call on government funds had soared 60 per cent beyond budget to Pounds 1bn in the year to March 1991 served to remind would-be purchasers of BR's unappealing financial qualities. Reinforcing the message is the threat of industrial action lurking behind the rail unions' rejection of BR's 6.5 per cent pay offer. Yet those who thought the pressure for a sell-off would ease when Mrs Thatcher resigned were wrong. Mr John Major has made it clear that BR's privatisation has moved up the political agenda. If the Conservatives win the next election, the necessary legislation will be sought early in the next parliament. Whatever Mr Major's reasons for pressing ahead with BR's sale, he is not in it for the money. Although the balance-sheet value of BR's assets has been put at Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn, the main concern of buyers will be the railways' earnings potential, particularly if strings are attached to asset disposals: so BR's poor financial performance is likely to produce an equally poor price. A better reason is that, for the first time since nationalisation in 1948, the railway industry has entered an era of growth. Increasing road and air corridor congestion has brought the need for heavy new investment in rail infrastructure which public ownership is ill-equipped to meet. As long as BR is owned by the state, its borrowing counts as public borrowing and is fixed in the context of competing demands from other government services. As Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, complained in February, however badly needed or potentially profitable a rail project may be - if the money needed to undertake it exceeds Treasury limits, it cannot go ahead. A second good reason for privatisation is the widespread feeling that it would sharpen BR's management and marketing. In spite of attempts to induce a more customer-oriented attitude at BR, operational expediency still tends to triumph over customer care, as with the frequent closure of restaurant and buffet cars long before train journeys end. Suggesting why BR should be privatised is easier than deciding how. The ministerial group studying the problem - Mr Roger Freeman from the Transport Department, Mr John Redwood from Trade and Industry and Mr Francis Maude from the Treasury - is far from reaching conclusions. One option which has been ruled out, however, is selling BR off as a single company. Although attractive for its simplicity, this would substitute a private monopoly for a public one; and the company would remain beholden to the state in perpetuity because of the large subsidies it would need for the operation of the Regional Railways services, many of which will never run at a profit. Equally unlikely is the notion of splitting the network into units based on the existing regions - western, southern, London Midland and the rest. This would still leave the new companies drawing off state subsidies for their loss-making services, and would lead to an illogical fragmentation of the marketing and operation of BR's InterCity, Railfreight and European passenger services. A more attractive variant of this idea is the one advanced by the Centre for Policy Studies. This would carve BR into about 12 companies based on 'route segments' such as the old London &amp; North Western Railway network running from London Euston to Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. The virtue of this proposal is that it recognises the traffic flows which formed the rationale for the railways' construction. There would also be competition between rival routes to some places, such as Scotland. This solution, however, still does not solve the problem of subsidies; and although the fragmentation of the network would be along more logical lines than under the regional plan, it could also discourage the evolution of national and international services. One solution which overcomes these objections is the one advocated by the Adam Smith Institute. This would see BR's track, signalling and stations hived off to a separate track authority, leaving BR owning just the trains. BR would then be split and sold off, after which its parts would compete in the private sector with anyone else who wanted to enter the market as a train operator. One of the attractions of this option is the opportunity it would create for competition. As with airports and airways, stations and tracks would be available on equal terms to any operator who wished to use them. The problems associated with fragmentation of the network would be avoided. And loss-making regional services could be put out to tender on a line-by-line basis, with 10-year franchises going to the companies which wanted the smallest subsidy to run them. However, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, is opposed to this solution. He believes it would create a big and dangerous monopoly. Track costs account for roughly 45 per cent of the costs of running a rail service, he says. How could any company operate sensibly with such a high proportion of its costs controlled by a monopoly supplier? The track authority, whether public or privately owned, would have little incentive to operate efficiently. Any decision to update the infrastructure would present formidable problems: for example, modern signalling and automatic train protection systems could not be introduced without parallel investment in improved trains. Mr Rifkind prefers a less radical and more workable solution. He believes BR should be split along the lines of its existing business sectors (InterCity, Railfreight, Regional Railways, Network SouthEast and Parcels) and privatised piecemeal. Two important components of this plan would be, first, that no sector or company would be permitted to exercise a monopoly over the use of its tracks; and second, that track costs would have to be identified separately from running costs under the supervision of a regulatory body, so that all track users would be free to compete on an equal footing. Once these pre-conditions had been achieved, the first candidate for privatisation would be the profitable Railfreight division. Owning little track of its own, it would be mainly a train operator, running its services over BR's tracks and paying BR the same track fee as any other private-sector freight train operators which cared to compete. Next most likely candidate would be InterCity, which has also made modest profits recently. This would probably be sold as a complete operation comprising trains, stations and mainline tracks, though it could be sub-divided into route segments. Its own trains would continue to dominate the network, but other would-be express train operators would be free to enter the market on equal terms, paying InterCity a fee for use of its tracks. If and when Network SouthEast became profitable (the target for ending subsidies is 1992-93, although that looks like slipping) it could be privatised as a single entity or split into northern, southern, and eastern sectors. Alternatively, it could be divided further into independent lines such as the London Tilbury &amp; Southend and the London Brighton &amp; South Coast railways. Mr Rifkind does not envisage much competition between different operators' trains on Network SouthEast. Constraints on track capacity would not allow it. But dividing the network into sub-groups would allow the performance of different operators to be compared. Finally the loss-making regional lines, as under the track authority option, would be put out to tender on a line-by-line basis, with the companies requiring the lowest subsidies getting the franchises to operate the tracks and trains. The weakness of the Rifkind scenario, as with some of the others, lies in its fragmentation of the track network. International freight distributors in the north, faced with the task of negotiating track paths with a regional railway operator, InterCity, a Network SouthEast operator and Eurotunnel before even reaching the Continent, might well conclude that road transport offered an easier solution. But possibly the bigger hurdle is the political one. Mr Rifkind might have ruled out the track authority option, but many on the Conservative right are wedded to it. The final arbiter will be Cabinet: meanwhile the lobbying can only grow more fierce as the options begin to crystallise.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Jubilee talks at critical phase THE Jubilee Line Underground extension to London's Docklands will be built only if a banking consortium which has made loans to the troubled Canary Wharf development can persuade the European Investment Bank to make a contribution to the UK government of up to Pounds 98m. The 11 banks, led by Lloyds and including Barclays, have been negotiating for almost a year on how to meet the government's demand they contribute Pounds 400m to the Jubilee's costs, including an immediate payment of Pounds 98m. Negotiations have reached a critical phase, bankers said yesterday. Bank executives have agreed to a framework for making the Jubilee payment, but this must be agreed by each bank's board. 'We should know at the end of next week whether approval has been given,' one banker said. 'It could go either way.' Even if the banks give formal agreement, there will need to be another set of negotiations with the European Investment Bank. The banks want the EIB - controlled by the European Community - to make the Pounds 98m initial payment. Bankers close to the negotiations said that the EIB had made no commitment to provide the funds. It would set tough conditions before lending the Pounds 98m to a company in control of Canary Wharf, which would then give the money to the government. The EIB's main condition would be that the 11 banks transfer considerable collateral to it. The boards of the 11 banks are also being asked for sufficient finance to allow the first stage of the Canary Wharf property development to be completed, and for it to come out of administration under UK insolvency procedures. The banks have set a deadline of the end of March for final agreement to be reached on the funding of the Jubilee Line and the completion of Canary Wharf. Related agreements must also be reached by then with London Regional Transport for it to build the line and rent office space at Canary Wharf. A banker warned: 'If agreement with any party is not reached, the whole deal collapses.' The EIB already has a Pounds 100m loan to Canary Wharf, but its security is inferior to the Pounds 600m provided by the 11 commercial banks. As a result, the EIB faces bigger losses than the other banks.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Personal View: Safety net for pensions custodians Taken together, the following three events are rather surprising. First, about Pounds 400m is discovered to be missing from the Maxwell pensions funds. The problem, so far as we know, had nothing to do with underfunding or with poor investment performance. Rather, the money just was not with the custodians, where it was supposed to be. Second, in the wake of what is surely the most serious financial scandal of recent times, the government asked a committee under Professor Goode to examine the law as it applies to pensions. The report does not propose any substantive changes in the area of safe custody and, in particular, does not recommend making the use of independent custodians mandatory. Among the reasons given is that the use of custodians may 'give the semblance of protection without the reality'. Third, in its 'Custody Review', the Securities and Investments Board says that it does not feel the case has been made for bringing custody under the regulatory umbrella and making it an authorisable activity. Can all this make sense? Goode is right to have doubts about the contribution which commonly existing forms of custody can make to the safety of client assets. A custodian typically works under a contract drawn up by the pension fund trustees. Duties will typically include the safe-keeping of assets, their delivery or receipt after authorised transactions, and the provision of a reporting system. Such a contract will usually not require the custodian to use its judgment and discretion to protect the assets of investors but rather to follow the instruction of the pension fund trustees or their delegates. If the trustees instruct the custodian to deliver client assets to some third party, as appears to have occurred in the Maxwell case, the custodian will do it so long as this is consistent with the custody contract (which it usually will be). In contrast, our view is that the form of the contract can be altered substantially to improve protection for client property against fraud and misuse. One of the principles of protecting investors is that those with responsibility ought to be in a position to provide compensation if that responsibility is abused. In pension funds the responsibility lies with the trustees but they are rarely able to provide compensation. Regulating custodians will not change this substantially. This may be why the SIB does not support making custody an authorisable activity and why Professor Goode does not favour mandating the use of custodians. What pensions regulation ought to focus on, however, is the type of contract under which custodians operate. It should be a legal requirement that the contract with custodians provides a duty of care to the trust fund and its beneficiaries rather than the trustee. One implication for the Maxwell type of case would be that, if the trustees were to give instructions to the custodian which the latter considered prejudicial to the interests of pension fund beneficiaries, the custodian would be obliged to refuse to carry out such instructions, and failing that would be liable for the consequences. This would also have the effect of providing another 'whistleblower' for beneficiaries just as Goode's proposals would do in the case of auditors. If this change were made it would be necessary to subject custodians to a 'fit and proper' test and to minimum capital requirements to ensure they can meet liabilities in the event of claims against them. This, in turn, would require that custody becomes an authorisable activity. We believe this approach would be more effective than Professor Goode's proposals, which would create a fund to compensate pension fund beneficiaries in the event that the assets were misappropriated. A compensation scheme will do nothing to diminish the incidence of fraud; indeed, it is nothing more than a compulsory insurance scheme where the premiums will (almost certainly) be unrelated to the risks. Honest firms will subsidise dishonest firms, efficient firms will subsidise inefficient firms and the scheme will weaken the incentive for firms to take sensible actions on their own behalf to prevent fraud. If a compensation scheme has a role at all, it should not be the principal weapon in the current drive to protect the investor against fraud. It would be far better to give a greater role to properly regulated custodians, to let the market for custody services discriminate between good risks and bad risks and to leave any compensation scheme to cope with the few cases that slip through the net.

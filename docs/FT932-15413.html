			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK and China end deadlock on Hong Kong reform talks BRITAIN and China are to hold talks in Beijing on April 22. The decision, announced yesterday, breaks a five-month procedural deadlock over democratic reforms for Hong Kong proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. The dispute over Mr Patten's reform programme, which has seen China heap increasingly vicious personal abuse on the governor, threatened to embitter the remaining years of British sovereignty over Hong Kong, which is to be handed over to China in 1997. China had also threatened to restrict trade between the two countries and to veto big projects in Hong Kong, which Beijing says require its approval under the 1984 Joint Declaration between the two countries. Mr Patten refused to say whether China had changed its position on the talks, merely describing the decision as 'a victory for common sense'. He was speaking in London, where he had talks over lunch with Mr John Major, the prime minister. He said: 'I very much hope that we can come off at the end of the day with an agreement on proposals which are fair and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.' The announcement was anticipated in aggressive buying on the Hong Kong stock and futures markets. Ahead of the news, the Hang Seng index closed 132.54 up at 6,418.21. The April Hang Seng Index futures contract, a significant barometer of short-term confidence, closed at an 82-point premium to the Hang Seng, and Hong Kong shares were in great demand later in London, suggesting that investors were expecting another strong performance today. Although the agreement settles none of the fundamental issues raised by Mr Patten's reforms, it appears to be a genuine compromise. China has accepted the presence of three Hong Kong delegates in the British negotiating team. It had previously rejected any Hong Kong participation. Britain, for its part, appears to have agreed that the three Hong Kong representatives should not play a direct part in the negotiations. The British embassy in Beijing said they would be there 'to support' the British representative, Sir Robin McLaren, the British ambassador to China. Significantly, the colony's three representatives - Mr Michael Sze, Hong Kong's secretary for constitutional affairs; Mr Peter Lai, his deputy; and Mr William Ehrman, Mr Patten's political adviser - were not mentioned in the joint statement announcing the talks in Beijing, although Mr Patten said they were full members of the British team. The talks, the first round of which is expected to last for four days, will focus on the arrangements to be made for district board elections in the colony in 1994 and elections to the Legislative Council (LegCo) in 1995. LegCo, even under the Patten reforms, will continue to be only partly composed of directly elected members. China has strongly objected to the governor's proposals under which LegCo members representing so-called 'functional constituencies' (representing various functions or trades) will be democratically elected. Britain insists that the proposals are consistent with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, China's mini-constitution for Hong Kong after the colony reverts to Chinese rule. China has always said they contravene the Basic Law. Mr Patten has repeatedly made clear that he will respect the wishes of the people of Hong Kong in the matter. His proposals will eventually be submitted to LegCo and, if the legislative body rejects them, the governor has promised to accept its verdict. That might be a face-saving procedure for Britain.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F> Spomenka Jovic in Belgrade on 18 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Jovic] Can I freely assume that there is  significant optimism and faith in a more stable government?    [Marjanovic] Well, you see, the stability of the government  will depend on what we manage to achieve. Times are tough, and  had we not believed that we could achieve something, I believe  that neither I nor my associates would not have undertaken this  task. What is the essence? The essence is that the only strong  elements we had as pointers that we had to apply ourselves to  diligently in order to fully succeed lay in our belief that,  even in conditions of sanctions, there was a possibility of  mobilizing the mechanisms for reviving the economy. If there  were no sanctions, this would be a completely different thing,  and I believe that we would be able to come up with even better  programs. However, I am convinced that we will find the  strength to keep the dinar stable, to improve and increase  production, at least to the extent that will keep the dinar  stable for the time being. Once we gain a little strength, then  we can think more seriously about the further revival of the  economy.    [Jovic] I thank you for this interview, and wish you  successful cooperation with your team and the best of luck in  your work.</p>

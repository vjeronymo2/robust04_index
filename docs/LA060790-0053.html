			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL LOVER GATHERS THE WOUNDED AND THE WEAK  </P> <P> No living thing is too big, too small, too slimy, too ugly, or too smelly. If  it flies, crawls, slithers, hops, swims, or walks on four legs and is in need  of help, Bob Farner will be there.  </P> <P> Bob Farner's Wildlife Rescue and Education Center, newly located on 3 acres in  Valley Center, was established in 1980 primarily for the rehabilitation of  injured and orphaned animals. Another, equally important goal of the  organization is educating the public about wildlife preservation.  </P> <P> "We've become so far removed from nature that we've come to fear it," Farner  says. He wants people to realize that animals and birds will stand a much  better chance of survival when people learn to adapt and share the environment  with them.  </P> <P> "I think people who love and understand wildlife get along in life very, very  well," Farner said, espousing his theory that this kind of sensitivity and  wisdom fosters a sense of fulfillment that enriches everyday lives.  </P> <P> In an effort to introduce people to wildlife and individual animals, Farner  takes wild animals into classrooms, hospital rooms and town halls.  </P> <P> A tour of his center's facility brings you face to face with a cougar named  Sheba, a blind great blue heron known as Blue, and Flag, a mule deer, all  permanent residents with no hope of returning to the wild.  </P> <P> As a young cub, Sheba was declawed by an exotic-animal dealer in Texas who sold  her to a customer as a pet. Kept illegally, she was removed from that home at  the age of 7 months and placed with Farner, who has cared for her over the last  seven years.  </P> <P> Blue lost both eyes when the Carlsbad lagoon in which he lived grew polluted  with toxins. Now he must be carefully hand-fed, a process he and Farner have  perfected through trial and error.  </P> <P> Flag was rescued from someone who raised him and kept him confined to a small  apartment. This robbed him of his wild instincts and rendered him incapable of  survival outside of a captive environment.  </P> <P> Many of the animals are victims of Mother Nature herself. People bring in baby  birds who have fallen from nests, orphaned animals whose mothers have either  abandoned them or been killed, and many sick animals. Weather patterns, too,  such as persistent drought, can wreak havoc on wild habitats.  </P> <P> The hapless victims of human ignorance are the ones that bother Farner the  most.  </P> <P> "It preys on my mind, but I just have to forget it," he said. Incidents like  these only serve to deepen his resolve to continue showing and telling.  </P> <P> He cautions people to use judgment when they come across an animal in need of  help. To avoid hurting either themselves or the animal, Farner or an  experienced volunteer will come out to remove a sick or injured critter, or  relocate a healthy one that may pose a threat, such as a rattlesnake.  </P> <P> Farner has his finger on the pulse of the diverse San Diego County wildlife  populations. Encroaching development has reduced the habitats of many animals,  including the once plentiful deer whose reproduction is naturally regulated by  the availability of habitat.  </P> <P> Certain barometers have already indicated seriously declining populations. For  instance, this year the center has taken in 15 barn owls. This is down from 37  at this time last year and from the 100-plus the year before. No red-tailed or  red-shouldered hawks have come in so far this year; they used to get as many as  a dozen.  </P> <P> A nonprofit organization, the wildlife center has no paid employees and relies  entirely on private donations. Volunteers contribute their time, knowledge and  whatever else is needed -- including food and medical care -- for the animals .  </P> <P> Wildlife Rescue &amp; Education Center  </P> <P> Valley Center  </P> <P> Call: 749-6737 or 724-6338. Keep calling; workers are often busy outside with  the animals.  </P> <P> Or write: Bob Farner  </P> <P> 1286 Oak Knoll Drive  </P> <P> Vista, Calif. 92084  </P> <P> Notes: Visitors are welcome; so are new volunteers.  </P></p>

Nevertheless, I also believe that  reckless statements should not be made at Sandinist departmental  meetings, not even jokingly, because they are in bad taste,"  Sergio Ramirez said yesterday.    Last week, LA PRENSA reported that supporters of Daniel  Ortega recommended during a departmental meeting in Leon that  the leaders who did not agree with the current orthodox  leadership of the party be killed [eliminar fisicamente].    "I heard these rumors, and Monica Baltodano (of the  so-called  Pikin Guerrero trend) informed me this was a joke. We discussed  this matter in the Sandinist Assembly, and I expressed my  opposition to this kind of thing," stressed Ramirez, who has  been the target of attacks by sectors close to Ortega.    Ramirez said it is dangerous to enter into confrontation  within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] because,  according to him, this could create "difficult" situations for  those people who are the targets of the attacks.    "If they insist on insults and accusations -- such as  selling  out to imperialism, or selling out to the right -- this indeed  creates a tense atmosphere that is somehow dangerous," asserted  Ramirez, who is a member of the FSLN National Directorate. He  added that he condemns this kind of behavior "in both currents."    "I recently heard on a radio program (Radio Ya) that I was a  cancerous member in a healthy body (FSLN), and that I should  therefore be cut out of the body. I do not know what they were  implying by saying that I be cut out," Ramirez complained,  reiterating his belief that ideas should be discussed with  respect and not with insults.    Sergio Ramirez and Daniel Ortega are the individuals who  currently lead two currents of opinion struggling to control the  FSLN.    Political observers have termed Ramirez's supporters  "moderates," while the followers of the FSLN secretary general  have been labeled "hardliners and orthodox."    Also, Ramirez, former vice president of the Republic,  reiterated his presidential aspirations for the 1996 elections,  in response to a reporter's question.    "My categorical answer is yes, because it is a right  bequeathed by the Nicaraguan Constitution. I have legitimate  aspirations like everyone else," Ramirez stressed.    Later, Ramirez, leader of the Sandinist legislative wing,  suggested that the FSLN presidential candidate come from the  party's rank-and-file and be chosen in primary elections "not by  a small group." His statement came in open defiance of the  election system that has traditionally existed within his party.    Months ago, Ramirez stated his presidential aspirations to  the FSLN National Directorate. This resulted in pro-Ortega  media, in particular Radio Ya and Radio La Primerisima,  launching a severe campaign to discredit and insult him.    "I do not aspire to run for vice president, because I have  already outgrown such a position," Ramirez asserted  categorically.    "I want all Sandinists to understand that I will not leave  the FSLN, even if the current I support turns out to be the  minority. I will continue to be a Sandinist, either within the  leadership or the rank-and-file," Ramirez remarked.    At this point, with a little more than a month before the  party's Congress (20 May), Ramirez indicated he has reserved the  right to run for leadership positions within the FSLN. Sergio  Ramirez believes the rights of individuals should be respected.  "No one is authorized to tell others what they must do," he  continued.    Ramirez made the aforementioned statements within the  context  of a struggle for control of the party -- a struggle in which  people close to Ortega leaked a list of candidates to join the  expanded National Directorate. Sergio Ramirez and Luis Carrion,  promoters of the renewal of the FSLN, have been "purged" from  this list.    Yesterday, Daniel Ortega declared that differences between  Sandinist currents stem from the fact that one sector of the  FSLN supports government policies, while the other sector  opposes them and would be willing to resort to violent means.    "I do not agree with Ortega's opinion, because all of the  activity Sandinism conducts with the government has the National  Directorate's approval," Ramirez stressed.    He explained that relations with the government began with  the signing of the transition protocol in 1990. "I did not even  sign this agreement between the government and the National  Directorate, because I was not then a member of that leadership  organ," Ramirez said.    Ramirez ended by saying: "Every political party that loses  an  election enters into serious contradictions, and there are  Sandinists who have not yet accepted this situation -- a  situation of which I am very proud, because the FSLN showed its  democratic calling by relinquishing power in the first free  elections ever held in this country."</p>

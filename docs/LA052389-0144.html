			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Active Memory Technology Inc., an Irvine manufacturer of high-speed computers  known as parallel processors, said the U.S. Army has purchased one of its  computers for use in an experimental project that involves detecting mine  fields from an aircraft.  </P> <P> AMT said the order with the Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment  Station in Vicksburg, Miss., is valued at about $360,000.  </P> <P> AMT said the Army is studying how well mine fields can be detected from the  air. Under the contract, one of AMT's DAP 610 computers will be mounted in a  helicopter and used to process data received from an airborne scanner.  </P> <P> If the experiment is successful, AMT is hopeful that the Army will go ahead  with full development of a mine detection system using AMT equipment, a company  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Irvine firm manufactures parallel computers that use hundreds or thousands  of small processors to perform computer tasks at very high speed.  </P></p>

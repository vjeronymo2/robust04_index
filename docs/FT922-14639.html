			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THIS WEEK'S column epitomises the opposing forces influencing directors. On the one side there is a fear of the potential impact a Labour administration would have on the trading environment, coupled with the threat of higher personal taxation. On the other is the feeling that economic recovery is near and shares are cheap. As a result there are almost as many purchases by directors as sales. Shares in Iceland Frozen Food have proved rewarding over the last year, rising from 280p to 470p. However, all the main board directors, save for the one non-executive director, sold shares, realising more than Pounds 5m. When six directors of Global Group sold a total of 7,150,000 shares at 24p 12 months ago, investors would have been wise to have followed suit. With the shares now languishing at 8p three directors have bought a modest 250,000 shares in total. In the year to December 1991 pre-tax profits fell 60 per cent. It is rare for high-profile industrialists to make open market purchases - they usually acquire shares through executive options schemes. Lord Sterling, chairman of P &amp; O, the shipping and property concern, bought 250,000 deferred shares after announcing better than expected final results.

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIALEAH PARK BETTING LICENSE LIFTED;  </P> <P> RACING: AN EMERGENCY STATE ORDER SHUTS DOWN THE HISTORIC TRACK BECAUSE IT  ALTERED ITS SCHEDULE WITHOUT APPROVAL.  </P> <P> The Florida Department of Business Regulation said it will suspend Hialeah  Park's pari-mutuel license because the historic track altered its racing  schedule without state approval.  </P> <P> The department's emergency order will at least temporarily shut down the  track's troubled meeting.  </P> <P> Hialeah Park owner John Brunetti and his attorney, Barry Richard, informed of  the state's plans Monday, promised to appeal the order to the 3rd District  Court of Appeals in Miami.  </P> <P> If Hialeah can persuade the court to grant a stay, the track can continue  running its abbreviated schedule until a full hearing.  </P> <P> "I never have expectations with an appellate court," Richard said of Hialeah's  outlook.  </P> <P> Brunetti had planned to be closed today through Friday. Saturday was to be the  first day Brunetti would test his revised three-day race schedule.  </P> <P> Under its original schedule, Hialeah was to be open today. By closing, the  track would be in violation of its license, which requires that it run six days  a week through May.  </P> <P> The state's emergency order is based on the grounds that the Division of  Pari-Mutuel Wagering no longer can adequately regulate pari-mutuel activity at  Hialeah under the chaotic conditions.  </P> <P> Brunetti decided to abbreviate Hialeah's schedule because the track has lost an  estimated $68,000 per day since it opened Nov. 18.  </P></p>

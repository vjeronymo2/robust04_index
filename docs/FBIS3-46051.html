In Jiangsu, township enterprises and tertiary industry in  the  countryside account for about half of its GDP -- the value of  goods and services produced.    In the rural areas of the province, township enterprises and  rural tertiary industry rose to 86 percent of the total output  value in 1993 from 50 percent in 1978, an 11 percent increase  over that of 1991.    Traditionally, agriculture has been confined to the  countryside in China and industry to cities. Township  enterprises came into being only in the 1970s.    In 1978, township enterprises and other non-agricultural  tertiary industries for the first time produced half of  Jiangsu's agricultural output value. Their golden age came in  the 1990s when the Chinese Government decided to develop the  market economy in cities.    The past three years were the fastest development period for  township enterprises in Jiangsu.    In 1992, the industrial output value produced by township  enterprises increased by more than 100 billion yuan over the  previous year to 300 billion. In 1993 it leapt to 400 billion  yuan.    Seven of the top 10 most developed counties in China are in  Jiangsu.    In 1993, township enterprises in the province contributed to  about 45 percent of the province's revenue turned over to the  state.    For the past few years, about three-fourths of the  province's  increased GDP has come from the countryside, where 80 percent of  the added output value has come from township enterprises.    Meanwhile, township enterprises have exerted influence on  the  layout of China's cities. Thousands of small towns which have  been born and prospered on the basis of township enterprises  link the countryside with cities. In some areas, cities can  hardly be distinguished from the countryside.</p>

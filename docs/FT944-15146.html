			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (9): How Iowa won the battle for a steel mill / Case Study of Ipsco The course of site location does not always run smoothly. When Ipsco, a Canadian steel company, was examining places to build a new US plant, one leading contender was a site in Iowa on the banks of the Mississippi River. Then came the great Mississippi floods of 1993 and the site disappeared under 11 feet of water. Ipsco, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, went on to choose another Iowa site - again close to the Mississippi, but in a somewhat more elevated position - as the location for its new Dollars 360m mill, now under construction in the state's Muscatine County. The facility, due for completion in April 1996, is one of the biggest development projects in Iowa. It is designed to produce 1m tonnes of hot rolled steel annually from scrap metal and will create 300 jobs. But the project could easily have gone to another mid-western state. Roger Phillips, president of Ipsco, says that initially Iowa did not figure prominently in the company's site search - even though Ipsco already had a steel pipe mill located in the state. Iowa, says Mr Phillips, was not a leading contender because the state's taxes on machinery and equipment discouraged investment by capital intensive industries. Iowa, however, put itself in the race by suggesting to Ipsco that it might be able to offer a break on the machinery and equipment tax. The tax issue apart, the state met a lot of Ipsco's other site requirements: since steel is heavy, the company needed to be relatively close to the mid-western markets it wanted to serve. It needed reliable supplies of its basic raw material, scrap metal, and guarantees of long-term reasonable electricity prices. Other essentials included good rail and truck transport links and proximity to a river system. Its site list finally came down to a choice between three states: Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky. Indiana is America's leading steel state, being home both to the large integrated mills around the town of Gary, and a revolutionary new mini-mill constructed by Nucor in the agricultural heart of the state. Kentucky has been particularly aggressive in trying to attract new manufacturing industry, including steel plants. From Iowa's point of view, winning the battle for Ipsco became one of the highest priorities in the state's industrial development strategy. Iowa is known primarily as an agricultural state and has long been one of the leading US producers of corn and soya beans. It is also a significant manufacturer of farm equipment and consumer durable goods, being the home state of white goods manufacturer Maytag. However, the state economy suffered badly in the 1980s. Successive recessions in the farming and durable goods sectors meant it suffered among the largest percentage drops in its employment base in the nation, losing 8.1 per cent of its workforce and 4.6 per cent of its population. The 1990s have seen a slow reversal of the population loss as agriculture has recovered and the state has sought to diversify its economic base. It has modified its tax structure, put in place financial assistance and job training programmes, invested Dollars 150m in the construction of an information superhighway backbone, and started a big marketing push, including glossy advertisements in leading US business magazines under the slogan 'the smart state for business'. The slogan plays on Iowa's traditionally very good educational system and its strong work ethic. (Mr Phillips says that the reputation of the school system was not a deciding factor for his company, 'but it was icing on the cake'). Among the sectors targeted by the state for development efforts are insurance and financial services (Des Moines has become a significant insurance centre); agricultural products processing; and the metals industry, which is concentrated in the eastern part of the states. Its emphasis on metals led state development authorities to go aggressively after the Ipsco project. The most important component of the Dollars 75m package the state put together is the elimination of the property tax on machinery and equipment for the project, which required special approval of the state legislature. The Iowa senate initially rejected the incentive package, last February, but then passed the measure when Ipsco threatened to walk away. The package includes just Dollars 3m of upfront state financial assistance, about half that which will go on road construction. The vast bulk of the aid is in various forms of tax credits, which are dependent on Ipsco making a very substantial investment in the state. Some Dollars 36m consists of exemption from the machinery and equipment tax, while Dollars 8.5m comprises foregone state corporate tax. However, Iowa economists reckon that state and local tax receipts could receive a Dollars 120m boost over 20 years, thanks to the project's impact on population and earnings growth, and that the public benefits of aid for the mill will easily outstrip the costs.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: IPounds 7m loan recovery helps Bank of Ireland rise 28% An unexpected recovery of a IPounds 7m individual loan that had been written off helped pre-tax profits at Bank of Ireland rise by 28 per cent from IPounds 130.9m to IPounds 167.3m (Pounds 164.3m) in the six months to September 30. The bank disclosed that competition for deposits in Ireland had narrowed its net interest margin from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent, although the effect on income was offset by loan growth, including a strong rise in mortgages. It raised its interim dividend by 13 per cent to 4.25p (3.75p), emphasising that this was 'in order to achieve a better balance' with the final. Earnings per share rose from 15.2p to 22p, and net asset value per share grew from 144p to 174p. Mr Maurice Keane, deputy chief executive, said it might repay some subordinated loan capital from next year onwards as retained earnings strengthened capital, but had no plans to distribute cash to shareholders in a share buy-back. Mr Keane said the bank was more likely to use the cash for acquisitions. He said this could include the purchase of a mortgage portfolio in the UK, or an expansion of life insurance or pensions in Ireland. He expected margin pressures to continue, and said that they could extend from deposits to lending if National Australia Bank or National Westminster Bank succeeded in buying TSB Bank, creating a larger competitor. The First New Hampshire group, its US retail arm, returned a IPounds 13.9m profit (IPounds 3.5m loss). Mr Keane said the subsidiary would be retained for at least two years in order to gain the tax benefit of accumulated losses. Loan loss provisions as a percentage of loans fell to what Mr Keane said was an 'unsustainably low' level of 0.2 per cent as a result of loan recoveries of IPounds 10.6m, including the unidentified individual recovery of about IPounds 7m. Net interest income fell slightly to IPounds 304.9m (IPounds 311.2m) as a result of narrowing margins, but loan loss provisions fell to IPounds 11.4m (IPounds 47.5m). Operating expenses slipped by 1 per cent from IPounds 288.7m to IPounds 285.2m as staff costs fell. The shares closed unchanged at 285p.</p>

[passage  omitted]    But the government has been forced to postpone a major push  against KR strongholds at Pailin and Anlung Veng because of a  lack of ammunition and difficulties in adequately preparing  field operations.    KR, government and diplomatic sources agree that the  government hopes to concentrate initially on a major assault on  Anlung Veng, the northern headquarters of the guerrilla faction  under the command of Gen. Ta Mok.    The assault on Pailin has been put on hold for fears they  would not be able to successfully capture the KR stronghold  without more ammunition.    "There is no panic. They are going on with their plans for  the offensive as normal," said a western military source. "They  are waiting for the ammunition and when they get it they will  attack Anlung Veng. For Pailin, they decided to cancel their  plans for the moment, they don't speak about Pailin anymore."    Both sides acknowledge the imminent fighting is a test of  strength that is designed to influence the leverage each seeks  during peace talks over how to include the KR in the government  and the army. [passage omitted]    But both sides see the military push -- expected to begin  this month -- as designed to gain political advantage and  neither side contends that the offensive, no matter how  successful, could wipe out the KR as a military force.    What is clear is that peace has been postponed for at least  another dry season in Cambodia and war is seen as inevitable, by  both sides, to achieve their longer term political objectives.    For the KR, this means a desire for a maximum power sharing  role in the new government and the army. For the government the  objective is to weaken the guerrilla faction to be in a position  to give up less at the negotiating table.    "No negotiation is successful at the negotiating table  alone," one KR official said. "What we get depends on the  fighting. Of course we want the maximum but it depends if we  can defend ourselves."    KR sources acknowledge they may be able to hold Pailin or  Anlung Veng in the face of a well organized and equipped  government attack.    "They will fight, we will defend the territory but not at  any  cost. We may lose some areas during the dry season but we will  take it back in the rainy season. At the end we will come out  on top. If they want to try, let them try," he said. [passage  omitted]    Senior government and diplomatic sources say government  officials have officially requested military aid from China,  Russia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and North  Korea but have come up mostly empty handed.    Russia is said to have given ten million rounds of AK-47  ammunition and small token contributions from Malaysia and  Singapore may have been acquired. China may also provide some  equipment.    "We want to start now on Anlung Veng but we are waiting for  ammunition. We don't have enough, we hope we will have ammo in  a few short days," said Gen. Toan Chhay in an interview on Jan.  7.    He is the governor of Siem Reap province and military  commander of the 4th Military Region which is in charge of the  key provinces of Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap and parts  of Oddar Meanchey.    It is here that KR commander Ta Mok, in control of 12  Divisions, has his headquarters. He is said to control at least  3,000 regular troops, plus militia and until recently was based  at Anlung Veng.    Government forces claim to have 16,000 men under arms in  Military Region four.    Gen. Toan Chhay outlined the strategy of the two sides in  the  coming weeks: "As a whole, the KR know we are about to launch  the operation against Anlung Veng for our self-defense. In the  meantime they want to occupy and capture the district at Choam  Khsan in Preah Vihear to set up a bridge from a new headquarters  near the tri-border area.    "Once they capture Choam Khsan, they will launch to capture  the whole of Preah Vihear... We want to attack Anlung Veng so  that they will withdraw their troops, to draw them away from  Siem Reap, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey and Kompong Thom to  defend Anlung Veng. If we leave Anlung Veng intact they will  send their front-line further," he said.    In Battambang province, the other major military theater,  commanders spoke of similar problems.    At the government Division 12 headquarters located along  Route 5 near the Thai border, troops engaged in heavy clashes  after attacking KR positions along Phnum Malai, north of Pailin.  More than 100 people were killed or wounded in the first five  days of the month, according to commanders.    "We do not have enough ammunition. They said, maybe we will  get more this week," said Gen. Em Saray, deputy commander of the  12th Division.    "Our objective is to destroy the 450 Division but it depends  on the weapons supply. Plans for the attack on Pailin are not  clear yet. The general staff in Phnom Penh has not given us a  clear decision yet."    The first week of January also saw significant fighting in  the area between Samraong and the Thai border in northern Oddar  Meanchey province.    KR forces captured the former FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia] military base at Koam Chong and burned at least nine  villages long under FUNCINPEC influence. Government forces  recaptured the base but the "situation is not calm and remains  unclear," said Gen Toan Chay.    However, both government and KR sources say the fighting in  this area reflects ongoing local anger over the government  attack and capture of the KR base at Phnum Chhat last August.  It is not part of the current, centrally coordinated government  offensive.    "It was a big mistake of the government to attack Phnum  Chhat," said a senior government military official who asked to  remain anonymous. "It made the local people very angry, not just  the KR but the villagers."    Phnum Chhat was the headquarters for KR Division 519 and  served as a civilian base for diplomatic and other personnel and  their families.    Perhaps the most important battle theater may be in Preah  Vihear province, which both government and KR sources say will  be a focus of fighting.    Ta Mok has established a new headquarters north of the  border  district of Choam Khsan, after abandoning Anlung Veng in  preparation of the expected government assault.    In an interview on Jan. 7, Preah Vihear governor and  military commander Gen. Mean Sarin said his province was under  daily attack by the KR. He said 500-600 KR have surrounded  Choam Khsan, cut all roads and are "attacking us every day."    He said the morale of the KR troops was strong and they were  well armed. KR reinforcements had been brought from Kompong  Cham, Kompong Thom and Preah Vihear to participate in the  assault.    "The KR really want to fight because they believe in their  leaders. They are not new, but the old cadre," said Gen. Mean  Sarin.    He said 300 KR had defected in his area but they were mainly  recruits from the 1980s.    "The defections reflect their desire for peace. The old  cadre are waiting for orders. Those that have been with the KR  since 1970 are sticking to the position that the winner of the  election should take control of the government according to  international standards," said the general.    "They say that the KR should get 20 percent of the army,  FUNCINPEC 20 percent, CPP [Cambodian People's Party] 20 percent  and the KP [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] 20 percent  while 20 percent should be divided among civilian administration  and state bureaucracy," he added.    Preah Vihear is effectively cut off from government access  by  land, and 300 government soldiers are currently trying to open  up Route 12 from Kompong Thom to Choam Khsan.    Equipped with bulldozers, a single mine detector and earth  moving equipment, the troops are clearing 36 kilometers of  heavily mined road that military commanders say must be opened  within a month to save Preah Vihear from KR capture.    Gen. Toan Chay said: "We are trying to repair Route 12,  otherwise we cannot save Preah Vihear. Our main objective is to  defend Choam Khsan and Preah Vihear, not to capture Anlung Veng."    Gen. Mean Sarin said he has 1,970 soldiers in Preah Vihear  but currently they are lacking food, ammunition, medical  supplies and other necessities.    Government officials say the morale of KR troops remains  high  in the north.    Gen. Toan Chay said: "Morale of their troops is still very  good. They are united to defend themselves. If they are not  united they will die together. In the field they are willing to  achieve the orders from their commanders."    "The KR are very confident," he said. "They are launching a  political campaign designed to hang the government by the throat  economically. They count only on their forces and finally no  one loses, no ones wins. The suffering falls on the whole  country."    "For us to lose is very easy, to win very difficult and to  maintain victory, even more difficult," said the general.    While both sides agree the outcome of the fighting will be  crucial to what is finally decided at the political negotiating  table, it is not likely to deal a mortal blow to the KR  militarily.    The KR are prepared to give up fixed bases and have made  contingencies to revert to guerrilla tactics if they lose their  main rear sanctuaries.    But more importantly, many analysts say the KR threat  remains  primarily a political one. Military assaults can only disperse  them into large tracts of jungles and remote villages that are  virtually impossible for the government to bring under central  control by force.    "Our military attacks are important as a demonstration of  strength," said Gen. Toan Chay. "But it is not as important as  economic development. We can spend millions of dollars on tanks  and artillery to kill ten KR. Why?"    More alarming to many officials in the government controlled  provinces and other observers, is the deteriorating security  because of crime, widespread corruption by military and local  officials, and the difficulty in implementing rural economic  development to improve the lives of the peasantry.    They say the people had unrealistic expectations for change  after the UN operation in Cambodia and the government conduct so  far has done little to engender faith that things will improve  soon.    It is the KR who will reap the political benefit of  continuing popular frustration, they say.    A KR official said: "Politically and in terms of morale,  they  (the government) have no forces in the country side."    "If we didn't have popular strength, they wouldn't even give  us the time of day. But if we are weak militarily, we will  never get anything at the negotiating table. But this is not  about the military it is about politics.    Despite KR confidence that they can withstand a government  assault, people everywhere are afraid of what the faction really  wants and hatred runs deep for the killings and suffering during  the KR years in power.</p>

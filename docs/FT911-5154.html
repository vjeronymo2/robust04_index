			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker shares rise 8p on confirmation of Power deal BRENT WALKER, the heavily-indebted leisure group, yesterday announced the appointment of a new group managing director and confirmed the proposed swap of its stake in the Trocadero leisure development in London's Piccadilly Circus. Brent Walker's shares rose 8p to 71p. However, Brent Walker has yet to detail how the deal will affect its balance sheet. It is likely to result in a substantial reduction in the group's net assets, perhaps by Pounds 100m, and will not of itself reduce debt, although it will remove potential costs involved in developing the Trocadero site. The new managing director is Mr Nicholas Ward, who is 49 and has a reputation for being tough and competent, but has been involved in boardroom rows in the past. His appointment is the final part of the board's reconstruction following the standstill agreement reached between the group and its banks last autumn. Mr Ward was previously chairman and chief executive of Macarthy, the pharmaceutical manufacturer and retailer, but resigned in July 1989 after a boardroom dispute. He is still pursuing Macarthy for compensation, although last August it paid him Pounds 140,000 net of tax as an interim payment. Brent Walker and Power Corporation, the Republic of Ireland-based property developer, have signed a conditional agreement untying the two groups' 50-50 ownership of three properties. The deal will swap Brent Walker's half-shares in the Trocadero and the Tower Shopping Centre in Blackpool, for the half-share Power owns in the Island site, a 1.3-acre site next to the Trocadero. The Island site is thought to be worth about Pounds 70m, but Brent Walker will take about Pounds 60m of debt with it. Mr Robin Power, chairman and chief executive of Power Corporation, said he hoped to finalise the deal by the end of this week or early next. However, Brent Walker's banks have to give consent to the deal, and yesterday were awaiting more detailed information on it. They may take longer to study it. Analysts suggested that Power Corporation appeared to have the better part of the deal, since the Trocadero - which should be producing annual rents of Pounds 16m by the end of this year once completed - and Blackpool properties are potentially more valuable than the Island site. However Brent Walker has a more urgent need for cash than Power, and the Island site, which covers about 40 properties, can be more readily sold. It can demonstrate to its banks, with which it is discussing a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing, that it can make disposals which should more than meet a promise to raise Pounds 50m through asset sales by the end of 1991. Mr Power said the deal would remove a conflict of interest between the two parties, as Brent Walker had been keen to sell the development or properties within it while Power was prepared to hold out for higher prices later on. He said the deal 'suits us and it suits their present position'. Power Corporation plans to keep the 50 per cent stake in the joint venture it is taking from Brent Walker distinct so that it could bring in another partner later.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter European to triple in size Jupiter European Investment Trust has announced plans to raise more than Pounds 41m of new capital through a placing and open offer. This would almost triple the size of the split-capital trust, which was launched in 1990 and has assets of about Pounds 25m. 'We believe the current weakness in European equity markets represents an opportune time to expand significantly JEIT's investment portfolio,' said Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall Group, which manages the trust. The issue will not change the capital structure of the trust, but it will increase the net asset value per ordinary share by 2.7 per cent, and increase the capital cover on zero dividend shares from 1.62 to 1.65. All the 29m new zero dividend shares, at 46 1/2 p, and 29m new ordinary shares, at 92p, have been placed with institutions, but can be recalled to meet demand from existing shareholders in the open offer. The trust is also placing 5.8m new warrants at 52p. At this price, the zero dividend shares have an annualised gross redemption yield of 10 per cent, and the ord-inary shares yield 2.3 per cent. Existing shareholders and warrant holders are being offered new shares in the ratio of 1.3 new ordinary shares for each ordinary share held, 1.3 zero dividend shares for each zero held, and 1.3 ordinary shares and 1.3 zero dividend shares for each warrant held. The open offer closes on September 16, and a meeting to approve the proposals will be held on September 19. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, recently joined the board of Jupiter European as a non-executive director. He is also on the boards of two other investment trusts managed by Jupiter Tyndall.</p>

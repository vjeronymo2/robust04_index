			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F> by Philippe Lemaitre and Claire Trean; place and date not given:  "An Interview With Jacques Delors"]    [Text] [LE MONDE] Do you think the European stakes are  clear for the French people?    [Delors] It is in partly inevitable that national stakes  should overlap European issues. It is true that in France this  is more marked than elsewhere. We also get the impression that  those people who are called pro-Europeans are afraid to come out  firmly in favor of their convictions. Nothing is perfect in the  process of European construction, but we could have hoped that  these people would at least say what should be done to improve  the situation. When you listen to all sides, you get the  feeling that the situation is totally unsatisfactory.    [LE MONDE] Do you not see a decline in the popularity of  European construction?    [Delors] Our opinion polls show that there is no longer the  euphoric feeling that marked the period 1988-1990. However, we  have not returned either to the feeling of indifference that  characterized the years before 1985, that is before I took over  at the Commission. Opinion is still very much in favor of a  united Europe, but a number of factors conspire to make the  expression of this opinion less wholesale and not quite as  enthusiastic.    [LE MONDE] The enlargement of the Union requires  institutional reform. The French side seems convinced that this  reform will be done at the expense of the little countries and  the Commission. Is there an alternative way?    [Delors] The fathers of the Treaty of Rome wanted to give  the  European Community institutions that would enable it to make  decisions in due course and to act efficiently.    In this spirit, everyone sees the European Commission as  playing an essential role as a source of innovation,  guaranteeing continuity and respect for the rules. If tomorrow  we decided to change this institutional logic, we would run the  risk of paralysis. The protagonists of the French campaign have  decided to make the Commission a scapegoat charged with  irresponsibility.    The truth is that the European Commission is answerable to  the European Parliament which may censure it at any time.  Moreover, in July 1993, I was asked to see out a 5th term of  office of two years, and Parliament voted me in with an almost  90 percent majority. No one ever remembers that in the debate.  Of course, the operation of the institutions can be improved,  but the problem is set out badly.    [LE MONDE] What of the little countries in an enlarged  Europe?    [Delors] To date we have been able to work in the Community  on the principle that no country, even the smallest, should be  placed in difficulty when a vital interest is at stake. It is  clear that, in a community with 25 or 30 members, this unwritten  law may be more difficult to apply. Judge for yourself the gap  between Germany on the one hand, with 80 million inhabitants,  and countries like Malta and Cyprus on the other. Consequently,  from this point of view, we have to think about a system that  makes it possible to take into account specific national  characteristics and which, at the same time, transcends these  whenever we manage to identify a common interest. We will have  to break new ground.    [LE MONDE] Do you like the idea of a President of Europe?    [Delors] The European Union needs an injection of  personality. For the time being, even if I do not have the  powers, in the eyes of some people I am the one who fills this  role. In a European Union it would be useful if the European  Council elected, every two and one-half years (twice in the life  time of a European Parliament), someone who would be charged  with representing the European Union, flanked by two vice  presidents appointed in turn from all the member states. The  issue is whether this president should at the same time head the  European Commission.    The second argument in favor of this solution is that of  continuity, especially where foreign policy is concerned. It is  important for the United States, Japan and the continents of  Asia, Latin America, and Africa to be able to deal with one  person representing the position of the European Union for a  relatively long period of time (flanked by two revolving vice  presidents -- one from a "big" country and one from a "small"  country).    [LE MONDE] Let us turn to a debate that has recently  developed in France: Do you think Europe should demand the  lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo?    [Delors] Let me remind you what, as long ago as 1992, I  told the European Parliament -- a statement for which I was  reproached because it exceeded my prerogatives. I condemned the  ideology of ethnic cleansing. I added that, unless there was a  credible threat of an armed intervention, the bearers of this  ideology would not stop. Unfortunately, what I said has been  borne out by subsequent events. Now it seems to me that, if we  lifted the embargo, we would risk becoming embroiled in an  unending war which would extend to other countries or end in the  defeat of our Bosnian friends, given the reserve potential of  the Serbian Army.    This is why I rally the praiseworthy and committed efforts  of  France -- in particular, Francois Mitterrand and Alain Juppe --  to try and bring all the belligerents back around the  negotiating table on the basis of the European Union's plan  which could be slightly reworked. However, there is one  condition for this -- that the agreement that could be found in  no way sanctions the ideological victory of those who reject the  other protagonist to point of killing him. Thus, we need to  increase the pressure we are putting on the Serbs. Politics is  the art of choosing, at any time, the "least unfavorable"  solution. I am not proud to have to say that, but I do not have  the right to avoid your question. I should add that the  intellectuals are only playing their role by questioning the  politicians.    [LE MONDE] Do you think that the discredit which has been  heaped on the Twelve's ambition to create a joint foreign policy  can be repaired?    [Delors] It will be hard to repair this damage in the coming  months, even assuming that we do manage to arrive at a peaceful  solution imposed more by reason than what we feel in our hearts.  In the Yugoslav tragedy I see the proof that Europe does not  exist as a prime mover in foreign policy. What I would like is  for the Twelve to decide on and carry through three or four  joint foreign policy missions, where each country indisputably  has the same interests at heart.    You will notice that I am not talking about a joint foreign  policy, but joint foreign policy action. I have never thought  that our countries, given their traditions, interests, and  geopolitical situations, could share a complete joint foreign  policy.    [LE MONDE] Let us return to the campaign in France. The  candidates have no consideration for the Community institutions.  In an interview on 19 April, [Socialist Party Chairman] Michel  Rocard condemned "a European organization which bans the hunting  of woodpigeons in the south of France but which is unable to ban  the hunting of Muslims in the east of Bosnia." Dominique Baudis  said much the same thing the very same day. How do you react to  this kind of generalization?    [Delors] It dismays me to hear such untruths. I have already  spoken about Bosnia. Let us talk about the woodpigeon issue.  In 1979, the member states of the Community unanimously agreed  to adopt a directive for the protection of wild birds --  especially migrating birds, and thus woodpigeons -- which are  part of our common heritage since they fly across Europe. The  principle is a simple one: We put a ban on their hunting while  they are on the way back to their nesting grounds to protect the  species. The dates the hunting season opens and closes were  left up to each state to decide. That is the reality of the  situation. The Commission strives in this area, as in others,  to leave the final decision to the states, or even the regions,  since they alone can judge the situation since they are closest  to the areas in question.    [LE MONDE] People no longer seem to believe that Europe is  capable of eliminating unemployment. Does the white paper you  produced on the subject guarantee at least some concrete results?    [Delors] Unemployment is a European disease, and I have  drawn the attention of the heads of state and government on this  issue. From 1970 to 1990, the United States created 29 million  new jobs, while Japan created 12 million new jobs, and we  managed 9 million. Incidentally, these 9 million new jobs were  created between 1985 and 1991, thanks to the relaunching of the  process of European construction aiming at the single market.  After that, I asked myself: Were these years just a slight  upturn, the swan song of a Europe in decline, or was what  happened a good omen for the future? The answers to this  question can be found in the white paper. These answers are  encouraging. The decline and the situation of mass unemployment  were not predestined.    In this white paper we did not ask for extra powers for the  Community. We said what we think should be done on the European  level in the framework of our current powers (deepening the  internal market, developing infrastructures, setting up an  information society, and the necessary growth in investment and  development research). We also said that at the national level  there is much to be done for everything impacting on employment  (education, training, work organization in companies, the  operation of the labor market, unemployment benefit, etc.). In  the light of national debates and the measures that have been  taken, it is clear that the Europeans have decided to push for  recovery.    [LE MONDE] So what concrete results are you expecting?    [Delors] At the next European Council in Corfu, I expect the  following decisions to be made: Firstly, the adoption of an  initial list of infrastructure projects and the means of funding  them. In this way these projects will be able to get under way  by the end of the year and provide support for the upcoming  economic recovery while at the same time laying the foundation  for more competitive structures and better town and country  planning in Europe.    Secondly, I expect to see confirmation that my intuition was  right as far as the information society is concerned, that this  is a veritable revolution and that we must quickly equip  ourselves with the means to ensure that Europe is present in  this area. Thirdly, I expect us to continue exchanging  information and innovation regarding everything that makes it  possible to create new jobs. Moreover, I am currently working on  new sources of jobs. Indeed, it is quite wrong to say that our  societies will suffer from a lack of work and hence a shortage  of jobs on offer.    [LE MONDE] The issue of Europe's borders has not really been  debated by the Twelve so far. Do you have a conception of the  limits of a greater Europe?    [Delors] I think that the limits of the greater Europe lie  at  the borders of the former Soviet Union. This means that Poland,  the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Cyprus, and Malta  -- not to mention the three Baltic states -- could all belong to  the greater Europe. In addition, if peace returns to the former  Yugoslavia, why not include Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, and what  will have become of the Serbian-Montenegro union after a lot of  water has flowed under the bridge and the ideology of ethnic  cleansing has been eradicated.    I say this to illustrate the scope of the political and  institutional problems you mentioned a little while ago. The  other difficulty is that Russia is not enthusiastic about the  idea of a greater European Union. We will only be able to build  up this greater Europe if we offer Russia a very close  partnership in the political and economic arenas, if we  recognize Russia as a major power, and if we help it solve the  problems arising in the former Soviet Union, especially in  Ukraine. Hence the association agreements to be signed with  Russia and Ukraine; hence our action to avoid the nuclear risk,  especially in Chernobyl.    [LE MONDE] You mentioned the institutional difficulties  encountered in creating a greater Europe, but there are also  economic difficulties. In France, the leaders of the two main  lists are in favor of enlargement, but they never say anything  about either the agricultural problems or the budget problems  that this enlargement entails.    [Delors] They are indeed very vague in what they say. That  is also true for those who call the pro-Europeans a "club of the  rich" without once mentioning the economic consequences and  institutional structures of a greater Europe. The Commission is  prepared to discuss these matters, whether it involves  increasing the Community budget and the contributions of each  participant, pursuing the basic objectives of the common  agricultural policy, or the undoubtedly positive impact on  economic growth and job creation. It is prepared to do this in  liaison with the countries of East Europe, which have great  needs to be met.    I would add that, as a citizen, I am prepared to bear the  costs of a greater Europe geared toward peace and solidarity, by  paying a bit more in taxes. But who talks about that?    [LE MONDE] What is your response to people who are worried  about Germany's new influence since its reunification, or when  faced with the prospect of an enlargement of the Union to the  north and east?    [Delors] I would reply: Do we have a choice? If we feel  that Germany is drifting toward other horizons and if we  precipitate this drift by turning our backs on European  integration, what will happen to us? If someone says to me, and  rightly so, that Germany will be strong -- and it will be,  because right now it is making considerable efforts at economic  restructuring which few people in France are aware of -- well  then I would reply that France must make the same effort, with  or without European integration.    The most terrible and scandalous thing in the tale which  certain candidates are spinning for the French people is that  they are blaming Europe for changes in the world. The reality  is that the world is changing for the better, and also for the  worse. This can be seen in the new dangers which are appearing:  ideologies based on rejecting others; confusion between faith  and politics; fundamentalism; hypernationalism; etc. European  integration is the only instrument that can enable us to  confront this new world full of both danger and promise.    [LE MONDE] Since the storm of August 1993, the European  Monetary System has been going rather well and the Member States  are following a policy of tight convergence. However, if new  difficulties were to emerge on the foreign exchange market,  would the system be able to withstand attacks by speculators?    [Delors] I have noticed that operators on the foreign  exchange market are talking increasingly of the prospect of  economic and monetary union. In addition to that, there is the  economic recovery, which will come about without aggravating  imbalances or inflation. Economic and monetary union has  regained credibility, and it must once again be considered a  substantial element in a strategy aimed at promoting the concept  of Europe. That is an encouraging observation.    [LE MONDE] In the debate on Maastricht, certain people  ([right-wing deputy] Philippe Seguin and [former Socialist  Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement) wondered whether  Europe's economic policy did not pose a genuine danger to  growth. Is this still a valid question?    [Delors] Now that is a question. So far, we have based our  thinking on the following experience: Those countries which had  a stable currency have performed better in terms of economic  growth and job creation than the other countries. However, even  if that provides ammunition in favor of economic and monetary  union, it is not enough. I am continuing to fight those who  would reduce economic policy down to a strong currency and norms  on budgetary balance. I feel that economic policy is more  complex, that during slumps we have to accept a budget deficit,  and that it is not a bad thing to go into debt in order to  finance investments that will benefit future generations.    It is my conviction that Europe will keep its model of  society, while at the same time adapting to new situations, and  that it will forge an original path of development which  respects people's time and the environment. This Europe will  keep its radiant personality enriched by its national and local  diversity. In this Europe, our country -- France -- will have  its own sizeable space for itself. Let us not be overcautious!</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Dinkins threatens to put out NY's lights LIGHTS may soon be going out all over New York - literally - as the City confronts its worst financial crisis in 15 years. Mayor David Dinkins, in a sober television address on Wednesday night, said one in four of New York's 295,000 street lamps would have to be switched off to save money unless all the city's inhabitants, together with the New York state government, joined forces to help bridge the city's huge budget deficit. Other cuts foreshadowed by the mayor included the lay-off of 20,000 city workers and cuts in numerous socially progressive programmes, including the closure of several shelters for the homeless and the suspension for a year of a scheme to recycle domestic garbage. Even more galling for the city's first black mayor, who dedicated his administration to New York's children, was a threat to shut the zoo in Central Park, visited by nearly 900,000 people a year, indefinitely and not open this summer the City's outdoor swimming pools, which are used by 1m people a year. There may be an element of bluff about some items on the mayor's list, but there is no doubting the severity of the financial crisis facing the city, already weighed down with some of the worst urban social and infrastructural problems in the US. For the fiscal year beginning on July 1, the city faces a budget gap of more than Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.1bn) and is seeking help from both the state government and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state body set up to borrow on behalf of the city during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. Mr Dinkins also wants the city council to approve Dollars 1bn in higher taxes and its labour unions to agree to wage concessions. After calling interested parties to a crisis meeting last weekend, Mr Dinkins took his message straight to the people with Wednesday night's television broadcast, declaring: 'The choices before us are clear. We can act together, making sacrifices and sharing the burden for the good of this city, or we can go forward with some of the most difficult, painful budget cuts that our city has had to confront.' Behind the current problems lie a severe recession in the regional economy, including drastic lay-offs on Wall Street over the past two years and a property market slump. But while the administration inherited many of the problems, the mayor has been criticised for dithering and sending out confusing signals about the severity of the crisis. Critics said Mr Dinkin's speech did little to address the long-term financial problems facing the city, and the danger that a deteriorating infrastructure, high crime rate and high costs will continue the drain of business from the area.</p>

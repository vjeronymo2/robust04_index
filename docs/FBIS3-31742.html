I do not want to stress the almost nine-page  long text in which the Presidency's spokesman Traian Chebeleu  finally fulfills one of his presumed duties: to be a man.  However, I would like to remark that, after a quick glance at  the text, I felt a certain exaggeration of the situation.  Traian Chebeleu takes Corneliu Vadim Tudor's attack as a real  classical tragedy. The ambassador appears before the broad  public with a more disheveled face than Antigone. At one point,  he reaches a stage when he apologizes to his family, relatives,  and to his female and male colleagues with whom he used to work  together. It is clear that he is moved by the flow of insults  and calumnies that fell on his head. We would sympathize with  him, cry together with him, and blow each other's noses, if the  following problem did not crop up. For over two years several  public figures in today's Romania, among them myself, have been  defamed week after week by Corneliu Vadim Tudor. This  pocket-size Zhirinovskiy however is the creation of President  Ion Iliescu. Thanks to the president he revived from the  political and journalistic death to which the 1989 revolution  condemned him. Thanks to Ion Iliescu he won in the elections.  Thanks to Ion Iliescu the legal bodies have not given justice  to any of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's victims. Not even in the case  that is crying to heaven through its clarity, namely the case of  the former prosecutor general, Gheorghe Robu. How can the legal  bodies start acting against Corneliu Vadim Tudor when he is the  leader of a party that is allied with Ion Iliescu?! All this  time, President Ion Iliescu has not made one single move that  might indicate a break with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Ion Iliescu  was happily rubbing his hands every time the PRM [Greater  Romania Party] leader was slandering his political adversaries.  He accepted that the PRM senator should jump to his help with  his journalistic filth every time a journalist or a politician  dared to remark that the president also makes mistakes  sometimes. This discreet complicity gave Corneliu Vadim Tudor  the enthusiasm to do what he wants in political life and in the  field of journalism. And now, when the wave of filth is turning  against his collaborators, the president, through Traian  Chebeleu, shows signs of unrest. Thus, no matter how much our  souls would wish to deplore the presidency's spokesman, we can  say nothing else except that his tragic posture is ridiculous.  Just as ridiculous as the letter of solidarity addressed to  Chebeleu by Adrian Nastase. As far as I know, Adrian Nastase is  the leader of a party [PDSR -- Social Democracy Party of  Romania] that is allied with the PRM. He was, until recently,  in close unity of ideas and feelings with Corneliu Vadim Tudor.  Now, when one of the president's men is attacked, he sends that  person a letter of solidarity. We would have expected something  else from the man called Adrian Nastase. For example, we would  have expected the radical move of a political breakup with the  PRM. However, such a move involves certain risks, for example  to lose the support granted to the PDSR by the PRM. How can  Adrian Nastase assume such a risk? It is much more comfortable  and cozy to send a letter of solidarity to Traian Chebeleu. I  would have not written about the answer of the Presidency's  spokesman if, in the end of his humdrum, he had not referred to  my person and to the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI publication. Suddenly,  sliding into the tricky field of psychology, Mr. Traian Chebeleu  assumes that I have a spiritual impulse. Namely, that allegedly  I have reproduced "with an undisguised pleasure" the insults and  objectionable expressions used by Corneliu Vadim Tudor, in the  several hundred thousand issues of the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily.  Traian Chebeleu is just as poor a psychologist as a politician.  The president's spokesman did not understand anything of our  journalistic action. If the insult "oral sex" had been  formulated by just any journalist, I would not have noticed it.  As I have often mentioned in the columns of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI,  the incredible insult belongs not to any journalist but a  political figure, namely the leader of a party, moreover, who,  through the goodwill of the PDSR, is also secretary of the  Senate. More than that, taking into consideration the  negotiations of the PDSR with its left-oriented allies, starting  1 March this person might become a minister. Both through the  information published, as well as through my editorials I have  drawn attention to the fact that we are facing an incredible  case of degradation of Romanian political life. We have not  simply reproduced Corneliu Vadim Tudor's despicable words, but  published an information about an unusual event. Through this  fact we warned not only about the hole into which Romanian  political life might fall, but also about the idiotic things  that Corneliu Vadim Tudor might commit once he gets to power.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER CAPITAL GAINS  </P> <P> The Democrats have lost the last two presidential elections because they have  lost touch with those whose votes they need to win an election (the  middle-class American.)  </P> <P> The Democrats presently are against a proposed reduction in the capital gains  tax as it will only benefit the rich and the upper class. Why don't the  Democrats propose a reduction in the capital gains tax that will benefit most  Americans in one way or another? Why not treat interest income as capital gains  and then the reduction in the capital gains tax will affect every American who  has money in a bank account, etc?  </P> <P> I see no reason why a person, rich or poor, should be penalized for saving  money and have to pay a high rate of tax on the low rate of interest earned on  the money. One reason that Americans do not save money is they earn 6% to 9%  interest and after taxes their return is from 4% to 6%. When Americans do not  save money, we then have to keep our interest rates high so that foreigners  will deposit money in our financial institutions and purchase T-bills, etc.  Therefore, if we can encourage saving by lowering the tax rate on interest  income (by considering it a capital gain) we may also very well lower the  interest rate we have to pay to borrow money.  </P> <P> ORRIN H.

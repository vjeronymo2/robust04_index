			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Pledge by Major on Brussels powers A CAMPAIGN to roll back 'unnecessary regulation' by Brussels was yesterday promised by Mr John Major as he set out his priorities for Britain's presidency of the European Community in the second half of this year. In a speech to the Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce, the prime minister promised to work unceasingly for a wider Europe that would embrace the emerging democracies of eastern Europe. His appearance in Scotland marked the first in a post-election series of visits to fulfil a pledge to make government from Westminster less remote from the people of Scotland. While reiterating his promise to 'take stock' of the pressures in Scotland for more self-government, he reaffirmed his absolute opposition to legislative devolution. Attacking the 'narrow nationalism' of the Scottish National party, he warned that devolution would be a 'step half-way across a chasm'. He linked Scotland's past and future prosperity to the role that Britain played in the EC. Separation would relegate Scotland from the heart of Europe to, at best, its outer fringe, depriving it of investment and influence. Mr Major, who used a trip to central Europe last to back the claims of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary for EC membership, said that a wider Europe was vital to the peace and prosperity of Europe. 'It is not an optional extra.' He insisted that the government would not be content with arguing its corner defensively in the Community but would set out its own vision of the future. Britain would take as its starting point that the cardinal principle of the Community must be the free market. It would use its presidency to ensure that the single market was completed and then move on to try to limit the burdens the EC placed on business.</p>

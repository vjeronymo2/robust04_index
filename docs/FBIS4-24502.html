			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Niger President Mahamane  Ousmane is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Thursday [2 June]  for a six-day visit, Foreign Ministry officials said Monday.    President Li Teng-hui and ranking government officials will  greet Ousmane and his wife at Chiang Kai-shek International  Airport.    With a land area of some 1.27 million square kilometers,  Niger is the largest among the 29 countries with which Taiwan  maintains official relations. It is rich in uranium deposits,  and is one of the few countries in Africa that has a  self-sufficient economy.    Osmane, who won Niger's first popular presidential election  in March 1993, will sign a joint communique with President Li  reaffirming Niger's support for Taiwan's bid to join the United  Nations.    The Republic of China [ROC] first set up diplomatic  relations  with Niger in 1963. But ties were suspended for 11 years after  Niger recognized Mainland China in July 1974. The two nations  re- established formal ties in 1992.    An agricultural cooperation program that calls for Taiwan to  help Niger grow rice is expected to be finalized during  President Ousmane's visit.    Accompanying Ousmane in his first Taiwan trip will be Niger  Foreign and Cooperation Minister Abdourahmane Hama, and Trade,  Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdoulaye Souley.</p>

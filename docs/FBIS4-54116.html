			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Kim Chung-il] </F>   [Text] On the basis of its judgment that the construction  of nuclear waste storage sites--whose selection has been delayed  because of opposition by local residents--can no longer be  postponed, the government has planned to decide on candidate  sites during the latter half of this year before beginning  construction next year.    One high-level government official said on 22 May: "In  connection with the selection of sites, the government has thus  far conducted public relations activities for local residents  with a view to pushing ahead with construction, on a priority  basis, with the consent of those residents who want to have such  a site built in their area. But, as seen in the large-scale  demonstrations in Yangsan County, South Kyongsang Province, we  have come to judge that the beginning of construction based on  residents' consent is realistically impossible. In this regard,  the government will make public its selection of sites during  the latter half of this year before beginning construction early  next year."    The same official added that in order to minimize residents'  backlash against the selection of sites, the government has been  trying to provide support for regional development  plans--including projects whose materialization the residents  have long aspired for their own areas' benefit--and to legislate  relevant enforcement ordinances for guaranteeing jobs for the  residents' livelihood, saying that all these government efforts  are now at a final stage. He made clear the policy of pushing  ahead with construction by saying: "Despite some residents'  opposition, we will have no choice but to carry through the  construction even by exercising government power."    He continued to say: "At the moment, nuclear waste coming  from atomic power plants is being stored at the individual  plants. But, it will reach a saturation point in 1999. It  takes at least five to seven years to build a nuclear waste  storage site. Therefore, it is a pressing question for us to  begin construction early next year after making a final decision  on construction sites within this year at the latest."    It has been learned that at present the government is  searching for candidate sites among six areas, such as Anmyon  Island, South Chungchong Province; Uljin and Yongil, North  Kyongsang Province; Changhung, South Cholla Province; Kosong,  Kangwon Province; and Yangsan, South Kyongsang Province--the  sites a research team of Seoul National University has  proposed--and among the areas where the existing atomic power  plants are located.    Since the residents in the Yangsan area near the Kori Atomic  Power Plant showed an interest in having such a site built in  their area, the government has conducted public relations  activities for them. But, in spite of the fact that more than  80 percent of the area's residents have consented to having such  a site built in their area, there have been demonstrations  staged by some residents and outside forces such as  environmental organizations. As a result, the government  officially expressed its stance of giving up the construction of  a site in that area on 22 May.</p>

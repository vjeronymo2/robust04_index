			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bank Holding Company Reports Loss: West Coast Bancorp, a multibank holding  company that owns Sunwest Bank of Tustin, posted a third-quarter loss of  $904,000, negating its profits for the year and leaving it $197,000 in the red  for the first nine months. The loss was a result of a decision by the company  to add $3.6 million to its reserves against the possibility of loan losses in  the future, said John B. Joseph, chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> Last year, West Coast reported earnings of $761,000 for the third quarter and  earnings of $1.4 million for the nine months. It had $474.2 million in assets  at the end of September, contrasted with $468.5 million a year earlier. Much of  the third quarter was related to loans made by West Coast Realty Finance, a  mortgage lender that ceased operations in April, when the market for home loans  dried up.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TR Euro Growth launches issue TR European Growth Trust, a specialist smaller companies investment trust, is planning to raise new capital through a conversion share issue. The trust currently has assets of about Pounds 73m. The C share issue is understood to be likely to increase that by at least one third, but if demand is there, the trust's size could double. TR European Growth invests mainly in quoted companies capitalised at less than Pounds 200m, though it also has a small portfolio of unquoted companies, particularly ones which are likely to seek a listing in the future. The company said there were clear signs of recovery in smaller company share prices, a feeling which appeared to be shared by other fund managers. The non-UK smaller companies investment trust area is highly active at the moment, with the launch of the Piper European Smaller Companies Trust and the Govett Global Smaller Companies Trust, and another C share issue under way from Fleming European Fledgeling. 'We feel very strongly that the European story is something that is going to go through over the next couple of years, and smaller companies are going to out-perform the bigger ones,' said Mr James de Sausmarez, managing director of Hen-derson Touche Remnant Investment Trust Management. TR European Growth's net asset value grew by 31 per cent to 154.3p (99.2p) per ordinary share over the half year to December 31. Earnings per share were up 66 per cent to 1.01p (0.61p). The trust pays a single dividend at the year end.</p>

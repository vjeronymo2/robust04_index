			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Visit lifts hopes on Malaysia trade ban There is speculation that a Malaysian ban on giving government contracts to British companies might be lifted soon following a surprise visit to Malaysia by Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, Kieran Cooke writes. Mr Needham arrived yesterday and was scheduled to have a meeting with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Mr Needham said he was carrying a letter from Mr John Major to Dr Mahathir and expressed the hope that the ban would be lifted soon. He added: 'We have so many things to do in common, not only in business but in education, health care and so on.' Malaysia imposed its ban at the end of February after critical comments about the government in the British press. In particular Kuala Lumpur reacted angrily to a report in The Sunday Times which alleged that a British company was prepared to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir in exchange for a contract. The ban is believed to have cost British companies many millions of pounds of business. Mr Needham has been among the more vocal critics of what he has considered to be irresponsible reporting about Malaysia in the British media.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT: REMODELED KITCHEN IS HOME'S 'THEME' ROOM  </P> <P> Architect R. Mark Fuote of Arkineto Architects, Venice, calls the kitchen in  the Hamaguchi house on the Westside the "theme" room of the much-remodeled  structure.  </P> <P> Fuote designed the kitchen to be the focal point of the extensive interior  remodeling (all he'll say is it cost more than $100,000) job he designed for  the house on a quiet street between busy Sunset and San Vicente boulevards.  </P> <P> All of the original 1940s-style cabinets and the sink were removed and  custom-design, white-painted cabinets were installed, along with granite  counter tops. The European-look cabinets were built by Mike Beeman of M &amp; B  Cabinets, Santa Fe Springs -- a craftsman whose workmanship meets Fuote's  demanding standards. (The Miami-born architect studied and/or practiced  architecture in Italy, West Germany and England.)  </P> <P> In keeping with the function of the kitchen as a focal point of the house,  computer desks and a peninsula base cabinet were part of the built-in cabinets,  along with a dining banquette. This kitchen brings to mind the real "country  kitchens" of the Midwest, along with the sophistication that one would expect  of the Westside.  </P> <P> Another feature of the kitchen that takes it far beyond the ordinary is a  spectacular curved three-dimensional ceiling plan with three plastic skylights  at the apex 20 feet above the floor. Still more light is funneled into the room  through a greenhouse window behind the sinks.  </P> <P> Fuote insists on custom-designed greenhouse windows, skylights and cabinets for  a job of this magnitude: "All too many remodels have the appearance of being  put together from stock units purchased at a home center and thrown together in  an ad hoc manner."  </P> <P> A large bathroom that served the downstairs bedrooms was gutted and turned into  a modern bathroom and powder room, occupying the same space. A housekeeper's  room and bath was added to the rear of the house, blending in with the previous  exterior expansion and remodeling, which was designed by another architect.  </P></p>

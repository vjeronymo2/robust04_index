The talks  focussed on Georgia's request to despatch U.N. peacekeeping  forces to Abkhazia and prospects for widenning U.S. aid to  Tbilisi. At the end of the talks the two leaders signed a  declaration of principles of relations, and also an agreement on  mutual encouragement and protection to investments.    During the meeting President Clinton said that the United  States decisively supports chairman Shevardnadze and the  territorial integrity of Georgia. He mentioned difficult times  which Georgia is living through and expressed belief that the  Georgian people will overcome hardships and build a calmer and  more flourishing future. He assured the guest that if the  Georgian-Abkhazian talks crown with a durable political  settlement, the united states will be inclined to support a U.N.  peacemaking operation in Georgia. However, the U.S. President  added that the American armed forces must not participate in it.    The U.S. President noted that his country intends to render  humanitarian aid worth 70 million dollars. We affirm our  readiness to broaden economic and technical assistance to  Georgia while it keeps moving towards peace, Clinton said.    "Georgia, like other states of the former Soviet Union,  needs  foreign aid," in turn, Shevadnadze said. "Without Western  assistance we cannot succeed in the transition towards democracy  and a free market economy... Georgia supports the 'partnership  for peace' programme put forward by Bill Clinton, and hopes to  take an active part in implementing it. I have appraised the  president of our approach towards finding a solution to the  Abkhazian conflict, and intend to furnish our stand on this  problem in detail during the U.N. Security Council session on  this problem to be held on march 9," Shevardnadze said.    "During the talks we also discussed events in Russia. I  spoke in favour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the  policy he is conducting. We exchanged assessments of tendencies  of the develoment of the situation in russia. We share an  interest in strengthening democracy in Russia. Events in moscow  will inevitably have great affect on contiguous countries,"  Shevardnadze emphasised.    The Georgian head of state began the official part of his  visit with an address to the U.S. government corporation of  private capital investments abroad. "We are in a desperate  state," he said addressing representatives of the American  business world. "The country is on the verge of hunger. If no  U.S. aid had arrived, we would have been facing hunger in its  true sense," Shevardnadze said. He called on American  entrepreneurs to broaden the volume of capital investments in  the Georgian economy, assuring that the maximum possible  favourable conditions will be for them in Georgia. "A turning  point will come in two-three years. I would not have come here,  if I were not absolutely confident that Georgia's transition  towards a free market economy and democracy is irreversible,"  the Georgian head of state noted.    The same day Shevardnadze visited the Pentagon, where he  held  talks with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalkashvili. At the end of the  meeting the two sides signed a memorandum of cooperation between  the two countries in the military sphere.    On Monday Shevardnadze also held a meeting with director of  the U.S. Agency for International Development Brian Atwood.  They discussed questions concerning the implementation of the  U.S. Programme of techinal and economic aid to Georgia through  channels of this federal department.</p>

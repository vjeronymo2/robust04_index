			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / BR wins deal for shake-up on bargaining AFTER A year of intense but largely invisible, negotiation, British Rail has won union agreement to abandon one of the most antique pieces of industrial relations machinery - the 75-year-old Railway Staffs National Council. That body, to which the most trivial disciplinary case could, theoretically, be referred is being replaced with bargaining machinery based on BR's five businesses and 30 profit centres. At the top will be a Railway Joint Council, its remit restricted to pay and basic conditions of employment for the 116,000 employees covered by collective bargaining. At the business councils, more detailed matters such as grading will be discussed, and at the profit centre councils almost everything else. Crucially for BR, there will be no 'reference up' from one level to the higher level, although local disputes can be referred to the profit centre councils. Individual grievances have been removed from the collective bargaining machinery altogether. Mr Gareth Hadley, BR's group employee relations manager, said the changes were not merely a response to BR's more devolved structure and future franchise-based system. 'Regardless of the current changes, we wanted to do things in a different way with decision-making at the lowest possible level and individual matters separated from the collective,' he said. The unions, particularly the main rail union RMT, have been suspicious of the potential 'fragmentation' of union power, and the RMT executive voted by only a slender majority to accept. A similar attempt to change the bargaining machinery lay behind the rail strike of 1989. The unions remain concerned about arrangements for promotion and transfer across businesses, but Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT, said: 'We have achieved our objectives within a trade union framework and with the BR board committed to encouraging employees to join a union.' The unions also say they have won improvements on earlier drafts of the plan. THE government will be ready to award cash grants for big rail projects as part of its plans for rail privatisation, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes. That is a significant departure from previous policy. So far, British Rail has had to finance all its investment from revenues and loans. Grants have been available only for loss-making commuter services and branch lines. Speaking to business people in Aberdeen, Mr MacGregor said the track-owning part of BR would have to fund most of its investment from charges to train operators. Where projects would not earn returns large enough to justify investment, the government would consider direct grants if the project yielded wider benefits, such as relief of road congestion.</p>

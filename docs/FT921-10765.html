			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Chubb scores Dollars 552m profit CHUBB, the US property-casualty insurer, made a Dollars 552m profit after tax last year, up from Dollars 522.1m in 1990. The results were scored after net investment gains of Dollars 43.4m, compared with Dollars 30.2m a year ago, writes Nikki Tait in New York. Underwriting profits in the property-casualty business eased from Dollars 20.7m to Dollars 18.6m, but the previous year's results were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.</p>

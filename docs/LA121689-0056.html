			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAN GETS 3 YEARS ON PROBATION FOR THREATENING STAR  </P> <P> A Westlake Village shipping clerk who in a year's time sent nearly 6,000  threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox was sentenced to three years  probation Friday after she pleaded guilty to three counts of making terrorist  threats.  </P> <P> Tina Marie Ledbetter, 27, was ordered to receive psychiatric therapy and to  stay away from Fox, his wife, actress Tracy Pollan, and the couple's young  child.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan J. Gruber said Ledbetter could face a maximum jail  term of four years and four months if she violates the terms of the plea  bargain, which was entered in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> Gruber said she believed the nine months of jail time that Ledbetter has  already served "got her attention" and may deter her from repeating her threats  to kill Fox or his family members.  </P> <P> Ledbetter told investigators that she hated Pollan and was furious when Fox  married her.  </P> <P> The expletive-filled letters, written in capital letters and punctuated with  strings of exclamation points, began arriving in February, 1988, at a rate  averaging 15 per day. When she was arrested a year later, after two boxes of  rabbit feces sent to Fox were traced to her home, investigators found numerous  threatening letters ready to be sent.  </P> <P> During the trial, Fox testified that he took the threats seriously and that  they "changed my life style extensively." Fox hired a security agency, arranged  for extra security on the set and said Pollan traveled under a false name  before Ledbetter's arrest.  </P> <P> "She has a lot to lose if she violates her probation," Gruber said of  Ledbetter. "The time in custody has served as a potential rehabilitation, as  far as her understanding of the nature and consequences of her crime."  </P> <P> Ledbetter, who had never lived apart from her mother before being taken into  custody last February and held without bail in the psychiatric unit of the  Sybil Brand Institute for Women, was to be released either Friday or today, as  soon as the necessary documents could be processed.  </P> <P> She was among the first individuals to be prosecuted under a law that makes  verbal threats a crime, regardless of the person's intent to carry them out.  The law was designed originally to be a tool to stop gang intimidation of  witnesses.  </P> <P> Gruber acknowledged concern that Ledbetter might once again pose a threat to  Fox. But, she said, "it is hard to predict future dangerousness and Miss  Ledbetter has not been a physical aggressor."  </P> <P> According to Gruber, Fox agreed that Ledbetter's sentence was appropriate.  </P> <P> "I hope we have a handle on her now, and we will closely supervise and monitor  her to make sure she is no longer a threat to them or to herself," Gruber said.  </P></p>

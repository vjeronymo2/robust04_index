			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: One-off charges drag down results at Boral The acquisition of Sagasco and good results from its core Australian operations helped Boral, the Australian energy and building products group, to a 34.7 per cent increase in profits to ADollars 280.9m (USDollars 207.7m), after tax but before abnormal items, in the year to end-June. Earnings per share, again before abnormal items, were up by 28.6 per cent to 28.3 cents. Sales rose by 10.2 per cent to ADollars 4.65bn. Large abnormal items severely depressed the bottom-line performance, causing Boral to post profits after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 121.8m, down from ADollars 228.9m a year ago. The net abnormal items charge was ADollars 159.1m, including a ADollars 121.3m profit on the sale of the Azon businesses, a ADollars 108.8m write-off of goodwill, and a ADollars 140.1m provision for rationalisation and restructuring costs. The abnormal charge means that Boral is dipping into its reserves to pay a dividend of 20 cents a share for the year, with the final being an unchanged 10 cents as promised at the time of the rights issue.</p>

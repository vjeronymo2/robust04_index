			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY ALIVE AND WELL, AND IN EFFECT ALONG THE BORDER  </P> <P> Adam Kramer, 23, was coming back across the border at Calexico last week with  two friends after a mountain-climbing trip in Mexico wheS. Customs agents  seized his 1975 Plymouth Valiant. Inspectors said they found a 10th of a gram  of marijuana -- barely a pinch -- in the pocket of one of his friends.  </P> <P> Two days earlier, the Thomas Washington, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography  research ship, was seized in Honolulu after Customs agents said they found a  gram of marijuana hidden in a crew member's berth.  </P> <P> The Thomas Washington was allowed to sail on after of few days of legal  wrangling. But Kramer, an art student at San Diego State University, has been  without his car for more than a week, bumming rides from the friend who was  caught with the pot. He is uncertain whether he will ever get his car back.  </P> <P> The two incidents underscore the confusion that continues to characterize the  government's implementation of its "zero-tolerance" anti-drug policy, which  permits authorities to seize boats, cars, planes and trucks if even minute  amounts of drugs are found on board. The policy came under fire about a year  ago when authorities began a nationwide crackdown, threatening to seize cars  and boats permanently.  </P> <P> Much of the current confusion arises from the differing policies that apply to  boats and cars. But owners also say they get conflicting information about  whether, and how, they get their vehicles back.  </P> <P> Seizures of boats are now relatively rare, but, with little fanfare, Customs  has continued to seize cars at a steady pace at the California-Mexico border.  </P> <P> Kate Thickston, a lawyer in the Federal Defenders office, said the seizure  process is explained improperly to many motorists and, as a result, people like  Kramer are unsure about how to petition for the return of their cars.  </P> <P> "It's apparent that the Customs agents at the border take the opportunity that  zero tolerance offers them to harass people at the border. It's not that I  condone bringing any amount of a controlled substance into the country, but it  seems people at the border are not given accurate information," she said.  </P> <P> "Confessions are taken from them . . . and some of the agents will say things  like, 'If you don't admit it's yours, we'll just arrest you,' " Thickston said.  </P> <P> Said Kramer: "I spoke to several of the officers there, and one of them said  that usually the property is returned if the petition is valid. Two others said  it was unlikely."  </P> <P> Paper work handed to him by Customs agents reads, " . . . in appropriate cases,  administrative relief may be considered. It should be noted that you will not  be granted relief in the form of return of the seized property. Relief may be  granted in the form of a monetary refund from the proceeds of sale of the  property after it has been forfeited."  </P> <P> To Kramer it was "fairly unclear exactly what you're supposed to do," Kramer  said. The car, given to Kramer by his grandmother, has 30,000 miles on it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Get Car Back  </P> <P> But Thickston said Kramer would probably get his car back if he could prove to  Customs that he did not have any knowledge of the drugs being in his car, and  after he pays a fine, probably about $300.  </P> <P> "If he tried to prevent the controlled substance from getting into his car,  he'll get his car back. He'll still pay towing and storage," Thickston said.  </P> <P> Kramer's friend, who was allegedly in possession of what Customs agents at the  border called "pipe scrapings," was released after being assessed a $150  administrative penalty, the Customs Service said, confirming Kramer's account.  </P> <P> Although the Customs Service relaxed the controversial policy for commercial  fishing vessels last year to keep from penalizing innocent owners unaware of  the actions of crew members or guests, authorities have been less lenient with  car owners -- who form the bulk of people stopped under zero tolerance. Even  though the Scripps vessel was not a fishing boat, Customs applied the relaxed  policy in that case and allowed Scripps to continue operating the ship while  the legal case is pending.  </P> <P> But Customs agents continue to seize cars, refusing to return them even to  "innocent" owners until the cases are resolved, which at best can take several  months. Some lawyers label the policy a waste of taxpayer's money, an injustice  to "innocent owners" and a burden on the court system.  </P> <P> But Allan Rappoport, district director of the Customs Service in San Diego said  the program seems to be operating smoothly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Running Pretty Well'  </P> <P> "Basically the zero-tolerance program for cars seems to be operating without a  great deal of animosity or without much media visibility," Rappoport said. "I  can only assume people for the most part have a better understanding of the  program. It seems to be running pretty well."  </P> <P> Three years ago, then-U.S. Atty. Peter K. Nunez arranged with the Customs  Service to start the zero-tolerance policy in San Diego because "the notion had  gained credence in the community that it was OK to use drugs in the community,  just don't sell them. We had to dispel the notion that we had tacitly approved  of using drugs."  </P> <P> But, a year ago, a toughened policy created a backlog of cases and threatened  to disrupt the functioning of federal courts and prompted an outcry against the  crackdown.  </P> <P> Since then, new guidelines have given more of the program's administrative  duties to the Customs Service, lessening the burden on the U. S. attorney's  office. Despite confusion in the minds of their clients, lawyers say the  situation has reached "equilibrium," with most cars eventually being returned.  </P> <P> U. S. Atty. Bill Braniff, who succeeded Nunez, says the program remains an  important symbol in the fight against illegal drugs and is running smoothly.  </P> <P> "I think you can't fight the war on drugs and say there is a safe haven for the  personal use of drugs, that this is not criminal, that this is bad taste or  otherwise, and expect everyone else to take it seriously . . . where (the  federal government) has exclusive jurisdiction, we should show we're doing our  part at all levels," Braniff said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just the Principle'  </P> <P> "The amounts that are seized aren't significant; it's just the principle."  </P> <P> Compared to a year ago, the situation has improved, Braniff said. He has no  plans to change the existing procedures.  </P> <P> Figures from the U. S. attorney's criminal complaints section shows a slight  decrease in zero-tolerance arrests since the program began in December, 1986.  Braniff said there are 20 to 30 seizures a week at the border under the  zero-tolerance policy.  </P> <P> There were 49 such arrests this January, 54 in January, 1988, and 58 in  January, 1987, a spokeswoman for the criminal complaints section said.  </P> <P> Alleged offenders typically plead guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession  of a controlled substance in order to have felony charges of importation of a  controlled substance dropped. Generally, their cars are returned after they pay  a fine.  </P> <P> But the system nearly ground to a halt last May when the Customs Service  refused to return cars and people refused to plead guilty.  </P> <P> Customs Service spokesman John Miller in Los Angeles said that, although he is  aware of challenges to the zero-tolerance policy "working their way through the  court system," the program is working well now that the Customs Service had  returned to its original policy of issuing fines instead of focusing on  forfeiture.  </P> <P> "There really is not a problem anymore . . . in most cases people can get their  cars back -- with a hassle, I'll admit -- but it's a reasonable one," Miller  said.  </P> <P> Kramer disagrees.  </P> <P> "They detained us for an hour and a half. They said, 'Are you a calm person?  Good, because we are taking your car.'  </P> <P> "I'm furious, but what good does it do to be angry?" said Kramer. "I'm going to  petition and do whatever I can to get back that car."  </P></p>

Antonov, secretary of the Political Executive Committee of  the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan, said the secret to the  invariable defence and advance of the idea of socialism in Korea  under the complicated international situation lies in the  singlehearted unity of the entire people under the wise guidance  of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    V.I. Ran, secretary of the Political Executive Committee of  the Aktyubinsk Regional Committee of the Party, noted that  support and trust of the Korean people for their leaders is  immense, indeed. "No one can break the crystal- like  singlehearted unity of Korea" he said, adding: "In Korea the  question of carrying forward the revolutionary cause of the  leader has been successfully solved and education of the young  people has reached the highest level beyond imagination".    Co-chairman of the party A. Alimjanov said: "Only the rich  monopolize arts and scenic spots in many countries. But in  Korea all people take part in the creation of arts and enjoy  holidays at scenic spots. This is the reality which can be  seen only in Korea where the people revere their leaders as  fathers."</p>

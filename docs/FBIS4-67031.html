			<p>BFN     [Text] Through the publication of a decree in the official  gazette yesterday, the Foreign Ministry promulgated an agreement  with Jamaica for the prevention, control, surveillance, and  repression of the illegal consumption and trafficking of drugs  and narcotics.    The agreement is signed by former President Patricio Aylwin.  It was approved by Congress as stated in Resolution No. 1280 of  the Chamber of Deputies.    The two governments are aware of the problems stemming from  drugs, including the deterioration of economies and the harm to  peoples' health.    The idea is to establish a permanent mechanism that will  allow Chilean and Jamaican authorities to exchange information  related to drug trafficking.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Tuesday [10 May] he will continue his predecessor Morihiro  Hosokawa's agenda to hike the consumption tax and cut income  taxes.    He asked the tax commission to draw up "appropriate  guidelines" for tax reform "based on the pillar of lessening  personal income taxes and fulfilling taxation on consumption."    Hata was speaking at the start of an afternoon meeting of  the  commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister that is to  present tax options next month for politicians to choose from.  He asked the panel members to "treat the earlier request of  former Prime Minister Hosokawa as my request," saying he plans  to push the same package that includes "permanent income tax  cuts."    Hata pledged "utmost efforts" to keep Hosokawa's vow of  submitting the government's tax legislation by the end of next  month and getting it through parliament this year, with "the  cooperation and understanding of the various parties."    Opposition to a consumption tax hike by the Social  Democratic  Party was a key problem for the Hosokawa government. The  socialists quit the coalition, leaving Hata to form the first  minority government in nearly four decades.    In addition to the shifting the tax burden away from direct  levies such as income tax toward indirect levies like the  consumption tax, Hosokawa also said as prime minister that  Japan's net tax burden must grow to meet the coming needs of the  nation's graying society.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV Today Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Motilones Indians are among the tribes that  struggle the hardest to save their identity. The guerrilla  movements have now surfaced as a formidable enemy. They say  they are willing to fight the subversives. It took one whole  day, travelling along dirt roads, canoeing along the Catatumbo  River, and cutting through the jungle to get to the villages of  the Caricacha Buquira tribe of the Motilones Bari Indians.  Almost 300 Indians, whose ancestors go back some 500 years,  base their economy on fishing, coffee, cocoa, yucca, and wild  fruits.    "TV Today" came here after hearing about reports made by 16  Indian communities. The Motilones are angry with the guerrillas  and the white settlers, who have moved onto their historically  defined reservations.    [Begin unidentified Indian chief recording, in dialect  fading  to Spanish translation] The settlers have been growing coca.  The processing waste flows into the river. The guerrillas have  contaminated the river with oil and there have been no fish in  the river for the last few years. Fish are the basis of our  diet. [end recording]    The Indians filed a complaint against the Revolutionary  Armed  Forces of Colombia and the Army of National Liberation.  Although there have been no clashes up to now, the Motilones  Bari Indians threatened to burn the coca plantations they find  on their lands. There are almost 4,000 Indians living all over  the Catatumbo region who would enforce this request by the  Motilones if the government representatives do not offer any  solutions to the problem.</p>

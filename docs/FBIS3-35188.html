"Iraq is implementing (UN Security Council) Resolution 687  and no longer has any weapons of mass destruction or the  capacity to manufacture them," al-Sahhaf said in an interview  shown on Qatari state television Friday.    The resolution set the terms for ending the 1991 Gulf war,  in  particular the elimination of all Baghdad's programmes for  nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.    UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four  days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990.    Al-Sahhaf accused certain members of the Security Council,  "notably the United States," of prolonging the political and  economic embargo "for political reasons totally unrelated to the  (Gulf) crisis."    He reiterated Iraq's refusal to export some of its oil under  UN supervision, in accordance with Resolution 706.    "This resolution cannot be applied because it has changed  from being a humanitarian resolution to a colonialist one."    It was the second time a senior Iraqi official had appeared  on Qatari television since the Gulf crisis.    Last Saturday the television screened a report on Iraq's  economic problems under the UN embargo, and invited Iraqi  Commerce Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih to speak on the programme.    Apart from Oman, Qatar is the only member of the six-nation  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to have renewed contacts with  Baghdad since the Gulf war.    The other GCC members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United  Arab Emirates and Bahrain.    On Thursday al-Sahhaf told the UN Human Rights Commission in  Geneva "the lifting of the iniquitous blockade and the injustice  done to the Iraqi people is a humanitarian responsibility."    He urged that the "use of the weapon of economic sanctions  and the policy of starvation" be abandoned.</p>

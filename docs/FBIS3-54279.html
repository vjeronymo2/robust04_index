It has  denounced the attempts of massive fraud made by the Nouakchott  government.    In connection with these elections, Sheikh Sadibou Camara,  influential leader of the opposition, was arrested on 20  January. Sadibou Camara is also the chairman of the Mauritanian  Human Rights Association. For Camara's lawyer, Fatimata Mbaye,  this arrest is connected with his fight against slavery in  Mauritania:    [Mbaye] Professor Camara is a well-known figure whose  activities are no secret to anyone. He is not only a human  rights activist, but also takes part in the UN efforts to fight  slavery. He is also a member of the board of administration of  a nongovernmental antislavery organization. It is therefore  quite normal for Prof. Camara to stand against slavery. What is  really interesting is that Prof. Camara's arrest occurred around  the time that the Acting Together and the International Human  Rights Federation joint delegation arrived in Mauritania -- a  delegation which received authorization at the Mauritanian  Embassy in Paris -- only four days after getting this  authorization.    Like every Mauritanian who is at all aware of the  Mauritanian political atmosphere, we quite understand the  reaction of the Mauritanian authorities inasmuch as Prof. Camara  is an influential personality who plays quite an important role  in his party, the Union for Democracy and Progress, by  attracting a large number of activists. This is just another  violent act which the authorities have perpetrated on our new  democracy.    Prof. Camara's arrest has, since this morning, raised a  general outcry within the international community. Here is the  reaction of the chairman of the International Human Rights  Federation, Daniel Jacob:    [Jacob] I have sent a telegram to the Mauritanian head  of state asking him to release the professor immediately because  he was arrested as a result of his human rights activities in  Mauritania. We are contacting immediately the UN working group  on this disappearance -- on this arbitrary detention -- and on  this situation which we consider as particularly serious  because, according to the information in our possession, the  main accusation against Prof. Camara is first, he continued to  head an association that did not have the required authorization  and second, and above all, he gave information to the  investigation mission of the international federation which was  in Mauritania last week.    [Unidentified reporter] Given the fact that reports  reveal that he was being detained in extremely difficult  conditions, do you think you have other means of pressure that  can make the Mauritanian Government soften its stand and release  him immediately?    [Jacob] I personally wrote to Colonel Taya asking him  to understand that the international organizations that finally  adopted a relatively lenient attitude owing to some progress in  the promotion of freedom of opinion, are perhaps going to revise  their stand and then complain to the French Government.    Here is another reaction from Gaita Motou, an official of  the  research bureau of Amnesty International in Paris:    [Motou] We launched what we call an urgent program of  action in (?collaboration) with all our sections and groups of  persons working on our urgent program of action asking them to  contact the Mauritanian Government and demand the release of  Prof. Camara since 21 January.    [Reporter] The accusation often leveled against Amnesty  International is that it remains in its Paris or London bureau  to criticize the public authority in Africa. In this particular  case, have you sent a mission to Mauritania to see the  conditions in which Prof. Camara is being detained?    [Motou] This accusation leveled against us is quite  unfounded. In the case of Mauritania, we tried to go there to  express our concern, but we have never received any answer. We  think that intensifying the pressure that we have been bringing  to bear on the Mauritanian Government since 21 January might  make it change its mind.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Buyers at Sotheby's in New York City paid $1.7 million for 396 lots of  animation artwork from the Disney/Amblin hit "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"  Wednesday in the first major sale of art from a contemporary film. The most  expensive item, a cel of the assembled 'Toon characters from the movie's  finale, brought $50,600. Its pre-sale estimate was $15,000-$20,000. Each cel  was mounted against a still from the corresponding live action scene from the  film. The record for a piece of animation artwork was set in May, when a  Canadian collector paid $286,000 for a cel and background from Disney's  "Orphan's Benefit" (1934) at Christie's East.

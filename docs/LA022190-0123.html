			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRAHAM COMPLAINT SAYS GOP MEDDLED IN PRIMARY  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission said Tuesday that it is reviewing  a complaint by Democratic state Senate candidate Janice Graham alleging that  Republicans meddled with her primary campaign earlier this month.  </P> <P> Graham of Laguna Hills said a Republican political action committee in  Sacramento was responsible for spending $17,000 to mail copies of a letter in  support of her campaign for the special primary for the 31st State Senate  District seat held Feb. 6.  </P> <P> Graham won the Democratic primary and will face Assemblyman Frank Hill  (R-Whittier) in an April 10 runoff election. Hill narrowly defeated Assemblyman  Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach).  </P> <P> Political officials speculated that the letter was intended to strengthen  Graham's campaign so that Democratic voters would not defect to Ron Isles, a  pro-choice Republican who was appealing to Democrats for support. They also  speculated privately that Hill was the intended benefactor of the letter.  Hill's campaign has said it had no knowledge of the mailing.  </P> <P> Officials for the Voter Information League, the source of the letter, could not  be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> The special primary was held to replace former state Sen. William Campbell  (R-Hacienda Heights), who resigned in December. The district straddles the  border between Los Angeles and Orange counties, stretching from Whittier and  West Covina in the north to Laguna Beach in the south.  </P> <P> Sandra Nichioku, an FPPC spokeswoman in Sacramento, said that Graham's  complaint had been received Tuesday and that there would be no comment until  the panel examines the issue.  </P> <P> Graham said the letter may have helped her campaign, but she complained that it  was unauthorized and contained inaccurate information that caused some  recipients to complain to her office.  </P> <P> She also said that some of the letters were delivered after the primary,  "making her campaign look incompetent," and that the letter led some people to  believe she had an alliance with Hill to defeat Isles.  </P> <P> "Frank Hill is the last person that I want to be allied with," said a Graham  statement, which added that Hill is a subject in the FBI's influence-peddling  investigation at the Capitol.  </P></p>

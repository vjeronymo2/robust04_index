			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Observer: Lankester bomber Top civil servants don't normally like to rile their prime ministers, but then Sir Tim Lankester is hardly a conventional bureaucrat. As head of Britain's Overseas Development Administration, Lankester has thumbed his nose at John Major by saying British taxpayers' money was wasted on Malaysia's Pergau dam project. Lankester has long had the habit of giving a straight answer to a straight question, which endeared him both to Jim Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher when he was their private secretary. His obsession with third world affairs comes from his seven-year stint as a World Bank economist. An interest in development economics was sparked off by Arthur Lewis of the University of the West Indies during a spell as a VSO teacher in Belize. On returning there 30 years later Lankester was delighted to find that two former pupils were now governor of the central bank and permanent secretary at the finance ministry. The end of January sees him moving to far less congenial waters, as permanent secretary at the Department for Education, where his role is to help save the neck of education secretary John Patten. Time for more straight talking?</p>

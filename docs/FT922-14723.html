			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Books: Playwright who turned into a fly AUGUSTUS REX by Clive Sinclair Andre Deutsch Pounds 13.99, 210 pages THIRST by Stephen Amidon Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 219 pages EMMA SMART by Jonathan Treitel Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 277 pages THE MAN WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH THE MOON by Tom Spanbauer Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 8.99, 400 pages TAKE a deep breath before you consider the plot of Clive Sinclair's new novel, Augustus Rex. A very deep breath. What it needs from the reader is a willing suspension of disbelief, a readiness to meet the author halfway - perhaps more than halfway. Grant him that much - and then brace yourself for a story in which August Strindberg, the Swedish playwright, did not die in 1912 as popularly supposed. Instead, he sold his soul to the Devil and was kept in suspended animation until 1961, when he rose again to become a powerful man and vigorous lover, the eponymous Rex of the title. He is tempted by the Devil on the way, first with a sexy Jewish landlady (Strindberg was notoriously anti-Semitic) and then with his coronation in the ancient field where the Swedes traditionally elected their monarchs. He looks for the elixir of life, attempts to turn urine into gold, and aspires to win the Nobel prize. Not surprisingly, perhaps, he goes mad instead and ends up wandering around Sweden for seven years before turning into a fly and buzzing round the sexual organs of his wife as she makes love to another man. Weird? All Clive Sinclair's stuff is weird. He has always been an offbeat writer with a quirky way of looking at the world that is entirely his own. A cerebral writer, too: very whimsical and interested as much in the exploration of ideas as the simple mechanics of the plot. You either like his kind of writing or you don't; but whatever else you can say about him, he is always lucid, always original, never dull. Far more straightforward as a writer is Stephen Amidon, an American living in England. For the hero of his second novel, Thirst, he has chosen an American living in . . . England. The resemblance ends there, however, because Daniel North is an actor and in no way an alter ego for the author. He is at Heathrow airport when the novel begins, waiting to meet his father whom he has not seen for 13 acrimonious years. But his hopes for a reconciliation are dashed when North senior has a heart attack on the plane and arrives in London stone dead. Undaunted, Daniel accompanies the body back to Arizona, where he delivers it to a stepmother his own age and meets his half-brother for the first time. He also meets his father's former employer, a shady businessman selling water rights to beat the drought. Was Daniel's father involved in criminal activity - something to do with wells drying up and illicit deals on the Salt Indian reservation? Daniel resolves to find out. He takes a job to pay his way, playing the part of an Indian murder victim in the Arizona equivalent of Crimewatch UK. Then, by chance, he discovers that the victim's name was on a list in his father's possession. What possible connection could there be between his father and a headless Indian found in a canal? Not what you might think, because Amidon is too good a writer for that. He handles his story with great verve, never showing his hand, always keeping the reader guessing. There is a hint of Chinatown in the plot and a nod, perhaps, to the American Indian novels of Tony Hillerman. If there is a complaint, it is that Daniel's behaviour at the denouement seems a little out of character; not at all what you might expect. But that is only a minor quibble in an otherwise neatly-executed book. Jonathan Treitel's Emma Smart is a modern equivalent of Jane Austen's Emma. A Cambridge mathematician is enjoying a year's sabbatical at the Institute of Advanced Studies in New York. She was a child prodigy at Cambridge: only 11 when she went up. Ten years later, she is an adult at last, but still a virgin and happy to remain so. In New York, she is befriended by an old university chum, who introduces her to LZ Allgrobsch, an enigmatic novelist and Nobel laureate from central Europe. Her friend wants to write Allgrobsch's biography, but is having trouble researching his early life. Emma offers to help, with intriguing results. Treitel cheerfully acknowledges his debt to Jane Austen and tells an intellectual story in best academic manner, although one must quarrel with him about the existence of a McDonald's in Cambridge - it is the one example of American cultural imperialism that has not so far been permitted in the town. The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon is another very American creation, the product of the Columbia fiction programme and of 68 assistants thanked individually in the foreword ('Bless your hearts, you guys'). It begins dreadfully in an arch, approved writing school manner that clearly is aiming at Literature, if not High Art. Once the author settles down, though, his story gradually develops a certain peculiar charm of its own. It is about a half-Red Indian boy, working as a male prostitute in Idaho at the turn of the century and desperately looking for his parents. At one point he has sex willingly with the man he believes to be his father, which seems to be par for the course in American novels these days. He identifies his parents in the end, although not before he has tried every kind of sexual combination you can think of, and one or two you almost certainly can't.</p>

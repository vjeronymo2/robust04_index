			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Croats flee Moslem assault on Travnik HUNDREDS OF terrified Croat refugees fled Travnik yesterday as Croat forces hurled mortar and shell fire at positions occupied by Moslem fighters who have seized most of the central Bosnian town. The battle for Travnik has turned into a rout for Croats who earlier were allied with Moslems against Serbs in Bosnia's civil war but are now fighting each other for territory. A spokesman for the Croatian Defence Force (HVO) admitted that around 1,000 its soldiers who surrendered to nearby Serb forces on Monday had disobeyed orders to withdraw to safe positions. Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, accused Moslems of executing Croat prisoners in Travnik although there was no independent confirmation of the claim. Croats streamed from the Turkish-built town, a relic of the Ottoman empire, and its surrounding villages on foot or any other means of transport available. Mules, donkey carts, bicycles, cars and vans laden with panic-stricken refugees jostled on the roads as Croat mortar bombs and shells soared over their heads towards Moslem targets. A young Croat fighter said the Moslems, who outnumber the better-armed HVO, captured another village yesterday morning and added: 'The Moslems are attacking right across the front.' Hundreds of people have been killed in and around Travnik since the fighting began over the weekend, according to western military sources in the area. The HVO appear to have taken up positions on high ground south and east of the town in anticipation of a Moslem attempt to take control of the valley bisecting central Bosnia. This would allow Moslems to link their northern strongholds of Tuzla and Zenica with Jablanica and Konjic south of Travnik. An HVO spokesman confirmed that Croat soldiers and civilians from Travnik surrendered to the Bosnian Serb army on Mount Vlasic just north of the town during the fighting. 'I believe they had no other choice' because the situation in the town is 'a total mess'. General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN peacekeepers, planned a meeting with leaders of the HVO and the Moslem-led government forces in a fresh attempt to enforce a ceasefire. In eastern Bosnia, Sarajevo radio reported that Serb forces attacked the blockaded Moslem enclave of Gorazde with tanks and infantry yesterday and were bringing up reinforcements.</p>

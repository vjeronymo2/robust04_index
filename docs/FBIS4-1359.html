			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Transitional Prime Minister Kokou  Koffigoh has left. The first prime minister of the Fourth  Republic, Kouadjovi Edem Kodjo, has taken over. The  inauguration ceremony, held late yesterday afternoon at the  Palais de l'Entente, did not have much pomp -- but it was a very  important ceremony. Edem Kodjo received military honors and  inspected the social and professional organizations. The two  officials then held a brief, private meeting. They delivered  speeches later. Most of the ideas which they talked about, such  as reconciliation, dialogue, unity, peace, rule of law, and  economic recovery, which were included in Mr. Koffigoh's speech,  were also found in Mr. Edem Kodjo's speech. The only difference  is that the new prime minister (?added) the issue of  repatriating refugees. Listening to the outgoing prime  minister's speech, one did not have the impression that he was  someone who had been crushed by the transition, but was instead  someone taking great satisfaction in having accomplished his  mission, in spite of an uneasy climate.    [Begin Koffigoh recording] Mr. Prime Minister, before  extending my congratulations, I would like to express the  happiness I felt at hearing your first statement when you were  appointed prime minister by the head of state. You listed the  priorities of your future policy, which included reconciliation,  the consolidation of social peace, and economic recovery. These  also formed the basis of my actions during the transitional  period. I would now like to congratulate you on the confidence  the head of state has placed in you by appointing you his first  prime minister to the Fourth Republic. Your Excellency, Mr.  Prime Minister, your appointment and the inauguration into your  new duties mark the end of our long transition toward a new  society. [passage omitted] [end recording]    [Announcer] The new prime minister said he was filled with  emotion in the face of the heavy task that lay ahead of him.  Here is what he said:    [Begin Kodjo recording] Your Excellency, Mr. Prime Minister,  I would first like to thank you for the warm reception you have  given me during this inauguration ceremony. I would also like  to say that on this occasion my first thoughts go to all those  in the country who lost their lives in order that we might  obtain democracy. I would sincerely like to thank the Togolese  people, who have suffered so much in order that the rule of law  might prevail in our country and human rights might be  respected. This ceremony is very moving, and I would like to  express my emotion in the face of the heavy task which lies  ahead of me. We will be able to accomplish this task only if we  have a firm and legitimate footing within the parliamentary  majority of which we are members, and only if we take the  trouble to open up to the active forces of the nation. In this  way we will be able to build our country together in harmony,  understanding, and peace. This country needs to be turned into  a place where rule of law prevails. We will work toward that,  step by step.    Democracy is not something one confers on oneself, one has  to  constantly worked at it. It involves constant effort, but I  think the Togolese people are committed to making this effort.  This effort must be continued so that, gradually, the  establishment of the necessary mechanisms and institutions for a  genuine state where the rule of law prevails will become  reality. We have, in conjunction with our friends in the  parliamentary majority, and with the same concern for openness  which must be at the basis of all our actions in this delicate  stage of the life our nation, emphasized a certain number of  issues which are fundamental if we want our country to move once  and for all out of the era of disturbances and into an era of  stability. Of course, we should ensure that the Togolese get  along with one another, that refugees are able to hope to return  to their country some day. We should ensure that all those who  are separated are reunited. This is a very important (?program).    The security forces, the police, and our Army must feel  constantly and totally integrated into this democratization  process, which is intended for them as well. Our concern is to  do everything possible so that our country is able recover its  position within the international community as one of the  leading African countries. In order to do that, we need to  normalize our relations rapidly with the financial institutions  and begin working rigorously toward reconstructing the economy.  Social peace and security are also moral imperatives. In any  case, they are essential aspects of a program that parliamentary  majority parties have been formulating in order that, together,  we might be able to bring this interesting task to a successful  end. Our young people, our professionals, our women's  associations, and the silent forces of farmers are our national  assets. We must give new hope to all these people, and to all  these national sectors, so that investors can find a stable and  secure situation which enables them to move forward and  contribute to building a solid national economy.    I would like to add that we are determined to ensure that  there is permanent dialogue among all the active forces of the  nation, a daily dialogue between unions, workers, and  representative associations. We need to find solutions through  dialogue to the problem of employment, to the workers' salary  problem, to the problems of our young people, to the problem of  finding a public harmony -- which is necessary and unavoidable  -- and to the problem of our (?uncertain) economy. Mr. Prime  Minister, I said I would be brief and I will keep my word. I  would like to end my speech by reiterating that all the Togolese  people must assist us, so that if shadows exist the shadows are  dispelled, and if there are clouds then they are dispelled, so  that in this situation of strengthened unity, especially within  our parliamentary majority, we can make of this country the  modern state which it should be. Thank you very much for this  ceremony. I will always remember this moving ceremony, since  you said that you will always be at our disposal to give us any  information we need -- be convinced that we have taken note of  that. I would like to thank all your aides who are familiar to  us, and all those who have attended this ceremony. Thank you.  [applause] [end recording]</p>

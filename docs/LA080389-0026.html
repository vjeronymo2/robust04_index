			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: NEED STILL GREAT FOR SRO SPACE  </P> <P> San Diego's new single-room occupancy residential hotels are garnering alot of  attention, not just here but across the country. Out-of-town architects,  planners, developers and politicians often inquire about the roughly 1,000 new  SRO rooms built here since The Baltic Inn became the first new SRO in more than  50 years when it opened in 1986.  </P> <P> Building code changes helped pave the way for the new projects, easing sewer  hookup fees, parking requirements and various code restrictions to compensate  for the expensive fire sprinklers required because low-cost construction is  more combustible.  </P> <P> But while the bright new SROs, many of them built with financial assistance  from the San Diego Housing Commission, are getting the spotlight, the housing  situation for low-income people still looks bleak, particularly downtown, where  the new SROs are concentrated.  </P> <P> By some estimates, there were nearly 10,000 SRO rooms in downtown San Diego  before redevelopment began in the 1970s. Now there are about 3,500, and,  despite more than 1,000 additional SRO rooms due in the next year or two, the  total number will fall 1,000 rooms short of meeting the annual demand for new  rooms between now and 1991, according to a Housing Commission survey.  </P> <P> There are actually two problems: New SROs can't be built fast enough, and older  units are facing extinction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cleared of Tenants  </P> <P> The Gordon Hotel, a 26-room SRO at 1334 7th Ave., where rents start at less  than $200, has been cleared of tenants by its owners, 600 Associates, even  though they haven't gotten demolition or building permits.  </P> <P> The Housing Commission has yet to determine whether the Gordon is exempt from  the city's SRO Preservation Ordinance (which requires developers to replace, or  pay for the replacement of, any SRO rooms demolished), or whether it has  adequately provided for the relocation of tenants.  </P> <P> Right now, the developers won't divulge their plans for the Gordon. Kathy  Rodman, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society, which represents low-income  clients, is working with an undisclosed group of San Diegans in the hope of  preventing demolition. She said a contractor hired by her clients found the  building to be structurally sound and a good candidate for rehabilitation.  </P> <P> For many people, older SROs such as the Gordon are the last rung of housing  before the streets, with rates substantially below the $310 average rate for  new SROs.  </P> <P> Thousands of families need low-cost housing, according to the San Diego Housing  Trust Fund Coalition, a group of low-income housing advocates for the fund  being proposed by the Housing Commission. The coalition estimates that 4,500  new low-income units are needed annually in San Diego to keep up with demand.  </P> <P> A Housing Commission study shows that most SRO tenants earn less than $15,000 a  year, putting them in the "very low-income" category. (Housing experts define  "low income" as 50% to 80% of median household income, and "very low" as 50% or  less of the median household income. In San Diego, the median household income  is $36,000.)  </P> <P> Contrary to common belief, many of the people served by SROs are not unemployed  transients, but workers who can't afford a studio apartment, the next step up  in housing. Many of these are janitors, maids, dishwashers and day care  providers essential to serving new downtown development, especially hotels and  the soon-to-open convention center.  </P> <P> Such people should be the prime target for low-income housing, not households  making $18,000 and more, according to Jeanne Ertle of the Peace and Justice  Commission of the San Diego Catholic Diocese.  </P> <P> Developers who get Housing Commission financing to build SROs -- including  loans made at interest rates as low as 3% -- must make 20% of their rooms  available to people earning 40% or less of the median income. These rooms rent  for about $240 a month.  </P> <P> Roughly half the 1,000 new SRO rooms in San Diego are commission-subsidized,  according to Judy Lenthall, a senior city planner specializing in SROs, so new  SROs are providing about 100 rooms for this rock-bottom income group, not  nearly enough to meet demand.  </P> <P> Advocates of low-income housing see new signs of hope for very low-income  people in the proposed trust fund. There are many possible sources of money,  including the "tax increment" dollars that flow when redevelopment increases  property values, higher business license fees and assessments of 2% to 3% of  the construction cost of new commercial developments downtown. The idea is to  make those who profit the most from downtown development pay for housing the  very low-income workers they often employ.  </P> <P> The trust fund could be approved by the Housing Commission and the City Council  before the end of the year, and could provide $10 million to $20 million  annually for low-income housing.  </P> <P> "We're letting them know there is a real concern about the needs of low-income  people on the bottom end of the housing crisis," said Ertle, who represents the  diocese on the coalition. In the past, she said, the city has aimed for  low-income and moderate-income groups whose income is much higher than those in  the very low-income category.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Projects Well Designed  </P> <P> One of the biggest problems facing new low-income housing is the syndrome known  as NIMBY, or "Not in My Back Yard." When low-income housing is proposed for a  neighborhood, some people envision the Gargantuan, abandoned hulks built in New  York and Chicago in the 1960s, rather than the more intimately scaled,  well-designed projects of today. Architect Rob Quigley's design for The Baltic  Inn at 521 6th Ave., for example, has been published in national design  magazines and received an Honor Award in 1988 from the local chapter of the  American Institute of Architects.  </P> <P> But building design isn't the only, or even the major, concern for some SRO  opponents. There's also the matter of who will live in them.  </P> <P> City staff member Lenthall recently visited several community groups, including  the Normal Heights Community Assn., to explain a new ordinance being drafted to  govern the development of SRO-like buildings with slightly larger rooms  designed more for couples than singles. In Normal Heights, the reception was  less than warm, she said.  </P> <P> "Yes, it was definitely less than ecstatic," said Judy Elliot, community  organizer for the planning group. She said the group was afraid that one of the  new buildings might be proposed for Adams Avenue, in the heart of the  community's business district, and that such projects are too dense for an  already-dense part of the city. Many among the group also feared that such  projects might attract the "bad element . . . drug dealing."  </P> <P> Lenthall offered the group a tour of new SROs, to show them how nice they can  be, but no one seemed interested, she said. According to Elliot, planning group  members were simply too busy.  </P> <P> On Aug. 11 and 12, the national AIA's Affordable Housing Task Group will  sponsor an SRO workshop at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, in conjunction with  the local AIA chapter, the city Planning Department and the Housing Commission.  But, with a cost of $220 for non-AIA members, it will appeal mostly to  developers, bankers and architects, not a public in need of education.  </P> <P> To date, architects have been noticeably quiet on the subject of low-income  housing, although they are among the best qualified to explain to people how it  can blend into existing neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Ed Grochowiak is past president of the local AIA chapter and head of the AIA's  Architectural Foundation, which puts on various events aimed at educating the  public. Low-income housing hasn't been addressed recently, but Grochowiak  acknowledged that in the future it should be a topic.  </P></p>

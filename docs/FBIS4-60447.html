			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick Bishop: "Saddam Losing Grip as Trade </F> Sanctions Bite"]    [Text] Saddam Husayn's iron grip on Iraq may finally be  slackening due to unrelenting international sanctions against  his regime, according to British and American assessments.    Officials believe that the economic embargo imposed after  the  invasion of Kuwait is restricting the dictator's ability to buy  loyalty and increasing the chances of a successful coup.    Reports of defections by military officers and terrorist  attacks in Baghdad against government offices have fuelled  speculation that the regime's hold is weakening.    President Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser, Mr  Anthony Lake, noted with approval recently that "despite  Saddam's efforts to buy loyalties, sanctions are taking their  toll on the crucial inner circle on which the regime depends.    "There are now frequent reports of coup attempts and unrest  among the relatively privileged Iraqi elite."    Mr Lake went on to say that "these trends could lead to new  conditions for the citizens of Iraq and new opportunities to  build a more peaceful and normal relationship between Iraq and  the outside world" -- a coy reference to the possibility of  Saddam's overthrow.    The hope that the dictator could be ousted in the  not-too-distant future has increased American determination not  to slacken the international blockade.    So far, London and Washington have managed to resist  pressure  in the Security Council to reward Saddam for his more  co-operative attitude towards UN inspectors trying to track down  his weapons of mass destruction.    The advocates of a less stringent policy are led by Russia,  for whom Iraq is a major debtor. But France also has sound  economic reasons for softening the line against Saddam.    It had lucrative economic ties with Baghdad before the war,  buying Iraqi oil and selling military aircraft. French  enterprises are already positioning themselves to be in the best  possible position to exploit opportunities once sanctions are  lifted.    The Elf Aquitaine and Total oil companies have held  extensive  talks with the Iraqis over the future exploitation of two fields  in southern Iraq where there is an estimated 20-30 billion  barrels waiting to be pumped -- more than in the North Sea.    The French insist that nothing will be signed until  sanctions  have been eased or lifted. But their actions have caused anger  in London, where they are viewed as undercutting British  commercial interests and breaking the spirit of the allied  strategy against Saddam.    After initially believing that its interests were best  served  by leaving a weakened Saddam in place to hold the country  together and act as a counterweight to anti-Western Iran, the US  has come round to the view that it would be better for Saddam to  go.    The US now supports the Iraqi National Congress, the broad  spectrum exile organisation which has moved its headquarters to  the Kurdish-held north of the country.</p>

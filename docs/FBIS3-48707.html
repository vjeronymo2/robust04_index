Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN today says:    This is part of the crafty ruses to whitewash the inhuman  acts committed systematically by the United States. Recalling  the materials of radiation tests on human bodies brought to  light in the United States of late, the analyst says:    Those tests were aimed at realizing the ambition for nuclear  monopoly by largely increasing the production of nuclear  weapons. Radiation tests on human bodies were carried out in  real earnest each time the U.S. Government was going to  manufacture a new type of nuclear weapon. This was a heinous  crime of the U.S. warmaniacs to dominate the world with nuclear  weapons and a shocking act of murder to which innocent Americans  fell victims.    The U.S. Government must feel compunction for this  anti-human  act and punish those responsible.    The United States' nuclear ambition has not changed at all.  New high-efficiency nuclear weapons are being manufactured, in  actuality, behind the screen of nuclear disarmament. This  suggests that radiation tests on human bodies more brutal than  in the past days might be committed in the United States.    The United States must renounce the ambition for nuclear  monopoly and not repeat any more such beastly act as radiation  tests on human bodies.</p>

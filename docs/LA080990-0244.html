			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOKYO STOCKS IN NOSE DIVE  </P> <P> Growing pessimism over the Middle East set stock prices nose-diving in Tokyo  today, while share prices finished modestly higher on London's Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 893.41 points, or 3.13%, ending at  27,615.73, its lowest level since Oct. 25, 1987.  </P> <P> Yoshio Ogawa, chief trader at Nikko Securities, said investors shied away from  the market because they are increasingly pessimistic about the Middle East  conflict, which they believe will be prolonged.  </P> <P> London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 7.4 points, or  0.3%, to close at 2,244.9.  </P> <P> British investors appeared tired from the week's erratic trading and uncertain  over the market's near-term direction, preferring to take to the sidelines  until a clearer trend could be discerned, dealers said.  </P></p>

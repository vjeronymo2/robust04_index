			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / College lecturers plan action over changes in contracts COLLEGE LECTURERS are likely to plan strike action after the introduction of tough contracts yesterday cutting their holidays in half and adding an hour to their working day. The change follows the transfer in April of further education colleges from local authorities to national government control. The contracts alter terms and conditions in place for two decades. Since the switch of control, the College Employers' Forum, which represents 360 further education colleges in England and Wales with 55,000 lecturers, has sought to establish itself as a tough public sector employer. Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the CEF, said the contracts were in line with requests by Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, for employers to 'rapidly introduce' changes in lecturers' conditions. The contracts, initially only for starters and those lecturers who are moving colleges or have been promoted, make several changes to the old arrangement: The 30-hour working week is abolished and increased to 37 hours (36 in London). Holiday entitlement is cut to seven weeks per year, plus statutory holidays, from 14. Redundancy notice periods are cut from 12 months to between one and three months. Lecturers must gain their principal's permission before taking on any outside work. Confidentiality agreements must now be signed to prevent lecturers divulging information about their old departments if they move to a new college. Lecturers will be barred from moving to companies which compete with their old college. Employers say the alterations are to accommodate the changing role of further education which involves offering part-time courses throughout the year. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education has refused to negotiate with the CEF if the contracts are on the agenda. Its conference starts tomorrow and is likely to prepare for strike action.</p>

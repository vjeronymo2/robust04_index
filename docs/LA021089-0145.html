			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO MAY SET UP SHUTTLE SERVICE TO AMTRAK DEPOT  </P> <P> In an effort to alleviate the congestion in downtown San Juan Capistrano's  Amtrak commuter parking lot, city development officials are considering setting  up a shuttle service to the depot.  </P> <P> Since August, more than 100 passengers have said they would be interested in  the morning and evening park-and-ride service planned for the Capistrano Depot  by city and Orange County Transit District officials, said Brian Fisk,  community development assistant. Fisk said sign-up sheets have been posted at  the depot for interested commuters to choose one of the three designated pickup  stops.  </P> <P> Dial-a-Ride has been working with the city to design routes for three vans that  could shuttle up to 51 passengers -- 17 in each van -- from satellite parking  areas in San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, Monarch Beach and  Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> At least eight passengers per van are necessary for the service to be  self-sufficient, Fisk said. Each commuter would pay $1.60 for the round-trip  service from each parking area to the Verdugo Street depot.  </P> <P> The shuttle vans would deliver passengers to the 6:41 a.m. northbound train to  Los Angeles and return them to the parking areas after the arrival of the 6 and  7 p.m. trains. John Snodgrass, operations manager for Mark IV Charter Lines  Dial-a-Ride division, said at least 150 southern Orange County commuters travel  north on the trains daily.  </P> <P> Proposed morning routes for the three van shuttles are:  </P> <P> A 6:18 a.m. stop at the northern Marguerite Parkway entrance to Mission Viejo  Mall, a 6:25 a.m. stop at the park-and-ride lot on Junipero Serra Road at  Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano and a 6:30 a.m. depot arrival.  </P> <P> A 6:15 a.m. stop at Monarch Bay Plaza in Monarch Beach, a 6:23 a.m. stop at  Violet Lantern Street and Coast Highway in Dana Point, and a 6:30 a.m. depot  arrival.  </P> <P> A 6:20 a.m. stop at Grant's Plaza in San Clemente and a 6:30 a.m. stop at the  depot.  </P> <P> Fiske said the service is expected to start this spring, as soon as enough  passengers commit themselves to the shuttle.  </P> <P> The city also plans to lease 100 commuter parking spaces in a multilevel  parking lot under construction at the Franciscan Plaza, across from the  station. Commuters will have to pay for the spots.  </P> <P> Fisk said the parking complex -- which is scheduled to be completed this summer  -- and the shuttle vans should alleviate the parking problems.  </P></p>

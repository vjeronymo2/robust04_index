			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Surge in net income at BZ Bank BZ BANK, the vehicle for Mr Martin Ebner's aggressive activity in the Swiss stock markets, reported a 153 per cent rise in its net income last year to SFr25.1m (Dollars 17.8m), writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The seven-year-old bank made gross income of SFr114.9m, up 12.9 per cent, of which SFr73.3m came from commissions, which advanced 20 per cent. The bank said brokerage fees contributed about two thirds of the commissions with underwriting commissions providing the rest. Total assets surged 39 per cent to SFr506.3m due to higher current loans and a higher inventory of securities.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Bosnia's warring parties face second hard winter Bosnia's three warring parties are poised to fight a second winter of war with all sides firm in the belief that time is on their side, despite evidence to the contrary. Moslem leaders are hoping that United Nations sanctions, imposed on Belgrade 19 months ago, will bite even harder in the coming months, forcing the Bosnian Serbs to make concessions. In contrast Serb leaders hold faith that when Greece takes over the European Union presidency in January, sanctions will be lifted whether or not Serbia has handed over land to the mostly Moslem state. For their part, Croats plan to recover some of the territory in central Bosnia seized by their Moslem rivals over the past months. With no tangible signs of a settlement, the international community can only hope that economic deprivation will curb the territorial ambitions of Serb and Croat nationalists and force them to show flexibility. But this is a faint hope. At last week's Geneva talks on the division of Bosnia into three ethnically based republics Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders gained no ground towards ending the 20-month Bosnian conflict. Serb leaders ignored EU demands to hand over 3 to 4 per cent of territory to the mostly Moslem republic in exchange for the easing of sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia. They are loathe to cede any land in eastern Bosnia, because this would be tantamount to giving up Greater Serbia. The 'state', carved out over the past three years by Serb forces in Bosnia and Croatia, would be cut in two. The Bosnian government, on the other hand, is hard-pressed to abandon claims on eastern Bosnia, which was mostly Moslem before the war.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: Jenufa - Opera Anja Silja first sang at Covent Garden 24 years ago, as heroine of the last London Fidelio series conducted by Klemperer. Her appearances since have been absurdly infrequent but always precious. Now she supplies main light- and heat-source of the house's latest Janacek revival: a Kostelnicka of searing honesty, dignity and power of presence, a point of unwavering intensity amid the flickers of an otherwise somewhat disappointing Jenufa. To lucky British opera-goers this portrayal was first shown, in all its greatness, at Glyndebourne four years ago, where it emerged as the crowning glory of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's magnificently severe production. In the larger London theatre it takes a while to come into focus - on current form the whole staging fails to provide this Kostelnicka with the necessary sense of oppressive containment, and at the start of Act 2 it seemed that Silja's soprano had been beset by a passing attack of the old wobbles. But soon the voice had broken free of them, cutting across the spaces in a way that revealed its incomparable qualities of fearlessness and gutsy honesty. No touch of extraneous melodrama or calculation is permitted the character even in the opera's deepest moments of agony - the sight of this figure of gauntly severe moral authority gradually bent and broken is in itself a revelation of unvarnished Janacekian insight. Once Nancy Gustafson  -a Jenufa graceful, vocally glowing, but still dramatically pale and sketchy - learns to dig deeper into her character, as later in the run she surely must, the force of Silja's authority will no doubt be more resonantly answered than it was on opening night. When new, in 1987, Yury Lyubimov's staging used all its whirring panels, whooshing gas-jets and balletic movement-groups to build up a tremendous surge of 'innocent' theatricality, powerfully physical, unstintingly radiant. Although Lyubimov has evidently been back to supervise the current revival, that surge obstinately refused to happen on Tuesday; and in its absence one was left regretting the aura of High Art that clings to so much of his production methods. Jan Blinkhof's violently impulsive, vocally unruly but also brave-spirited Laca and Arthur Davies's Steva, a finely detailed portrait of a weakling, were both much admired in the 1988 revival; on this occasion each seemed blurred, not enhanced, by the staging. Other than Silja, the most telling Janacek interpreter in evidence is the conductor, Jir Kout (house debut), who marries strong awareness of the opera's dramatic workings to warm, natural feeling for the heart-lifting thrust of its rhythms and shape of its melodies. A shame Covent Garden still clings to the discredited Kovarovic revision of the score, with its grandiose, tub-thumping ending: as WNO, Glyndebourne and many other serious Jenufa-performing companies have now shown, the superiority of the Mackerras-Tyrrell edition is proved beyond argument. Royal Opera, Covent Garden: in repertory until May 7</p>

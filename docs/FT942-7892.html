			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Poland in debt buy-back offer Poland has offered to buy back part of its Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.6bn) debt at a price of between 41 US cents and 38 US cents to the dollar, in a financing plan sent out to western commercial banks at the weekend. The buy-back offer covering 5 per cent of the amount owed is to be presented to holders of Polish debt at meetings in Frankfurt, Paris, London and New York beginning at the end of this month and Poland expects to have answers from its creditors by June 29. The framework for the proposals was negotiated last March in an agreement which foresaw an overall reduction in the debt amounting to between 42 per cent and 45 per cent. The proposals sent out see Poland issuing par and discount bonds and include provisions for the buy back as well as opening the way for debt-for-equity swaps. The proposals have the tacit backing of the banks which negotiated the agreement. The price of Polish debt reached 39.5 cents to the dollar on the news of the proposals, up from 37 cents at the end of last week. The price of Polish debt went as high as 52 cents early this year. Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that he intended to follow up the debt reduction deal expected to be completed this autumn with 'bold' proposals on swapping the remaining Polish debt for equity in state sector enterprises.</p>

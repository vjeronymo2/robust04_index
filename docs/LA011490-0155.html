			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE IRVINE CO.'S PLAN FOR A BIGGER EAST ORANGE  </P> <P> Re the East Orange petition drive: I applaud Dottie Thrdecek, Terri Sargeant,  Sharon Seibert and everyone else who is working to see that all city of Orange  residents have a chance to vote on the future of their city and the quality of  their lives.  </P> <P> It is unfortunate that all Orange County residents will not have the chance to  vote on the East Orange development and others like it.  </P> <P> The 12,350 homes, 347,000 additional daily car trips, destruction of natural  open space and wildlife habitat, crushing gridlock and unhealthful air will  affect everyone who lives in Orange County.  </P> <P> Add to this the tens of thousands of homes planned and under construction in  Orange and Riverside counties, the three new freeways and proposed private toll  roads, paid for by fees on more development, and we are looking at the last of  Orange County as we now know it. That may make the Irvine Co. fatter and  happier, but it will leave you and me in the middle of paradise lost.  </P> <P> LAURA AUNAN  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICARE FEES  </P> <P> As I continue to read of the impending alteration of Medicare reimbursement to  physicians, I get more and more angry (Part A, Nov. 21). If any other  profession was as bizarrely regulated as is medicine, the resultant uproar  would be deafening. I certainly can understand the government's interest in  protecting the poor and disabled in society, but it seems intent on legislating  with a bulldozer to affect the billing of all my patients. Of course the  private insurers, who are the real crooks, will quickly follow suit.  </P> <P> If it were legislated that I take care of patients who are below a certain  income/asset standard for insurance only, that would be fine -- I already do  that as often as possible. However, the government has no business insuring an  older wealthy industrialist or then telling me I cannot charge him what I would  charge a younger person.  </P> <P> Many would perhaps ask if doctors do not already make too much money, and for  them to complain is merely indicative of their greed. I don't know how to judge  how much is too much, but if you compare what a physician earns relative to a  good attorney or CEO, especially when you consider the 24-hour calls and years  of schooling, I think medical care in the United States is a bargain.  </P> <P> Of course, I may be getting worked up over nothing -- if Congress implements  the current recommendations with its usual alacrity, I may be retired prior to  its taking effect. And those guys want a raise!  </P> <P> JAMES DITCHIK, M.D.  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> LA CONICA  </P> <P> YES, THERE IS something laconic about La Conica, the copper- bottomed,  stainless-steel espresso coffee maker with a lid that resembles the Tin Man's  conical helmet from "The Wizard of Oz." Introduced in 1984, Milanese architect  Aldo Rossi's design was an instant classic. As an architect, Rossi talks more  than he builds. But he's become a household name in design-conscious circles  for his filter and espresso coffeepots and percolators, including La Conica's  "male" counterpart, a tea kettle named Il Conico (1986). They're all  manufactured by the Italian firm Alessi, the people who brought you kettles by  Michael Graves (with the bird whistle) and Richard Sapper (with a musical  whistle). What distinguishes Rossi's creation from the others is its sense of  monumentality -- remarkable in such a small object -- deriving from his use of  simple elements: a cylinder, a cone and the little ball on top.  </P> <P> Those geometric forms also pay homage in a pithy (or, to use Rossi's pun,  laconic) way to the painter Giorgio de' Chirico, whose surrealist canvases  painted in the 1920s Rossi acknowledges as a major influence. Very fashionable  now (they've even motivated advertising-agency art directors), these gloomy  scenes bear evocative titles such as "The mystery and melancholy of the  street," and typically depict endless bare arcades, punctuated by a lonely  tower.  </P> <P> That proverbial de' Chirico tower got under Rossi's skin. It inspired, for  instance, his famous Teatro del Mondo, a small floating theater for the 1979  Venice Biennale that became a key building in the postmodern movement. In turn,  Rossi's tower stimulated similar efforts by other big-name architects such as  Michael Graves (the light monitors of his San Juan Capistrano Library) and  Barton Myers (the Cerritos Performing Arts Center, under construction). Now  Alessi has seemingly taken those de' Chirico-ancestored towers, put them in a  sci-fi reducing machine and placed them on our breakfast tables.  </P> <P>  La Conica is available at Details, the Museum of Contemporary Art Book Store,  and Lynne Deutch Limited in Los Angeles; Zero Minus Plus in Santa Monica, and  Pannikin in San Diego.  </P></p>

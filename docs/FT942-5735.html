			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Jobs priority at OECD and G7 meetings With 35m unemployed in the industrial world, it is no surprise that jobs will be topping the agenda of next week's annual ministerial meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the economic summit of the Group of Seven nations in Naples in July. Underpinning the discussions of ministers of finance, labour, trade and foreign affairs from the 25 OECD member states next Tuesday and Wednesday will be an in-depth study by the OECD secretariat, containing 57 detailed recommendations, intended to form the basis of tailor-made policy programmes for individual member states. Virtually all OECD member states face unemployment problems of some sort, which the OECD believes rest in an insufficient ability to adapt to a fast-changing world economy. The OECD study, two years in the making and to be published late next Tuesday, puts the jobless problem in the context of globalisation and technological change, forces which have undermined many traditional patterns of work and overwhelmed many long-established responses to unemployment. The paper's main recommendations are expected to detail how to: Enhance creativity and diffuse technical know-how. The OECD believes its members need to encourage high-wage jobs with high productivity, and that it is more important for countries to diffuse new technologies than create them. Increase flexibility of working hours. The paper will stress many workers no longer need to be pinned down to traditional working hours in office or factory because new technology allows them to work from home. Many households have two earners and not all workers want to work full time. But the study will warn against governments imposing work sharing. Encourage a more entrepreneurial climate in many member states. OECD economists have been struck by the ease with which companies can be set up in the US compared with parts of Europe. Increase flexibility of wages and labour costs. Potentially, this is one of the most contentious areas of the report. The US has created far more jobs than Europe, but at the cost, critics say, of creating poverty in work for the unskilled. The OECD will focus on non-wage labour costs, such as employers' social security payments, which are very high in many European countries which also have inflexible wages. It believes employment can be created in such countries if non-wage costs are cut and the resulting gap in government finances plugged through other taxes. But in the US, where wages are flexible and non-wage costs are low, increased levies, to cover health-care for example, should not hit employment. Weaken employment protection legislation, which has the perverse effect of discouraging job creation. This is a particular problem in some European countries such as Spain, Ireland, France and Italy. Encourage active labour market policies that link unemployment benefit with seeking a job or training. The OECD is convinced paying people for doing nothing is damaging. Improve the overall competence of labour. This goes beyond vocational training to ensuring member states have suitable school curricula. Overhaul, where necessary, the interaction of the labour market and social benefit systems to ensure help is targeted where it is needed and benefits do not act as a disincentive to job seeking and job creation. The OECD paper will tell governments to maintain solid macroeconomic policies based on low inflation, sound public finances and sufficient savings to sustain investment.</p>

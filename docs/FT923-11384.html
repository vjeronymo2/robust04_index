			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar down on policy unease THE DOLLAR drifted lower on the foreign exchanges yesterday as dealers started to think that central banks in the US and Europe might not be ready to intervene again to keep the currency above its all-time low, writes James Blitz. Monday's concerted central bank intervention took the dollar up to a high of DM1.5020 the following day. But, since then, its effects have started to wear off and the US currency was yesterday testing a low on the day of DM1.4810. There is still no clear indication as to whether the central banks have a policy on the dollar. Yesterday, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said Monday's intervention had been well-timed and highly successful. But dealers may have been affected by a comment from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a biannual testimonial on Wednesday that the Fed has no firm target for the dollar's exchange rate. This underlines suggestions made by some analysts that the intervention was prompted by the British, French and Italian central banks, rather than the US. 'The Europeans had so much more to gain from the move than the US,' said one analyst yesterday. Another indicator suggesting that the US economy is in sluggish shape did not help sentiment: the latest weekly survey of US jobless claims rose by 19,000. The dollar ended the day  1/2 pfennig down from its previous close, at DM1.4830. In New York the US unit ended a shade lower at DM1.4820. Sterling closed firmer against the D-Mark for the first time this week, finishing  1/2 pfennig up at DM2.8375. However, sentiment towards the pound was still bearish. The most serious factor affecting the currency yesterday was the Bank of Spain's decision to raise interest rates by 60 basis points to 13 per cent. The move puts more pressure on the UK to tighten monetary policy in order to remain within its permitted limits against the D-Mark in the European Monetary System. The decision by Mr John Major's government to tighten controls on public spending did not seem a factor in the pound's rise. 'It may have helped a little,' said one dealer. 'But the view in the market is that this government has talked tough on monetary policy before without doing anything, and this may be more of the same.' Nevertheless, sterling's performance was not matched by other currencies. The Italian lira softened to L758.6 per D-Mark from a previous close in London of L758.2. The French franc firmed slightly against the German unit to FFr3.377 from Wednesday's FFr3.378 finish. Only the Spanish peseta showed a notable rise, finishing at Pta63.78 to the D-Mark, after a previous Pta64.10.</p>

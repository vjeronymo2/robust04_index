			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Ex-minister on Mafia charge Mr Antonio Gava (left), a former Christian Democrat interior minister and an important political figure in Naples, was yesterday arrested on charges of alleged association with the Camorra, the Neapolitan Mafia. The arrest was one of 76 ordered by Naples magistrates on charges of association with the Camorra. As interior minister from 1988-92, Mr Gava had direct control over the fight against the Mafia. Earlier in 1987 as finance minister he had responsibility for the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. Mr Gava is alleged to have developed his Camorra links in the early 1980s in the wake of the transfer of vast funds to Naples and the surrounding region to make good the damage caused by the devastating Irpinia earthquake. These funds were diverted for political use and business investment which required Mafia protection, the magistrates allege. In return for such protection the politicians, allegedly headed by Mr Gava, provided political cover for the Camorra. Yesterday Mr Gava's lawyer expressed surprise at the arrest and claimed the charges were unspecific and lacked foundation.</p>

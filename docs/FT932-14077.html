			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Spanish governor warns on currencies EUROPE faces further exchange rate instability because of the combination of weak growth prospects and high German interest rates, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, said yesterday. In unusually frank comments, Mr Rojo said European governments had been two years too late in efforts to head off recent currency market instability. They had also made important technical mistakes in drafting the Maastricht treaty. Mr Rojo said it 'was not easy' to suggest how Europe might address its mounting economic difficulties. 'We will just have to wait and see if the elements of disturbance are overcome,' he said. The remarks by Mr Rojo underline worries in financial markets that Europe might soon experience another period of currency strains, after the run of realignments in the European exchange rate mechanism which saw the peseta devalued twice and forced Britain and Italy out of the system. Mr Rojo said 'possible problems' were piling up, including the second Danish referendum on European integration on May 18, the June 6 Spanish general election and the impending decision in Britain on ratifying the Maastricht treaty. Meanwhile, high German interest rates were making it harder for ERM countries, including Spain, to cut interest rates to head off economic slowdown. Mr Rojo, a highly-regarded former economics professor who took over as Bank governor last July after a spell as deputy governor, said Spain had little option but to keep short-term interest rates at around 13 per cent even though output growth this year is likely to be less than 1 per cent. Europe should have had the foresight two years ago to revalue the D-Mark upwards because of the inflationary pressures sparked by German unification, Mr Rojo said. It also should have omitted from the Maastricht treaty any numerical definition of the convergence limits for fiscal policy which 'created confusion' and were a 'restrictive element'. The governor was referring to the goal of keeping government deficits to less than 3 per cent of GDP and state borrowing to less than 60 per cent. He said he thought the Bundesbank would 'make substantial cuts' in German interest rates later this year. 'But the problem is the timing. It seems the cuts will be quite slow and as a result there will be further difficulties for some months.'</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / University research income increases RESEARCH AND contract income generated by British universities is growing at more than Pounds 100m a year, but their student-staff ratio is worsening, according to figures published today by the Universities Statistical Record (USR). Between 1988-89 and 1989-90 universities' total income from research grants and contracts grew by 20 per cent, from Pounds 629m to Pounds 752m. Of that sum, income from overseas organisations - including the European Community - increased by one third, with funds from research councils rising 23 per cent and those from UK-based charitable bodies increasing 18 per cent. Over the same year universities' total revenue grew by 14 per cent, from Pounds 3.41bn to Pounds 3.89bn. Almost half came from direct government grants, with 14 per cent from student fees and support grants, 7 per cent from research councils and a similar proportion from residences and catering. Student numbers increased by 6 per cent over the year to 382,000, but the number of full-time academic and academic-related staff grew only 3.7 per cent, to 58,480 - evidence of a progressive increase in the student-staff ratio, now about 12:1. The USR also reports strong growth in continuing education. It says the number of courses and student enrolments rose by more than 40 per cent in the five years to 1990.

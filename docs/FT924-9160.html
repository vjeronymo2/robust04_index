			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Challenge to cable TV law TIME Warner, the US media and entertainment group, yesterday filed a lawsuit against the US government and the Federal Communications Commission, seeking to declare a cable television regulatory law unconstitutional, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The lawsuit claims the new regulations - passed in October, over the veto of President George Bush - violate First Amendment rights of free speech. There is increasing opposition to the law among US cable operators, who fear their ability to charge higher rates to consumers will be hit.</p>

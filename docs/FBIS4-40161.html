			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun -- Russia is prepared in the near  future to sign a framework document of the Partnership for Peace  initiative together with a program of full-scale cooperation  with NATO. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this here today  by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the conclusion of  talks with Mikhail Popov, his Moldovan counterpart. From  Moscow's point of view, the Russian minister added, as far as  deciding this particular question was concerned, it might be a  matter of days, or even hours, rather than weeks.    Now, said Kozyrev, everything depends on how fast we receive  a reply signal from Brussels to activate both the framework  document and the Russia-NATO program, whose main principles were  presented to the NATO leadership by Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev. According to Kozyrev, the program of cooperation  with NATO is a very full of documents, which reflects Russia's  importance in international affairs and the specific nature of  its relations with the NATO, "without any mutual vetoes or  surprises."    The Moldovan minister told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that  his country, which signed the framework document in March of  this year, also plans to submit to NATO in the near future a  program of individual cooperation. Talking about the advantages  Moldova will gain from participating in the Partnership for  Peace programme, Popov noted in particular that if the republic  finds itself under threat from outside, it will be able to hold  consultations with NATO the in the interest of strengthening  stability and national security.</p>

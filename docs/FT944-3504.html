			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / People: Allied Leisure's team 'in place' Allied Leisure, the ten-pin bowling group, hopes to have ended a year of boardroom upheavals with the appointments of Neil Goulden, as managing director, and Peter Molony as a non-executive. Directors have been falling like skittles at Allied, which lost its chief executive and other directors this year as it plunged into the red. In September, it reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 30.1m for the 48 weeks to June 19 after withdrawing from its nightclub businesses to refocus on its ten-pin bowling operations. Ken Scobie, who resigned as chief executive of Brent Walker in January 1993, was appointed part-time chairman in September, replacing William Davis. Damien Harte, appointed finance director just over a year ago, said yesterday that Allied's management team is now complete. Goulden's major task would be to consolidate the core bowling business and take it forward. Goulden, 41, is currently chief executive at Letheby &amp; Christopher, the division of Compass that specialises in sports and event catering. During his six-year tenure, Letheby's turnover has doubled to Pounds 40m. His 20-year experience of the leisure industry includes stints with Ladbroke and with Grand Metropolitan at the Chef &amp; Brewer and Berni Inns chains. Bowling contributes less than half Allied's turnover, which is made up from food and drink operations, and from video machines. Molony, who was the longest serving member of the Rolls-Royce board when he left in 1986, previously worked as finance director of Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries and as Accountant General to the Post Office.</p>

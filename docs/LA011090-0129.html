			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHE DISCOVERS RECORDS ARE MADE TO BE CONFUSING  </P> <P> In fairy tales, some prince is always inheriting some throne or kingdom, only  to have a brother emerge as the rightful heir.  </P> <P> High school basketball records can be a lot like that.  </P> <P> Just ask Debbie Fischer of Edison High School. Fischer apparently set a  Southern Section record for making the most three-point baskets in a game. In a  Dec. 14 victory over Corona, Fischer sank 10 three-point shots.  </P> <P> The Southern Section lists Marilyn Robinson of Pasadena and Chiemi Morita of  Hacienda Heights Wilson as sharing the record with eight three-pointers. But  that was only the reported record.  </P> <P> Kathy Lizarraga, now at UC Irvine, apparently set a section and state record  last season with 12 three-pointers when she scored 46 points for Calexico in a  61-48 victory over Fallbrook, according to Mark Tennis of Cal-Hi Sports  magazine.  </P> <P> Tennis said he established the record from a report of the game in the San  Diego Union, which reported that Lizarraga was 12 of 15 from the floor and had  made 12 three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Cal-Hi is a weekly magazine that compiles state rankings, statistical leaders  and records for high school sports.  </P> <P> "Any time you're dealing with boys' and girls' records and dealing with  hundreds of schools and thousands of games, there are going to be slip-ups,"  Tennis said. "That is why we always say it is a reported record because there  is always a chance, however slim, that there is an unreported total out there."  </P> <P> Tennis said the reason his magazine and many of the CIF sections have different  records is because he will take newspaper accounts as proof of a performance.  The CIF sections often depend on written notice from the schools.  </P> <P> The Southern Section asks its members to return a form listing record-setting  performances.  </P> <P> "We have 475 member schools in our section and geographically we range from the  Mexican border to Paso Robles," said Scott Cathcart, a Southern Section  spokesman. "It is impossible for us to keep track of everything that happens,  so we ask our schools to provide us with that information.  </P> <P> "I still haven't been contacted by the school concerning (Lizarraga's record).  I don't doubt that she did it or anything but that is how our process works."  </P></p>

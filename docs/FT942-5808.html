			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei tops 21,000 for first time in 1994 Equities extended their run to a fourth consecutive high for the year, the Nikkei 225 average closing above the technically significant 21,000 mark for the first time since last September, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The index gained 79.52 at 21,053.11, within striking distance of last year's peak of 21,148.11, after a day's high of 21,090.72 and low of 20,896.38. First section volume on the TSE was estimated at 700m shares and winners outnumbered losers by 613 to 419, with 158 issues unchanged. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 average ended at 309.89, up 2.10, and the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 11.08 to 1.693.58. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.41 at 1,405.42. The market moved higher at the opening as foreign buyers returned after Monday's holidays in New York and London. With some exceptions, domestic institutions and arbitrageurs continued to sell throughout much of the morning, but they were no match for foreign investors. Trading was characterised by active demand for highly priced high-technology shares, encouraged by a government panel's report yesterday which advised governmental investment in fibre-optic infrastructure to create a national multimedia network. Fujitsu, a world leader in fibre-optic switching systems, put on Y30 at Y1,130. Other multimedia-oriented companies also gained ground. NTT, positioned to be a leader in the expansion of the nation's telecommunications infrastructure, advanced Y27,000 to Y892,000. Heavy electricals were also mostly higher, Hitachi rising Y20 to Y1100. Oil shares moved up on a broad front, supported by higher prices for crude oil and projections that China's need for oil would increase as its economy expands. Nippon Oil moved forward Y18 to Y778 and Japan Energy finished at Y458, up Y9. In Osaka the OSE average rose 148.83 to 23,311.19, with 40.9m shares changing hands. OSE volume for May was 36.5 per cent higher than in April, reaching 579.6m shares. Roundup Sentiment in the region was mixed to better, with selectivity in evidence. MANILA climbed by 2.7 per cent on a higher than expected GNP growth rate, a late rally in an already bullish market driving the composite index up by 83.67 to 3,114.44 after a bout of profit-taking. GNP-related stocks were favoured, with San Miguel 'A' shares up 4.9 per cent to 107 pesos and Meralco 'A' 3.3 per cent better at 312.50 pesos. SYDNEY recovered on economic data, rising futures and stronger commodity and gold prices, the All Ordinaries index closing 15.4 firmer at 2,097.2 in turnover of ADollars 456.2m. Brokers said that while the 1.9 per cent rise in March GDP was not good for bonds, it fuelled buying of equities because of the prospect of higher company earnings. Among resource stocks, CRA jumped 26 cents to ADollars 18.36, Western Mining climbed 10 cents to ADollars 7.80 and MIM added 4 cents at ADollars 3.17. TAIPEI saw waves of buying in electronics shares which pushed the weighted index up by 69.89, or 1.2 per cent, to 5,961.45 as turnover increased from TDollars 53.96bn to TDollars 63.03bn. Rises in electronics were led by the leading computer manufacturer Acer, TDollars 2.50 stronger at TDollars 66.50 on newspaper reports of a higher 1994 profits target. Petrochemical issues also attracted buying, on expectations of higher product prices. China Petrochemical was up TDollars 1.20 at TDollars 28.10 and Union Petrochemical advanced TDollars 2.80 to TDollars 44.20. BANGKOK featured banks and building materials as the SET index moved ahead 11.48 to 1,368.35 in turnover of Bt6.7bn. The banking sector rose 2.55 per cent. HONG KONG was subdued on a lack of domestic news and the absence of foreign initiatives, the Hang Seng index declining 41.49 to 9,512.07 as turnover recovered from HKDollars 3.21bn to HKDollars 3.97bn. SINGAPORE fell as general sentiment was weakened by retail margin selling in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 13.79 to 2,267.88. Volume came to 110.45m shares. Singapore Press foreign shed SDollars 1 to SDollars 26 and Sembawang Corp 80 cents to SDollars 12. KUALA LUMPUR dropped 1.1 per cent on forced selling linked to margin calls by stockbrokers, the KLSE composite index closing 10.93 down at 982.80. after hitting an intraday low of 976.26. SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive session, depressed by institutional inactivity and by worries about North Korea's nuclear programme. The composite stock index dipped 6.72 to 932.77. Reports that an international sanction against North Korea was imminent, and that Pyongyang had test-fired a missile over the Sea of Japan on Tuesday, brought an extra chill to sentiment.</p>

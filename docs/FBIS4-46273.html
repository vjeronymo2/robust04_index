			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Citizen Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz  Ahmad was killed and his father injured when a strange object  exploded while they were buying scrap metal from Sabri Sayyid  Abu-Zayd, a scrap metal dealer in the eastern part of al-Qanatir  al-Khayriyah.    A responsible security source from the Interior Ministry  stated that the incident took place in the town of Kafr  al-Dawwar at 1430 when the two citizens were inspecting various  pieces of metal. They found a strange metal object which looks  like the armature of a car with a wire attached to it. Upon  pulling the wire, the metal piece exploded.    The salesman gathered the three similar-looking pieces and  threw them into the water canal. Security men retrieved and  detonated them.    The security source said it is clear that these metal  objects  are explosives marked with "45 military offensive." The metal  pieces have been seized.    A report has been prepared on the incident and the northern  military region of Alexandria has been notified so an explosives  expert can come down to take the necessary measures regarding  the seized bombs.</p>

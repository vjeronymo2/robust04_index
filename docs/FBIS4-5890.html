Increasing DRAM Standing as a Strategic Commodity    3. Demand for Improvements in Efficiency    Introduction    In the midst of an unprecedented slump, the industrial world  is undergoing extensive restructuring through the elimination of  unprofitable units, cutbacks in investments in plants and  equipment, personnel reductions, plant closures, and other such  measures. This downsizing has even touched what has been  considered until now "sacred ground"--namely, research and  development. In order for a country like Japan without any  notable natural resources to continue its prosperity into the  21st century, however, there is no alternative but to give  technology a central place in its industries. It is an  undeniable fact that excessive restructuring will destroy its  global competitiveness. A case in point is the dynamic  random-access memory (DRAM) industry, which is one of Japan's  representative high-technology fields. As investment costs soar,  outsiders and not a few industry insiders have begun to voice  their concerns about its future. There is also concern about the  narrowing gap between Korea and Japan. In the following  sections, the authors have sorted through some of the problem  points that face the industry while giving their projections  about its future direction.    1. Current Problems Surrounding the DRAM Industry    "Semiconductor integrated circuit" (IC) is really a  collective term that covers a broad area. Roughly divided, it  covers logic devices, such as the chips that perform the  "logical decisions" of a computer, and memory devices, which  store information. Microprocessor units (MPU's), which are the  processing and control units in computers, are typical of the  former; DRAM, the subject of this article, is typical of the  latter.    Since entering the DRAM market in the latter half of the  1960's, Japanese manufacturers, as part of a national effort,  have steadily built up their strength by making full use of  Japan's superior manufacturing technology and, in 1982, finally  moved ahead of the United States to place first in the world in  their field. However, when the supply-and-demand balance for  4-megabit DRAM memory (hereafter, 4M), collapsed after a  better-than-expected start, problems such as those discussed  below suddenly came to the surface, bringing with them serious  concerns about the industry's future.    A.. Soaring Investment Costs    The first problem is rising investment costs. Generally,  heavy investments in equipment are needed to manufacture  integrated circuits, but the burden is even greater when it  comes to DRAM and even heavier still for improvements in levels  of integration. The reason is that, compared to MPUs, where the  "soft" aspects of circuit design are of the greatest importance,  in the case of dynamic random access memory, higher value-added  is sought on the "hard" side--in other words, in finding ways to  integrate more memory elements on a fixed surface--and  production is always being carried out with investments in the  latest processing technology and equipment. Every three to four  years, the level of integration for DRAM chips increases  fourfold, an improvement which requires a higher degree of  precision and complexity in the manufacturing process. Capital  investments for the standard DRAM plant[.sup]1[/], adequate  at the 30 billion yen level for 1 megabit of DRAM memory,  increased to 50 billion yen for 4 megabits and to 80 to 90  billion yen for 16 megabits and may even go as high as 100  billion yen for 64 megabits. It is unclear what the investment  efficiency is for individual DRAM businesses, but certainly  efficiency is getting poorer with these increasingly enormous  amounts of capital outlay, and many in the business are  concerned whether they can turn a profit.    B. Korea's Rise to Prominence    Second, there is Korea and the speed with which its  enterprises are catching up with Japanese's DRAM industry.  Although Korea entered the field only in the mid-1980's, its  three zaibatsu-affiliated companies (Samsung  Electronics, Gold Star and Hyundai Ltd.), backed by a wealth of  funds, have been pouring their investment dollars into the DRAM  field. As a result, in terms of today's leading 4-megabit DRAM  chip, Korea is said to be "shoulder-to-shoulder with Japan in  mass production technology." In terms of volume, Korea has  caught up with the United States and is second only to Japan. An  "export drive"--where Korean companies are exporting products to  the United States at prices 10 percent or so cheaper than  Japanese goods--seems to be an important factor here, and many  people share the pessimistic view that Japan will be  outdistanced by the Koreans some day in the same way that Japan  earlier took the lead over the United States. With products like  dynamic random-access memory, manufacturers are not only faced  with the struggle to improve precision and use the latest  technology but, since generations change every three to four  years, their products very quickly become out-dated, and the  existence of a low-cost player who can rapidly bring down prices  represents a very big threat.    C. Rising Investment Risk    Investment risks have gotten higher primarily because of  technological advances. The need for higher integration has  always preceded the birth of DRAM chips. Before, if technology  failed to keep pace with new needs, manufacturers could put  money into developing new products without all that great a  risk. With the coming of the "mega" age, however, that has  changed. With a lot of experience and development know-how  behind them, manufacturers have been able to shorten the time it  takes to develop new products and to calculate when to make such  investments. For DRAM, a product which uses the latest  technology, experience brings with it a rapid improvement in  yield during the initial period of production. This gives rise  to the kind of phenomenon or pattern one always sees; namely, a  temporary imbalance is effected between supply and demand, which  in turn causes prices to drop sharply. It becomes quite  significant, then, that it has become possible for manufacturers  to manipulate their timing. It is commonly known that when it  came time for 1-megabit DRAM, while the majority of companies  were reluctant to invest during the recession, others, by  investing aggressively, were able to enjoy large profits during  the initial period when the market was still undersupplied. The  opposite happened with 4-megabit DRAM. Not wanting to repeat the  mistake they had made with 1M DRAM, companies all rushed ahead  to invest. Unfortunately, this happened to be an "off-crop"  season for new electronic products, and in addition to widening  the supply-and-demand gap through their own making, they brought  about a large drop in profits. This happened recently enough to  still be fresh in the industry's memory. In a word, the fact  that manufacturers could manipulate their investment timing  worked against them, giving rise to a situation where they could  easily be influenced by the moves of every other player. This in  turn has raised investment risks in the DRAM industry.    2. Increasing DRAM Standing as a Strategic  Commodity    As these problems became clear, companies have adopt  plans--for example, to expand their application-specific  integrated circuit (ASIC) and MPU units--which are intended to  "break [their] reliance on DRAM." In industrial circles, there  is deep-rooted skepticism about the value of the DRAM industry  itself, and one commonly hears criticisms that "DRAM is not a  moneymaker" or "DRAM is low-level technology." However, one  would have to say that too light a view of the DRAM industry is  not only economically very dangerous but also strategically very  dangerous.    A. High-Growth in DRAM Demand Expected    First of all, even compared to other semiconductors, DRAM  will continue to be a high-growth product. That is because the  demand for more bits (one bit, it will be remembered, is a  single memory cell, or unit) is a demand for devices with larger  memory capacity, which is essentially a demand for more DRAM,  and this demand is expected to continue to show a high level of  growth. Because they were disappointed in their expectations of  the 4M during its initial period on the market, many  manufacturers felt that "the need for higher integration might  be on the decline." But, as mentioned earlier, the problem was  mainly on the supply-side, and in fact, there have not been any  signs since then of a slowdown in the growth in bit-demand. On  the contrary, besides expecting to see more in the way of an  information society in the future, one can expect to see  "downsizing"--the shift toward smaller equipment--become the  main current in computers. For example, if users shift from  mainframes (which cost 500 million yen on average and have 8  gigabits of memory) to personal computers (costing 300,000 yen,  with 32 megabits of memory), the total memory per unit price  (bits/price) increases about sevenfold, clearly showing that the  same investment dollar buys much more in the way of DRAM memory.  In fact, if we compare the amount of DRAM required by these two  types of equipment for the years 1987 and 1992, we see that  personal computers have significantly boosted the demand for  memory. It is projected that in the future the amount of memory  required by computers will increase sharply as MPUs and software  improve[.sup]2[/]. Certainly, it would not be an exaggeration  to say the "age of large DRAM memory consumption" is coming. In  fact, taking time trends over the past 10 years to estimate the  growth rate over the next five years[.sup]3[/], the authors  projected that demand will still continue to grow at around 46  percent on average.    It seems that growth of 20-30 percent in the money base can  also be anticipated. Of course, there will probably still be a  sharp drop in production; this seems to be unavoidable when  there is a changeover from one generation to the next one.  Generally, the shift to a new generation occurs when users feel  it is to their advance to use a next-generation product rather  than an existing product. The pattern with DRAM chips, because  of improvements in yield, shows that next-generation DRAM prices  (i.e., the unit price per bit) will move sharply downward,  falling below prices for existing generation DRAMs when the  older and newer generations cross paths (bit-cross). But,  besides expecting the price of both generation DRAM's to drop,  one also expects to see production volume [as measured in  dollars or yen] fall below levels attained during the heyday of  the outgoing, previous-generation DRAM. The reason is that there  will be less demand for the outgoing generation of DRAM chips as  users shift to newer products having four times as much memory  capacity; on the other hand, demand for newer products will not  grow sufficiently to make up for this decline. It is the  essential nature of the DRAM industry that this pattern of  generational change will keep repeating itself, and around each  changing of the guard this kind of dip will probably occur.  However, looked at in medium and long-range terms, DRAM  production [as measured in dollars or yen], sustained by a  growth in bit-demand, can be expected to continue to show  double-digit growth[.sup]4[/], and when considered in terms  of semiconductors as a whole, can be expected to maintain a high  level of growth, second only to that of MPU's.    B. Spread Effects From DRAM Industry    Another reason for aggressively developing Japan's DRAM  industry can be seen when one considers the strategic importance  of this industry and the beneficial spread effects its  development will have on the semiconductor industry as a whole.    As mentioned earlier, DRAM utilizes the latest semiconductor  manufacturing processes, and by maintaining the field, Japanese  manufacturers are sustaining the world's top manufacturing  technology. It is not a matter simply of the technology being  new. By putting to use manufacturing technology acquired during  DRAM production or by utilizing manufacturing equipment that has  already been paid off through DRAM production, they will make it  possible to manufacture products other than DRAMs smoothly and  at low cost. In that sense, DRAM continues to be the  "foundation" of semiconductor production and Japan's "engine of  technology."    Another trend that has been attracting attention in  particular these days is the increasing demand for more advanced  manufacturing technology for high-growth microprocessing units.  During these past several years, there have been remarkable  improvements in MPU performance. But higher performance also  means more complicated circuits and, inevitably, higher levels  of integration and, thus, more investment dollars. According to  estimates, total investments for the microprocessing giant  Intel's next-generation MPU's, including the cost of  manufacturing more units, will reach 500 billion yen, or 20  times the cost of its current MPU's. (Investment in the  4-megabit DRAM developed by Japan's top manufacturer totals  about 200 billion yen.) On the other hand, more manufacturers  are entering the MPU field. Thus, the price competition among  them is heating up, and even in the case of MPU's, which are  considered a typical high-value-added product, an important  question that has started to be raised is how businesses can  hold down plant and equipment investment costs and manufacture  their products cheaply. In short, even in circuit design (the  "soft" side of the coin), superior manufacturing technology is  needed and without it, MPU businesses have become increasingly  likely to fail. In fact, barring only a few exceptions, American  manufacturers who have withdrawn from the DRAM  business[.sup]5[/] are said to be having a very tough time  making MPUs. This, then, may be an opportune time for Japanese  semiconductor makers to give full play to the production  technology they have built up and their proficiency in  manufacturing products while achieving a good yield. Of course,  even if Japan does try to enter the field, it is still behind in  terms of the software that is necessary for MPU production and  it will not immediately be competitive in the MPU field. But,  clearly, it would be to Japan's advantage to build up its  strength in those areas, such as microprocessors, where it is  lagging behind the United States and, in the meantime, expand  its efforts in "second source" enterprises to manufacture MPU's  under license from American makers. While contributing its  production know-how, it will also be gaining additional MPU  know-how.    Needless to say, aggressive investments in development are  the best way to widen the gap between Japan and Korean  competitors who are close on its heels. Certainly, Korean  manufacturers have rapidly gained strength and, according to  some analysts, will be bigger suppliers of the next-generation  16M than Japan. But it is also a fact that a gap still exists  between the two countries, and if Japanese makers continue to  invest as they have until now, it is fully possible that Japan  will be able to maintain its present edge. One reason is that  Korean manufacturers are still heavily dependent on Japanese and  American technology. They are currently paying out over 10  percent of their sales for patent licenses, several percent  points higher than what Japan is paying, and are said to be  planning to continue aggressively importing new technology in  the future. As can be seen, too, in the fact that Koreans are  behind in circuit design technology, a point that will be  touched on later in this report, Japan can still be considered  ahead of Korea in terms of technology. Nor has Korea nurtured  the growth of its semiconductor equipment manufacturing  industry. Recently, joint development has been moving forward  between Japanese and American semiconductor equipment makers,  but just as the underdevelopment of the parts sector has become  a weak point in Korea's consumer electronics industry, the lack  of its own, domestic semiconductor equipment industry, the  foundation for other related industries, is a major weakness.  Thus, Korean manufacturers still have not shaken themselves free  of their position as "trailers after Japan." What seems to be  essential in order for Japan to maintain this lead are  investments in the DRAM industry.    Thus, the DRAM industry in Japan is faced with a number of  problems. But as the competition among countries heats up,  rather than losing its importance as a product that Japan has  led the field with until now, dynamic random access memory is  becoming even more important for Japan than ever before. The new  turn taken in the direction of MPU's is definitely not a  mistake. Given the fact that Japan is still not fully  competitive in this area, its semiconductor industry cannot  continue to develop and prosper without the development of  enterprises where the DRAM remains the core product.    3. Demand for Improved Efficiency    Future plans must then address the question of how the  operations of the DRAM industry can be carried out more  efficiently[.sup]6[/]. Steps already being taken by companies  are described below.    A. Keeping Investment Costs Down    The first step is to hold investment costs down as much as  possible. In order to achieve the kind of fast-paced, fourfold  improvements that have occurred in integration every three to  four years, it has become necessary for companies to invest  aggressively in research and development, but with the "mega"  age, the huge cost of development is climbing even higher.  Companies are thus actively going into joint development  projects--primarily with U.S. manufacturers--in an attempt to  cut back even a little on their investment costs.    Increasingly popular also is the move seen among  manufacturing plants to use their equipment and facilities in  common to the extent possible and to use the same equipment for  two or more DRAM generations. Manufacturers have already been  setting up [assembly] lines to introduce new, next-generation  technology during the latter half of the preceding generation's  lifetime and creating the flexibility to produce two generations  of DRAM. Recently, they have also been trying to cut down on  costs by designing their plants and equipment (with the  exception of those used for precision processing) so they can be  used from one generation to the next. They have also been trying  to cut costs by eliminating whatever differences they can in the  methods used by different plants, which have operated in the  past in all but a disjointed, uncoordinated fashion. Moreover,  in areas where manufacturers have been competitively near  equals, there has even been a move to standardize equipment  across companies. Thus, it is not an exaggeration to say that  "economization" has now become a key word for every company.    B. Controlling Supply Quantities; Seeds of Such a Technology  Are Beginning To Sprout    As mentioned earlier, when the balance between supply and  demand is upset during the start-up period, it leads to a steep  drop in prices which, in turn, has a negative effect on profits.  To avoid such situations as much as possible, companies have  aggressively been looking into technology to control supply in  terms of quantity, or volume. Typical of such technology is the  single-wafer processing method; here, in the manufacturing  process, silicon wafers (on which circuits are to be etched) are  processed one piece at a time. In the "batch method," the main  method used at present, 50 to 150 pieces are processed in one  lot, leading to rapid improvement in yield along with a greater  supply [of silicon chips] than may have been expected. This is  one of the major reasons that the gap between supply and demand  widens. By contrast, with the introduction of the single-wafer  method, it becomes possible to a greater extent than at present  to control supply quantities while achieving higher yields.  Understandably, companies are thus moving ahead with  preparations to seriously introduce this method from the  64-megabit DRAM on.    C. Making DRAM a High Value-Added Product    Attempts are also being made to further establish a  segregation of niche with Korea. DRAM is typical of a product  that has a broad range of uses. And recently, as user needs have  become more diversified, headway is being made in further  diversifying DRAM's uses and turning it into an even higher  value-added product: for example, as a "low-energy consumer,"  suitable for portable [computer] terminals; as a "high-speed"  product, able to process voice and image data together in a  single lump; and as a "special purpose DRAM," where memory sits  on a single chip along with a logic circuit. In as much as such  products differ from standard products in requiring circuit  design and control technologies, it would seem that at present  it would be hard for Korea to manufacture them on a large scale;  for Japanese manufacturers, this may be an expedient way to  avoid direct competition with Korean products. For low-grade  products, manufacturers have already started to procure OEM  [original equipment manufacturing] items from Korea and are  moving into high value-added products while using Korean power  to the extent possible for these low-grade items. This move  toward creating separate niches will probably gather even more  steam as time goes by.    D. Overseas Development    Until now, overseas development has referred primarily to 1)  the opening up of markets in Europe and the United States in  order to ease trade tensions, and 2) assembly production in  Asian regions, where the aim has been to reduce the cost of  labor-intensive processing. In only a few cases has large-scale  production been carried out consistently in areas of high  demand. But with the yen's appreciation to unprecedented levels,  on the one hand, and with demand markets scattered randomly in  different regions, on the other, it has become more important  than ever for manufacturers to establish a global supply system.  As products become more diversified, shortening the geographic  distance between users and suppliers also takes on an important  meaning from the viewpoint of accurately deciphering user needs  and reducing the time for shipment and delivery. This disordered  state is still evident in the overseas strategies of companies,  but globalization is inescapable and will probably bring about a  rapid overseas shift.    Conclusion    When the situation is viewed in this way, it becomes clear  that recent perspectives on the DRAM industry often confuse its  "essentially cyclical nature" with its "strategic significance."  Certainly, the relative weight given to DRAM in Japan's  semiconductor industry is becoming less significant, dropping  from the 50 percent-and-above-level it has occupied thus far to  the 30 percent-level today. With investments increasing yearly,  it seems to some that DRAM is only becoming a heavier and  heavier burden. However, as the authors have already mentioned,  it is DRAM which continues to support Japan's semiconductor  business, and recklessly weakening this support and curbing  investments will not only lower the competitiveness of the  semiconductor industry as a whole but also shake the very  foundations of a country built on technology. In this sense,  investment strategies developed from a long-term perspective can  be seen as the very means by which to maintain a "high-tech  Japan." While caution about ballooning investment costs is  necessary, so too is a change of perspective necessary--a change  where manufacturers will be seeing "a return on their DRAM  investments through semiconductors."  Footnotes    1. The example is for standard DRAM plants which process  200,000 silicon wafers per month; with the 4-megabit DRAM chip,  currently the industry's main product, this is equivalent to a  plant which produces 3 million units per month.    2. For example, the Pentium, which [Intel] hopes will become  the main, next-generation microprocessing unit, requires about  four times more DRAM for existing equipment (see following).    3. The method used to make this estimate was as follows:    Y = 31.13701 + 233.1478x,    where Y = average change in bit-demand over a  three-year period, X = the reciprocal of the time  trend, or 1/time trend, and R[.sup]2[/] = 0.8799,  D.W. = -2.76.    4. Hypothesizing that the unit price per bit would show a  consist drop due to technological innovations, the authors  estimated unit price, using trends over the past 10 years; by  multiplying this estimated unit price by bit-demand, they came  out with a 28 percent or so growth rate in DRAM-demand over the  next 5 years. More specifically, the unit price per bit was  estimated as follows:    Y = -0.003341714 + 0.09791906x +  0.01502765d    where Y = unit price per bit and x =  reciprocal of time trend, or 1/time trend, d = dummy  variable (in 1984 and 1988, the years that 256K and 1M started  to be mass produced in earnest and the unit price of bits rose,  the value "1" was assigned to the dummy variable; "1" was not  assigned in 1991 although that was the year mass production was  started in earnest on the 4M. Because demand at the beginning  lagged, the unit price of bits fell sharply).    R[.sup]2[/] = 0.8799, D.W. = 2.76    5. With the coming of the "mega" age, American manufacturers  have withdrawn one after the other and at present, only three  companies, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and Micron Technology,  are continuing in the business. The first two are engaged in  joint development with Japanese manufacturers. In part, this  [withdrawal of companies] may be an indication that an  aggressive turn has been taken in the MPU field. The primary  reason, however, is that there are many specialist manufacturers  in the United States who have not been able to keep up with the  heavy burden of investing in equipment and research and  development. As a result, American manufacturers are behind  Japan in technological innovations and their mass-production  systems.    6. As mentioned earlier, investment efficiency for DRAM  alone  is not clear. However, recovery seems to be the underlying tone  for the semiconductor industry as a whole. According to a  leading manufacturer, DRAM profits are "still showing adequate  improvement."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Santillo has  announced in Rio de Janeiro that he is holding talks with Cuba  in order to import the meningococcal meningitis vaccine, the  only of its kind in the world. The objective of his ministry is  to conduct a vaccination campaign in Rio de Janeiro, where, even  though there is no epidemic, meningitis has already taken the  lives of 10 infants this year alone. Santillo also stated that  the vaccination will be conducted in Brazil as soon as possible.    Santillo went on to say that there are cases of  meningococcal  meningitis in many nations. He also acknowledged the  effectiveness of the Cuban-made medicine to counter this illness.</p>

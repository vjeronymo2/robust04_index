			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / US personal incomes rise as new home sales fall US personal incomes rose more than expected last month, but sales of new homes fell sharply, according to economic data released yesterday. The Commerce Department said personal incomes rose 1.3 per cent last month after a 0.3 per cent decline in July. However, the figures were distorted by flooding in the Mid-west, which sharply reduced farmers' incomes in July. Economists at C J Lawrence, the New York broker, said incomes probably rose by 0.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in July and August. Personal consumption spending rose 0.4 per cent last month, the same pace as in July. The figures point to an increase in real consumer spending in the third quarter at an annual rate of about 4 per cent. Sales of new homes fell 3.1 per cent last month and by 1.4 per cent in the year to August.</p>

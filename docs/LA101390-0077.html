			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> 2 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO ANIMAL NEGLECT  </P> <P> Alfred (Dale) Beem and his son, Robert, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor  animal-neglect charges during their arraignment Friday in Ventura Municipal  Court.  </P> <P> A trial is scheduled for Nov. 14.  </P> <P> The two men were originally charged with felony animal abuse when seven horses,  69 rabbits and 35 sheep were impounded from their rented ranch on Piru Canyon  Road in an unincorporated section of the county May 31. Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark  Pachowicz said the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor due to extenuating  circumstances, including the fact that the two men had to care for the animals  alone after Beem's wife and his younger son Michael left Piru to care for  ailing relatives.  </P> <P> The reduced charge does not lessen the severity of neglect to the animals.

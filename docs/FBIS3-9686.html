			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement </F> for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, by Anna Samelova following the  conclusion of the HZDS National Assembly in Presov on 27  March--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, you adopted a new  political program for the movement. How does it differ from the  previous one that was adopted in Trnava last year, entitled  "From Sovereignty to Prosperity"?    [Meciar] The difference between the programs is, above all,  in the chronology: This year's policy covers the period 1994 to  1998. The program is built so that it allows for creating a  basis for a government program, and, moreover, it reassesses the  situation in which the Slovak Republic finds itself today. In  other words, it is based on many years of experience, seeking  pragmatic answers to the problems encountered in all spheres and  in all kinds of activities, whether in politics, culture, or  elsewhere, which the Slovak Republic must overcome. In other  words, our program represents an offer. We are again the first  to come up with something like this, and we expect again that  the others will create alternatives to our program because we  have, indeed, sought what is good and possible.    [Samelova] The assembly also altered the statutes of the  movement, among other ways by putting the current consultative  body, the HZDS Council, and the national leadership on an equal  footing. What reasons have led you toward this step? Is this  not some kind of duplicity?    [Meciar] No, in essence it means building a two-chamber  system of the movement's leadership, which has been built like  this from the very beginning but, owing to the passivity of the  chairmen, has never been fulfilled. The movement's council will  unite professional clubs, and it will unite the intellectual  sphere that will work with us. It will also unite the deputies  and the state administration that will work toward the elections  and the local elections that are being prepared. This is of  great significance. These people must have influence and space  to make decisions. [passage omitted] At the same time, the  principle that the leadership, after the Assembly, is the  highest political body of the movement must be respected.    [Samelova] The Assembly devoted considerable attention to  the  analysis of why it was that the HZDS was in the opposition again  today. Could you tell us something about the results of this  discussion?    [Meciar] It was a businesslike discussion. We are not  looking for a culprit; we are looking for causes, but, above  all, we are seeking guarantees in the movement's mechanisms for  the future period. We cannot fail to see that 18 deputies from  our movement failed from both the human and the political  viewpoints. Of them, 10 signed a statement saying that, if they  were to leave the movement, they would give up their mandates.  They have left the movement but have kept the mandates. We  cannot fail to see that the government was overthrown not only  by the opposition, but also by the attitude of these people who  were in the movement with us and recognized its program. We are  seeking ways to guarantee the stability of the parliament both  within the movement and outside it. We are seeking to undertake  measures inside the movement in the sphere of pledges,  discipline, and responsibility toward citizens, and ways to win  over the citizens during the elections so that they may find the  same security with us that they did in 1992.    [Samelova] You mentioned the deputies who left the HZDS. In  this connection, self-critical addresses were allegedly heard at  the assembly. They came from the districts from which these  deputies, who are no longer members of the movement, got to  parliament. What was this self-criticism about?    [Meciar] The selection of the candidates was based on  proposals of district assemblies, the so-called nominating  assemblies. Then it was confirmed by the nominating assembly  held in Zilina. Afterwards, they went through psychological  tests and personal interviews. Despite this, there were human  errors. In other words, the criticism was aimed at the  districts for not knowing their candidates well. In many cases,  those who had left could not cope with their work because they  had no dialogue with the movement they had left or with the  citizens. [passage omitted]    The government is now in the hands of these 18 people. For  me, it is always a warning if people put their subjective desire  for posts or power above the principles they are to serve.    [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, on Thursday [24 March], at the HZDS  meeting, the moderator said that the radio and television were  closed to the HZDS. Ever since your Cabinet was dismissed, the  HZDS has not organized any news conferences. You yourself have  refused in the parliament requests by radio and television for  interviews. How would you explain this contradiction?    [Meciar] To be precise, running along the corridor with  somebody sticking a microphone in front of you--that is not an  offer. It is normal that giving interviews is also work. It is  work for both the editor and the interviewee, and time and  conditions must be allocated for it. I see no contradiction  here. Indeed, we appear less on both the screens and everywhere  else. We can see the changing character of reporting, we can  see the contents of the reports, and we are aware that we are  not participating in it. Our assessment of these things is that  this is one of the areas where we were unable to ensure full  democracy. That is why, logically, when conditions prompt a  different interpretation of democracy, the media behave  differently, too.    [Samelova] Two weeks ago, at support meetings for your  departing government, some of your followers physically attacked  four journalists. How do you view this unpleasant incident, the  fact that those involved were your potential voters?    [Meciar] Did you see it?    [Samelova] I was there.    [Meciar] I received the resolution from the people who were  there and who were protesting. They talked about Mr. Zitny, who  sprayed tear gas in people's eyes without their doing anything  bad. There were about 100 signatures of eyewitnesses who  described the situation in a completely different way. I am not  a judge to play the role of a referee. If I am to follow  whomever I trust more, I certainly trust the citizens more than  Messrs. Zitny and Hrib.    [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, my last question will be worded so  as to be both personal and professional. When, in June 1992,  you took the post of the prime minister for the second time, you  said in your main interviews that you had given a written pledge  to your party that, if the Slovak parliament should recall you  again from the post of prime minister, you would not return to  politics. Everything seems to indicate that you are preparing  for the election campaign and that you are preparing for your  third return to politics. How did you (?personally) come to  terms with this pledge?    [Meciar] First, I have not left politics yet. I have only  changed position from the government to the opposition. My  daughter came to see me in parliament when they recalled me.  When they dismissed me, she came to see me and said something  that was absolutely correct from the point of view of her  understanding the events that concern me. She told me that  politics was one hell of a dirty business and that I should  leave.    But there are other points. First, the movement to which I  offered my post invited me back to it. Second, there is a  certain hope and trust of the citizens that things may look  different, that there is an alternative to the current  government coalition. If all of this has some meaning, I will  come again in September with an offer. I will ask those who  will decide in the elections what I should do.</p>

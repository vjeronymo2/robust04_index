			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (9): Developers at bay - Kyoto is 1,200 years old, yet celebrations are muted Kyoto, Japan's historical and cultural capital, began the year of celebrations commemorating the founding of the city 1,200 years ago, with fireworks and high-tech laserbeam shows. But the birthday party has yet to pick up, because the occasion falls at a time when the city is still suffering the effects of the burst of the asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s and the economic downturn that has followed. The dramatic rise in property prices and the subsequent fall has hit the city's development activity. During the late 1980s, the increase in development in a city surrounded on three sides by mountains, so that available land is limited, sent real estate prices surging. Land and condominium prices tripled between 1987 and the peak in 1991, far exceeding the increases in larger cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. But as interest rates have risen and speculative activity has diminished, prices have declined more sharply than in other large cities, falling by half in the past two years. The strong yen has also hurt Kyoto's export-oriented companies. Earnings have plunged at manufacturers such as Nintendo, the video-game maker, and at high-technology companies Kyocera and Shimadzu. The economic slump has depressed anniversary festivities, as organisers have failed to collect the full Y30bn (Dollars 300m) needed for the planned events from local government and companies. Yet the economic downturn and the fall in development projects has come as a relief to many conservationists. They claim that enough damage has been done to the city, and that further development would only harm Kyoto. The city of temples and gardens remains the spiritual home for many Japanese, although traditional wooden houses in the centre have been replaced by investment houses and offices, and temples and shrines share the skyline with condominiums and department stores. 'The Japanese are trying to ruin even what the Americans (in the war) chose to preserve,' says Mr Chikou Kiyotaki, high priest of Koryuji Temple, the city's oldest. Many Buddhist temples have been hardened by their experience during the late 1980s, and are relieved at the current economic downturn. In 1990, Kiyomizu Temple, the most visited in Kyoto at the foot of the eastern hills, was forced to buy adjacent land to fend off developers trying to construct a condominium. Along with the Buddhist community, conservationist citizens groups have tried to stop developments. Mr Akira Nakajima, leader of a citizens group against the development of Kyoto, argues that the 'hollowing out' of the city stems from the rise in property prices, due to the bubble and not the lack of development. On the other hand, many of Kyoto's leading businessmen believe a remedy for the faltering economy is a loosening of development restrictions. They claim that excessive conservation, aimed at preserving the city's skyline and its image as Japan's ancient capital, is restraining Kyoto's vitality. Some of the businessmen who favour further development go so far as to claim that the city - which was spared US bombing after American academics had persuaded the airforce not to attack Kyoto and destroy its temples and shrines during the war - would have prospered had it suffered as Tokyo did, and therefore been freed from construction restrictions. 'Kyoto is a dead city,' says Mr Katsuji Tsunoda, at the Real Estate Research Institute, a private agency that monitors property markets. Members of the development camp blame a recent population drain on building restrictions that have obliged residents to sell their cramped homes and move outside the city. Universities have also left Kyoto, because of rigid height restrictions. City officials, also disturbed by the fall in economic activity, have not missed the opportunity to use the 1200th anniversary to request funds from central government and to change stringent rules covering development projects. They recently announced a compromise plan, tightening building rules around historic sites, but easing height restrictions in the southern industrial areas. Following the rule changes, rebuilding has begun at Kyoto railway station, located in the south of the city, to include a concrete and glass monument, 400 metres wide and 58m high, in commemoration of the anniversary. The business community hopes the project will help to vitalise the regional economy. They hope the building, which will house a large shopping centre complex and a hotel, will bring young consumers of the Kansai area to Kyoto; while an express railway line, linking the new Kansai airport to Kyoto, which does not have a city airport, will give visitors and cargo easier access. Many conservationists, however, fear that economic recovery will mean more development and further urbanisation.</p>

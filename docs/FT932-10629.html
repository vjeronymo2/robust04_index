			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian company needs licence for Siberian gold project A small Australian company allied with a Siberian gold producer has admitted that it still needs to get a licence from Russia's State Geology Committee to clinch a deal to exploit the country's biggest hard rock gold deposit. But Mr Mikhail Galiatin, the Moscow-based lawyer for the Australian partner, Star Technology Systems, added the latter, as proof of its commitment to the project, would first make a downpayment of at least Dollars 20m, the first instalment of its Dollars 250m investment, before approaching the committee. The committee, which is responsible for licensing the exploitation of mineral deposits, has argued throughout that the Australian-Russian Lena Gold joint stock company did not have a valid licence to the Sukhoi Log deposit. But Ms Louise Moore, Star Technology Systems' representative in Moscow, has until now insisted that there was no need to get the a licence from the committee on the grounds that it had already a go-ahead from local authorities. The law says that rights to deposits on which work had already begun by the time natural resources legislation came into effect last summer had to be validated by a licence from the committee, to be applied for within a month. The main question now is whether the committee will issue a licence, or raise other long-standing objections to the deal. 'I am 100 per cent certain that Lena Gold can fulfil any requirements which may be legally set by the State Geology Committee,' Mr Galiatin said. The government, which is divided and still embroiled in political crisis after last week's referendum, has also looked at the project but has so far not tried to impose any particular decision on the committee. Mr Galiatin added that another obstacle had only recently been removed by the Committee for State Property, which has defended the deal but erroneously liquidated the Russian state-owned enterprise that held the licence to the deposit. This made it possible for Mr Yegor Gaidar, then prime minister, to declare a tender for other Russian companies to develop the deposit last winter. This tender was never held, partly because of a change of government in December but also because of internal divisions over how to handle the case. The Committee for State Property finally corrected its own mistake last month by issuing new documents transforming the Russian enterprise into a joint stock company in which Star is to hold 31 per cent of the shares. Another remaining obstacle is the government's failure so far to declassify information on the Sukhoi Log deposit, which Star had previously cited as a condition set by its bankers for the release of money raised for the project. But Mr Galiatin said he was working on an alternative arrangement whereby Russian authorities would show data to interested parties without publishing it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign minister, Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri, and Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat signed an  agreement for the management and maintenance of the Thai-Lao  Friendship Bridge in Vientiane, the Lao People's Democratic  Republic today. The opening ceremony of the bridge will be  held on 8 April. The major points of the agreement pertain to  the administration and maintenance of the bridge and the  establishment of management committees. The bridge has nothing  to do with the Thai-Lao boundary, which is determined by the  deepest channel of the river. Each side will have jurisdiction  over half of the bridge and will collect toll fees at a similar  rate.    Squadron Leader Prasong said that the bridge will provide  convenience for the transportation of goods and benefit the  economic development of the two countries. A committee will be  set up to administer the bridge while another committee will be  set up to oversee legal issues. The deputy governor of Nong  Khai Province and six other persons will represent the Thai side  in the committee, while the Lao side will include the deputy  governor of Vientiane Municipality. The officials will set the  date for opening the bridge to the public. Whether or not the  two sides will cooperate to build other bridges depends on  economic development. Part of the bridge has been prepared for  laying rail tracks.    The Lao foreign minister believes that the opening of the  bridge will help further develop the Lao economy. He admits  that it may lead to positive and negative social changes in  Laos. Such changes, however, could also take place even without  the bridge.    Meanwhile, the Lao mass media also asked about efforts to  arrest General Vang Pao who has reportedly fled into Thailand.  Foreign Minister Prasong said that Thailand will not allow any  person to use its territory to conduct inappropriate activities  against neighboring countries. There has been no news because  no arrest has been made. He did not think that the person was  still in Thailand.</p>

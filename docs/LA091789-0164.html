			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROHRABACHER AND FUNDING FOR THE ARTS  </P> <P> Re the proposed amendment to restrict National Endowment for the Arts funding  for "indecent art," introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms and championed by Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita):  </P> <P> Although I've always been against censorship of any kind, the above amendment  didn't incense me enough to write, until I read Rohrabacher's remark quoted in  The Times: "I don't believe that the government in a time of severe deficit  crisis, should be spending money on frivolous things like the arts in the first  place."  </P> <P> What pre-Cro-Magnon mentality would coin such a phrase? Indeed, as far as  Rohrabacher, U.S. congressman of the late 20th Century, is concerned, even the  fabulous animal paintings on the walls of the Lascaux caves should never have  happened.  </P> <P> What "frivolity" compelled those first artists to paint while "decent" men  hunted and fought wars?  </P> <P> Let us all take a stand against these latter day "Savonarolas" who would use  the "indecent art" issue as a vehicle to quell all funding of the arts. Also,  doesn't "indecent art" somehow evoke similar labels? Such as decadent,  bourgeois and unnatural art, used by Communist and Nazi censors? Oh, woe to us  all! and who will be the judge?  </P> <P> MARICA HEFTI  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Telmex profits decline 14% in first quarter Telefonos de Mexico, the country's monopoly telephone utility, reported net profits of 1.85bn pesos (Dollars 566m) in the first quarter, a drop of 14 per cent on the same period last year. Telmex's profits were pushed down by an exchange rate loss of 719m pesos on foreign currency debt resulting from the depreciation of the peso against the dollar and weakness of the dollar against the yen. Excluding the exchange rate loss, the underlying results showed robust growth. Operating profits reached 2.94bn pesos, a 13 per cent advance, while revenues climbed to 6.63bn pesos, an increase of the same amount. The rise in sales was helped by unexpectedly strong growth of international telephone traffic, which rose 22.3 per cent in the quarter, far higher than last year's increase . Long distance traffic was up by 11.6 per cent, and local calls grew by 12.3 per cent.</p>

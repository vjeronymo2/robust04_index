			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (6): High hopes demolished - The reforms intended to widen markets FOR THE past few years, Japanese government officials and financial institutions have debated reforms intended to demolish the walls between banking and securities business and make the country's markets more international and accessible. The results of these controversial negotiations will become law next week. But the high hopes for the reform programme have already given way to general disappointment that a nervous government took the line of least resistance in dealing with territory-conscious banks and brokers. Japanese banks complain that the finance ministry has kept them out of the stock market indefinitely, protecting brokers weakened by the collapse of stock prices and share turnover. The brokers complain that their cherished access to trust banking has been unnecessarily restricted and, in other areas such as corporate bonds, trading remains weighed down by government regulation. Ministry of finance officials insist that the 'spirit' of reform has been maintained in next week's changes, but that the reforms had to be introduced more slowly than planned because of the collapse of stock prices and the impact on brokers' competitiveness. Professor Kazuo Ueda, co-ordinator of the Committee to Make Tokyo Markets More Transparent and International (CTTI), an industry body with Japanese and foreign representation, says the government must push ahead with changes in spite of the turbulence in the stock market. 'There will be a long-term negative impact on Japan if nothing changes,' Professor Ueda says. He argues that regulation in Tokyo will limit Japan's ability to profit from value-added financial instruments, which are more freely available abroad. Continuing regulation also creates difficulties for local industrial companies seeking to diversify the sources of funds. The tenor of debate on financial reform has reflected the mood of the markets. During the late 1980s, when stock prices surged and brokers made easy profits, the finance ministry presumed that banks could enter the securities markets without undermining the brokers' profitability. But the conclusion of the reform debate coincided with fears that an already ailing stock market could fall to 14,000 or 12,000 or lower. Prices are now about half the level of December 1989, while not one of the 14 largest brokers reported a net profit for the first half (to end September). All of them are trimming staff and closing offices. Banks' enthusiasm to enter the broking business has been blunted by the obvious difficulties of the securities houses, though the banking industry was hoping that the finance ministry would give a clearer signal on a gradually expanding role in stock trading until the end of the decade. Under the regulation changes coming into force on April 1, Japan's 10 trust and long-term credit banks will be able to establish securities subsidiaries to issue - but not market - convertible and warrant bonds, and to deal in straight bonds. Leading commercial banks were told that they must wait at least another year for the same limited opportunities. The ministry has plans to review the banking industry's role in the bond market after 'two to three years'. The impression is that further reforms will follow, but the ministry's vague promises have disheartened the banks and given the government an opportunity to delay changes. In return, the securities houses will be limited in their trust banking business, though they will have more freedom to deal in investment trusts and currency instruments. However, brokers were disappointed at being denied access to special large-lot securities trusts and special loan trusts in which public funds are invested, effectively protecting the vested interests of the trust banks. Banks and brokers are still assessing the costs and benefits of their entry into new businesses in which they are barely able to compete with existing players. For banks, there may be better opportunities in waiting for the shake-out of troubled medium-sized brokers, which have suffered most from the market collapse, and may be in need of rescue from friendly institutions. The collapse of stock prices has also encouraged the finance ministry to return to the opaque ways of the past in attempting to support stock prices, undermining a reform programme which has promised 'transparency'. In the wake of the stock industry scandals of the past two years, the ministry promised to clarify its 'administrative guidance' procedures, ending the informal relationships which had previously characterised the system. Japan's Big Four brokers, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, were particularly concerned that the scandals had damaged their relationship with ministry officials, but the concerted government campaign to prop up stock prices has drawn the two sides back together. The continuing unpredictability of the ministry's decisions remains a concern for foreign brokers and for some Japanese institutions. In its report last month, the CTTI complained that the decision-making by the ministry was both unclear and inconsistent, particularly in evaluating new financial products. CTTI estimates that only 12 of 25 financial instruments available in the US and the EC are available in Japan, and that the ministry's policy on new products leads to 'incongruous treatment of issues and issuers, with insufficient consideration for the interests of investors'. US and European brokers told the committee that, in other markets, an action is allowed unless specifically prohibited. In Japan, on the other hand, an action is forbidden unless specifically permitted. But foreign financial institutions are also divided over the pace of liberalisation, which has created new opportunities for them but which also promises to provide more competition for companies with carefully-crafted niches in partly closed markets. For example, an easing of restrictions in the domestic bond market could hurt institutions which have done well from Japanese issues in the Euromarkets. And for foreign brokers, many of whom are still struggling to make profits in Tokyo, the deregulation of stock brokerage commissions will intensify competition.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Freely available instruments in the Japanese, US, London and Euro-markets  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Japan    US   London  Euro Mkts  Frankfurt  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Straight bonds               yes   yes      yes      yes         yes  2 Convertible bonds            yes   yes      yes      yes         yes  3 Equity warrant bonds         yes   yes       no      yes         yes  4 Covered warrants              no   yes      yes      yes         yes  5 Over the counter equity    options                       no   yes      yes      yes          no  6 Individual stock options      no   yes      yes      yes         yes  7 Stock index options, futures    and options on futures       yes   yes      yes      yes     limited  8 Warrants on stock indices     no   yes       no      yes          no  9 Futures, options &amp; options    on futures on govt bonds     yes   yes      yes      yes     limited 10 Floating rate notes           no   yes      yes      yes         yes 11 Zero coupon bonds            yes   yes      yes      yes         yes 12 Foreign currency bonds       yes   yes      yes      yes         yes 13 Bank and parent company    guaranteed bonds              no   yes      yes      yes         yes 14 Junk bonds                    no   yes      yes      yes          no 15 Subordinated bonds            no   yes      yes      yes         yes 16 Preferred stock          limited   yes      yes      yes         yes 17 Dual currency bonds          yes   yes      yes      yes         yes 18 Index linked bonds            no   yes      yes      yes          no 19 Strippable bonds              no   yes      yes      yes         yes 20 Commercial paper             yes   yes      yes      yes         yes 21 Note issuance facilities      no   yes      yes      yes         yes 22 Revolving underwriting    facilities                    no   yes      yes      yes          no 23 Medium term notes             no   yes      yes      yes         yes 24 Asset backed securities      yes   yes      yes      yes     limited 25 Money market funds           yes   yes      yes      yes          no  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Quick Research Institute  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Bosnian peace force may prove too small / A look at the UN soldiers' role THE decision by the United Nations Security Council to send up to 6,000 more troops to Bosnia-Hercegovina is aimed at stepping up the international relief operations throughout the former Yugoslav republic. But UN officials admit that the numbers may be too small to cope with task facing the United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR). Under its enlarged mandate, the UN forces will support the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees aid efforts in Bosnia, and provide protection, 'where and when the UNHCR considers such protection necessary'. However, the UN remains determined not to change its operations in Bosnia from peace-keeping to peace-enforcement for fear that it will be seen as partial towards any one side involved in the fighting. 'The expansion of the UN presence is tied to the humanitarian aid effort,' a senior UN official said yesterday. However, he added that it would run in parallel with the Geneva talks, as well as continuing attempts to place all heavy weapons under UN supervision. In addition, the agreements signed last month at the London peace conference envisage sending many more observers to Bosnia's borders to stem the flow of weapons into the republic. As part of the humanitarian effort, UN troops, which will work closely with the UNHCR, will be deployed in four or five new zones, apart from the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. These include Banja Luka, Bihac and Doboj in the north, Mostar in the south, and Tuzla and Gorazde in the east. A UN infantry battalion will be based in each zone. It will be complemented by an engineer bridging company, military observers and logistical and signals back-up. 'The UN units in the new zones would need to have a high degree of self-sufficiency,' said Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, in his report on Bosnia to the security council. 'The troops will be doing a lot of repair work before the winter arrives. Bridges have to be re-built. Mines have to be located. Roads have to be made passable. We will not be able to use the mountain routes in a few weeks time,' a UN commander explained. 'When we move the UN troops into the zones, they will be there for some time. This is a long haul,' he added. At the request of the UNHCR, the UN troops will protect aid storage facilities in these zones. The relief convoys will be supported by a UN transport battalion, which will escort them in and out of the zones. The troops will follow 'normal peace-keeping rules of engagement', and will be authorised to use force in self-defence. Mr Boutros Ghali stressed that self-defence would include 'situations in which armed persons attempt by force to prevent UN troops from carrying out their mandate'. He said that if all parties involved in the war in Bosnia did not stop attacking UN personnel, 'further steps might be necessary to ensure UNPROFOR'S security and enable it to fulfil its mandate'. However, Mr Boutros Ghali conceded that the enlarged UN presence in Bosnia would not be sufficient to protect any of the people released from the detention camps who wish to leave the republic, let alone protect those who wish to return to their homes, which have often been destroyed. He said the security council would have to expand the UN's mandate even further if it was to take on this role as well. Under these circumstances, and the limitation of the current mandate, it is now apparent that the UN's expanded role in Bosnia will not lead to the setting up of safe-havens for the millions of refugees, nor will UN protectorate zones be established. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, has backed off his threat to boycott international talks on Bosnia's future scheduled to begin in Geneva on Friday, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. He will be sending Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign minister. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, leader of the Croat-controlled area of western Hercegovina, are also expected to attend the talks, to be chaired by Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a UN official. The talks, under auspices of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, co-sponsored by the UN and European Community, are to craft a long-term political settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the conference, said yesterday that the negotiations would go into continuous session from Friday until a solution was reached. He added that the talks would start with a clean slate, now that the EC's previous 'cantonisation' plan has been buried. Sixty-eight sick and injured men from Serb-run detention camps in Bosnia were flown to hospitals in Britain on a Red Cross flight yesterday, Our Foreign Staff writes. A Russian Aeroflot aircraft, chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross, landed at Stansted airport after leaving the Serb-held stronghold of Banja Luka. The Moslem-held Bosnian town of Sokolac in the north-west of the former Yugoslav republic was 'practically destroyed' in a Serbian air raid on Monday, authoritative sources said yesterday, agencies report. The sources said they had no casualty figures for the attack, carried out by four warplanes apparently based in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. One source well-informed on the incident described it as 'the most serious air attack of the (Bosnian) war so far'. Earlier, UN spokesman, Mr Fred Eckhard, told reporters in Geneva that international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, had sent a message to the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, deploring the incident. Mr Eckhard, citing information received from UN military commander, General Satish Nambiar, said Sokolac was one of four population centres in the so-called 'Bihac pocket' that were hit in the attack which lasted approximately an hour.</p>

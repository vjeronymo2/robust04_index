			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashraf Abu-Sayf: "The 'Ulama' of Islam Unable to </F> Face the Problem Alone"]    [Text] Confronting extremist and terrorist groups is a  problem that requires political activism and cannot be left to  Islamic advocates only since the crisis is political in nature  and removed from the faith which the extremists peddle. There  are puppet masters behind the scenes who pull the strings of  those extremists.    The issue calls for men who discuss and debate the dangers  that threaten Egypt and the challenges that face it. Their  weapon would be intellect and they would have the ability to  challenge destructive ideologies packaged in religious wrapping.    This calls for political education, for raising citizen  awareness of national causes, and for developing in everyone the  spirit of joint action.    Political parties, no matter their orientation, have  responsibility for realizing that objective.    The politicians whom MAYU approached emphasized that  political education is capable of challenging the deviant  minority and pointed out that reliance on instruction, rather  than on indoctrination, would help contain the ideologies of  those groups that are manipulated in the background against the  interests of the motherland. Political awareness would prevent  them from ensnaring new elements in their nets.  <H5>  Political Awareness </H5>   Dr. Mufid Shihab, chancellor of Cairo University and  president of the Consultative Council's Foreign Affairs and  National Security Committee emphasized that political parties  must act in the manner of a school to raise political cadres  through political instruction programs and through true partisan  practices.    He explained: "Creating political cadres can only be  accomplished by offering theoretical educational programs at  party schools and by empowering youth leaders to assume  responsibility at all levels. Any political party that lacks  political cadres versed and active in political action, or that  lacks schools or facilities for political instruction, would  lose effectiveness among the rank and file."    He added that the political education of youth, either  within  the parties, via the media of information, or through school and  university programs, would create desired political awareness  and keen understanding of national issues of various dimensions.  It would also enhance patriotic sentiment and increase  commitment to societal causes, thereby ending the apathy we note  among most citizens, and especially youth.    He pointed out that apathy aids and encourages the deviant  minority to be influential with its operations and ideology,  unchallenged by those who consciously reason and realize the  threats posed by waves of terrorism.    He added that this apathy of intellect and of challenge is  the natural outcome of the absence of political awareness. The  absence of political awareness is caused by the lack and  deficiency of political education to which all the parties and  concerned ministries must contribute, especially the ministries  of Culture, Information, Awqaf, and Education.  <H5>  Gains </H5>   Muhammad Kamal Sulayman, assistant secretary general of the  Nationalist Party in Cairo, believes that "we are in dire need  of institutions to prepare political leaders and political  advocates who understand national issues and problems. Their job  would be to explain and analyze the gains made by this  motherland as well as defend and explain the various national  issues that may elude many a simple person and which terrorist  groups are the worst exploiters."    He added that such a role should not be limited only to the  Nationalist Party but should be assumed by all political parties  in the field.    He explained that youth training would generate a goodly  number of political cadres who are able to debate and who are  instilled with a nationalist ideology and capable of argument  and resistance.    Several gains would accrue to us as a result.    First, the ability to win over the masses to join political  parties, thereby ending the apathy and political vacuum that  plague us.    Second, create an inter-party climate of democratic debate,  which would serve the interests of the motherland.    He emphasized that we can, with lucid political instruction,  create a generation capable of serving and defending the  motherland should it be exposed to a threat such as that of  terrorism. Those educated cadres would be capable of convincing  the masses that such a threat really exists, utilizing their  ability to debate extremist ideologies that undermine the public  interest. The first precept of political education is to raise a  generation instilled with the desire to defend and protect the  motherland and equipped with the ability to differentiate  between opposition to the government, if such a position is  taken, and positions antithetic to the national interest, such  as those taken by terrorist groups.    Dr. Rif'at al-Sa'id, secretary general of the National  Progressive Unionist Grouping, said that "political advocates  have not vanished altogether. Some are still playing their roles  but others are hesitant as a result of threats that originate  not only with the self-proclaimed Islamist terrorists but with  certain newspapers that do not have the right idea on how to  confront terrorism.    That is why many of those with viewpoints to express lack  the  means of dissemination in the face of a flood of opposing  publications that are well-printed and well-financed and  consequently cheaper in price. The concept of energizing  political activism requires solidarity among various  intellectuals and writers who fight terrorism, and who sometimes  go as far as countering some of the allegations propagated by  terrorists.    He explained that the development of political cadres  requires reforming the educational process as well as cultural  and informational curricula in order to rectify the general  climate, blunt the edge of extremism in all our endeavors, and  seek the creation of an intellectual climate characterized by  understanding and the desire to approach, discuss, and debate  all our problems without preconceived views. Should this become  the attitude of opponents, or perceived opponents, among the  forces that reject such terrorism and its originators,  activists, propagators, and supporters--then that solidarity  could provide those advocates with greater opportunities and  endow them with stronger influence. Such solidarity would also  reduce the prickliness of political parties because it would  create for us activists who are enlightened and capable of  influencing youths.    Dr. Rif'at al-Sa'id believes that the '60s experience proved  the ineffectiveness of the Youth Organization that had hoped to  develop political awareness in young people. The organization's  modus operandi was based on mere indoctrination, rendering its  graduates mere parrots repeating what they heard with no effort  to debate, discuss, modify what should be amended, or correct  what should be corrected.    The methodology, therefore, must be instruction and not  indoctrination. The two concepts are worlds apart. Education  opens the door to the mind and creates visions that enable their  possessors to understand, espouse, amend, and develop as well as  reject the ideologies proposed to them and therefore become the  ones capable of influencing others.  <H5>  We Lack </H5>   Mamduh Thabit Makki, member of the People's Assembly and  vice  president of the Federation of Egyptian Industries, said that  "we lack what we might call political leaders or political  cadres armed with a great deal of superior intellect and culture  and extensive familiarity with political action techniques, and  who also possess comprehensive awareness of societal conditions  that would enable them to challenge many destructive ideologies  and principles as well as the claims of those working against  the interests of the motherland."    He added that the intellectual development of political  cadres should be accomplished through training institutions  within the various parties in order to become familiar with the  party's political ideology and be able to defend it and explain  it to others. Party members should also be given an opportunity  to progress through the various stages of preparing political  thought, i.e., participate at all partisan levels. That is the  way to develop generations capable of facing and convincing the  masses, rather than letting the common citizen become fertile  ground for the purveyors of destructive ideologies.  <H5>  Energizing </H5>   Kamal Henry Badir, chairman of the People's Assembly's  Committee for National Security, says that "responsibility for  the political education of individuals rests primarily with  political parties that must raise the consciousness of their  individuals and members. That would require intensifying  political action all the way down to hamlets and small partisan  units and elevating [assigning more responsible roles] to those  able to contribute and serve society and champion its causes.    "Such political awareness could be developed through  caravans  of enlightenment, whose participants would include al-Azhar, the  Mufti, the Ministry of Information, and individuals with  influence on youth. They must make it clear to youth not only  that terrorism is antithetic to all religions, and especially to  Islam which urges mercy and compassion, but also that the  motherland is hurt by terrorist actions and that strikes against  tourists and foreigners burden the motherland with wide-ranging  losses.  <H5>  Promoting Joint Action </H5>   Dr. Mustafa Kamil al-Sayyid, professor of political science  at Cairo University, believes that the development of political  awareness is a function of individual participation in social  and political activity. This requires doing everything possible  to promote joint action at all local and national levels,  reexamining election laws and procedures, and removing the  restrictions with which Cooperatives Law No. 32 of 1964 is  replete.    It would also require giving partisan and political forces  more access to the information media, especially radio and  television, in order to make citizens feel that political  participation is of value in the sense that when the various  authorities become responsive to people's wishes expressed in  the information media, everyone would realize the value of  participating.    Dr. Mustafa Kamil al-Sayyid explained that the challenge to  the phenomenon of terrorism should be all-inclusive because the  causes underlying it are numerous and are political, economic,  and ideological in nature.    Dr. Jamal Zahran, professor of political science at Suez  Canal University, believes that raising youth with a fair degree  of comprehensive religious and political awareness is the best  way to immunize them against sliding towards [falling into the  trap of] extremist ideologies then resorting to violence as an  expression of opinion.    He added that such an education can be imparted through the  information media and school curricula and through the example  of good role models by educators and those in charge of  political parties.</p>

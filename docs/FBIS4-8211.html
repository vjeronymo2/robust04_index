			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Miroslav Lazanski commentary: "Askers in Bosnia"] </F>   [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has  accepted Turkey's offer to send troops to former  Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].  Butrus-Ghali's decision was undoubtedly dictated by the  problems of providing a new contingent of troops for UNPROFOR in  Bosnia. The United Nations could not find additional troops  from other countries, so that the Security Council openly  stressed that it was forced to accept Ankara's offer. That is  the excuse by which the United Nations, the Security Council,  and Butrus-Ghali have tried to justify their action in view of  all the criticism from throughout the world, and particularly  from the Balkans, at the Turks being sent to a region where they  were masters and governors for more than 500 years. The UN  Security Council's decision, lacking any subtlety of historical  memory, is becoming more and more the object of serious analysis  and criticism by many NATO member-states, among which Greece, of  course, takes the lead.    Nevertheless, come what may, some 2,700 Turkish soldiers are  getting ready to set off for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Askers  [Turkish soldiers] are again on the road to Bosnia. How, with  what, in which way, how capable are they in military terms [as  published]? From what is known, UNPROFOR intends to deploy  exclusively engineering units of the Turkish Army in Bosnia, in  the first place for logistical support, but also for more  difficult engineering works in order to fix communications.  Since the task involves activities in the conflict zone, the  Turkish troops will have to have protection, of course, if the  war continues. Whether that protection will be given by NATO  war planes, or their own forces, will be seen very soon, as soon  as the Turkish troops and their equipment arrive in Bosnia.    How capable are the Turkish engineers, and other soldiers,  of  carrying out UNPROFOR assignments, given the terrain of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina? The answer lies in the picture of the  contemporary Turkish army, its equipment and armament, the  doctrine of its deployment, the concept of development,  membership in NATO, the historic role of the army in the  development of modern Turkey....    The second greatest military power in NATO, after the United  States, is the Turkish Army, numbering some 480,000 soldiers  (390,000 recruits, service lasts 15 months). In terms of status  in Turkish society, the army members are an elite class, which  since 1960 has intervened three times to suppress riots, or  rather to attain power. It is an army that, until the collapse  of the Warsaw Pact, policed one third of the border between NATO  and the former Soviet Union, that is, some 400 kilometers of the  only direct border with the former Soviet Union, except in  Norway. That was a task of the 3d Turkish Army, being actually  the most powerful operational-strategic Turkish armed force.    After the demise of the Warsaw Pact, and the disintegration  of the Soviet Union, Turkey relocated its armies, so that now  the most powerful 1st Army is concentrated on the border toward  Greece and the islands in the Aegean. The American military is  still present in that country, and every year Ankara is given  great economic and military aid, because of its role on the  southern wing of NATO. There are 26 large U.S. and NATO military  bases on Turkish territory, in addition to several dozens of  smaller military compounds. The most important is certainly the  great air force base in Incirlik, including warehouses for  logistical support in (Iskendrun?) and (Yumurtalik?). In that  base the planes equipped with nuclear weapons are stationed. In  (Chigly?), near Ismir, there is another U.S. air-force base,  and, in addition, the U.S. planes are using the airports in  (Pirinchlic?), Ankara, and (Eshishecher?). The ships of the U.S.  Navy are using almost all the Turkish ports and shipyards. The  ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet are anchored very frequently in the  port of Iskenderun in the Mediterranean. There are very  important radio-locating [as published] stations in Synop and  Pyrinchyluk, while 14 Nage [not further specified] stations of  the NATO anti-aircraft defense system are positioned throughout  Turkish territory .    Being so tightly bound with the NATO and the United States,  Turkey is trying to overpower the Kurds in the southeast of the  country, and to obtain a more prominent place on the  international stage. During the Gulf War against Iraq, Ankara  allowed the Allies to use Turkish territory -- airports and navy  ports, as well as the entire border belt toward Iraq itself.    Later, Turkey was financially rewarded by the West for its  support, so it is a state that receives the most military aid  from NATO. True, some NATO member-states sometimes give their  outdated arms and equipment to Turkey for free, but still, the  Turkish Army is today one of the most powerful armies in Europe  -- 4,835 tanks, 3,000 infantry armored vehicles and  transporters, 4,550 cannons of various calibers, 1,870  anti-aircraft cannons, 2,100 mortars. The ground forces have  their own aviation, numbering 269 aircraft and 538 helicopters,  the air forces involve 60,000 people and 539 combat aircraft,  126 of which are F-16's, 137 F-5's, as well as 155 F-4's, while  the navy numbers 50,000 people, 15 submarines, 11 destroyers,  eight frigates, 16 missile craft, including its own naval air  force.... There was a time, 20 years ago, when the Turkish  armament industry was incapable of manufacturing even a simple  piston aircraft for amateur flying clubs. Today, Turkey  manufactures U.S. F-16 fighters, the latest electronics, and  missiles.    As for the engineering equipment, the Turkish soldiers  deployed within UNPROFOR in Bosnia will have various types of  engineering vehicles, based on the old M-47 U.S. tanks (German  version), as well as Bailey pontoons. Since the UNPROFOR units  are a multinational force, it will be interesting to see how the  Turkish troops function under the command of foreign officers.    All in all, the UN decision, not very wise from the  political  point of view, will place the Turkish soldiers in much  temptation. It seems as though the problem with the Kurds is not  enough of a problem for Ankara. Or is this all about the old  dreams of coming back to the Balkans?</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: MOONSTRUCK SCHOLAR BARES THEORY IN UNUSUAL CARDIFF  QUARTERLY  </P> <P> Articles about mooning always attract me.  </P> <P> "Early Mooning in America" is the title. Lincoln Diamant, a New York historian  and biographer, is the author.  </P> <P> His argument is that European explorers discovered mooning -- described as the  contemptuous baring of the buttocks -- in the Americas and joyfully took the  practice home just like their other discoveries: corn, potatoes and tobacco.  </P> <P> "Within half a century of Columbus' landing on San Salvador," Diamant writes,  "the literate population of Europe was adding New World mooning to its broad  arsenal of uncivilized rejoinder."  </P> <P> It's all there, complete with scholarly footnotes, in Volume I of the Journal  of Unconventional History. The Cardiff-based quarterly is the offbeat  brainchild of co-editors Aline Homaday and Ann Elwood.  </P> <P> "We want to provide a place for people who may have been shut out by the  traditional professional journals," Elwood said. "We want things that are  scholarly but controversial; new ideas that are not yet accepted."  </P> <P> Volume I also has an essay by La Jolla historian Alice Goldfarb Marquis on "The  Ballad of Jackson Pollock: Marlboro Man," and one on "Science, Reason and the  German Utopia" by Hugh Murray.  </P> <P> Elwood, 59, and Homaday, 66, have their own unconventional histories. Each  earned a doctorate in history at UC San Diego after a career outside academe.  </P> <P> Elwood was a free-lance writer (including children's books). Homaday was the  publisher of the (San Diego) Daily Transcript from 1950 to 1972.  </P> <P> Volume II, soon at selected bookstores, will look at wife-beating in Rhode  Island and the European avant-garde. Volume I has already stirred up a ruckus.  </P> <P> The mooning article brought a hot response from a San Francisco writer who says  Diamant has it all wrong: that mooning was spotted as far back as the fall of  Constantinople in 1204.  </P> <P> Ah, the invigorating give-and-take of intellectual life.  </P> <P> Highfalutin Food for Thought  </P> <P> Radicalizing prose is sometimes found in unlikely places.  </P> <P> In the days before last week's strike authorization vote by Union-Tribune guild  members, there was a clipping from the society pages of the San Diego Tribune  posted prominently on the newsroom bulletin board at the San Diego Union.  </P> <P> The clip told of the recent Christmas party at the La Jolla home of David  Copley, president of Copley Press Inc. and son of publisher Helen Copley. A  party complete with caterer and designer.  </P> <P> "The party played out in a scene that was a nostalgic tour de force, the kind  of glowing, sparkling, fragrant ideal seldom realized by even the most  committed Christmas mad . . .  </P> <P> "Copley greeted his guests at the entry, where a brightly lacquered antique  sleigh was moored as backdrop for Dickensian costumed carolers. Santa cut  through the crowd sampling cheeses and fine pate . . .  </P> <P> "With champagne to wash it down, fare ranged from traditional ham biscuits to  quail ragout and shellfish bisque (fun to slurp off cloudy puff pastry shells).  Dessert included toothsome persimmon tarts and a deadly delicious chocolate  density."  </P> <P> To newspaper guild members, the message was clear: Let 'em eat cloudy puff  pastry shells.  </P> <P> Keeping Sweets Tax-Free  </P> <P> Political rumble.  </P> <P> * Libertarians don't win many elections but they do have fun.  </P> <P> Take Dennis Thompson, the San Diego computer firm owner who is running for  governor as a Libertarian.  </P> <P> He doesn't like Atty Gen. John Van de Kamp's proposal to tax candy. So he sent  Van de Kamp a box of sour ball candies to show his displeasure. No response  yet.  </P> <P> "I'll probably hear from his dentist," Thompson said.  </P> <P> * Opposition research has begun in the race for sheriff.  </P> <P> Vince Jimno, on leave as police chief in Escondido, gave a stump speech Friday  to San Diego's Catfish Club, a black professional organization.  </P> <P> In the front row, with a tape recorder, was a visiting Jeanette Roache, wife of  a rival candidate, Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache.  </P></p>

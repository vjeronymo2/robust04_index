			<p>Cosmodrome   <F P=102>   947Q0106A Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in Russian 2 Apr 94  First Edition p 3 </F>  <F P=103> 947Q0106A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Ostroumov, RSA deputy general director, </F> and Igor Barmin, general designer, General Machine Building  Design Bureau: "What Will the New Cosmodrome Be Like: `Costly as  a Diamond' or Very Necessary?"; the first paragraph is an  introduction]    [Text] The report on the establishment of still another  cosmodrome in the Far East by the year 2000 was received with  mixed feelings by space branch specialists. But will these  disputes lead to the appearance of still another spaceport? We  asked leading branch specialists to express themselves on this  matter.    Boris Ostroumov, deputy general director of the Russian  Space  Agency.    The ITAR-TASS communication carried reproaches directed  toward our agency to the effect that the project for the Alpha  international orbital station which we approved is completely  oriented on Baykonur and that under the prevailing conditions  this is complicating its implementation. "Accordingly, for  Russia to carry out an independent space policy and ensure  guaranteed access to space Russia has been forced...to proceed  to the reoutfitting and construction of a new cosmodrome."    First of all, I wish to be more precise and once again  remind: the project for the Alpha international space station  has not been finally adopted by all the partners and is being  prepared for signature only with great difficulties. Many points  are being refined and the interests of Russia are lagging  behind. We are even trying not to use the very name Alpha..    The fact that the project is oriented on Baykonur is  entirely  natural: today it is the sole operational gateway into space  with a well-developed infrastructure. For example, the  assembly-test facilities constructed for the Buran are outfitted  with the most modern apparatus. Baykonur ensures launches of  space vehicles into the necessary orbital inclinations. While we  are not losing hopes for success in negotiations with the  Americans, we have had to exercise still more wisdom and  restraint in the dialogue with Kazakhstan. The results of  negotiations indicate that despite the efforts of many  short-sighted politicians there can be no falling out between  our peoples.    The establishment of a new cosmodrome in the Far East is an  expensive idea. I have already mentioned before that "each stone  there will be more expensive than a diamond." In Russia today  there are no funds even for ordinary bricks and blocks. The  remoteness of the new cosmodrome from manufacturing plants also  will transform it into too expensive a facility.    In my opinion, today, when preparations are being made for  ratification of the documents signed with Kazakhstan, to raise a  discussion about an "alternative" variant means to drive a wedge  between the covenanting parties.    Igor Barmin, general designer of the General Machine  Building  Design Bureau.    The problem of establishing a cosmodrome in the eastern part  of the country has a multisided character. Without question,  Russia must have its low-latitude cosmodrome not only for  implementing space programs, but also for solving problems of  defense importance. The choice of a place for the construction  of a new spaceport also has its pluses and minuses. It is  fortunate that the construction will not be carried out in a  barren place but at the base of a military unit already having a  quite well-developed infrastructure. Unfortunately, the  fulfillment by Russia of its obligations for disarmament has the  result that much is experiencing an arbitrary fate. The choice  of the place also is fortunate with respect to the allocated  falling zones.    A shortcoming is the great expenditures related to the  remoteness from scientific research institutes, design bureaus  and manufacturing plants. However, in my opinion it is incorrect  to consider the construction of a new cosmodrome as an  alternative variant to the Baykonur cosmodrome.    The project for the new cosmodrome can be fully examined  only  when its tasks have been clearly set forth and the programs for  whose solution it will be intended have been defined.    Only after serious and thorough working through of all these  questions can a decision be made about the stages in its  development and the time when it will be established.</p>

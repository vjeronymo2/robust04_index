One of the areas under consideration is the inclusion of cable television systems as an equal partner with broadcast stations in a new emergency alerting system. On Wednesday, April 27, 1994, members of the Commission staff met in Washington, DC with some of the cable television equipment manufacturers and cable operators that had filed comments in the docket on the integration of cable systems into an alerting system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the meeting was to attempt to clarify and further document the estimated costs of emergency alerting equipment in cable systems. Such costs include the purchase of equipment, and the operation of such an alerting system over the multi-channel cable systems. While the discussions centered upon comments already filed with the Commission, it was hoped that this further discussion would enhance the Commission's understanding of the nuances and details for cable implementation of an alerting system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An audio recording of the meeting was made and has been placed in the record as a part of the official proceeding in the docket. The public and all interested parties are invited to review this recording which consists of approximately six hours of discussion by the approximately 25 participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further information contact the EBS staff at (202) 632&hyph;3906. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Communications Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William F.

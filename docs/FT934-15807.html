			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Inco comes to aid of nickel market WITH PRICES falling by about 45 per cent over the past two years as production ran ahead of flagging demand, the nickel market had become the undisputed Cinderella of the London Metal Exchange. But a timely injection of confidence by Inco, the biggest producer, has ensured that it will present a less tattered appearance than might have been expected during LME Week, the exchange's annual shindig, which begins on Monday. Thursday night's announcement by the Canadian company of a plan to cut production next year by 16 per cent, or about 5 per cent of western world output, confirmed rumours that had already helped to lift the market by 10 per cent from the 6 3/4 -year lows reached a week ago. Yesterday, with most of the bullish speculators resisting the temptation to cash in their chips, the three months delivery price put on another Dollars 75 to close at Dollars 4,562.50 a tonne, up Dollars 450 on the week. 'The producers had to do something,' said Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, as there was no chance that next year's expected increase in nickel demand would amount to the 22 per cent needed bring the market back into balance. 'This is a good start,' he said yesterday, referring to the Inco move, 'but other companies will have to follow'. It would not have been reasonable, he suggested, to have expected a much bigger cut from Inco because 'if they had put up too big an umbrella others might have sheltered under it'. He calculated that output cuts of some 45,000 tonnes a year would have to be made before consumption started eating into excess stocks, which he estimated to be equivalent to 18 week's western world consumption. Inco's move would account for about 60 per cent of that, Mr Moore said, and he was confident that other companies would make inroads into the remainder. Falconbridge, also of Canada and the second-biggest producer, was the obvious candidate. A six-month closure of its Falcondo operation in the in the Dominican republic would take another 16,000 tonnes out of the market, Mr Moore said. A further 17,000 tonnes might be removed if Sunday's election resulted in a new Greek government and an end to the series of reprieves that had kept the country's loss-making Larco company in operation, he said. Larco is the world's highest-cost nickel producer. Another possibility was that some Japanese ferro-nickel producers might succumb to financial pressures caused by the strength of the yen, which had made nickel production even more unremunerative for them. That is not to say that it is remunerative elsewhere. 'No western producer is making money at these levels,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, before the Inco announcement. Inco itself lost Dollars 2.2m in the second quarter of this year, when the nickel price averaged Dollars 2.93 a lb - 86 cents higher than it is now, even after this week's rally. Nickel's strength this week helped sentiment in the tin market, recently nickel's partner at the tail end of the LME batting order. With the rise being aided by short-covering purchases and a strike at Brazil's biggest producer the three-months price ended the week Dollars 285 higher at Dollars 4,722.50 a tonnes. The zinc market flirted early in the week with the Dollars 920-a-tonne mark, for three-months metal. But that speculative surge soon ran out of steam and the price ended at Dollars 904.50 a tonne, up Dollars 9 on balance. In contrast, lead prices bounced from fresh 20-year lows as signs of consumer interest emerged. The rise, which was also fuelled by options activity, took the three-months price to Dollars 384.50 at yesterday's close, up Dollars 9 on the week. At the London bullion market gold and platinum were outshone by silver, which ended 26 cents up on the week at 432,50 a troy ounce for immediate delivery. Dealers attributed the rise to speculative buying encouraged by the present supply deficit, despite the large US stockpile overhanging the market. Among the soft commodities, it was cocoa's turn for a 'correction' following a rise to long time highs. On Monday the December futures contract reached Pounds 983 a tonne, the highest level seen since May 1990. But the bulls' appeared to quail at the sight of the Pounds 1,000 barrier and after another abortive attempt on Tuesday to break upside resistance the rot set in. In what analyst Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London trade house, described as 'blood-bath' the December price floundered to Pounds 911 before steadying yesterday to Pounds 913 a tonne, down Pounds 56 on the week. Mr Eagles suggested that the final push to Pounds 983 had been fuelled by 'the last of the bulls', and when there was no follow through the selling began in earnest. Most traders still regard the cocoa market's long term prospects as bullish. But many believe the current retracement could take the price as low as Pounds 850 a tonne, and some Pounds 830, if March position support at Pounds 892 a tonne gives way. The coffee market, which had already had its correction, following a sustained run-up, put in a steadier performance. The January futures price ended yesterday at Dollars 1,179 a tonne, up Dollars 7 on the week. Traders told the Reuter news agency that the coffee market was still in the process of deciding which way to move next.  ---------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS     (As at Thursday's close)  --------------------------------- tonnes  --------------------------------- Aluminium    +6,350 to 2,208,075 Copper       -1,025 to   600,700 Lead           -250 to   287,275 Nickel          +48 to   117,978 Zinc         +1,475 to   803,250 Tin            -150 to    20,935  ---------------------------------</p>

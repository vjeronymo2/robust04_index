			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Takao Fujinami - Hit by scandal / How candidates fared Mr Takao Fujinami, a former chief cabinet secretary on trial for alleged bribe-taking, had said his re-election would be proof that local voters thought him innocent. Mr Fujinami yesterday lost his seat in Mie prefecture, in central Japan. He was elected in 1990 even though he had been indicted after the investigation into the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal, for which he was seen as the politician taking the punishment on behalf of his party, the LDP. This time, standing as an independent, he failed because his old party unsympathetically put two strong candidates against him. But the Fujinami name will survive in Mie. His family is famous for making sweet bean dumplings, named Rikyu in honour of a tea ceremony master. After the scandal broke, the locals started calling them Recruit dumplings.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] The Havana City water shortage is primarily due to a  decrease in the level of the phreatic layer of the Vento Basin  and multiple pump breakdowns. Water service authorities have  reported that the Havana City municipalities most affected by  these shortages include: Centro Habana, Habana Vieja, Cerro,  and Plaza de la Revolucion.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Water wars dominate acquisitions The international mergers and acquisitions scene was dominated last week by Europe's water wars, writes Brian Bollen. The offer by Swiss food group Nestle and French bank Indosuez for Source Perrier, the French mineral water company, was the biggest bid of the week by far. The offer is being interpreted as further confirmation of the arrival of the hostile bid in continental Europe, and as an example of how modern European takeover strategy is evolving, combining Anglo-Saxon opportunism with continental structures, attitudes and regulation. It is also being seen as a setback for the ambitions of Italy's Agnelli family in the European food industry. The family, which is currently bidding for Exor, Perrier's parent company, will apparently not be muddying the waters still further by launching a counter-bid for Perrier. Elsewhere, UK food and household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman is selling its low-margin US-based Durkee-French spice and seasoning business as part of its strategy of concentrating on higher-margin, branded consumer businesses. Reckitt, which is also to sell its Canadian spice business to Burns Philp of Australia, will use the proceeds to cut debt. British Petroleum's sale of its Egyptian oil production assets to Spain's Repsol Exploracion continues its drive to focus on core exploration areas and withdraw from countries where it has not reached critical mass. Acquisitive Birmingham-based architectural products group Newman Tonks is continuing its policy of expansion and international diversification by buying Moller &amp; Auster, the Norwegian locks and security systems company.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                  CROSS BORDER M&amp;A DEALS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR    TARGET          SECTOR      VALUE   COMMENT                                                Pounds Nestle             Source Perrier  Soft drinks 1.38bn  Hostilities (Switzerland)      (France)                            commence Banque Indosuez (France) Repsol Exploracion Assets of BP    Oil           70m   BP exiting (Spain)            (UK)                                Egypt Burns Philp        Durkee-French   Spices        44m   Reckitt &amp; (Australia)        (US)                                Colman disposal Kanematsu (Japan)/ Fischer         Sports goods  7.4m  Jointly buying Goldwin (Japan)    (Austria)                           31% Newman Tonks (UK)  Moller &amp; Auster Controls      5.5m  NT continues                   (Norway)                             international-                                                        isation John Brown (UK)    Sechaud &amp;       Engineering  est 5m Strengthening                    Bossoyt         design              continental                    (France)                            operations British Vita (UK) Norma Boxmeer    Bedding/fibres  5m  Combined                   (Holland)                            consideration                   /Sporda (Sweden) T&amp;N (UK)          Gleitlagerwerk   Bearings        2m  'Important'                   Osterwieck                           strategic move                   (Germany) Elextrolux        JV               Car safety     n/a  Air bag supply Autolive (Sweden)/                                     venture NSK (Japan) Friends Provident Gambi Azzoni     Stockbroking   n/a  20% of new (UK)              Sim (Italy)                          group  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT Mergers + Acquisitions International  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

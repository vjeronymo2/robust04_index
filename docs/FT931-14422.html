			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Regions showing signs of recovery A WEAK recovery has started in the Yorkshire and Humberside region, according to the latest survey of business performance by the region's chambers of commerce. Similar surveys in north-east England and Cumbria, and in the east Midlands, also show a modest increase in sales and orders in the last quarter of 1992. This repeats the experience of companies in north-west England, the west Midlands and north Wales reported by regional chambers earlier this month. Yorkshire and Humberside, with the largest regional canvass of companies, said the return of sales and orders to the levels recorded just after last April's general election could mean 'some economic recovery in 1993, barring any minor setbacks'. But in the north-east, the Northern Development Company and the Teesside and Tyne and Wear chambers said business performance was still some way below the levels achieved during the first half of 1992. In the east Midlands, Mr Mike Hadfield, regional chairman of the chambers, observed 'the fact that business confidence, although at the same levels as 12 months ago, is beginning to return'. Despite the slightly improving commercial climate, the chambers of the three regions are not optimistic about jobs. 'Business confidence is returning but consumer sentiment is still being affected by mounting unemployment,' said Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, chief executive of the Leeds chamber. The three latest surveys, however, disclose improved export prospects, especially in the north-east and Cumbria where, of 769 companies responding, 47.8 per cent reported higher sales and orders. Yorkshire and Humberside chambers attributed the stronger export trend to devaluation but warned that, given the slowdown in Germany, the region's largest export market, this may not last.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Rubtsov: "`Klaus File' Could Bring Closer </F> Solution to Riddle of the Fate of Many Soviet Citizens Missing  Abroad"]    [Text] A routine session -- the 10th -- of the  Russian-U.S. commission for seeking U.S. citizens who have gone  missing on the territory of the former USSR has been held in  Moscow. According to its cochairman on the Russian side,  Colonel General Dmitriy Volkogonov, doctor of philosophical  sciences and historical sciences, the importance of the  commission's work is increasingly obviously going beyond the  framework of purely search tasks, becoming an important factor  in the improvement of the climate in our two countries'  relations.    But the practical results are also substantial. Thus,  Americans have been handed reports extracted from Russian  archives about 1,500 U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet pilots  and air defense gunners. Many testimonies from witnesses have  been heard, in particular from former Central Aerohydrodynamics  Institute staffer P. Kovalskiy, who once took part in the  investigation of a U.S. F-86 aircraft sent to the USSR, and now  firmly states that the crew was not on our territory at all.    The U.S. side, as Congressman Peterson stated at the press  conference which took place, is satisfied with the level of  cooperation. It has received access to previously secret  documents which are advancing the search considerably. For  their part the Americans have provided information about several  Soviet citizens whose traces were lost in Afghanistan and other  regions.    It should be noted that the emphasis in the work of the  joint  commission is shifting increasingly to establishing the fate of  our compatriots. That cannot fail to cause satisfaction, as can  the action of the U.S. side in this direction -- we have been  presented with the so-called "Klaus file" which contains  extensive confidential information from the U.S. special  services on conflict situations involving Soviet citizens.    In general, the longer the commission works the clearer it  is  becoming how much the peoples need such search activity. The  embassies of Britain, Italy, Australia, and other states have  asked us for help, D.A. Volkogonov noted at the press  conference. They are also concerned for the fate of their  missing compatriots, and the experience of the Russian-U.S.  commission will be useful to them.    Or here is one more example of the public response. During  the press conference representatives of the Kuwaiti mass media  asked whether the Russian-U.S. commission could not help the  return home from Iraq of the Kuwaiti citizens still languishing  there. The commission has no legal powers, was the reply, but  if instances of the enforced detention of Kuwaiti citizens are  indeed taking place, the commission is prepared to appeal to the  world public to promote the humane solution of the question.</p>

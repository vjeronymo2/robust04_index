			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / MPs call for tougher pension law reform Pressure for an overhaul of occupational pension law intensified yesterday as a MPs urged changes beyond those being considered by the government. A report by the Tory-dominated Commons social security committee said the proposals the government was expected to put forward on reforming pension law would not do enough to protect workers' pensions. While endorsing many of the proposals put forward by the government's pension law review committee, it urged that schemes be required to give more generous pensions to those who changed jobs, and said individuals should be able to challenge trustees in court. The government has signalled its intention to water down the review committee's proposals, arguing they would impose too great a burden on employers. Mr Frank Field MP, select committee chairman, said the group voted unanimously against continuing the present 'voluntary' system of pension scheme regulation. The committee also felt the review committee's proposals did not go far enough. A central recommendation of the committee calls for a 'well-resourced' pensions regulator financed by tax revenues. Government officials have said privately they favour asking industry to finance the regulator, which would limit the resources available to it. The select committee also strongly endorsed the review committee's recommendation that scheme members be allowed to elect representatives to trustee boards. The Confederation of British Industry, the largest employers' body, opposes this measure. Almost all occupational schemes could meet modified standards of minimum solvency proposed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries as part of a pension law reform package, the social security department said yesterday. The pension law review committee had recommended schemes be required to have enough assets to buy the 'cash equivalent' of each member's benefit if it were suddenly wound up. Employers had argued that because calculation of cash equivalents is based on gilts yields while an average of 80 per cent of pension funds is invested in equities, the new rule would require them to dump equities and buy bonds. A modified proposal from the actuaries' professional body altered the calculation of cash equivalents to take more account of equity yields. The DSS concluded that on the modified basis, 95 per cent of the 500 schemes it surveyed were 100 per cent solvent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 14 January His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan,  chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], sent a  telegram to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, king of Cambodia,  expressing respect and admiration for the latter's 5 January  1994 editorial entitled "Human Rights in Cambodia and the Rights  of the Cambodian People To Live Permanently in Peace Within  Cambodia's Internationally Recognized Legitimate Land and Sea  Borders of 1963-69." The telegram reads as follows:    Humbly to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of  Cambodia.    His Majesty has composed an editorial dated 5 January 1994  entitled "Human Rights in Cambodia and the Rights of the  Cambodian People To Live Permanently in Peace Within Cambodia's  Internationally Recognized Legitimate Land and Sea Borders of  1963-69."    We would like to express our great respect and admiration  for  the resourcefulness of His Majesty, who is always concerned  about national and social problems facing our Cambodian nation  and people. Our people are delighted to praise you for this  prowess.    The editorial is encouraging our people to join hands to  resolve currently unresolved problems, both big and small, and  to follow you in your crusade, like the one you launched between  1952 and 1953. Our nation and people pin their hopes on His  Majesty, the only great leader capable of leading the country  and preventing our Cambodian nation and people from disappearing  as was the case in Kampuchea Kraom. Our nation and people are  well aware of the great dangers since several western powers and  UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] implemented a  policy of opening up Cambodia for millions of ethnic Vietnamese  to enter freely and systematically.    For our compatriots -- the children of His Majesty, who is  the father of the nation and the father of national independence  -- the editorial is vitally important. For this reason, I have  ordered the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia  [VGNUFC] radio to broadcast the article several times for the  attention of our nation and people.    Availing myself of this opportunity, I would like to wish  His  Majesty a speedy recovery, zealous physical strength, and high  spirits. I would like to extend best wishes to the respected  queen as well.    Your Majesty, please forgive any inappropriateness.    [Dated] 14 January 1994    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, PDK chairman</p>

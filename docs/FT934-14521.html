			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Japanese recovery trend 'marking time' JAPAN'S official forecasting body yesterday slightly downgraded its view on the economy, as the latest figures from the retail industry underlined consumers' continuing gloom. 'Movement towards a recovery is marking time and (the economy) is largely stagnating, affected by the sharp rise in the yen and the cool, wet summer,' the Economic Planning Agency said. This contrasts with the agency's previous monthly report, which said that the economy was at a 'standstill' but that the agency was sticking to its view that the recession would get not worse. To back up the agency's gloomy assessment, Mr Yasuhi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, warned yesterday that business sentiment had turned more cautious and that he saw no clear signs of recovery. Banks had become slightly more positive about making new loans, but were still cautious, because of bad debts built up during the liquidity-fed rise in asset prices of the late 1980s, Mr Mieno said. The agency highlighted three factors in Japan's current economic weakness: a continued fall in consumer spending, the rise in inventories of unsold stocks, and the decline in job openings. Department store sales in Tokyo fell an annualised 10.2 per cent last month, the 19th monthly decline in a row, the Japan department stores association said yesterday. A small, but unreliable, indicator of an improvement came with a report yesterday of a steep decline in corporate bankruptcies in the first half of the fiscal year, the six months to September. The amount of bankruptcies fell by 18.3 per cent in the first half, the third six-monthly fall running, said Teikoku Data Bank, a private research group. However, the decline in corporate collapses could be merely a symptom of the sluggishness of business activity, warned Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. Separately, Teikoku reported that liabilities guaranteed by Japan's 82 listed construction companies for their property subsidiaries rose by 15.5 per cent in 1992, to Y3,335bn (Pounds 20.5bn) - a heavy burden on their balance sheets.</p>

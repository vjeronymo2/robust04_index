			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed and selective view of Northern Ireland (1) Sir, As so frequently, Enoch Powell's analysis is both perceptive and flawed (Personal View, September 7). He is absolutely right to point out that the dispute in Northern Ireland is about nationality but wrong to see this as a choice between being British and being Irish. The people of Northern Ireland, in both communities, have never shown any desire to be British, as can be demonstrated by their consistent failure to elect British mainstream party MPs to Westminster; all of the electorate have repeatedly voted for local fringe candidates and every sitting Ulster MP is a fringe politician. Mr Powell should reflect that the choice facing the people of Northern Ireland is between being Irish and being Northern Irish. The majority may well choose to be Northern Irish, but they should understand the full implications of that. He, like every unionist politician this century, does the people of Ulster a grave disservice by continuing to speak of Northern Ireland as part of the UK when that relationship has never existed outside legal fiction. He should also reflect that, were the people of Britain to be asked, by referendum, whether they wished Northern Ireland to be part of Britain, they would overwhelmingly vote against this. The 'loyalist' and 'unionist' community must eventually face this reality. They must decide whether they can go it alone as an independent state within the European Union or join the rest of the population of the island of Ireland in forging one secular state. But they have so consistently opposed the British option that this can no longer be a real possibility for them. Andrew Dyke, 40 Compton Road, Winchmore Hill, London N2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mirza Sadikovic report from Bihac] </F>   [Excerpts] [Words indistinct] of the fiercest offensive on  Bihac County, Karadzic's chetniks are not giving up on their  aspirations to take Bihac, particularly since they have the  generous aid of the greatest traitor of the Bosnian people --  Fikret Abdic. Following instructions from his superiors, he has  set out to capture the left bank of the Una River. Artillery  and tank attacks along the defense lines on the  Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and the Bihac front went  on throughout the night, while artillery attacks at Bihac and  the outskirts of Cazin intensified this morning. After  yesterday's attacks in the Cazin-Velika Kladusa Commune, the  so-called army of so-called Kladusa autonomy was somewhat  quieter overnight, but it resumed attacking this morning. All  this is an illustration of the peace in [Velika] Kladusa that  Fikret Abdic claims he agreed yesterday with Karadzic [16 Feb].  [passage omitted]    As we report this, the chetniks have stepped-up attacks on  the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, and also on the demarcation  lines with the remains of Abdic's rebel army.</p>

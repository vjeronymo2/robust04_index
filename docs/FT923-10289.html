			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Striving to cap bid speculation - The factors behind Lasmo's low share price LAST December, Lasmo was the toast of the City after pulling off its audacious Pounds 1bn takeover of rival oil company Ultramar. Seven months later it has watched its shares plummet, and is the subject of bid rumours itself. Lasmo's directors joke that they have years of experience of opening the morning papers to read that companies are about to attempt to take them over. 'People can say that any company bigger than we are might be interested in buying us,' says Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive. 'Only there aren't so many companies that are bigger than us any more.' Nevertheless, Mr Greentree and his colleagues, who announced first-half results well above analysts' forecasts on Wednesday, might be forgiven for feeling disappointed by the persistence of the speculation, and a share price which stands at about a 20 per cent discount to the most pessimistic net asset valuations. Even oil industry analysts admit that the pressure on the share price is a classic example of City short-term thinking and distrust of companies that do not make fast profits. For in the longer term, there is much positive to be said of Lasmo. It is investing in 20 oil and gas fields in five countries, all due onstream by the end of 1994. These should add 40 per cent to the company's average production of 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day  - a figure which has itself increased by more than 100,000 b/d in the last year. Despite the problems experienced with floating off Ultramar's US downstream assets, the takeover achieved its objective of creating a strong exploration and production company with considerable reserves concentrated in the UK North Sea and Indonesia. In the North Sea, Lasmo has a number of interesting developments, notably the Markham field in the southern gas basin - the first project to export UK gas to the European market. Indonesia accounts for more than 40 per cent of reserves. And the company's share of reserves in its biggest interest, the Sanga Sanga production-sharing contract in Kalimantan, were recently increased by 34.1m barrels to 454.7m barrels. Gas from the field will be processed at the Bontang plant, currently being developed into the biggest liquefied natural gas plant in the world, giving Lasmo a significant foothold in the huge LNG market in the Pacific Rim. Mr Greentree says pessimistic City forecasts overlook the importance of these Indonesian assets. 'Indonesia is a huge earnings generator, but is one of the least understood parts of our business.' The forecast production increase, moreover, refers only to developments under way, and takes no account of possible success with the drill bit. Only last week, oil was discovered on acreage in which Lasmo has a 30 per cent share in the Irish Sea, four miles off the coast of Southport, Merseyside. As well as selling some parcels of non-core acreage, Lasmo is also trying to arrange swaps. The recent deal with BP, which left it with some attractive gas prospects adjacent to its Markham and Caister fields, highlighted the merits of this approach. Exploration spending will have to fall, however, to only Pounds 136m this year, and could be less than Pounds 100m next year. This is mainly because Lasmo is at a particularly capital-intensive phase in its cycle. The 20 ongoing developments raised capital spending to Pounds 184m in the first half of this year, compared with Pounds 129m in the same period in 1991. It is this factor, together with the Pounds 291m loss incurred on the disposal of Ultramar's downstream assets, that has caused gloom in the City. Before new developments come onstream, Lasmo faces a period of high spending, high debt, and probably unimpressive earnings. This week's results looked encouraging at first glance, with Pounds 26m net earnings outperforming all forecasts. But they were flattered by a holding charge of Pounds 22m, representing capitalised interest costs from carrying Ultramar's downstream businesses. 'In the long term, they look very good indeed, but in the short term all the worries on the dividend and earnings are still there,' said Mr Rob Arnott, oil analyst at Hoare Govett in London. Attention is also focused on gearing which, with total debt at Pounds 914m, stood at 80 per cent on June 30. The company believes, however, that gearing can be kept under control through its rationalisation programme. It expects to raise about Dollars 170m (Pounds 89m) from the sale of Ultramar's US upstream assets and the remaining 50 per cent of its interest in Lasmo Canada, and hopes to make further disposals of non-strategic UK assets worth up to Dollars 100m by the end of next year. The real wild card in the pack is the price of crude oil. Mr Michael Pavia, finance director, said a Pounds 1 per barrel rise in the sterling price, whether through a change in exchange rates or a rise in the dollar price, would add Dollars 40m to cashflow. Without such an upturn in the crude price, however, the share price looks set to remain low. If so, the bid speculation will continue. Some analysts even suggest that the price may have been driven down so far in the hope of a bid, which could revitalise the whole of the subdued oil sector. Larger companies, they say, will inevitably be looking at Lasmo, and valuing the whole package over the long term in the way the City does not. Mr Arnott says that now is the time a bid could emerge, with the share price looking attractive and the interim results and balance sheet just published. Mr David Basham, at Kleinwort Benson, disagrees, arguing that few oil companies would be in a position to make a bid that could total Pounds 3bn. They would have to wait until their own earnings start to pick up, which would not be before 1993 or 1994.</p>

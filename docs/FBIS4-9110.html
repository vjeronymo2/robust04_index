			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Moira Whittle, PA News] </F>   [Excerpts] An Irish doctor today described in vivid and  terrifying detail the horror of life for aid workers trapped in  the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde. Mary McLauglin, who comes  from Cork, is in a building in the town after travelling there  to arrange medical evacuations before the violent Serb offensive  began. She described, just hours before 10 patients were killed  by a direct hit on the main hospital, how she and the other  eight UN workers were "chronically frightened" and suffering  daily from acute anxiety attacks. Dr McLauglin also spoke of  her feelings of helplessness in the face of the tragedy suffered  by the people of Gorazde.    A despatch sent by the group after today's shelling said  they  were "running out of words to describe what is going on ... It  seems the Serbs are prepared to level east Gorazde  house-by-house in order to gain control over it".    The doctor said: "Yesterday at 6 PM shells landed at the  United Nations Military Observers building with four of them  rocking it and spreading debris into the rooms upstairs where  the refugees shelter. One blew a hole in the side of the  building adjacent to us and a little boy lost both his legs. We  cannot go to the assistance of such cases as it would be  suicidal to face direct fire ... How many others were injured  we do not know, but the fire raged in the building all night as  a grim reminder to us of how close we come to direct hits."  [passage omitted]    For Gorazde residents and refugees, she said conditions were  "appalling". "They have no food and have to risk their lives to  get water. Most shelter in badly-damaged buildings and the wet,  foggy weather is no help. But worst of all is the constant  shelling of the town and few have cellars suitable to protect  against this. We feel so helpess in the face of the great  tragedy for the people of Gorazde. Not a family has escaped  death."</p>

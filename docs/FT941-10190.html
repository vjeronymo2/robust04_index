			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Earnings at Goodyear climb 30% in quarter Strong operating margins enabled Goodyear, the last of the big US-owned tyre groups, to lift net income by nearly 30 per cent in the fourth quarter, despite a slight decline in sales. The company posted earnings of Dollars 113.2m, or 76 cents a share, in the final three months of 1993, against Dollars 87.5m, or 61 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992. Revenues slipped from Dollars 2.92bn to Dollars 2.91bn, largely because of 6 per cent slide in Europe, where the car industry is severely depressed. Latin America, with sales 5 per cent higher and operating income up 74 per cent, continued to outperform other regions. Sales were flat in the US, despite a strong performance by the domestic car industry. The announcement was greeted warmly on Wall Street, even though the company had given investors an accurate estimate of its results two weeks ago. The stock added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 in early trading, amid expectations that the company's performance would improve as the US economy expands in 1994. For the full year, net earnings, excluding extraordinary items and the effect of accounting changes, improved 33 per cent to Dollars 488.7m, or Dollars 2.57. Worldwide sales dipped to Dollars 11.64bn, compared with Dollars 11.78bn, but the year-earlier figure included Dollars 43m in revenues from businesses which were later discontinued.</p>

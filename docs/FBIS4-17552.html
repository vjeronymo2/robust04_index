			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 79 (569): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin; quotation marks as received]    [Text] Below are the excerpts from Parliamentary Chairman  Mechyslaw Hryb's speech at last week's international forum of  newly-independent states in Bucharest.    "The Supreme Soviet and Belarusian government embraced a  guarded policy of economic reforms with the main focus on  treatment rather than shock to be able to ward off a sharp fall  in living standards. That is why we have used fixed prices on  some foodstuffs and housing rent and services rather than price  liberalization over the interim period. We have kept intact  subsidies on a range of essentials.    At the same time, our economy is undergoing hard times in a  period of transition to market relations. Economic reform is  hampered because of the huge spending involved for the purpose  of disarmament and elimination of the after-effects of the  Chernobyl nuclear accident.    It must be said that Belarus was badly hit by the severance  of economic ties, emergence of new borders and trade barriers  between the republics of the former Soviet Union. Having no  mineral resources of our own and being a virtual assembly plant  of the former Soviet Union, we have found ourselves at an  extreme disadvantage. Our producers are having to buy raw  materials and fuel at prices much higher than Russia's internal  prices. Nonetheless, we find it increasingly hard to compete  even in the Russian market at which the country's exports are  oriented.    In these conditions, we have embarked on forming an economic  and monetary union with Russia in an effort to remove hurdles to  the flow of goods and services, realign prices for mining  products and set better conditions for the country's economic  performance. In the meantime, it must be said that this will  have no serious impact on our sovereignty.    Of course, we are well aware of being just at the onset of  reforms and of the daunting job to be done. However, the legal  groundwork for reform is already there and the pace of economic  reforms is accelerating."    Hryb next pointed to a number of conclusions made following  three years of the country's economic reform.    To begin with, he said, the pace of overhauling the old  administrative system of economic management was lower than that  of forming market infrastructures leading to lower efficiency in  economic management.    Secondly, apart from internal factors, the strategy of  market  reforms was largely dependent on external ones which for a  variety of reasons proved difficult for readjustment to the pace  of domestic reforms.    Thirdly, the mentality of the public used to accept high  social security guarantees as something granted appeared to be  one of the stumbling blocks to the acceleration of market  reforms.    Next, the widespread support for radical political and  economic reforms of the late 1980's and early 1990's was  followed by a sense of profound anxiety for the future. The  cost of perestroyka turned out too high. Efforts aimed at an  artificial acceleration of reforms have failed to bring any  tangible results causing general disenchantment which has  largely dented the idea of shifting to market economy.    Next, we have underestimated the factor of public unity with  an aim of building a democratic society and embracing market  reforms.    And finally, the emergence of an attractive legal groundwork  has failed to bring the much wanted foreign investment in areas  such as joint projects in engineering and power generation  industries, transport and communications, chemicals and  petrochemical industries and the farming sector.</p>

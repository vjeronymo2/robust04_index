Qualified Campaign Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Negligent Handling of Public Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accounting procedures employed by the Commission make allowance for reasonable loss and normal spoilage of equipment leased or purchased by a campaign. However, the Commission has at times encountered incidents involving the mismanagement or negligent handling of public funds that do not fall into either of these categories. The proposed rules therefore seek to clarify how such negligence and mismanagement is handled in the audit process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking comment on whether, as a precondition for the receipt of public funds, the candidate should agree to meet certain standards in handling public monies as well as in overseeing the use of and accounting for public funds. Such standards would be specified at 11 CFR 9003.1(b) and 9033.1(b). If this approach is taken, the Commission welcomes comment on what standard(s) would be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rules would amend 11 CFR 9004.4(b) and 9034.4(b), to clarify that the cost of items that are lost or misplaced due to negligence of a campaign committee will be considered a non-qualified expense for purposes of these rules. However, the Commission recognizes that there are varying degrees of negligence in this area, and that certain factors should be considered prior to any determination that a repayment is required. For example, these factors could include, but would not be listed to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made careful efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned by the committee. On this latter point, the Commission notes that a lost item, such as a newly-acquired vehicle, may involve a major investment of taxpayer funds, irrespective of the fact that its cost is only a small percentage of the total amount of equipment leased or owned by the campaign committee. The Commission welcomes comments on other factors that should be considered in making this determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another approach would be to limit the dollar amount of lost property that could be considered a qualified campaign expense. If a committee lost goods worth more than the specified amount, any amount over that figure would be a non-qualified campaign expense. This would have the advantage of not requiring the Commission to get involved in what could become a substantial number of negligence determinations, while recognizing that some loss is inevitable in large, lengthy campaigns. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach as well as on what reimbursement limit should be specified, if this were to be adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also seeking comments on how lost or stolen uninsured items should be reflected on statements of net outstanding campaign obligations [``NOCO'']. If an item is lost through negligence, the question is whether it should continue to be treated as an asset for purposes of the NOCO statement to avoid increasing the committee's entitlement. Comments are welcome on how this should be done. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that other proposed amendments to the NOCO requirements are discussed under ``NOCO Statements,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A related topic, the treatment of insurance proceeds, is discussed under ``Gains on the Use of Public Funds,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Closed Captioning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1992, Congress amended 26 U.S.C. 9003 to add a new paragraph (e), stating that no publicly funded candidate may receive funding for either the primary or general election campaign unless the candidate agrees that all of his or her television commercials will be closed captioned or otherwise capable of being viewed by deaf and hearing impaired individuals. Pub. L. 102&hyph;393, section 534, 106 Stat. 1764 (1992). Although no corresponding amendment was made to 26 U.S.C. 9033, section 9003(e) states that this requirement applies not only to candidates who are eligible to receive amounts from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, but also to those eligible for funding ``under chapter 96'' of Title 26 of the United States Code, that is, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act. The Commission is therefore proposing to add the statutory language to the candidate and committee agreement requirements found at both 11 CFR 9003.1(b) and 9033.1(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

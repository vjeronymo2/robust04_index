			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Wild days are here again: Adjusting to the rigours of the ERM is proving tougher than expected for some European currencies There will be no devaluations,' said the chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont, on the steps of the Treasury last month. Since then the government has staked billions of pounds in borrowed money to shore up the wilting sterling exchange rate. But such intervention exercises have a poor historical record of success in countering the waves of cynicism, greed and fear that periodically break over the foreign exchange markets. Very often, too, the market practitioners have a clearer perception of the underlying economic realities than do beleaguered politicians. This week, however, the main spotlight has been directed elsewhere in Europe. Two of the Nordic countries which have been unofficial members of the European Community's currency club, the European Monetary System, have been caught in the torrent of speculation. On Tuesday the Finnish markka was floated off its lifeline to the EMS's hybrid currency, the Ecu. The markka immediately sank by some 13 per cent against the D-Mark, and then a desperate battle began in Sweden to save the krona, involving at one stage overnight interest rates of 75 per cent. Within the EC proper the greatest pressure has been on the Italian lira. Interest rates have been sharply raised, taking the margin over D-Mark rates for three-month deposits up to about 10 percentage points. The Italian government, meanwhile, is seeking emergency powers to tackle the country's economic crisis. The immediate trigger for all this has been the approach of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, with voting taking place a week tomorrow. Present expectation is that the French will vote Yes by a narrow margin but the decision could still go either way. A No verdict would bring a potentially explosive end to a summer of simmering crisis for European currencies, beginning with the unexpected decision of the Danes to reject Maastricht in their own referendum at the beginning of June. Why has the crisis blown up in this way? Until the mishap in Denmark, European businessmen and travellers had been led to believe that currency integration was moving ahead quickly. With the single market about to be launched at the end of 1992, Europeans were to be spared the hazards of volatile currencies within their own continent. Although the ERM in theory permits currencies to shift around in occasional realignments, in practice the last significant change was back in 1986. The Maastricht treaty set out possible timetables according to which the ERM would be strengthened into a complete monetary union, perhaps in 1999, with a European Central Bank to control the single Euro-currency. The urge to fix exchange rates is one that comes and goes. The post-second world war Bretton Woods agreement, which was based upon the dollar and gold, lasted until 1971. It broke down because of the pressure of increasing speculative currency flows and the impossibility of holding down the gold price any longer. Floating can prove inflationary, however, unless a country's money is strictly controlled by a tough central bank able to overrule free-spending politicians. Moreover any small country in which imports and exports are very large in relation to the size of the economy can find floating dangerous because currency fluctuations may cause havoc with the internal price level. Borrowing may become very expensive, too, if a currency is seen to be risky. Yet large and powerful countries, notably the US, with imports only about 10 per cent of GDP, may be largely indifferent to the ups and downs of their currencies. Germany, where the Bundesbank has an important degree of independence, is one of the few countries to have achieved low inflation consistently over the years. Even during the 1970s some EC member states chose to track the D-Mark in a loose arrangement nicknamed the 'snake' (which the UK left after just six weeks in 1972 in pursuit of an inflationary economic boom). In 1979 this structure was refined and became the EMS. Over the next decade and more the EMS went from strength to strength. Even inflationary currencies such as the French franc and the Italian lira were seemingly tamed. Reluctant Britain eventually joined in 1990, and Spain and Portugal came in too. Hangers-on such as Sweden and Finland attached themselves to the system, partly to strengthen their credentials as candidates for EC membership. The buzz word behind it all was 'convergence'. With exchange rates locked together, European economies would come more and more in line in terms of inflation, output, growth and eventually living standards. Short-term interest rates and long-term bond yields, for instance, would fall into line. Moreover, because the German economy was the most powerful in the EC, the whole community would benefit from low German inflation. There has been an important political element too. The French have been especially determined to lock the franc and the D-Mark together to strengthen political cohesion at the very core of the EC and prevent Germany from turning its attention increasingly to the east. However, there are signs of over-confidence. The EMS has become bigger and more unwieldy, and yet EC politicians appear to have decided that the ERM should effectively be made into a fixed-rate arrangement. Devaluation has become a symbol of political as well as economic failure. Except in the most favourable conditions, however, this mechanism cannot work satisfactorily unless a monetary institution is created which looks at the needs of Europe as a whole. In practice the ERM is dominated by the Bundesbank, which has a constitutional obligation to consider only the interests of Germany. Short-term interest rate trends clearly reflect the change in sentiment. Differentials between the D-Mark and other ERM currencies generally narrowed until May, but have been widening since the Danish vote, often very sharply. Convergence has turned into divergence. This year, quite apart from the problems of the Maastricht referenda, three factors have begun to tear the ERM apart: The US has embarked upon a strategy of aggressive cuts in interest rates, almost regardless of the impact on the dollar's external value. Post-unification stresses in Germany have caused the Bundesbank to raise interest rates to very high levels, thus pushing all the ERM currencies to extreme valuations against the dollar, and to a lesser extent against the Japanese yen. Economic growth rates have slumped throughout Europe, and particular economic problems in countries such as the UK, Italy and Sweden are raising serious questions over their ability to sustain their present exchange rates. The ERM was supposed to bring positive benefits, pulling down inflation in those countries where it was high and reducing the need for Europeans to hedge against movements in each other's currencies. It would assist businesses to expand across borders and achieve the economies of scale. Now, however, the question is whether the attempts to keep up with the D-Mark are beginning to impose unreasonable economic costs. Britain is a case in point. Membership of the ERM has encouraged a reduction in inflation from 10.9 per cent on entry in 1990 to 3.6 per cent as released yesterday. That has turned out to be the easy bit. But the Treasury has never begun to grasp the negative implications for economic performance as a whole. Last autumn, for instance, it forecast that 1992 would show economic growth of 2 1/4 per cent. In fact GDP now appears likely to fall a little. It can be argued, therefore, that the unexpected cost of ERM membership will be anything up to 3 per cent of GDP in this year alone. When currencies depreciate, the sufferers are liable to be savers and consumers. But hard currency policies tend to penalise borrowers and manufacturing industry. Tightening belts may be one thing but closing factories is another. Sweden is also suffering a serious recession; GDP dropped by 1 per cent in 1991 and may fall slightly again this year. Again, inflation is not a problem, as it has been running below Germany's. But serious difficulties have been surfacing in the financial system. The government has already rescued Nordbanken and agreed to bail out Gota Bank. These are two of Sweden's four biggest banks. This highlights the problem that harmonisation of financial systems may be the most difficult element of convergence within a structure such as the ERM. Both in the UK and Scandinavia credit growth reached extreme levels in the late 1980s and the continuing overhang of debt could undermine the attempts to switch to a hard currency regime. In Germany, where episodes of currency appreciation have been quite common during the past 30 years, debt levels are much more conservative. But what will the British government do if banks in the UK begin to collapse? Financial difficulties apart, however, in neither the UK or Sweden is there any great case in terms of economic fundamentals for devaluation against the D-Mark (though the level of the dollar is another matter). Yet both countries urgently need much lower interest rates than they are likely to enjoy for several years within the D-Mark-dominated ERM. Their problems are quite different from those of Italy, which does appear to have lost competitiveness and also has a severe problem of government overspending. Most observers now regard a lira devaluation as inevitable. The danger is that massive speculation will shift from one currency to another. Meanwhile there is little flexibility left within the ERM, with the vulnerable currencies trapped almost on their floors against the D-Mark. It all adds up to one of the biggest currency crises since the wild days of the 1970s, and before that the early 1930s, another period when competitive devaluations and political obstinacy led to economic disruption and speculative excess. In 1931 there may have been no breakfast TV sound bites from chancellor Philip Snowden, but the British authorities were, as now, borrowing heavily from banks to support sterling - and this was only a few weeks before the Gold Standard had to be abandoned. On Thursday this week, however, John Major took up Norman Lamont's rallying cry. 'There is going to be no devaluation, no realignment,' he told a Scottish CBI dinner. The applause seemed polite rather than enthusiastic, which is not surprising given that, on present policies, industry will continue to bear much of the cost of adjustment.</p>

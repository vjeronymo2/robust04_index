			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / China sees 50% jump in reserves China's foreign exchange reserves at the end of June had jumped by 50 per cent over last year to Dollars 31.8bn (Pounds 20.5bn) because of increased exports and the effects of a currency devaluation. Mr Zhu Xiaohua, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's central bank, said the increased reserves indicated a 'sound performance of the national economy'. Western bankers in Beijing attributed the healthier reserves to the government's tight money policies which had restrained imports in the first half of the year. The depreciation of the yuan against the Japanese yen and the D-Mark had boosted exports to two of China's bigger markets. The Chinese currency, which is not convertible internationally, tracks the US dollar. China's export performance improved markedly in the first four months of the year following a deficit last year of Dollars 12.2bn. Export growth rebounded by 22 per cent to April compared with a sluggish 8 per cent in 1993. Import growth slowed to 20 per cent in the January-April period compared with growth last year of 30 per cent. Economists are forecasting a smaller trade deficit this year. The unification of China's multi-tiered currency at the beginning of the year and the establishment of an interbank money market had also bolstered the country's reserves. But western experts warned that China's foreign exchange reserves remain a murky issue. Beijing is now providing what it says are figures for reserves held solely by the central bank. Previously it had combined the reserves of both the People's Bank and Bank of China, China's specialised foreign currency bank. China's debt service ratio (interest payments as a percentage of exports and net private transfers) was expected to be in the range of 8-10 per cent this year, according to a Morgan Guaranty survey. Some Dollars 11.7bn and HKDollars 5.4bn (Pounds 454m) was traded in Shanghai's new foreign exchange market between April 1 and the end of June, the official China Daily newspaper reported yesterday. The establishment of the Shanghai market was part of far reaching reforms of China's foreign exchange system aimed at achieving full convertibility for the Chinese yuan within about 5 years. Chinese officials will not be drawn on the timing of such a step, but make no secret of the fact that turning the yuan into a 'hard currency' is one of their priorities.</p>

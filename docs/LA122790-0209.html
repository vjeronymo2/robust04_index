Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GUILTY PLEA IN PASTA-SEX CASE  </P> <P> A man who fled to Italy after allegedly feeding drug-laced spaghetti to two  women and then sexually assaulting them pleaded guilty today to felony sex  charges.  </P> <P> Nicola Iannone, 35, submitted his plea in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court to  two charges of gross sexual imposition.  </P> <P> He then was returned to the jail to be held without bond pending his Jan. 24  sentencing.  </P> <P> As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped six other charges against him,  including charges stemming from an alleged, similar incident in October, 1987.

The charges to which Iannone pleaded guilty alleged that he had sexual contact  with both victims and gave them drugs, either by force or deception.  </P> <P> Iannone, an Italian-born naturalized U.S. citizen, worked as a restaurant  consultant in Cincinnati and Chicago. He faces up to 1 1/2 years in prison on  each of the two counts.  </P></p>

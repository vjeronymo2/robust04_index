			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PRINCIPAL 'REHEARSED' IN DARK  </P> <P> Victoria Principal prepared for her role as a blind woman in a Sunday  made-for-television movie by wearing a blindfold for two weeks.  </P> <P> "I cooked dinner blindfolded, I baked, I made sandwiches, I scrambled eggs, ate  meals, and I even tended to business at my office with my eyes covered," said  the former star of CBS's "Dallas" in an interview with TV Guide.  </P> <P> In the ABC movie "Blind Witness," Principal plays a determined blind woman who  avenges her husband's murder. During filming in Utah, she wore special contact  lenses that distorted her vision and made her legally blind.  </P> <P> "I had to memorize all my locations before we shot a scene," said Principal,  who was also executive producer for the movie. "I would count every step and  practice moving to my marks over and over again because I couldn't see my  marks."  </P></p>

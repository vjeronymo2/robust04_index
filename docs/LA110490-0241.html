			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA VOTERS WILL NEED STAMINA;  </P> <P> BALLOTING: 89 CONTESTS WILL BE DECIDED. WEST HOLLYWOOD HAS A SINGLE PROPOSITION  -- WHETHER A CARD CASINO SHOULD BE ALLOWED.  </P> <P> A multi-candidate, multi-issue election that has the potential to redefine the  political agenda of the '90s in Santa Monica, and a high-stakes referendum over  legalized gambling in West Hollywood are the big local concerns as Westside  voters prepare to go to the polls on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Throughout the Westside, voters also will be selecting repre sentatives in  Congress and the state Legislature, but veteran Democrats are well entrenched  in every seat, and the defeat of any incumbent would be a big surprise.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, nine candidates are competing for three seats on the City  Council, and there also are contests for the Rent Control Board, the Santa  Monica-Malibu Unified School District Board of Education, the Santa Monica  College Board of Trustees and a municipal judgeship.  </P> <P> Much of the attention in the city, however, has been focused on the ballot  measures. Among the nine propositions on the city ballot (there is also a  school district bond issue) are questions dealing with development, crime and  the homeless, and rent control.  </P> <P> One thing the election will require of Santa Monica voters is stamina. The city  ballot was so long that it could not be consolidated with the even longer state  ballot. Voters will thus have to sign in twice and cast separate state and city  ballots.  </P> <P> All told, a Santa Monica voter wishing to cast a vote on every office and issue  on Tuesday will be making 89 decisions.  </P> <P> If this voter averages 10 seconds per decision, he or she will spend 14 minutes  and 50 seconds in the voting booth. Small wonder that 6,000 of the city's  54,000 registered voters have already requested absentee ballots.  </P> <P> In West Hollywood, by contrast, the election could hardly be simpler. There is  a single issue going before city voters, Proposition AA, which asks whether  card-club gambling should be legalized in the city.  </P> <P> The initiative is sponsored by a group of investors seeking to open a poker  casino similar to the large clubs found in Commerce and Bell Gardens.  </P> <P> The argument in favor is purely financial: Backers of the proposed casino say  it would generate $10 million a year for the city, a sum equal to one-third of  the current year's budget.  </P> <P> Although West Hollywood faces a financial pinch, and projects a budget gap for  next year that will have to be covered by cuts in services or a new source of  revenue, the gambling measure is opposed by every elected city official and all  major community groups. Most of the opposition is based on the traffic and  congestion a card casino would generate and the crime the critics say it would  attract.  </P> <P> Sponsors of the initiative have attempted to circumvent the official opposition  by appealing directly to West Hollywood by mail and phone. They sent 10,000  copies of a videotape extolling the virtues of the proposed casino to residents  targeted as likely voters. As of late last week, they had spent nearly $300,000  to try to make their case.  </P> <P> Elections also are taking place Tuesday in five Westside congressional  districts, five Assembly districts and three state Senate districts.  </P> <P> Registered Democrats substantially outnumber Republicans in each district, and  few Republican candidates have been able to raise the money it would take to  seriously challenge well-heeled Democratic incumbents.  </P> <P> In two of the congressional districts, however, the challengers are making a  particularly determined effort of it.  </P> <P> In the 23rd Congressional District, which includes such communities as Beverly  Hills, Westwood, Brentwood, Malibu and parts of the San Fernando Valley, GOP  candidate Jim Salomon of Beverly Hills has campaigned almost nonstop since  losing to Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson two years ago. He has attracted  financial backing from many local Republican business people and has been  warmly endorsed by the district's most famous Republican, Ronald Reagan. Even  so, an upset of seven-term incumbent Beilenson would be a shocker.  </P> <P> In the 27th Congressional District, which hugs the coast from Santa Monica to  the South Bay, West Los Angeles attorney David Barrett Cohen has stumped  vigorously against Democratic incumbent Mel Levine. Even the most optimistic  Republicans would be astonished by a Cohen victory on Tuesday, but a good  showing by the GOP candidate would position him well for 1992, when Levine is  widely expected to leave the seat open and run for the U.S. Senate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Democratic incumbents are strongly favored for reelection in every Westside  legislative and congressional district. Here is a brief overview of the choices  before the voters on Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congress  </P> <P> 23rd District: Malibu, Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Westwood, Bel-Air, Century  City, Beverly Hills, Rancho Park, Palms, northwestern San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> * Incumbent Democrat Anthony C.

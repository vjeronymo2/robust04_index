			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Forte Forte's strategy is clear from the way it presented yesterday's interim results. Recovery is slow to come through, but, thanks partly to two enhanced scrip dividends in a row, cash flow is strong enough to service its Pounds 1.3bn debt. There is no need for a rights issue, or for hasty sales of assets at knock-down prices. That is a legitimate approach, but yesterday's 4 per cent fall showed the market was expecting better. After all, the near doubling of the shares over the past year was predicated on the benefits of operational gearing in its hotels showing through more strongly by now. There is still a chance of this happening in the second half, but it will depend on the company's ability to push up room rates as well as occupancy. Equally important it must keep down costs, which are showing more underlying resilience than might be expected at this stage in the cycle. The more reasonable bet is that considerable patience will be required before Forte fulfils its promise. Though the company can manage on relatively modest capital expenditure, gearing thus limits its ability to exploit growth opportunities - like the expansion of its Travelodge chain in the UK. Arguably Forte's freedom of manoeuvre would be enhanced by the rights issue that seemed likely after the dividend was cut six months ago. But Forte regards equity as too expensive at present yields. Besides, a rights issue would be difficult to sell when even its reduced dividend may now be barely covered in the current year.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND TRIB'S FIGHT FOR LIFE;  </P> <P> PUBLISHING: EDITOR ROBERT MAYNARD'S LATEST RESCUE EFFORT CALLS FOR A 25% STAFF  REDUCTION. FAILURE WOULD MAKE OAKLAND THE NATION'S LARGEST CITY WITHOUT A  NEWSPAPER OF ITS OWN.  </P> <P> One sultry evening last week at UC Berkeley's rustic Faculty Club, Robert C.  Maynard held captive an audience of East Bay business and civic leaders with an  impassioned plea for grass-roots help to save his newspaper.  </P> <P> Earlier that day, the Tribune had announced drastic measures, including a staff  reduction of more than 25%, designed to pare the Oakland paper's out-of-line  costs and stave off bankruptcy.  </P> <P> What Maynard, who himself took a 20% pay cut, wanted from his audience was  support in rustling up subscriptions and advertising. At stake, in his view,  was the survival of Oakland's prime watchdog and news lifeline.  </P> <P> "I know you do not want to see Oakland, California, become the largest city in  the United States without its own newspaper," he told the group.  </P> <P> Maynard, however, knows full well that it will take more than a few  subscriptions to bail out the Tribune. Plagued by steep declines in advertising  and readership, empty coffers, outmoded facilities and competition from other  Bay Area newspapers, the 116-year-old daily is fighting for its life.  </P> <P> Although Maynard maintains that the cutbacks will put the Tribune on firm  financial footing, many staff members fear that the paper has begun a downward  spiral from which it might not emerge. They wonder how they will continue to  put out a worthy product once Maynard slices the staff to 500 from 725, on top  of previous reductions.  </P> <P> Gallows humor pervades the small, unkempt newsroom, reflected in a  hand-lettered sign that appeared at an employee's desk Tuesday, the day workers  were to submit routine records of work hours: "Act of Faith Day: Time Cards."  </P> <P> Underscoring the situation's severity was the resignation last Friday of Paul  R. Greenberg, a director and owner of the 21% of the company that Maynard does  not hold. It was Greenberg, a Los Angeles lawyer, who devised the financing  package that enabled him and Maynard to buy the Tribune from Gannett Co. in  1983. Gannett loaned the pair most of the $22 million. With the purchase,  Maynard became the first black owner of a major metropolitan daily.  </P> <P> Greenberg quit, he said, because he considers Maynard too weak a manager and  the company too short of funds to launch a successful resuscitation effort.  What is needed, he said, is to find a buyer with deeper pockets and stronger  management. But Maynard is dead set against selling.  </P> <P> "I see rebuilding as the most viable option," Maynard said in an interview at  his cluttered office in Tribune Tower in downtown Oakland. "The whole purpose  in the restructuring is to build for the long haul."  </P> <P> If Maynard, 53, sounds like a cockeyed optimist in the face of harsh realities,  perhaps he can be forgiven. He has for years defied skeptics who gave the  Tribune up for lost when he bought it.  </P> <P> That was four years after he was brought on board by Gannett as editor, the  first black to head newsroom operations at a metro daily. Exuberant and  charismatic, he had by then established himself as an advocate for minority  journalism.  </P> <P> The Brooklyn-born son of immigrants from Barbados, Maynard in the 1960s became  White House correspondent for the Washington Post at a time when blacks were  rarely hired by mainstream newspapers.  </P> <P> In 1977, he left the Post and, with his wife, Nancy Hicks Maynard, a former New  York Times reporter, co-founded the Institute for Journalism Education in  Berkeley, a minority training organization.  </P> <P> As editor of the Tribune, he used Gannett's plentiful resources to increase  news space, sharpen coverage and build staff, especially minorities.  </P> <P> "When I came here with Gannett, there were only two or three minorities on the  staff," he recalled. "That's where the building of a paper that reflected this  city began."  </P> <P> In recruiting young blacks, Maynard sold the idea of working at the Trib as a  "chance to be on the ground floor" of something important, said Lonnie Isabel,  whom Maynard hired away from the Boston Globe.  </P> <P> Many called it "following the Maynard vision," said Isabel, who moved to  Newsday last August as assistant national editor after 8 1/2 years as a writer  and editor at the Tribune. (Although many such experienced minorities have been  lured away, Maynard said minorities still make up 20% to 25% of the staff.)  </P> <P> As owner, without Gannett's funds, Maynard had to adapt to a hand-to-mouth  approach. He immediately won $10 million in concessions from unions, in the  process shifting from compatriot to adversary.  </P> <P> To attract readers, the newspaper launched a variety of zoning efforts -- often  unsuccessful -- to reach into ever-distant suburbs in Contra Costa County, many  of them affluent and white and unafflicted by the kinds of urban problems  common to Oakland. Millions of dollars were spent opening satellite offices and  shuffling people around. Some staff members became disillusioned, contending  that Maynard was a better guru than businessman and that he let circulation and  advertising needs dictate coverage.  </P> <P> "We were tough on the city administration in Oakland and very tough on the  school board (but) kissed up to the suburbs," one former reporter said. "Once  we had a story about a pancake breakfast in Montclair (an affluent section of  the Oakland Hills) on the front page of the paper. It turned people off."  </P> <P> In the meantime, Maynard had to deal with a personal crisis: prostate cancer.  He said he has been in remission for nearly three years.  </P> <P> Maynard, bearded and somewhat portly, points with pride to the paper's  achievements. A series on patronage in the school system prompted important  reforms. In April, the paper won a Pulitzer Prize for photo coverage of  October's Bay Area Quake.  </P> <P> Ironically, the quake also hastened the latest cutbacks. The tremor put out of  commission many of the Tribune's regular advertisers, notably the Emporium  Capwell department store and other merchants that depended on Emporium to draw  customers. (The Tribune building also was hit; it still shows cracks from the  quake, and Maynard said repairs so far have cost $250,000.)  </P> <P> The quake also delayed the long-awaited downtown Oakland renaissance on which  the Tribune has pinned many of its projections.  </P> <P> Advertising revenues are now 10%, or between $3 million and $4 million, below  pre-quake levels, an erosion that Maynard calls a "catastrophe." And  circulation has more or less steadily declined to about 130,000.  </P> <P> Key to the survival plan -- which is being headed up by Mrs. Maynard, the  company's senior vice president of marketing -- will be the response from the  six unions with which management must negotiate cutbacks.  </P> <P> Norman Golds, the Tribune's wire editor and vice chairman of the newspaper's  unit of the Northern California Newspaper Guild, noted that union  representatives are attending a convention in New York this week, putting on  hold negotiations over proposals to reduce staffing.  </P> <P> Although some industry observers say the unions remain bitter and antagonistic  after years of making concessions, Golds said they intend to cooperate.  </P> <P> "We understand the company does have financial difficulties," he said, "and we  want to help them in every way possible to keep the company running."  </P> <P> A 23-year veteran of the paper, Golds, 58, has weathered four ownerships and  frequent layoffs and cutbacks. For the first time, he said, he is considering  taking the company up on its offer of an early retirement buyout.  </P> <P> The staff, he said, is "glum." As one employee put it, "We're all looking for  jobs."  </P> <P> Maynard says the pessimism is understandable.  </P> <P> "It will take another year or so . . . for people to get used to the idea that  the Tribune can be a profitable and economically healthy organization," he  said.  </P> <P> What must happen first, he realizes, is a scaling back of the once lofty goal  of rivaling the San Francisco dailies. Instead of "trying to be all things to  all people," the paper will now concentrate on the corridor of towns stretching  from the Carquinez Strait on the north to Fremont on the south, forgoing  coverage of Contra Costa County suburbs further inland.  </P> <P> "What we've had to do here is be very humble," Maynard said. "It's a challenge  to our creative intelligence to find a way to live within our means."  </P> <P> Gannett Co. acknowledges that Maynard so far has paid none of the substantial  interest on its loan, which has a principal amount of $17 million. But an  executive maintains that the media company, based in Arlington, Va., has no  intention of calling the loan, at least not yet.  </P> <P> "Bob is a friend," said Douglas H. McCorkindale, vice chairman. "We're not  going to do anything that would put the Oakland Tribune in jeopardy."  </P> <P> Tom Goldstein, dean of Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, agreed that  the Tribune has "got a tricky struggle." But he refuses to count Maynard out.  "He has been able to keep it afloat when many had written it off."  </P></p>

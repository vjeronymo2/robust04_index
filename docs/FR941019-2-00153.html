			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> You also complained that ``the needed words of art `assignment' or `sublicense' do not appear'' in Subparagraph IV.B., which provides certain injunctive relief for U.S. Non-Licensees ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  those who have not entered into float glass license agreements with Pilkington). As you correctly observed, however, Subparagraph IV.B. does not enjoin Pilkington from enforcing limitations against them. But there is no need to do so; since U.S. Non-Licensees by definition are not in privity of contract with Pilkington, there is no contractual or other legitimate basis for Pilkington to enforce any license-agreement limitations against them. For the same reason, it is not necessary that Subparagraph IV.B. enjoin Pilkington from restricting or prohibiting the exercise of the right to sublicense or make assignments against persons with whom it is not in contractual privity under any float license agreement. Thus, neither the word ``assignment'' nor the word ``sublicensee'' is ``needed as part of the definition or concept of ``Limitations.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. You proposed to expand the definition of ``Subject Float Technology'' to include patented as well as unpatented float technology and to include float technology that was ``subject to disclosure'' as well as that actually disclosed to any given Licensee. In support, you claimed, incorrectly, that ``the protected class of intellectual property is far less than the body of intellectual property encompassed by the License Agreements *&blank;*&blank;*'' (p. 6, your letter). Indeed, they are the same. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose and effect of Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment is to free U.S. Licensees from any restraints (other than confidentiality) concerning all intellectual property rights acquired from Pilkington, to the extent that has not already occurred. As noted in the Competitive Impact Statement (p. 9), all U.S. Licensees' float license agreements have terminated, and the royalty obligations thereunder have become fully paid up. Also, Pilkington has acknowledged that its basic patent protection relating to the original form of float process has largely expired, and has represented that all mutual exchanges between Pilkington and its U.S. licensees (whether patented or not) have been terminated, the latest ten years ago. Pilkington has represented further (as have some of its U.S. Licensees) that all of the U.S. float glass patents licensed by Pilkington to any U.S. Licensee, either under the original grant or the improvement exchange provisions of the licenses, have expired. It is simply unnecessary, therefore, to cover patented rights that essentially no longer exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for technology that was ``subject to disclosure,'' that language is so vague and indefinite it would be impossible to identify the technology involved. In any case, it seems wholly unnecessary. According to the relevant float glass license agreements, Pilkington was obliged to disclose to each licensee (i) all ``necessary or useful'' know-how Pilkington developed, owned, or controlled at the time and (ii) all patented and unpatented float process improvements Pilkington discovered, owned, or controlled during the term of the mutual exchange provisions. Together, those obligations likely covered whatever might have been ``subject to disclosure.'' Of course, the proposed Judgment does not apply to any technology disclosed by a U.S. Licensee to your client (or to anyone else) that belongs to that U.S. Licensee rather than to Pilkington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, as you correctly observed (p. 8, your letter), the exclusionary language of the definition of ``Subject Float Technology''_other than float technology disclosed by Pilkington to any U.S. Licensee while Pilkington owned 50% or more of that U.S. Licensee_excludes float technology disclosed to a U.S. Licensee who was a Pilkington subsidiary at the time of disclosure ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  LOF) and not also disclosed to any other licensee who was not then a subsidiary ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  AFG, PPG, or Ford). We believe that intent is clear from the plain meaning of the exclusion (especially considering the included language, ``in relation to any given licensee,'' which limits the excluded technology), and so it is unnecessary to add the word ``only'' to the definition as you propose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6/7. You objected to (i) language in the proposed Final Judgment for resolving trade secret issues under ``applicable law,'' and (ii) the arbitration provisions of Pilkington's float license agreements plus the application of English law to disputes involving those agreements; accordingly, you proposed that the Judgment expressly reserve to the District Court jurisdiction over questions of applicable law in future litigation involving the defendants (including provisions for interlocutory appeals) and over any designated arbitrators (including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  review of their decisions). Alternatively, you also proposed replacing the choice of law provisions of the licenses with, for example, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and replacing the arbitration provisions with the venue of the District Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Your proposal seems far too sweeping insofar as it would reach future litigation. Moreover, the proposed Judgment (Subparagraph VII.B) already provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties. In addition, any court can, as this Court did in a related case in which it referred antitrust claims to arbitration, retain jurisdiction over arbitration proceedings for purposes of reviewing the decisions in those proceedings. Finally, the language (``under applicable law'') in the Judgment to which you objected requires application of the relevant conflict of laws rule, as to both U.S. Licensees and U.S. Non-Licensees, in determining the nature and existence of trade secrets, rather than, in the case of U.S. Licensees, merely following the license provision that requires application of English law. In any case, contrary to the implication of your letter based on the treatise cited therein (p. 10), we believe there is little, if any, substantive difference between the trade secret law of the United States and the comparable body of English law. Thus, we are unpersuaded that either of the alternative changes you propose should be adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. You proposed changing Subparagraph VII.A., which sets the term of the Judgment, in ways that effectively extend its duration beyond 10 years. In concluding that a period of 10 years is the appropriate life for most consent judgments, the Department has recognized that the anticompetitive effects of any challenged conduct or practices usually are fully dissipated within that time and that, because of the market changes likely to occur within that period, the operation of the judgment itself can have an undesirable competitive impact after 10 years. In this case, the Department believes that Pilkington technology is to a very substantial extent publicly known and therefore no longer of sufficient value to justify any restraints on its use, including obligations to maintain its confidentiality. Even more so would that be the case 10 years from now. Clearly, Pilkington would be subject to renewed antitrust challenge in the event it reinstituted, after expiration of the Judgment, the practices and conduct that led to this case in the first place. Thus, we believe Subparagraph VII.A. should remain unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. You complained that a prospective entrant into the float glass industry who cannot obtain rights by assignment or sublicensing would incur significant costs to the extent it was necessary (i) to review what you said are hundreds of unexpired relevant Pilkington float glass patents not licensed to U.S. Licensees, and (ii) to determine what float glass technology in the public domain is sufficient to construct and operate a competitive float glass plant. By failing to propose a specific change to address this complaint, you implicitly acknowledged that there are none that would avoid this task entirely or eliminate all risks associated with entry. Of course, without any modification, the proposed Judgment will allow U.S. Licensees to sublicense the requisite technology they used to construct and operate competitive float glass plants in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, we do not believe it would be in the public interest to forego entry of the proposed Judgment for failure to include therein any of your proposed changes. Nevertheless, we appreciate your interest in this matter and in the enforcement of the antitrust laws. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;Sincerely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> K.

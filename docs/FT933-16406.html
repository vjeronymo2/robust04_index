			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Saigon, where the past is another country: Once the premier city of Vietnam, now it is named after Ho Chi Minh, whose communist troops conquered it in 1975. Nicholas Woodsworth, who lived there as a small child, has just been back WHEN I was seven, my family moved from Ottawa, a placid northern city of snow banks and bureaucracy, to Saigon. Here, for the first time, I experienced the sweltering bustle of an Asian city in the tropics and felt an excitement which has stayed with me. But, even to a small child, it was obvious that an exotic climate was the least of differences between this city and my own secure world. In 1959, Saigon was between two wars. It was neither the French provincial city it had once been, nor the war-fattened American rear base it was to become. The catastrophic French defeat of Dien Bien Phu had taken place five years before. It would be another six years before the first American troops waded into combat off the beaches at Da Nang. But, in a city of eternal debacle and recovery, 1959 was a year as portentious as any: it was the year in which Ho Chi Minh began sending North Vietnamese soldiers over the 17th parallel in aid of the south's 'national liberation.' For my father, it was the beginning of a diplomatic posting he was to find the most tragically compelling in a lifetime of postings. As a member of an international commission set up to monitor post-colonial peace accords between the communist north and the western-backed south, he was to watch the rapid dissolution of Vietnam's fragile stability and its slide back into confrontation and war. For me, of course, there was nothing tragic or compelling about it. Adults found it difficult enough to see a meaningful pattern in the deceptions, political intrigues, corruption and misplaced enthusiasms that made up Saigon at the time. Children did not try. As Vietnam became an ever more obsessive concern in the minds of American anti-communist strategists - the first 'domino' that they believed would set south-east Asia toppling - my own mind pursued more immediate concerns: those of discovering a new, different, and wholly alluring world. For more than 30 years after, I carried round a set of childhood images of Saigon, some hazy, some etched deeply and fixed forever. Recently, I returned to Vietnam. Like me, like the entire face of the earth, the city has changed. Once again, Saigon became a new and different world to discover. Through the wondering eyes of a seven-year-old, any place at all has the ability to fix in the mind the vivid impression, the haunting image. What surprised me about Saigon is that it retains that power still. WE LIVED in a large, walled compound in a villa built in the French Art Deco style of the 1930s. Beyond the wall lay a wide boulevard, a river down which a stream of motor-cycles, bicycles and three-wheeled cyclo-pousses flowed from dawn to dusk in full, noisy spate. Unlike Canada, where life's intimacies lay hidden behind double-glazed windows and thick curtains, Saigon revealed itself in unself-conscious fashion on its footpaths. Children urinated in the gutters. Women washed themselves squatting on the ground in front of enamel tubs. Old men with bony rib cages dozed on hard, wooden beds. Scribes bashed away at antique typewriters. their clients dictating at their sides. Dentists yanked teeth, barbers cut hair, doctors ministered, saffron-robed bonzes promenaded with begging bowls in hand. It was smelly, hot, noisy - and, to a child trapped with his parents in the back seat of a black diplomatic car, infinitely appealing. But small boys rarely were let loose into the melee of Saigonese street life. Although the French no longer ruled Indochina, Saigon was still very much a city with a French flavour, an outpost of French commercial interests in the metropole, and home to the families that oversaw them. We lived the kind of privileged life that French expatriates throughout Asia and Africa had made for themselves and enjoyed for decades. I was enrolled in a French school, made blotted messes in my cahiers with old-fashioned nib pens, and muddled over the mysteries of French verb conjugation. My older sister, influenced by schoolgirl friends and visits to Saigon's pink brick Notre Dame cathedral, developed an obsession with Catholicism and announced her intention of becoming a nun. At the Circle Sportif, we swam and sunbathed and watched staid colonial matrons raising eyebrows at that daring new French invention, the bikini. At home, we chased geckos and lizards across the walls. At the back of the house, we crouched on our hams in imitation of the gardeners and house servants and, fascinated, watched them hack and spit and smoke tobacco through thick, bamboo tubes. On weekends, there were drives through rubber plantations to water-skiing on the Saigon river; on holidays, we stayed at country auberges in the hills and pine forests of Dalat. Only occasionally in this cocooned existence were there hints - talk overheard at adults' cocktail parties of civil disturbances, riots, brutal government repression and a war going badly in the hills and paddy fields to the north - that Vietnam was not simply some wonderfully warm and sunny playground. By the time we left in 1961, Saigon was already a city sitting squarely in the path of a fast-accelerating, oncoming disaster. IT IS 18 years since Hanoi's tanks smashed through the gates of Saigon's presidential palace and brought the cataclysm of the Vietnam war to an end. But signs of that great disruption are everywhere in the city's physical make-up, and more disturbingly, in its population. The war's aftermath is a drawn-out trauma from which Saigon is easing itself only slowly. French Saigon is still there but, in today's re-named Ho Chi Minh City, it lies buried, like an archaeological layer, under more recent, successive accretions deposited by Americans, Russians and North Vietnamese. To find it, one must burrow. I took a room overlooking the former rue Catinat, once the heart of colonial Saigon and today called Dong Khoi (or Victory) street. The hotel of the same name, once known as the Hotel de la Liberte, might once have been a gracious pile; today, it is a gloomy and crumbling relic. Its decorative stained glass windows are cracked, its marble and wrought iron staircases are dirty, its tiled Dollars 18 suites have been painted a dingy, battleship grey. From my upstairs balcony I searched the street, looking for signs of the past. There are still antique shops lining the avenue, and you can still find delicate crystal and bronze art nouveau lamps, pocket watches from Besancon and Geneva, old editions of Stendhal and Camus. But these now share a place with newer antiques more popular with today's visiting souvenir hunters. There are Zippo lighters engraved with the sexual doggerel of lonely 18-year-old GIs who, if they are alive at all, are now in their middle age. There are rusty field compasses, naval clocks, altitude gauges from US warplanes, army-issue eye-glasses, insignia and shoulder flashes, and even old jungle combat boots. There is something tragic and obscene in this trading in bloody memories, but it is not nearly as tragic as the human war mementoes who also haunt the street: amputees who stump, wheel-chair cases who roll, living on handouts and charity. Nor is it as sad as the city's remaining Amer-Asians, the issue of hasty rest and recuperation liaisons with servicemen, some of whom continue to live in Saigon in spite of an American programme to take them 'home.' Nor as wasteful and unrealised as the scores of Saigonese street children who roam the old rue Catinat, products of a dislocated society, living by vending and begging and petty theft. Everyone aged more than 20 has a war story here. Strolling along the street, you will meet fortune tellers who used to be businessman, second-hand book traders who were senior government officials, noodle cooks who once flew jet fighters. Remnants of Vietnam's smashed and painful history are everywhere. They loom large in the old concrete-shielded and pillar-boxed US embassy, from where diplomats, top soldiers and politicians fled in a chaotic, roof-top helicopter evacuation in 1975. They are evident, too, in the dull, east bloc-style architecture erected on city boulevards by the Soviets before their own recent departure. They surround the steel and glass one-time presidential palace - today Reunification Hall, the seat of local rule by a Hanoi government 1,200 kms to the north. Saigon's disjointed past made finding my own past difficult. When the southern republic disappeared, so also did all the officials, administrative bodies and documentation that might have helped me in my search. Visits to various offices proved useless; officialdom in Vietnam today is no lighter-handed than elsewhere in what remains of the socialist world. Somewhere in the stored archives of the former regime, I was told in a polite but stony-faced manner, there probably was a record of where the old International Control Commission villa was located. Unfortunately, though, it could take weeks or months to find - or not be found at all. I rented a bicycle and began to look for myself. THERE IS a line in the opening pages of Graham Greene's novel of Vietnam, The Quiet American, which stayed in my mind as, hour after hour, I cycled through the humid, soupy atmosphere of Saigon's crowded streets. When jaded and world-weary war reporter Thomas Fowler loses Phuong, his Vietnamese mistress, to a naive young American diplomat newly-arrived in Saigon, he reflects bitterly on the meaning of Phuong's name, which in Vietnamese means Phoenix. But 'nothing nowadays is fabulous,' he tells himself, 'and nothing rises from its ashes.' Greene was pessimistic about the fate of Vietnam even when he wrote The Quiet American in 1954 and foresaw the tragic consequences of growing US involvement there. What would he think of Saigon 40 years later? I wondered. In spite of the great ache left by the war and a damaging US trade embargo that continues even today, Saigon is rising from its ashes. Greene might be pleasantly surprised. Saigon might be known officially as Ho Chi Minh City, but its inhabitants rarely call it that. For more than a decade, Hanoi's attempts to re-make the city's substance and spirit in a socialist mould rarely were successful. Since 1990, with Vietnam's gradual re-admittance of market economies and an open-door investment policy, Saigon has become a place that hums and throbs ceaselessly with entrepreneurial energy. A few blocks up from the Dong Khoi hotel on Le Loi Boulevard, both the French colonial past and the American war seem only a distant dream. Even from the seat of a slow-cruising bicycle, you can feel the impetus that has turned Saigon into Vietnam's leading force for social and economic change and the busiest, most productive city in the nation. At the entrance of the newly-renovated Continental Hotel, once headquarters for generations of war reporters, I watched European, Australian and even occasional prospecting US businessmen dash through the heat from meetings to their air-conditioned rooms. In front of the busy Ben Thanh market, young Vietnamese men roared by on shiny new Japanese motor-bikes, the fruit of labour in one of the city's sprawling factories, textile mills or middle-tech assembly plants. A little more sedately, but much more fashionably, legions of young Saigonese women scudded by on scooters, fitted out elegantly in over-sized sunglasses, bright dresses, and colour co-ordinated driving gloves that stretched to their elbows. Cycling down by the docks on the Saigon river, where the fictional Fowler watched US warplanes being unloaded, I saw container ships from Piraeus, Panama and Yokohama unloading their own less-destructive cargoes of foreign factory equipment, cars, television sets. It will not be long before Saigon is making some of these things itself. Pedalling about late at night, I watched crowds of laughing Vietnamese emerge from some of the scores of city bars and dance clubs that have opened recently. By the standards of the recent past, even the names of these places are shocking: 'Apocalypse Now', 'Good Morning Vietnam', 'B4-75.' In their dress, their behaviour, their evident enjoyment of life, these Vietnamese on an evening out could be British, French, German or - dare one say it - young Americans. There are many travellers in south-east Asia, self-perceived purists of oriental culture who, arriving in Saigon, look somewhat disdainfully on the city. You must go to Hue, or Hanoi, or into the villages, they say; Saigon is not the real Vietnam: it is a fickle, cheap, neon city, the tart of Indochina, tainted by decades of contact with western values and western commercialism. I disagree. Saigon is the entrepreneurial city it has always been. Unlike the North Vietnamese, its inhabitants are a commercial people with an eye always on the main chance. This same materialistic vitality also gives them a joie-de-vivre; a sensuous pleasure in colour, movement, noise, food, conversation and company. Saigon's psyche is southern, and as different from that of Hanoi as Brussels is from Marseilles. Compared with much of south-east Asia it is still an old-fashioned, bicycle-ridden city, but is a place that roars and swirls with life. It is a place unlikely to remain old-fashioned for long. AFTER THREE days of cycling, I finally found the ochre-coloured French colonial house for which I was looking. It had changed little. Behind its high wall, the semi-circular architecture, portal-shaped windows and high-columned verandahs were just as I remembered them. In the end, though, the Saigonese villa of my childhood failed to come alive  -it remained as static and dream-like as it was in my memory. Perhaps it is true that there is no going back. Saigon has been through so much since, and seems embarked so determinedly on yet one more stage in its turbid history, that the house is a walled-off piece of history. What fills my imagination now are other, equally vivid images collected while looking for a past - those of an energetic, restless Saigon looking for a future.</p>

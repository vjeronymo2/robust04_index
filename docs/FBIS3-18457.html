			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Regarding claims that Russia has been  dispatching units to establish security zones in Azerbaijan,  Turkey has stated that should peace forces be required in  Azerbaijan, it should be done within the framework of the CSCE  principles which stipulate that these units be multinational.    Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman, at his  weekly news conference, indicated that there was no information  regarding Russian soldiers being sent to Azerbaijan, adding that  the sending of peace forces to the CSCE countries was determined  at the CSCE Council of Ministers meeting in Rome. [passage  omitted]    Ataman further stated that they received reports regarding a  ceasefire in Azerbaijan but that it was not comprehensive and  recalled that Turkey stressed that the ceasefire, on its own, is  not sufficient to solve the issue.    Ataman concluded by saying that the ceasefire will be  significant only if the Armenians withdraw from the territories  they occupy and enable the refugees to return.</p>

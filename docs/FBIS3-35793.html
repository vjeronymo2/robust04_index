			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan--"Russia needs an integral,  sovereign, stable, and economically sound Georgia. It is only  with this kind of Georgia that Russia can preserve the friendly  relations that have been formed over the centuries," Russian  Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said, speaking at a  meeting with North Caucasian leaders at the Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry.    This meeting was held on the eve of an official visit to  Georgia by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. "The importance of  this trip," Kozyrev stressed, "goes beyond the framework of  Russian-Georgian relations. Here we are talking about an  important step toward the implementation of a strategic policy  in the Caucasus. This policy is set on the basis of a carefully  calculated balance between state and regional interests."    According to Kozyrev, "allegations of some kind of a  military  alliance between Russia and Georgia against Abkhazia are totally  unfounded." Russia, he said, does not divide the Caucasian  nations into "ours" and "theirs". One of the main tasks of the  visit is to advance a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia  and South Ossetia and to reaffirm Russia's role as a mediator in  this process. The Russian minister believes that if the sides  do not reach a comprehensive political settlement of the Abkhaz  conflict and do not formulate and sign the relevant documents  under the auspices of the United Nations, it will be simply  dangerous optimism to hope for peace in that region. In such a  case, extreme nationalists, "the party of war", will  increasingly shape politics in the Caucasus.    Kozyrev believes that, as a first step in this direction, it  is necessary to agree on conducting an operation to support  peace in Abkhazia, with the necessary involvement of  peacekeeping forces and international observers. The situation  in the region is of essential interest to Russia. That is why  it is, yet again, primarily Russian peacekeepers who will have  to conduct this peacekeeping effort in Abkhazia. Both Georgians  and Russians are asking for it. Russia will once more carry the  largest burden of the peacekeeping challenge--of safeguarding  human lives, of the sovereignty of the neighboring state, and of  the rights of national minorities.    Incidentally, the minister continued, "not only is Russia  not  hiding from the international community, but it is asking for  its support". He resolutely denied "patronizing or vicious  gloating by outsiders, or speculations by "the Zhirinovskiy  factor", both in Russia and in the West. "What one needs is not  lecturing on norms of the United Nations or the CSCE, but the  practical effort to establish these norms in the Transcaucasia,  as well as across the post-Soviet area on the whole," Kozyrev  said.    During the course of the visit, the issue of the North  Ossetian settlement will be raised with the Georgian leadership.  The truce in North Ossetia is being maintained, thanks to the  presence of the Russian peacekeeping contingent and  representatives of the CSCE. Bloodshed may resume there at any  time.</p>

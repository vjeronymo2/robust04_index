			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Column: Political Things, by Dora Kramer: "You Can't Argue </F> With Cowardice"]    [Text] After six months, several attempts, and practically  no results, the constitutional revision will be officially  interred this week. The Requiem Mass, as assistant rapporteur  Gustavo Krause put it, was celebrated last Wednesday "to the  sounds of Minister Ricupero's Gregorian chant." Krause was  referring to the finance minister's last-ditch effort to salvage  votes on some items.    Rubens Ricupero's hopes were as commendable as they were  futile, since nothing, really nothing, can be done when the  absence of a political compact is actually a smoke screen for  cowardice. And so much the worse when people choose to blame  others for the absence of character that enables one to  acknowledge one's own mistakes.    That was the case with all those who, preoccupied with  October's election, fled from a confrontation on fundamental  issues. For public consumption, they pretended that subjects  like ending the monopolies, tax and social security reform, and  changes in the election system had nothing to do with the daily  lives of the citizens. It was easier to make it look as though  only those people out there in Brasilia need be  concerned about all that. This is false, because everyone  retires, pays taxes, votes, and--especially--prefers not to see  his money used to finance someone's excessive privilege.    What is serious about this deceptive posture is the criminal  significance it harbors. The case of Petrobras [Brazilian  Petroleum Corporation] is an example. TV ads--paid for by the  taxpayers, since they were financed by tithes deducted from the  salaries of its employees--repeated over and over that ending  the petroleum monopoly was synonymous with handing Brazil over  to foreign interests [entreguismo]. By ignoring the  modernity of the concept, actually so decrepit as to  border on the sclerotic, the sponsors of this campaign are lying  to the public.    Why else didn't they depict on television the money pit that  is Petrobras today? Why didn't they answer Nelson Jobim,  rapporteur of the revision, when in an official capacity he  sought to find out how much the state enterprise paid the  government in dividends last year? Because then, by presenting  the figures that demonstrate the disgraceful gigantism on which  society earns no return, they would be exposing what lies behind  the ostensible protection of the national patrimony: the defense  of personal privileges in the case of the employees, and  protection of a robust cash cow, in the case of the politicians.    Since prudence dictates that one avoid generalizations like  the plague, it is really better to name names. Here we have the  case, made to order, of the PT. With its candidate for president  of Brazil ranking well ahead in the polls, the party should long  since have realized its folly. Or does the PT intend to govern  with the tax system as it is? Or will it keep Social Security  the way it is now? Of course not.    Well, the party that fled the revision out of fear of facing  issues that would expose the clout of the vested interests and  inevitably result in breaking their stranglehold will, if it  takes over in 1995, have nowhere to run. And there we encounter,  once again, a typical case of ideological dishonesty. Afraid to  lose votes, Lula has tried to serve two masters.    He neither allowed the party to stand in opposition to the  corporativist electorate nor let the PT defend nonstatist  positions during the debate. Of course he needs the vested  interests, but he also needs the middle class, which does not  depend on the State. So he is trying to have it both ways.    Obviously, if he is elected, he will make someone mad. One  of  the two sides will soon realize it has been deceived. Had it  entered the debate now, the PT would always have had the option  to let the reforms take place, vote against them, and pretend it  had nothing to do with the outcome. With Lula in Planalto  Palace, things change a little. His party will not have a  majority.    Therefore, he will need to play with the same political  skill  that he now says the leaders of the revision process lacked.  Since he will need the reforms, the currency that the liberals  will demand in exchange will be precisely the end of the  monopolies. And then, since the PT will no longer have the  alternative of pretending it has nothing to do with the matter,  its only option will be to negotiate. Or to submit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the diplomatic level, everybody seems to agree  now on the organization of a summit between the United States,  Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations within a  month. This is exactly what France demanded. The proposal has  been accepted by Yeltsin and Clinton. At the military level,  NATO should respond within 48 hours to the UN request for air  strikes. All this is very complicated and very dramatic as  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe admitted:    [Begin Juppe recording] We have to obtain a real cease-fire  and not a cease-fire on paper as we have been told for 48 hours  now, and the withdrawal of Serbian troops. If these conditions  are met and if the situation in Sarajevo is back to normal as it  is happening now, then an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] force  should be deployed in Gorazde to act as a buffer to enable the  arrival of humanitarian aid because it is urgent to do so as  there are 60,000 people whose food stock will not last more than  three days. Secondly, we have to make sure that other tragedies  similar to Gorazde's do not happen by securing the safe havens.  We are discussing this with the Americans and I hope that we  will at last do what France has been demanding for some months  now, that is to anticipate proportionate air strikes in safe  havens if the population is attacked. For this we will have to  define the exclusion zones and the strict rules of engagement  that we are working out now. Finally, we have to repeat again  that whatever our determination to use air power, there is no  lasting solution other than a political one. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- The Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) sees the  statement by Jan Ruml concerning Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's planned  visit to the Czech Republic as "an attack against the last  remains of the democratic paint in our country".    During his south Moravian trip on Tuesday [15 March], Ruml,  the Czech Interior Minister, said he intended to take all  possible steps to prevent Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's  Liberal Democratic Party, from staying in the Czech Republic.  He said he would push his intention through with the use of the  law on foreigners' stay in the country.    A SPR-RSC statement given by a party spokesman to CTK today,  says the SPR-RSC assures the government that Zhirinovskiy's  visit to the Czech Republic will take place sooner or later.    "Ruml is not disturbed by the crowds of economic refugees  from the world flowing to the Czech Republic and being nourished  from our citizens' taxes. Ruml is not disturbed by foreign  mafias' staying (in the country) and pursuing criminal  activities...," the statement says.    It adds that Ruml is not even disturbed by trips of Sudeten  German spokesman Franz Neubauer to the Czech Republic, towards  which he is raising blatant claims.    "Not the stance of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy but that of Ruml  can  be called fascist, and it directly contravenes the proclaimed  democracy and post-November (1989) ideas".    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said in Warsaw on March 14 that he  would pay a visit to the Czech Republic on March 20-21. He has  been invited by the extreme-right SPR-RSC.</p>

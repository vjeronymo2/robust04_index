			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Washington may approve aircraft sale to Saudis A US AGREEMENT on Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees for Israel brought warnings yesterday that it could endanger the Middle East peace process and an indication that the administration might be willing to proceed with a Saudi Arabian request for a Dollars 5bn military aircraft order. In Washington, efforts began in Congress almost immediately to extract concessions from President George Bush on other issues, in order to facilitate speedy passage of the loan agreement. Senator Christopher Bond urged the administration to proceed with the sale of additional F-15 fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia and warned that 40,000 jobs, the majority of them in his home state of Missouri, could be at stake if Riyadh's request was not approved. A US official said later that the president was seriously considering the sale, which had been requested last year. He denied that further consideration of the sale was linked to the loans guarantee agreement with Israel. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was quick to fire a warning shot across the bows of any scheme to sell additional F-15s to Saudi Arabia. 'No official or responsible politician in Israel can but oppose the sale of arms to an Arab country that continues to stress that it is in a state of war with Israel,' he told a lunch at the press club in Washington. He said that although people argued that Saudi Arabia was an ally of the US, Israel remembered that positive views had been expressed about the intentions of President Saddam Hussein only a few months before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Mr Rabin was also worried by reports that it would be the F-15E that might be sold to Saudi Arabia, an aircraft more advanced that those supplied to Israel. Saudi Arabia has asked for up to 62 F-15 aircraft as part of its military expansion programme following the defeat of Iraqi forces in Kuwait. Saudi officials have warned privately that if the US was unable to meet the order it might have to turn to Britain for additional Tornado aircraft. Meanwhile, Palestinians have charged the administration with bias for providing the loan guarantees needed by Israel in its attempts to absorb a flood of Soviet immigrants. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, said that 'if the loan guarantees are given while settlement activities are continuing, then this invalidates the role of the US as a peace broker'. Negative Arab reaction can be seen partly as posturing ahead of the resumption of peace talks with Israel in Washington later this month. Arab officials have indicated greater understanding in private of domestic pressures on both Mr Rabin and Mr Bush. Congressional leaders have told Mr Bush there is no prospect of the loan guarantees being approved before September, and there are still doubts over whether Mr Bush and Mr Rabin agreed that the cost of completing houses already under construction in the occupied territories should be deducted from the total amount the US will guar-antee. Israel sought yesterday to reinforce its claims that it was doing all it could to rein in settlements by announcing a freeze on house purchases in Arab East Jerusalem. It also announced that apartments acquired by the Housing Ministry under the previous pro-settlement Likud government would not be renovated. Israel's cabinet strongly condemned earlier this week a move by about 15 Jewish families into seven houses purchased in the Moslem quarter of the walled city. The Bush administration had refused to provide the loan guarantees - needed by Israel to borrow at preferential rates internationally - to the outgoing government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir because of its refusal to stop building settlements in territories captured in the 1967 war. Full details of the agreement reached by Mr Rabin and Mr Bush at the president's Kennebunkport holiday retreat have not been divulged but the Israeli leader intimated they had reached private understanding after some difficult discussions.</p>

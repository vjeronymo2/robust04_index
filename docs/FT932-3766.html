			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Labour alleges move to cut benefits by Pounds 5bn a year THE GOVERNMENT plans social security savings of about Pounds 5bn a year by the end of the century in order to stabilise the sector's proportion of public spending, Labour said yesterday. A second batch of documents, said to be from within the Department of Social Security, came to light a day after the Tories faced a damaging row provoked by the leaking of plans to cut substantially the cost of invalidity benefit. The proposals were to tax it, make it less generous and focus it more on the long-term sick. While ministers dismissed Labour's attack as further scaremongering, Tory backbenchers still appear uneasy about the prospect of further months of speculation and reports about public spending cuts in the approach to the unified Budget in November. The papers released by Labour spokesmen set out some broader points about the future of contributory benefits and also implied that other benefits would have to be cut. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said that the saving of Pounds 5bn a year by the end of the century envisaged in the papers was almost four times the Pounds 1.3bn saving from changes to invalidity benefit alone. But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, denied that the long-term review of his department's Pounds 80bn spending was Treasury-led. He said it was intended instead 'to make sure vulnerable people are protected, and to make sure the whole system is sustainable and does not outstrip the growth of the nation's ability to pay for it'. He insisted that there was no question of taking money away from people who were genuinely sick and in need, but said that there was a need to look at why the number of people claiming invalidity benefit had been rising so quickly and why people had been remain-ing on the benefit for longer. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, highlighted the paper's admission that introducing means-testing for invalidity benefit would be such a fundamental change that it could lead to assumptions that a similar approach would be extended to other contributory benefits. The move would undermine the principles of the welfare state, he said.</p>

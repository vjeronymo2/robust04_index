			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KLIMCHOCK, 18, WINS LA JOLLA TENNIS TITLE;  </P> <P> UNSEEDED ARIZONA STATE FRESHMAN BEATS TOP-SEEDED WOMAN IN 2 SETS  </P> <P> Experience meant nothing against youth and confidence Sunday in the women's  open singles finals at the 73rd Robins Group La Jolla Tennis Championships.  </P> <P> Unseeded Luann Klimchock, an 18-year-old freshman at Arizona State University,  won almost every big point, including five in a row to end the match, in  beating 27-year-old and No. 1 seeded Lisa Seemann of Solvang, 6-3, 7-6.  </P> <P> In the men's open finals, 23-year-old Scott Patridge of La Jolla defeated  30-year-old Jack Kruger of La Jolla, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.  </P> <P> The match and the second set appeared to be slipping away from Klimchock, who  graduated from high school in Tempe, Ariz., a semester early to attend Arizona  State, as she faced three set points in the tiebreaker. But Klimchock surprised  Seemann, who played at UC Santa Barbara from 1981-85, with her aggressive play.  </P> <P> Klimchock, named to the West team for the U.S. Olympic Festival in Oklahoma  this month, hit two forehand volley winners and a deep serve which Seemann hit  into the net, to tie the score, 6-6. She then hit a backhand passing shot up  the line and another deep, unreturnable serve to close out the match.  </P> <P> Strangely enough, Klimchock said she never felt threatened.  </P> <P> "I felt good about my game the whole week," she said. "I had nothing to lose. I  won the big points. I tried not to think about them -- just play."  </P> <P> Klimchock said her volleying was the difference in the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> "There were a few balls where I could (have) let them drop, but I caught them  in the air and caught her off guard," said Klimchock, whose father, Lou, played  baseball with Cleveland, Kansas City, the New York Yankees and the Milwaukee  Brewers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Patridge's power game proved to be too strong for the charging and  slicing game of Kruger.  </P> <P> "I'm not used to playing against a guy that hits the ball that hard," said the  fourth-seeded Kruger, who is playing his first singles tournament in two years.  "He was keeping pressure on my serve by hitting low returns and I wasn't doing  enough with his serve."  </P> <P> Second-seeded Patridge, who played at USD, said his plan was to hit the ball  with as much speed as possible.  </P> <P> "I figured that's how I would keep Jack off his game and off the net," Patridge  said.  </P></p>

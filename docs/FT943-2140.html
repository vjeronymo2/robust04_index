			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Brazil intervenes in currency markets Brazil's central bank yesterday intervened in the foreign exchange markets for the first time since the July launch of a new currency, the Real, Angus Foster writes. The bank was reported to be buying moderate quantities of dollars in return for Reals. The move follows mounting concern that the Real is overvalued against the US dollar, having appreciated nearly 15 per cent since July.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Digital chief announces restructuring DIGITAL Equipment, struggling to return to profitable growth, has restructured its operations into nine business units, each of which will be accountable for its financial performance. The restructuring represents 'a fundamental change in the way Digital conducts business,' the company said. It follows the recent appointment of Mr Robert Palmer as president and chief executive, following the retirement of Mr Kenneth Olsen, the company's founder. Mr Palmer said that Digital would become more responsive to customers. In the past, 'Digital has been an outstanding technology company, but has done a terrible job of marketing, of listening to what customers want,' he added. A pioneer of the minicomputer, Digital grew to become the second-largest US computer manufacturer. However, the company was slow to respond to competition from cheaper desktop computers and failed to endorse wholeheartedly the trend towards 'open systems' based upon industry standards. Digital recorded losses of Dollars 260.5m for its first fiscal quarter ending in September, following losses of Dollars 2.8bn for the fiscal year that ended in June. The new business units include five marketing groups that will address sectors in which Digital has been successful over the years, as well as industries targeted for significant growth, Mr Palmer said. They are: health; discrete manufacturing and defence; communications, education and entertainment; consumer and process manufacturing; and financial, professional and public services. Digital has also formed four product development and manufacturing groups for personal computers; components and peripherals; storage; and multivendor customer services. 'These organisations will be responsible for understanding customer needs and providing solutions to meet those needs,' said Mr Palmer. 'Collectively, the new business units will have all of Digital's worldwide profit responsibility.' The changes at Digital mirror a similar restructuring at International Business Machines 12 months ago, as both companies overhaul their operations in response to shifts in the computer market towards cheaper, microprocessor-based computers and a move towards standardisation of hardware and software. 'There is a similarity,' Mr Palmer acknowledged. 'We are trying to get at the same sort of problems. I think it probably validates the concept of business unit accountability and an understanding that the computer market is very complex and different business models are required for different market segments.' Like IBM, Digital is in the middle of reducing its manufacturing capacity and its workforce. Since 1989, Digital has cut 27,000 jobs. Over the next few months, Digital plans to reduce its payroll to about 90,000, from 108,500 at the end of September.</p>

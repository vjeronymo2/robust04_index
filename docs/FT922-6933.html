			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: EBRD plans to set up finance advisory brokerages in E Europe THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) plans to set up two corporate finance advisory boutiques in Eastern Europe which may eventually be launched as financial institutions in the private sector. Mr David Hexter, head of the EBRD's Financial Institutions Group, said the bank is keen to establish the new corporate finance advisory brokerages, as these would help to select and identify new projects in Eastern Europe for the EBRD and others. The two projects still need the EBRD board's approval. The projects would require only a small amount of capital at first. Once they were established as fully fledged financial institutions, however, the EBRD said it would probably reduce its involvement by selling, or by reducing its participation. Mr Hexter said: 'In both cases we have identified locally committed people who are prepared to run with the idea'. The EBRD plans to provide help such as credit analysis, training, and computer systems. He added that ideally the EBRD should play the role of a 'catalyst', encouraging foreign banks to participate in banking joint ventures. Mr Hexter, who previously helped to set up banking ventures in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary while he was working at Citibank, said that he was impressed by the willingness of Eastern European bankers to learn and to adapt to market conditions. The EBRD is working to develop banking systems in many Eastern and Central European economies. An estimated 90 to 95 per cent of the banks in the region are state-owned. The EBRD wants to promote the development of private sector banks.</p>

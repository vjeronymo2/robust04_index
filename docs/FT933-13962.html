			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Observer: Rogues gallery While still on the subject of fugitives and their fan clubs, remember Agha Hassan Abedi? There must be many small depositors in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International who wish they had never heard of the bank's Pakistani founder. Not so the founders of Pakistan's Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology. The privately funded university, named after Pakistan's current president, has rewarded Abedi for his generosity by naming its main auditorium after him. Abedi is not the only controversial figure associated with the new seat of learning. Abdul Qader Khan, a leading light in Pakistan's nuclear programme, is directing the construction. He was chosen for his reputation for getting things done against the odds.</p>

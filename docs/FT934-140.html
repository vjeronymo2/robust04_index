			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Russia to do more for poor The Russian government yesterday proposed higher social spending next year following the strong showing of the far-right in elections this month, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Gennady Melikyan, the labour minister, said social spending would rise from 9 to 13 per cent of gross national product. Russian reformers have become sensitive to improving the lot of ordinary people following the success of the ultra-nationalist party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a first deputy prime minister, said the government would increase income tax on high earners to pay for help for the poor. 'Because the gap between the poor and the rich is rapidly growing, the government has prepared new tax regulations,' he said. The prime minister Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin and other reformers have interpreted Mr Zhirinovsky's success as a protest vote against economic hardship caused by radical market reforms rather than as a genuine swell in extreme nationalist feeling. Mr Chernomyrdin has indicated his government would now focus less on tight monetary policy and more on investments to create jobs. The government will have to look for ways of funding more social spending without compromising its plans for a tough budget next year aimed at curbing the deficit.</p>

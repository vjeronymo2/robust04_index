			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement from the Albanian Foreign Ministry; place and </F> date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] With the aim of contributing to reducing tension  between the two countries and in the region in general, as well  as for creating a more favorable climate for the meeting between  the foreign ministers of Albania and Greece scheduled to be held  in Zurich on 3 May 1994 and whose success we are interested in,  Albania has decided to freeze the application of its decision  regarding the question of the diplomatic staff of the Greek  Embassy in Tirana until this meeting.    In Zurich a bilateral agreement on the diplomatic staffs of  both countries will also be discussed, as stressed in the  meeting that President Berisha held on 14 April with German  Ambassador Claus Vollers, representative of the troika of the  European Union in Tirana.    We hope that this act, which expresses Albania's  determination for a constructive policy, will serve as a signal  for the Greek Government to engage in stopping hostile acts and  following a policy of good-neighborliness toward Albania.    With this decision, Albania confirms once again its  determination to follow a policy of reducing tension and  preserving stability in the south of the Balkans.</p>

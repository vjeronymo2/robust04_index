			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GERMANY WILL CLOSE TROUBLED NUCLEAR PLANT  </P> <P> The last of eastern Germany's trouble-ridden nuclear power plants will close  this weekend on completion of a substitute oil-powered station, energy  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Officials will close the fourth and last reactor at the Greifswald plant, which  once provided 10% of former Communist-ruled East Germany's energy needs but did  not meet safety standards in the new united country.  </P> <P> The other three reactors, as well as a smaller plant at Rheinsberg, closed  earlier this year.  </P> <P> Environment Ministry spokeswoman Monika Litwin said the new oil-powered station  would come on line Saturday and take over the Greifswald area's heating and  electricity needs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1120 GMT on 22 May carries in its  "Live Dialogue" program a 40-minute interview from Ashgabat with  Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov and members of the  republic's leadership. The program is hosted by Ostankino  Television announcer Andrey Skryabin.    Niyazov is shown seated at a desk in a large room with  journalists seated at two rows of tables. After greeting the  viewers, President Niyazov answers questions put by a number of  journalists on, among other things, the the development of  Turkmenistan, a Euro-Asian union, cooperation within CIS and  bilateral relations, debts, social protection for the  population, economic plans in the near future, privatization,  trade unions, relations with the East, and state support for  agriculture.    Niyazov welcomes the journalists and thanks them for showing  a keen interest in the political and economic changes taking  place in Turkmenistan. He then says:    "It is important that we see Russia not as a state that has  already become separate, but as the main and leading force of  the CIS, whose position strikes us very much by its equality, by  mutually beneficial cooperation, by respect for the sovereignty  of the independent states that have been formed. Therefore, we  -- all members of the government present here -- cordially  welcome you to Turkmenistan, and I am ready to reply to your  questions."    Skryabin asks the first question: "What development concept  do you adhere to? Which is the most acceptable to you for the  development of your state?"    Niyazov replies: "We chose a secular, democratic path of  development, which is laid down in our constitution. The  constitution was discussed nationwide and was adopted by the  mejlis after a referendum."    The next question is asked by Andrey Polishchuk from  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev  proposed not that long ago that a Euro-Asian union should be  formed. I would like to know your personal point of view on  that proposal."    Niyazov replies: "What is that Euro-Asian union? Does  anybody know what sort of union that is? Is it just a sign to  replace the CIS, or is it a new, natural kind of commonwealth or  a new confederation? What is it? I simply do not see the  mechanism, function, or task of that Euro-Asian union, and I  fail to understand why a group arose immediately that supported  it, a group that rejected it. But I can say just one thing: the  CIS has begun to be formed as a community of independent states.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was very difficult  to form independent states, to acquire political independence,  economic independence, to establish every state. And the  process is difficult now since we are so bound together by 70  years of economic ties we cannot tear ourselves away from one  another. But that process must happen now. History cannot be  turned back to its original stage. It's my opinion that  everybody should cooperate with each other on equal and mutually  beneficial terms, of course, without harming each other. It  even occurs in families that brothers can have their own  economic calculations, but one does not get by at the expense of  the other.    "We support the strengthening of the Commonwealth of  Independent States but on equal terms. Therefore, I think at  the first stage there should be more concrete bilateral  cooperation, bilateral agreements between the states of the CIS,  and the CIS itself should through framework agreements determine  overall direction. Therefore, objectively, it is simply unable  to create strict structures now. We must take account of the  realities. The Commonwealth should exist, but it has to go  through a transitional stage in which each of us has to overcome  difficulties and not on the basis of mutual accusations but  taking account of the real interests of each. In this  connection, I would like to say an economic court of the  Commonwealth was formed. Today, the countries of the CIS owe  Turkmenistan 1.3 billion dollars. Ukraine owes around 800  million dollars; Georgia owes more than 200 million dollars.  Many countries owe us, but we are not issuing ultimatums, nor  are we appealing to any courts to have a concrete solution to  that. We realize all countries are going through an economic  crisis. We simply ask that the debt is acknowledged and  formulated through state agreements, that there is  accountability. The former Union no longer exists. Today we  are buying goods at world prices from all countries of the CIS,  but when fuel and energy resources are at issue, a more casual  approach is taken. Therefore, there should be equality in  everything."    Correspondent Albert Belyayev from "Kultura" asks Niyazov  about the role of culture in the political course pursued by  Turkmenistan, and what percentage of the national budget is  allocated for cultural purposes.    Niyazov replies: "I will tell you briefly that we must  develop our national culture, and for that purpose, we allocate  seven to 10 percent of the budget to culture." He adds that  Turkmenistan had great respect for the Russian culture, which  has had a very strong impact on it, but in his view every  country should be able to absorb those aspects of the world  culture that are the most appropriate to its traditions and  customs.    He then is asked by Natalya Polezhayeva from ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA whether the fact that there were numerous streets,  villages, towns, and monuments dedicated to him did not indicate  a beginning of a personality cult.    Niyazov replies: "I would like you to understand that a  personality cult cannot emerge in a free society, with a market  economy, private property, and other systems. There is no such  thing. But I can tell you that since I started working in  Turkmenistan in 1985 there was not a single arrest for political  dissent. There is not a single political prison in  Turkmenistan. There is no violence. Right now we are going  through a transition period. And during a transition period  there is a need for a national leader who, together with his  like-minded allies, must carry out all these major state and  social changes. I am not talking about myself. Maybe if there  was someone else, the attitude would have been the same."    Correspondent Skryabin asks Niyazov about his portrait on  the  national currency and about his attitude to the celebration of  his birthday as a national holiday.    Niyazov says: "I must tell you that we have had lengthy  discussions about bank notes. There were proposals from the  rank and file, but I was against it for a long time. There have  been enough major figures in the 800-year history of  Turkmenistan who could have been depicted on banknotes." He  adds that unfortunately no realistic portraits of these figures  have been left. And when a meeting of more than 1,000 Turkmen  elders proposed to have his portrait on the national currency,  Niyazov "took it as an honor, not flattery." "There is no need  for false modesty. It was an honor for me that the elders have  proposed to have my portrait on the national currency." He then  adds that in fact it was not his portrait that was important to  him, but rather the exchange rate of the national currency.    As for his birthday, Niyazov says he did not want and does  not want any celebrations. He says he had even drafted a decree  that would have banned the celebration of his birthday for the  duration of his term in office. However, parliament has  rejected it. He said he would still try to pass another law  that would allow people, if they so wish, to celebrate his  birthday after the end of his term in office.    Asked by Anatoliy Yurkov from RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA about social  protection provisions in Turkmenistan, Niyazov says:    "From the first day of the creation of an independent  Turkmenistan, we have decided to carry out reforms, state and  structural changes only if they have no negative effect on the  majority of the population. This is our main criteria. In the  process of political and economic reform, we always measure  everything against the social protection of the population.  Within the first year we said to the people that everyone would  have free gas and electricity. This is what we produce here,  and this is what we can offer to other countries without  depriving ourselves.    "The same thing with water. We have water and the  possibility to provide the population with good drinking water  free of charge. This is not luxury. Once we freed our people  from this burden, it had the opportunity to use its income for  other needs. At the same time we also had the opportunity to  increase people's wages. But the state is not wasting the money  either. We have cut our investment in the industry. We have  told the industry to develop itself through profits. We only  provide assistance to projects of national importance and  profitability, such as the building of a railway from  Turkmenistan to Iran, another railway from western Turkmenistan  along the coastline to Russia, and another one from eastern  Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, the building of new airports, new  sea ports, and communications systems. I think that  Turkmenistan will continue to develop its infrastructure, but  only by using local raw materials, such as textiles, gas  refining, chemical products, and agriculture. As for heavy  machine-building, it does not make sense to build a tractor or a  car plant, or an aircraft plant in Turkmenistan. It simply does  not make economic sense."    Anatoliy Druzenko from IZVESTIYA then asks why, since all  leaders of new independent states come from the socialist past  and could have gotten together and sorted everything out, this  is not happening.    Niyazov replies: "One must be a realist. There is no turning  back. If we say that we are all independent, be it politically  or economically, let us then have proper relations, rather then  having a union and someone as a coordinator. It does not work  anymore. There is no turning back. We may come to some sort of  integration, but right now everyone must live through this  disintegration. This is the most effective disintegration."    Niyazov then says everyone must live through this difficult  period, but there must be a joint effort to make it work, rather  than look for something new in the light of present  difficulties.    He says: "We favor joint spiritual values, economic links,  political links. We need them. But they must be civilized. I  must tell you that the latest CIS meeting went very well, and  many good decisions were taken. There was a divergence of  opinions, however. We must take into consideration various  opinions. We cannot force everyone to have the same opinion.  I, as a representative of my nation, may have a different  opinion on one or other question. So, why must I sign something  I feel will not be accepted here? This is why we must not rush.  The CIS is a slow process and will not spring up from a single  resolution. It must remain voluntary and mutually beneficial."    Dmitriy Murzin from FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA then asks Niyazov  to outline his vision of the economic structure in Turkmenistan.    Niyazov says: "As for the internal economic structure, we  are  not in a hurry to implement privatization. We are afraid to  privatize trade outlets in the first instance, as you did it in  Moscow, because then state resources have to be pumped into  these trade outlets since there are no producers. We have  decided to create producers of goods in the first instance. We  have already started privatizing public catering outlets and  communal services. As for factories and plants, all works of up  to 500 employees will be sold through auctions, to both  foreigners and our own people, but with a guarantee to provide  their own raw materials and to improve production for the next  five years. They will have to abide by Turkmen laws and pay  taxes. This suits us, because it creates jobs, the state  receives an income, and like this the industry will be fully  privatized. As for large enterprises of more than 500 to 1,000  employees, 50 percent of their shares will be sold off, while  the state will retain the remaining shares for the next five  years. We will sell off 49 percent of shares.    "We already have a large number of land owners, and we have  also distributed more than 150,000 hectares of land. I am a  land owner myself. I have 58 hectares of land. I plant and  grow there. We have allowed members of the government and  ministers to have private property."    He then adds that they have developed a number of laws to  prevent ministers and other individuals in positions of power  from using state assets and funds for personal gain.    "We are not destroying cotton growing and cattle breeding  collective farms, some of which are very profitable, where  employees have a high standard of living. These ones we will  keep. However, all the unprofitable ones will be sold off. We  are setting up new agricultural units. We can give up to 50  hectares of land to those who want new land. If an individual  wants up to 500 hectares, he must sign a declaration that he  will produce something on this land for at least two years,  rather than leaving it to his children, while the money is  there. No, this is not allowed."    Yuriy Sovtsov from TRUD asks then whether Niyazov envisages  the role of emerging trade unions as his opponents or his  supporters.    Niyazov replies: "It is true that trade unions had no  tangible influence on every day life of workers. They may have  had some political influence, but as far as workers' lives were  concerned, this was well known all across the Union... [pauses].  There were no decent canteens or accommodation or any other  proper service on factories, but no one took care of this.  Instead, everyone was busy politicking. The link between grass  route level trade unions and workers was severed. When the  financial support disappeared they disintegrated somewhat as  well. But a new trade unionist movement has been set up through  membership contributions, which is self-sufficient, and workers  have also become more demanding. Individual trade unions have  been given new functions. They are in the process of being set  up. We are supporting them, not financially but as a body that  takes care."    Niyazov is then asked by Valentin Simonov from KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA to tell -- honestly, if he can -- whether he regards the  absence of criticism of him in the local press as an advantage  or as a hindrance to his state activities.    Niyazov says: "Not only I, but many others have difficulty  accepting public criticism. We must be honest with ourselves.  I do not accept personal criticism of, say, my tastes, but if I  am criticized as a public figure for some mistakes in the  economic or political management, I can accept it easily. These  are two different things.    "But when personal insults are used to pad out public  criticism, this is not normal criticism. Criticism must be  civilised."    He then says that from his experience of traveling abroad,  he  can say he has never seen anywhere else the kind of criticism  mated out by the media in Moscow. He goes on to say that this  confused kind of intermingled criticism of personal and public  qualities in political figures comes from the 70 years of Soviet  rule. In his view, only when his ministers will not have to  worry about their financial future -- for example, become  private owners of industrial or other estates -- will they be  able to think independently. He says:    "Even if I encourage criticism right now, they will not  criticize me. Maybe five or 10 will. Therefore, it would be  silly to artificially create criticism of myself. Does this  mean that if I want to be called a democrat, I must create an  opposition, pluralism, set up a multiparty system, create a  group that will try to get to the top on the basis of the right  to criticize, rather than on the basis of its own program, a  program that would be to the benefit of the people?"    Nail Bikkenin from the journal SVOBODNAYA MYSL then asks him  to explain how the specific characteristics of the East apply to  Turkmenistan.    Replying to the question, Niyazov says that East and West  had  different cultural traditions and often did not understand each  other. There were good and bad people both in the East and  West, and it would be wrong to let the Russians' opinion of  Turkmenistanis be influenced by stereotypes.    Aleksandr Lisin of VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA tells Niyazov that  Muscovites are interested to know more about his personality and  asks whether there is a politician or some other famous man whom  he regards as his role model.    Niyazov says there is no single person who has influenced  him  in this way, but adds: "Since my childhood I have regarded as  my ideal only the ideas of the Communist Party, and people  should not be judged too severely for being impressed by them.  But then I discovered that these ideas cannot be be implemented  at the present stage and that our real mentality is very unlike  the things we say."    He goes on to say that equality, peace, and cooperation  will always remain mankind's great ideals.    Niyazov then says that when he joined the USSR Politburo in  1985, he used to admire Mikhail Gorbachev, but his attitude to  that leader gradually changed by 1989-90. "I like certain  things about Churchill's politics, some things about  Mitterrand's, and some about Li Peng's. Generally speaking, for  some reason, my only ideal is Friedrich Engels: when I read his  works, I think they are logical and consistent, and he impresses  me as a philosopher and political economist; he rather than  Marx. That's about it."    The last question is from Aleksandr Kharlamov of SELSKAYA  ZHIZN, who asks about Niyazov's attitude to state subsidies for  agriculture.    Niyazov replies: "In Turkmenistan, we know that at this  transitional stage, agriculture will not survive without  subsidies. Profits from the sale of oil and gas should be  redistributed. This happens in all civilized states. We should  not say: this branch is not profit- making, so we shall close it  down."    Skryabin then thanks Niyazov, who says in conclusion:    "Our way of political and economic development, our moral  and  cultural values are typical of our own people. I am not  imposing them on you and not preaching them to you, just telling  you about us. At the same time, we respect all states and their  form of development, their political and economic reforms."    Thanking the journalists who attended the meeting, he adds:    "We regard Russia as a great country with which we shall  maintain friendly relations whatever may happen. It is our  long-term policy to respect the policy Russia has chosen and to  cooperate with it on a mutually beneficial basis."</p>

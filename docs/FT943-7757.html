			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Sri Lankan PM vows to end war Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, sworn in as prime minister of Sri Lanka yesterday after winning this week's general election, pledged to try to end the civil war in the north of the island, where government troops are fighting separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas, Stefan Wagstyl writes from Colombo. She plans to approach the Tigers and other groups to discuss a settlement of the fighting, which has claimed over 30,000 lives in the last 17 years. 'We have to tread very carefully, but we intend to start on a solution soon,' she said. Mrs Kumaratunga, who is to keep the finance portfolio for herself, also promised to follow free market policies with 'the private sector as the main motor' of the economy. She wished to assuage fears that her People's Alliance, a centre-left coalition which has ended 17 years of conservative rule, might favour greater intervention in the economy. Her other priorities were constitutional reform, including curbing the powers of the executive president, and a drive against corruption.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTER INCURS DEFICIT DESPITE SOLD-OUT KIROV  </P> <P> The Kirov Ballet sold out all nine days of its run that ended Sunday at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center, according to Center President Thomas R.  Kendrick.  </P> <P> About 260,370 people attended, Kendrick said Tuesday, with roughly 60% of that  number buying single tickets as opposed to subscriptions.  </P> <P> With a top ticket price of $65 during the company's only Southern California  engagement, receipts totaled $1,433,475, according to Kendrick. But even at  that, income from ticket sales will not cover all the costs of the engagement.  However, the subsidy required to make up the difference will be less than first  anticipated.  </P> <P> "We originally projected a subsidy of $300,000," Kendrick said. "I hope it will  be half of that." CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

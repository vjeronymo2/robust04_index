			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (12) A question of balance - Case Study: The Forestry Commission: How a national pioneer in the use of personal computers in business is seeking to move spreadsheet processing off the central computer system and on to its 200 PCs THE Forestry Commission runs the 20/20 spreadsheet package on everything from personal computers in forest offices to the central installation at its national headquarters in Edinburgh. The central set-up is a cluster of six DEC VAX computers supporting over 400 DEC VT terminals in the head office and in seven regional offices, plus personal computers in the local offices, forest offices and workshops which manage the 4,375 sq. miles of land directly under the Forestry Commission's control. The commission was a pioneer in using personal computers both as self-contained machines and as terminals to a central system. In 1983 it installed personal computers in local offices, choosing the Kennet machine made by UK company Logica and sold by British Telecom as the Merlin. Nine years later many of these machines are still running and make up about half the commission's 200 personal computers. Local and forest offices use the personal computers to manage their local operations, running applications ranging from spreadsheets to payroll for industrial staff. They link to the headquarters machines for central applications such as financial systems, although the commission is looking at passing some accounting functions out to the local offices, too. Users can extract data relating to their operations from the centre and use it in their 20/20 spreadsheets: there are around 35 local personal computers running 20/20 and this is increasing to 55. This combination of local and central processing reflects the fair amount of autonomy given to the local operations. However, the Forestry Commission also has headquarters functions, to which the regional operations are quite closely tied. Staff in all these offices need access to corporate financial and other systems for everything from data entry to management applications. In addition, they communicate with each other by electronic mail, controlled by the central VAX set-up. Central software includes DEC's All-In-1 office automation package and ledger systems from Dun and Bradstreet Software, as well as 20/20: there are almost 290 20/20 users on the network. These users have standard DEC VT terminals, connected to the centre by British Telecom Kilostream fast digital links. 'We are keen to provide spreadsheets on local machines for local data manipulation but there is also a central role for 20/20,' says systems development manager Mr Alan Mitchell. 'It's horses for courses,' he says. 'For example, 20/20 on the central machines is used to pull together information from local offices in summary form. This is done for quite a few systems. As a matter of policy, certain information is needed at specific times each month.' Even so, the Forestry Commission wants to move spreadsheet processing off the central system and on to personal computers where possible, although many standard spreadsheets will continue to be run centrally for the foreseeable future. For the terminal-users, this possibility is being opened up gradually as old terminals are replaced by personal computers, still linked to the centre. 'Spreadsheets are hungry beasts in terms of processing demand and the more that are run centrally, the more power is taken out of the VAX,' says Mr Mitchell. 'We want to provide the facility and, indeed, we offer training on demand and we are producing examples of what people can do. But we are also looking at ways of controlling the extent of the use, because of the demand on processing resources. 'For example, we largely restrict central use to the headquarters and regional offices and we are considering things like limiting the computer memory space available to spreadsheet users.' The commission is also striking a balance between encouraging spreadsheet use and preventing users taking over all the processing power by providing standard templates for some applications. This also ensures that, in some cases at least, users are running spreadsheet programs which have been professionally written and tested by the central computing team - rather than risking writing incorrect programs of their own, which Mr Mitchell regards as 'worrying, but difficult to control.'</p>

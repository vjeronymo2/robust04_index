			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Money Markets: European rates held European money market rates were steady yesterday, with central banks across the Continent maintaining current interest rates ahead of this weekend's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven countries, writes Simon London. The Bank of Spain held its intervention rate unchanged at 12.65 per cent at its regular money market operations, injecting Pta 1,540bn. Some analysts had speculated that the rate might be shaved to ease the pressures on sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism. However, sterling was trading comfortably above its maximum permitted divergence against the peseta this week, and the Spanish authorities maintained a tight policy stance. In Germany the Bundesbank council left credit policy unchanged at its regular bi-weekly meeting. Call money rates were also unchanged at 9.40/50 per cent. Analysts commented that lower than expected reserve requirements for January, at DM77.6bn, contributed to the stable tone of the market. The Bank of France also maintained its intervention rate, at 9.6 per cent. The Bank injected FFr45bn at this rate, a net increase of FFr16.2bn over expiring funds. In London the Bank of England forecast another substantial liquidity shortage - Pounds 1.2bn later revised to Pounds 1.15bn. Overnight unsecured money rates rose to 14-13 1/2 per cent by midday, from 11-10 3/4 per cent on Wednesday. In early assistance, the Bank bought Pounds 379m paper for resale to the market on February 10 at 10 7/16 per cent, the same repurchase terms as on Wednesday. In late morning a further Pounds 99m was injected, through the outright purchase of band 1 band and treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent and a further Pounds 75m repurchase paper. Early afternoon assistance was more substantial, with the authorities able to inject Pounds 685m band 1 and band 2 bills, again at 10 3/8 per cent. This was enough to ease liquidity conditions and overnight rates subsided to 11-10 per cent by mid-afternoon. Overnight money closed at 11 1/2 -11 per cent; one-month interbank funds closed at 10 13/16 - per cent; three-month interbank funds at 10- 9/16 per cent. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closed little changed at 89.76.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> LAWMAKER URGES 'A DIAPER CHANGE'  </P> <P> "California needs a diaper change," state Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) told  reporters at Sacramento's Shalom School, which welcomes infants who wear cloth  diapers.  </P> <P> Killea announced legislation that would require manufacturers of disposable  diapers to warn consumers that the diapers are contributing to the nation's  garbage crisis. Saying 26% of the 266 California child-care centers she  surveyed refuse to accept infants who use cloth diapers, she added that her  bill also would prohibit "diaper discrimination" at child-care centers.  "Single-use throwaway diapers represent the most significant consumer item  entering our landfills today," she said.  </P></p>

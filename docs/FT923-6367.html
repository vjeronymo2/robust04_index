			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Observer: That's life However, it is not all doom and gloom. A fellow diner at London's Ritz Hotel restaurant yesterday reports that the number of tables graced by the presence of Scottish Life company actuaries was 18.18 per cent recurring, which sounds better than two tables out of eleven. Admittedly, it was a bit of a slow day at the Ritz, but if Scotland's actuaries can justify a table at the Ritz, then perhaps the good times can't be quite so far away.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Mkrtchyan: "Armenia: Dying Patient </F> Receives Shock Treatment"]    [Text] Yerevan -- Trenchant discussion over the  privatization of industrial enterprises has begun in Armenia.  The charged nature of the discussion is largely due to the fact  that the land reform implemented in the republic, which  established private ownership of land and compulsorily  eliminated all collective and state farms, has brought the  complete collapse of the agraraian sector.    Prime Minister G. Bagratyan, author of the "Armenian  version"  of reforms, recently stated that the government of the Republic  sees the abandonment of state ownership as the only way to  create the conditions necessary for effective production  activity. The crux of the "Armenian version" of privatization,  which was approved by the World Bank last year, basically  amounts to the fact that 20 percent of shares in denationalized  enterprises are to be retained by members of labor collectives.  The free purchase and sale of vouchers will be carried out.  Moreover, the government intends to ensure that businessmen who  belong to the Armenian diaspora have free access to the purchase  of shares in privatized enterprises.    The authors of the "Armenian version" of reforms, as  advocates of notorious "shock therapy," consider that society  has to go through a long period of tough trials. The whole  construct of such rapid and unconditional privatization of  industry, which is close in essence to Gaydar's reforms, is  posited on the highly dubious postulate that it is impossible to  manage the state sector of the economy in conditions of free  prices. Thus, the reformists of the Armenian economy are trying  to relieve the state from a host of commitments and concerns  regarding the people's welfare.    "Shock therapy" in local conditions will lead to the  predominance of corrupt groups and clans in the sphere of the  economy.</p>

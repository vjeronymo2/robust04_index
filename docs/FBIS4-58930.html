			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F> Sulayman al-Najjab, in Amman, by Sa'id Mu'addi from the "With  the Events" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive  Committee member, currently in Amman: You boycotted the  Executive Committee meetings. You also refuse to take part in  the Palestinian authority. What is the reason?    [Al-Najjab] I did not attend the Executive Committee  meetings, which were devoted to endorsing decisions that were  made without consultation with the Executive Committee. I  announced that I would not take part in the Palestinian  authority under the agreement recently signed in Cairo. This  authority would remain under the control of the Israeli military  government, and it is rather similar to a civil administration.  That is why I refused to participate in this authority.    [Mu'addi] What is the solution, and what should Yasir  'Arafat do in this phase? Why does the minority not comply with  the majority's decision?    [Al-Najjab] Many Executive Committee members are not  attending the meetings being held in Tunis. I am fully  convinced that this agreement will not succeed in achieving any  of the Palestinian people's national objectives. This agreement  will not improve the Palestinian people's living conditions.  Our people will continue to adhere to their goal regarding  national independence and solving the refugees' issue in  accordance with UN resolutions.    [Mu'addi] You are the [Palestinian] People's Party's  representative in the Executive Committee. What is the  alternative to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement?    [Al-Najjab] As you know, I believe that we have long been  demanding a peaceful settlement of both the Arab-Israeli  conflict and the Palestinian-Israeli dispute based on  implementing the pertinent UN resolutions, particularly the  Security Council resolutions. This agreement is not a phased or  final solution. The solution, or the alternative, is to hold  more serious negotiations, which should be based on the  resolutions of international legitimacy and which should seek  their implementation, rather than to avoid the implementation  of, or commitment to, these resolutions.    What is required is to secure Israeli withdrawal as  stipulated by the Security Council resolutions. The  Gaza-Jericho arrangements, or agreement, have nothing to do with  implementing the UN resolutions. This agreement, rather, seeks  to entrench the current situation.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab: There are Palestinian  figures from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who refuse to join the  future Palestinian authority. What is your comment?    [Al-Najjab] What you indicate proves that this agreement has  not convinced anyone that it will secure even a temporary  solution. The alternative is to search for a solution that will  secure the Palestinian people's rights. Such a solution can be  achieved if the Israeli side commits itself to Resolution 242  and to the fact that any phased settlements are only  preparations and steps on the path of implementing Resolution  242.    [Mu'addi] But there is an agreement signed by the two sides  regarding the transitional phase.    [Al-Najjab] If the Palestinian people, or their majority, do  not accept this agreement, then it cannot be implemented. There  are many examples in this regard. The fate of any solution that  does not secure both the Palestinian people's rights and the  actual interests of both sides would... [sentence incomplete as  heard]    [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, Executive Committee  member, currently in Amman: Thank you very much.    [Al-Najjab] You are very welcome, Sa'id.</p>

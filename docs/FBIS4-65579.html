			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, expressed grave disappointment  over Rauf Denktas' negative response to the 21 March document on  the confidence-building measures. In a statement to CyBC [the  Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] in New York, the U.S. official  said the current opportunity was the first in years to remove  the deadlock and noted the need for a new direction. Lamb told  the CyBC correspondent that Gustave Feissel has sent his report  to UN Headquarters and that the Butrus-Ghali report to the  Security Council would be submitted on Monday at the latest.    The U.S. official said he expects the bulk of the  responsibility for the collapse of the talks to be attributed to  Denktas. Asked what will follow the report, Lamb said it was  too early to say and added that after the report is submitted  there will be consultations among the Security Council members.</p>

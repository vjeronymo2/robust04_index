			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Motoring: Britain's debt to those Japanese transplants / Putting the new Carina range through its paces THE THOUGHT might stick in the gullet of some Britons but, in a few years, nearly a quarter of all cars made in the UK will have Japanese names. They will, though, be proper British cars - far more British than some makes most people now think are British, but which are made in Germany or Spain by US-owned companies. Nissan's factory at Washington, Co. Durham, exported 90 per cent of the 112,700 Primeras it made last year, earning Pounds 695m in foreign currencies. This year, its export earnings will rise to more than Pounds 900m. From 1993, when production of the Primera and the soon-to-be-introduced Micra replacement goes up to 270,000 units a year, export earnings must top Pounds 1bn. Toyota's new Carina E - which I sampled in Italy and Switzerland earlier this month - is being imported from Japan. In December, though, a greenfield plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, will start building the car for UK and export (mainly European) buyers at the rate of 100,000 a year. The engines will come from another new Toyota plant at Shotton, north Wales. By mid-1993, Honda will be producing a two-litre model (code-named Synchro) at an annual rate of 100,000 at Swindon, Wiltshire, 75 per cent of them for export. Already, 25 per cent of all Honda cars sold in Britain are made in the country and the figure will be nearly 40 per cent by this time next year. These Japanese transplants are at least part of the reason why Britain's motor industry can face the future with some confidence. But why did the Japanese come to the UK? I believe there are two main reasons: that English has been a compulsory second language in Japanese schools for a long time, and because golf is their national passion. Japanese businessmen can talk to Britons more easily than other Europeans. And they know there are more golf courses in the UK than all mainland European countries put together. Luckily for Britain, it has been a winning combination. If they had been hooked on pelota or bull-fighting, and spoke Spanish as well as they speak English, the consequences for Britain's car industry would not have borne thinking about. I had all this in mind when I tried-out the Carina E range (the E stands for Excellence in Europe). The Carina E is a front wheel-driven four-door saloon or five-door hatchback. It comes with a choice of four petrol engines of 1.6 or two litres, all with twin camshafts, 16 valves and three-way catalytic converters. Power outputs range from the Pounds 12,145 XLi entry model's 114 horsepower to 155 horsepower in the highest-performing GTi (Pounds 16,980 as back). A two-litre, 72-horsepower diesel joins the range in September. The Carina E and Primera are pointed like daggers at the heart of the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), which is the car to beat in the modestly-priced European mid-range. Unsurprisingly, they all look very much alike although the Carina E has a leaner line and, because it is a bit longer, is roomier inside than either the Primera or Cavalier. Stripped of their badges, I doubt I would have known if I was driving a Carina E, Primera or Cavalier. You cannot say that all modern cars in this size and price class are the same but the differences are in degree, not principle. It was a demanding drive; 200 miles (322 km) between breakfast and lunch including the San Bernadino, Julier and Maloja passes and, for a less-than-grand finale, a narrow road infested with tourist coaches down the entire length of Lake Como. I started with the 1.6-litre, five-door XLi; moved on to a two-litre, 114-horsepower GLi automatic; changed to a manual two-litre, 131-horsepower Executive; and finished up in the GTi. The cheapest car made the best impression. They nearly always do. The XLi was very quiet and nicely-balanced. Its 70-series Dunlops had ample cornering grip but thumped not at all. The engine hummed sweetly and the air flowed almost silently around curvy body panels and well-fitted doors. It rode shock-absorbently, swung smoothly through hairpin bends, handled with precision and parked easily (all Carina Es have power steering). Toyota claims a top speed of 119 mph (191 kmh) and 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh) acceleration in 11.2 seconds for the 1.6 LX. More to the point, it is economical as well as agreeably driveable. Its lean-burn engine works on an air/fuel mix of about 23:1 compared with a normal engine's 14.7:1. The official constant 56 mph (90 kmh) figure of 57.6 mpg (4.9 l/100 km) is close to the two-litre diesel's 64.2 mpg (4.4 l/100 km). The equivalent 1.6 Cavalier manages 56.5 mpg (5.0 l/100 km) and the 1.6 Primera 54.3 mpg (5.2 l/100 km). Of course, in the cut and thrust of daily motoring, with cold starts and stop-start traffic driving, the gap between petrol and diesel would be much wider. The two-pedal, lean-burn GLi went well on mountain roads but I wished I had saved it for the last leg on the cluttered, slow road to Como. The Executive, with its lusher interior, reminded me of its up-market relative, the Camry. And although it was a stimulating drive, the GTi, on its 60-series tyres and firmer suspension, was less to my taste than the others. Hard, thrusting drivers would, I am sure, rate it the best of the lot. I liked it least - but I am not really a GTi or hot hatch person any more. As you expect of Japanese-designed cars, all the Carinas have the lightest of clutches and gear-shifts and excellent fresh-air ventilation, with air-conditioning an optional extra on every model. To meet British needs, there is a standard anti-theft system with ultra-sonic sensors. Both saloons and hatchbacks have low sills for easy loading and the split rear seats fold down, estate-car style. Is the Carina E better than the Primera or Cavalier? On that question, I pass. Two days after driving the Carinas, I tried the Primera equivalents of the 1.6 XLi and two-litre GLi (and also a Cavalier, a quite sensationally good 1.7-litre turbo-diesel with an engine made by Isuzu in Japan) at the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association's test day at Donington Park. As a result, I decided the only sensible way for a buyer to choose between the Carina E, Primera and Cavalier would be to compare prices (the Toyotas cost more than the Nissans and Vauxhalls), warranty terms and equipment levels. Then, all three should be tried to discover which felt best. If, as a private motorist or fleet manager, you feel you should buy only British, then the choice must be between Nissan and Vauxhall - until December. After that, with cars rolling off the line at Burnaston, the Carina enters the equation. And don't forget that the Swindon-built Honda Synchro will be moving up to the starting gate.</p>

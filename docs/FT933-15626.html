			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A rocky marriage - Marks and Spencer's attempts to popularise its Brooks Brothers chain in the US Over half the men's suits sold at Brooks Brothers, the prestigious US clothing chain, are now peddled 'wardrobe' style. This means the purchaser picks out a jacket from one rail and trousers from another, rather than buying a paired combination or having the outfit tailored from scratch. If the notion sounds familiar to British ears, that is because it was imported from Marks and Spencer, Brooks' UK parent. For Paul Smith, the M&amp;S director who supervises US operations from New York, 'wardrobe suits' are a sensible transfer of retailing technique - although Bill Roberti, Brooks' chief executive, admits that it took three stabs at the concept before the US retailer 'got it right'. But, from a broader perspective, this novel selling practice seems to epitomise the dilemma facing the British retailer as it struggles to make a five-year-old US marriage work. M&amp;S is a skilled mass-marketeer. How, and to what extent, can it popularise Brooks - founded in 1818 and one of the nation's oldest retailers - without tainting the latter's classic image? M&amp;S needs to get the answer right. It acquired the US retailer for Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) in 1988, and has since admitted that it overpaid. Brooks was then making profits of Dollars 24.5m after tax on sales of Dollars 290m. Earnings promptly tumbled and, five years later, the US unit is still struggling to match the 1988 results. In the 12 months to end-March this year, Brooks' operating surplus was Pounds 12.6m on sales of Dollars 338.3m. Bill Roberti acknowledges that the post-acquisition period was tough. But, in 1991, the two companies agreed a strategic plan for Brooks which aimed to help the US group grow without undermining its preppie customer base. This includes: A new 'prototype' store. Encompassing around 6,000 sq ft of selling space, the model is about half the size of the traditional Brooks outlet, and is designed to fit more neatly into heavily-shopped malls. 'There's a wide frontage and less depth in the interior . . . it gives us more flexibility,' says Smith. To date, about 10 of these 'new' outlets have been rolled out, sometimes replacing existing stores and sometimes taking Brooks into new markets. The first was in St Louis, where Brooks had originally operated a 'traditional' store on an uninspiring downtown block. It switched the business to a new-style outlet, sited in a glitzier mall nearby. Roberti claims that while the retail footage shrank by 60 per cent, sales doubled. A 'factory outlet' business, selling surplus stocks at discounted prices. In part, this replaced a previous system whereby Brooks sold its remaindered merchandise to Filenes, a New England-based chain of 'off-price' clothing stores. But the factory outlets are also supposed to market the Brooks name. By placing them in vacation resorts, M&amp;S hopes to inveigle casual shoppers through the doors and thus convince them that Brooks Brothers is not always synonymous with top-of-line prices. More people, runs the thinking, might then be encouraged to shop at mainline Brooks stores. Licence income and new markets. On the one hand, M&amp;S wants to utilise the Brooks name via licensing deals; it has, for example, signed an agreement with Luxottica, the world's largest eyewear frame manufacturer. On the other, it plans to take the Brooks Brothers retail business to new countries. Brooks Brothers products are already sold in Italy and Japan, and more plans are being laid. 'By the end of this year, we'll have a couple of business plans in place for another far eastern country and another European country,' says Smith. 'A joint venture? It depends where we go for. If it is Hong Kong, where there is an M&amp;S office, or Paris, we might be able to do it on our own. In other countries, I think we'd need a partner.' Operational changes. These have ranged from altering staff remuneration, to the sale of the credit card business. They have not always been easy to implement. M&amp;S ran into a strike threat in the New York stores, for example, when it tried to move employees away from the old departmental commission-based pay structure and towards higher basic salaries - although the revision finally went through. On the distribution front, it is still preparing to move to a controlled central warehouse system and away from the historic arrangement whereby suppliers drop shipments directly to individual stores. The problem is that many of these move are costly and M&amp;S, having forked out generously for Brooks in the first place, does not seem anxious to provide further largesse. For the past few years, emphasis has been placed on upgrading Brooks' computer systems and improving stock control. The new store programme has been correspondingly constrained. Only three new Brooks stores opened last year, plus nine factory outlets. This pace should pick up in the years ahead, but Roberti is clear that his capital expenditure plan 'should never exceed Brooks' cashflow and often fall below'. Problem number two is the US retail market. This is extremely competitive, and most retailers - from specialist fashion chains to department stores - have been emphasising 'value-pricing' in recent years. Brooks, whatever the justification, is widely viewed as an expensive option. Smith knows this and says the M&amp;S board has agreed the unthinkable: Brooks will run a national advertising campaign. Still, everything has yet to be proved. While Brooks boasted an 8 per cent sales increase last year, the underlying sales growth from its existing stores was a less-than-impressive 3.5-4 per cent range. Perhaps the big plus to date is that few old-established Brooks customers seem to notice much difference under the M&amp;S regime. One Manhattan shopper, who has brought suits from Brooks' Madison Avenue store for decades, says he heads for the same department where his measurements remain safely stored. Wardrobe selling, he admits, has passed him by.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Capital loss Regarding a letter headed 'Magnet loses attraction' in Briefcase of June 4/5. When these shares were given to us, there was no indication of a value  -so how can you claim a capital loss if there is no starting point? If you contact the London Stock Exchange at Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1HB, giving the date on which you acquired the shares, it will be able to provide you with the share price as at the date of your acquisition.

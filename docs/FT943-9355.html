			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese plan large geological survey China, faced with increasing shortages of oil, gas, copper and other key minerals, plans a huge geological survey in the hope of boosting reserves, the official Xinhua news agency said, Reuter reports from Beijing. The ministry of geology and mineral resources said it planned to survey 2m sq km of China's land mass before the year 2000, and 1m sq km more from 2001 to 2010. Geological surveys should have been completed on 1.35m sq km of China's total land area of 9.6m sq km by 1995, ministry officials said, because existing deposits of oil and gas were insufficient. Oil reserves of 15.9bn tonnes have been found in China over the past 40 years and, of the 4.49bn tonnes that can be extracted, 2.42bn have been pumped out, they said. Prospecting for oil and gas will be intensified over the next 20 years in west China, in the hopes of finding large deposits in areas such as the Tarim and Junggar basins. China has enough uranium deposits to meet its immediate needs and, because more nuclear power stations are planned, a general survey of uranium deposits will be launched into the next century, the officials added. China's annual steel output will exceed 100m tonnes by 2000. Domestic iron ore is mostly low grade so China will continue to import rich ores, while finding more economical ways to treat low-grade ore, they said. The ministry also plans to step up efforts to find new deposits of copper, for which China depended on imports for half of its needs. The officials gave no more details.</p>

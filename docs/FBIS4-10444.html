			<p>BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the FAR  [Revolutionary Armed Forces], has sent a letter of recognition  to the 164 combine operators who attained Millionaire status  during the current harvest. In his letter, Raul recalled how,  when the cane combine appeared on the scene, it replaced 220,000  canecutters who used to do the difficult manual cutting during  every harvest; and he stressed that the combine operators in  question are the worthy heirs of those forerunners of 30 years  ago, and champions of mechanization.</p>

The lawyer for the sixth defendant, 'Isam Muhammad  'Abd-al-Rahman, called for the examination of all the defendants  to verify the claim that they were assaulted. He said that he  joins the other lawyers in demanding that the court disqualify  all the testimonies attributed to the defendants.    Husayn Jabir Muhammad, the defense lawyer for the 11th  defendant, Tuhami Ahmad 'Abdallah, called on the court to find  his client not guilty for various reasons, including the  invalidity of the arrest and search warrant because it was  issued two hours after the accused were arrested and the  invalidity of the testimonies and admissions attributed to him  because they were taken under coercion. [passage omitted]    The court adjourned until tomorrow, when it will continue to  hear the defense case.</p>

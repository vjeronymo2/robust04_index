			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Shi Mingshen (2457 2494 1957): "What </F> Does the Reunification of the Renminbi Foreign Exchange Rates  Mean?"]    [Text] On 1 January the People's Bank of China published  the renminbi's new exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, which  was 8.7 yuan to $1. Beginning from this day, the renminbi's  foreign exchange rates were reunified. The enterprises and  residents would have to purchase foreign exchange from the banks  at the unified rates. Thus, the situation of having both  official list rates and the swapping rates ended.    The ultimate objective of reunifying the renminbi foreign  exchange rates is to realize free exchange of the currency.  According to the experiences of other countries, there should at  least be three conditions for the free exchange of a country's  currency. First, an ample reserve of foreign exchange; second,  devaluation or depreciation of the country's currency to a  reasonable level and establishment of a foreign exchange market  with banks as the main body; and third, an increase in the  nation's economic strength. Reunification of the renminbi  foreign exchange rates and promoting reform of the foreign  exchange system are both aimed at creating better conditions for  advancing toward this objective.    Beginning this year, the system of retaining and handing in  foreign exchange will be abolished and be replaced by a system  of banks selling and converting foreign exchange. This means  that conditions have been relaxed for the enterprises in using  foreign exchange. In the past, a part of the foreign exchange  earned by the enterprises should be turned over to the state,  and for each portion of foreign exchange they wanted to retain,  they had to ask for the approval of the higher authorities level  by level. In order to import raw materials, the enterprises had  to shuttle between various responsible departments, foreign  exchange administrative departments, and banks. After  reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, it is easy  for the enterprises to convert their foreign exchange income  into renminbi at the day's rates and decide how to use the  foreign exchange. When they want to use foreign exchange, they  can make the exchange with the renminbi by providing effective  certificates to the banks, so long as the use of foreign  exchange does not violate the state's industrial policy. This  is conducive to mobilizing the initiative of enterprises in  exporting their products to earn foreign exchange and increasing  the competitiveness of Chinese products in international markets.    The important measure of the Chinese Government on  reunification of the renminbi's foreign exchange rates is also  well-received by foreign businessmen. Under the dual exchange  rates system, when the registered capital of a foreign firm in  China was $1 million, it was equal to more than 5.7 million yuan  according to the official list price. But when they earned a  profit of more than 5.7 million yuan and wanted to remit it  outside the border, it could only be converted into $650,000  according to the swap market price. Because of the two  different exchange rates for the incoming and outgoing  currencies, the profit of foreign firms was reduced. After  reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, the  convertible amount of renminbi for the same amount of foreign  exchange will increase and the foreign investors will have more  profits. Naturally, their enthusiasm in reinvestment will be  further kindled. After reunification of the renminbi exchange  rates, export and foreign funds will increase and there will be  a steady flow of foreign exchange to our country. This will lay  a reliable foundation for the smooth progress of reform of the  foreign exchange structure.    What should be pointed out is that the abolishment of the  dual exchange rates system indicates a stronger purchase power  of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. As a result,  the prices of some trades concerning foreign affairs or foreign  nationals, such as hotels and civil aviation companies, which  originally used the renminbi's foreign exchange coupons to  settle their accounts, should be appropriately readjusted. For  example, according to the new system, an air ticket for a flight  from Beijing to Shanghai now costs 900 yuan (or $103 when  converted into the dollar), which was 590 yuan of the foreign  exchange coupon in the past.    The common people, individually, are showing greater  concerns  for the possibility of a big rise in commodity prices after the  renminbi's exchange rates are reunified. Apparently, because of  the lower value of the renminbi after reunification of its  exchange rates, commodity prices will go up. But after a  careful analysis, we will find out that the reunification of the  renminbi's exchange rates will only slightly affect the  commodity prices. First, the original rate of $1 to 5.8 yuan  could hardly be found in real practice. In the market, most  import goods were purchased in accordance with the swapping  rate. Some even cost higher than the current reunified rate  (that is, $1 to 9 or 10 yuan). Second, beginning from 31  December, customs duties for some import commodities have been  reduced. For example, those for refrigerators, microwave  stoves, video game machines, recording tapes, and color  television sets have been reduced from 100 to 50 percent. Thus,  the costs for importing these products by enterprises have been  relevantly reduced. Moreover, the readjustment of prices of  hotels and air tickets for foreign nationals will mainly affect  people outside rather than the great majority of domestic  residents.    This year the state has put forth various measures for  promoting reform of the foreign exchange structure. In the  course of the new structure replacing the old, there still may  be unexpected problems and difficulties. But we can be sure  that by reunifying the exchange rate, disorder, speculation, and  unfairness under the dual exchange rates system will be  eliminated and conditions for fair competition will be created  for the enterprises. This is conducive to promoting the  marketization, standardization, and internationalization of the  Chinese economy.</p>

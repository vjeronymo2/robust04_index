			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BUCK WILLIAMS NETS HAPPINESS AS A TRAIL BLAZER  </P> <P> There is a bit of wonderment in Buck Williams these days, as his mind bridges  the constant turmoil of eight frustrating seasons with the New Jersey Nets to  his new-found prosperity with the Portland Trail Blazers, a bona fide Western  Conference title contender.  </P> <P> "I can't ask for anything more than I have now," said the former University of  Maryland star, who faces the Washington Bullets at the Capital Centre Saturday  night.  </P> <P> "We've got a chance to make a lot of noise in our conference, and, for a  change, I'm having fun playing basketball. I've got a lot of talented players  around me, and my talent complements theirs. I'm in a situation where I can  contribute every night."  </P> <P> Save for declaring for free agency, the 6-foot-8 power forward felt trapped as  the backbone and only consistent performer for the lowly Nets.  </P> <P> But Williams, who turned 30 Thursday, was traded to a contender last June when  the Nets sent him to Portland for center Sam Bowie and a No. 1 draft pick  (point guard Mookie Blaylock).  </P> <P> "I think every basketball player wants to showcase his talents, but no one  seemed to care about the Nets. Playing there got to the point where I was sort  of like an abused woman. They always think the relationship will get better,  and it really doesn't. I always hoped it would, but it never did.  </P> <P> "I always worked hard in New Jersey, but the constant losing just drains you.  Now I look forward to playing before sellout crowds every game in Portland and  feeling appreciated."  </P> <P> No one appreciates the rugged forward more than his new coach and teammates.  </P> <P> He averages 13.9 points and 9.8 rebounds, and has become the unifying force on  a Portland team that, in the past, was beset by petty squabbles and jealousies  among the players. It led to last season's firing of Mike Schuler, who was  replaced by Rick Adelman.  </P> <P> "You can't believe what Buck has done for this chemistry of this team," said  Adelman, a favorite for Coach of the Year.  </P> <P> "We have four solid guys -- Terry Porter, Clyde Drexler, Kevin Duckworth and  Jerome Kersey -- back from last year. Buck gives us a physical presence. We  don't get pushed around anymore. His work ethic and positive attitude have been  an inspiration to everyone."  </P> <P> Williams is credited with motivating Drexler, an All-Star shooting guard and  explosive scorer known in the past for moodiness and creating clubhouse unrest.  </P> <P> "Buck has been a very positive influence on Clyde," said Portland vice  president Bucky Buckwalter. "Clyde is playing the best defense of his career."  </P> <P> Said Adelman: "You can really see the difference in Clyde's play this year.  He's playing like Buck, doing whatever is necessary to win."  </P></p>

Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is italicized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Member Surcharge <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 12.32 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) Each member, member organization, or associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether in a Claim, Counterclaim, Third-Party Claim, or Crossclaim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects service of the claim naming the member, member organization or associated person on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge shall be assessed against the member(s) or member organization(s) which employed the associated person at the time of the events which gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member or member organization shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Rule 12.31. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For the purposes of this Rule, service is perfected when the Arbitration Department properly serves the Respondent(s) to the arbitration proceeding under Rule 12.13(c). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis For, The Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the PSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The PSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PSE is proposing to add new Rule 12.32 to provide that any member, member organization or associated person named as a party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects service of the claim naming the member, member organization or associated person on any party to the proceeding. In addition, the firm whose associated persons are named in an arbitration proceeding will be assessed the surcharge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, the revenue-to-expense ratio of the PSE's arbitration service has resulted in a deficit, which has been subsidized by other revenues of the PSE. Although the deficit has declined in recent years, the Arbitration Department has determined in a recent review of the arbitration process that the deficit will begin to rise in the immediate future as a result of significantly increased resourcing needs. The PSE anticipates such needs to be ongoing. The increased resourcing needs result from a number of factors, including case growth, more complex cases being filed, more selective arbitrator recruitment, increased arbitrator training, and increased arbitrator compensation. Cost recovery for increased resourcing needs should be directed at those member firms using the PSE's arbitration service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new Rule 12.32(a) would require each member, member organization or associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, as a Claimant or a Respondent, in a Claim, Counterclaim, Third-Party Claim, or Crossclaim, to be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects service of the Claim naming the member, member organization or associated person on any party to the proceeding. This fee would be in addition to fees assessed pursuant to Rule 12.31. The fee applies both to members, member organizations and associated persons who file as Claimants and to members, member organizations and associated persons who are served by the Arbitration Department as Respondents. In a claim brought by a member, member organization or associated person against a customer, the $200 fee would be assessed in addition to the $500 claim filing fee described in the current fee schedule in Rule 12.31. For an associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, the fee would be assessed against the member or member organization which employed the associated person at the time of the events which gave rise to the claim. However, no member or member organization will be assessed more than a single charge in any arbitration proceeding. Finally, Rule 12.32(a) clarifies that the surcharge is not subject to reimbursement under Rule 12.31. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new Rule 12.32(b) clarifies that service is considered to have been perfected when the Arbitration Department serves the Claim under Rule 12.13. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PSE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which require that the rules of the Exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members, member organizations and associated persons in that the proposed rule equitably assesses a surcharge on each member, member organization and associated person who is named and for whom service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding and applies such revenue to additional costs resulting from increased arbitration resourcing needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing For Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing.

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO CHIEF URGES 'ROUGH PARITY' WITH EAST'S CONVENTIONAL FORCES  </P> <P> The military man entrusted with the defense of Western Europe said Thursday  that the Western allies should aim for "rough parity" with the Warsaw Pact  forces in new conventional arms talks in Vienna.  </P> <P> Gen. John R. Galvin, supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization forces, said in an interview at his headquarters here that the  West should aim for righting the current imbalance in military forces. Only  then, he said, should NATO consider cutting its own military strength.  </P> <P> "I think rough parity is a good goal," said the silver-haired, four-star U.S.  officer, 59.  </P> <P> After years of futile negotiations, NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations are  scheduled to begin a new round of talks on reducing conventional arms in Europe  early in March.  </P> <P> The knottiest problem facing Western negotiators is the disparity between the  size of opposing forces. The Warsaw Pact is generally held to have up to a 3-1  advantage in heavy offensive weapons such as tanks and artillery.  </P> <P> Few diplomatic observers believe the Soviets will accept outright parity. But  NATO planners say they think that the most serious Warsaw Pact threat could be  blunted by reducing the offensive capability of East Bloc forces, particularly  for a quick attack.  </P> <P> In addition to banning large formations of armored regiments near the border,  which could be marshaled for a surprise attack, Galvin suggested that  ammunition supplies be moved away from the front.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waiting to See  </P> <P> Otherwise, he said, he is still waiting to see the reductions in the Warsaw  Pact forces that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised in a speech to  the U.N. General Assembly in December.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a spokesman at NATO headquarters in Brussels rejected a Soviet  challenge to match the unilateral cuts.  </P> <P> "Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional forces is general knowledge, and in  view of this to reciprocate to statements of intent is unrealistic," the  spokesman said in response to comments by Sergei F. Akhromeyev, former Soviet  armed forces chief of staff. Akhromeyev was quoted Wednesday as saying the  Warsaw Pact would not disarm unilaterally while NATO looked on "without taking  adequate measures themselves."  </P> <P> Galvin defended NATO policy-makers against claims that they have only belatedly  reacted to initiatives by the Soviets on arms reduction. Holding a 3-1  advantage in various weapons, "it is easy to seem conciliatory," he said of the  Soviets.  </P> <P> The Soviet overtures had come in reaction to Western strength, the general  asserted, so officials of the Western allies have no basis for their propensity  for "self-flagellation" and "wearing a hair shirt."  </P> <P> In maintaining that strength, Galvin said the allies should modernize  short-range nuclear forces, which basically means that a new U.S. missile will  be needed to replace the Lance, a short-range missile now deployed in Europe  that will be obsolete by 1995.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approval Delayed  </P> <P> The West German government has delayed outright approval of such an upgrading,  and some political advisers at NATO's headquarters in Brussels say the delay  will make it more difficult for Chancellor Helmut Kohl eventually to support  nuclear modernization.  </P> <P> Galvin said that a green light on nuclear modernization would allow him to cut  back "significantly" the estimated 4,600 nuclear artillery shells in Europe,  thus reducing German fears about nuclear stockpiles on their territory.  </P> <P> Galvin also expressed concern about West German hostility toward low-flying  training flights and large-scale military maneuvers. He said he has asked his  senior commanders to figure out ways that training exercises could be reduced  without impairing military efficiency.  </P> <P> As far as big maneuvers go, he said, "generals need training as well as  privates and corporals."  </P> <P> "We need less troops and more leaders in the field," he added with a smile.  </P> <P> Galvin said that computer battlefield simulators help to give senior commanders  experience through electronic means rather than tearing up the German  countryside with tanks and troops. But maneuvers are needed, he said, so that  military men may experience "what (strategist Karl von) Clausewitz called the  friction of war."  </P> <P> "We need Murphy," said the general, referring to "Murphy's Law" that asserts  that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.  </P> <P> Galvin welcomed the arms reduction proposals made by the Soviet Union but said  he does not share the euphoria about them expressed in some Western political  circles.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's leadership, said Galvin, is "taking a road that leads into an  unknown situation."  </P></p>

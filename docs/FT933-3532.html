			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Hungary reveals banking fraud CRIMINAL inquiries into Hungarian banks have uncovered Dollars 170m (Pounds 110m) to Dollars 190m of losses due to fraud, negligence, bribery and other offences, the chief prosecutor's office has announced. Under investigation are 42 cases covering the spectrum of financial crime. In several instances, bank managers are alleged to have accepted bribes to underscore credit risk, overlook fake security, or grant preferential loans. In the largest single case, the authorities are taking action against the management of Ybl Bank, a private bank, which collapsed last year, for misuse of Ft6bn (Pounds 41m) of deposits. Explaining the proliferation of corruption, Mr Ivan Szabo, the Hungarian finance minister, blamed the spread of the black economy, which some estimates put at 25 per cent of gross domestic product. Most of the cases are old ones which have simply taken time to work their way through a creaky legal system, officials emphasise, and they have downplayed the significance of bank corruption. The latest burst of media interest in the problems of Hungarian banks comes as a World Bank delegation is in Budapest to consider help for a financial sector laden with bad loans. Nevertheless, the Budapest authorities remain confident that the World Bank will grant a loan of Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m to help recapitalise Hungary's commercial banks. A World Bank report earlier this year found some banks 'technically insolvent according to international accounting standards'. Bankers pointed out that a more significant problem for banks, though not a legal one, is represented by discretionary lending by local bank managers: central reporting systems are only now being introduced. The inquiries into bank fraud have contributed to increasing public suspicion that corruption is widespread.</p>

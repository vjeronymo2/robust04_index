			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Interior Minister Djibo Ka on 17 February; place </F> not given--recorded]    [Text] [passage indistinct] on Wednesday 16 February 1994  in the city of Dakar and its suburbs. Indeed, violent  demonstrations were organized by people armed with cutlasses,  knives, sticks, cutting and thrusting weapons, and even  (?pistols). This occurred at a time when an authorized rally of  opposition parties grouped within an undeclared body -- the  coordinating committee of the democratic forces -- was taking  place [words indistinct] when the said demonstrations started in  several areas of the city [words indistinct]. This rally, which  was also attended by officials and members of [words indistinct]  which is neither declared nor registered, and therefore an  illegal movement, was an opportunity for the organizers to  incite people to the violence that marked the events we  witnessed yesterday afternoon in the central part of Dakar and  its suburb.    The security forces, the police, the gendarmerie, and the  National Army, with the support of the fire department,  demonstrated courage and determination to restore and maintain  public order, which was under serious challenge, and to ensure  the safety of goods and property [words indistinct]. The  balance sheet of the demonstrations is [words indistinct]. The  demonstrators showed their desire to destroy everything in their  way. As I speak to you, several seriously injured persons have  been admitted to various hospitals in Dakar. They are all  members of the public security forces. On behalf of the  president of the Republic, the government, and all of you, I pay  my respects to those who died in carrying out their sacred duty,  that of ensuring our security and our tranquillity. The head of  state has decided that they should be decorated as knights of  the national Order of the Lion. They are: Moustapha Diane,  warrant officer; Ibrahima Said, policeman; Dauda Ndour, police  sergeant; and Abou Han, policeman; and El Hadj Soubou Tek,  warrant officer.    On behalf of the head of state and the government, I would  like to (?state) that the families of these policemen who died  on active service will not be forgotten. One demonstrator who  has yet to be identified is also [words indistinct]. More than  30 demonstrators were arrested and are being interrogated. The  initial results of these investigations have shown precisely who  were the instigators and the perpetrators of these criminal acts  of vandalism which the government has already condemned.  Indeed, it was a plan cleverly designed to sow terror,  demoralize the security forces, destroy property acquired by  peaceful citizens, and, in culmination, try to destabilize the  democratic institutions which the Senegalese people [words  indistinct].    This is why we have every reason to consider the instigators  of this plan and those who have carried it out as the declared  adversaries of the democratic and law-abiding state, which  guarantees liberties and human rights. The instigators and  perpetrators of the criminal acts that occurred yesterday  afternoon have decided to engage in trying to destroy the  time-consuming work patiently done by the Senegalese people,  particularly the democratic forces which they make up and which  are symbolized today by a democratic and secular republic.    What I would like to say this evening on behalf of the  government, first of all to the instigators and perpetrators of  the disturbances, is that their plan is henceforth known (?at  least by the security forces), who have been ordered to continue  to carry out their sacred mission with the greatest firmness and  unflinching determination. The government will spare no efforts  in strengthening the means of action, intervention, and search  of our security forces, whose courage and patriotism should be  (?lauded). Thus, they will continue to carry out their duty at  the service of the nation with all necessary efficiency. I also  solemnly reaffirm to you, dear compatriots, and to each family  the government's determination to assume all its  responsibilities, by ensuring your individual and collective  security as well as the free movement of people and the  protection of (?property).    To this end, all the appropriate measures were taken  yesterday evening -- I mean during the night -- (?to  consolidate) [words indistinct] banning all activities  throughout the country of the illicit and illegal movement of  (Mushashidin Wal Mushashidadi). [words indistinct].  Instructions have been given to the administrative authorities  to close immediately all (?centers) usually used by this  movement for meetings [words indistinct] which are banned  throughout the country, pending the result of the legal action  initiated against its (?members).    Other similar measures will certainly be taken in the coming  hours to render harmless those who seek to undermine the  foundation of our political system, which is the collective work  of the democrats and those who profoundly believe in the values  of tolerance and peace. Together, that is the people and each  of (?you) -- you who only aspire to live in peace in a united  country, profoundly committed to freedom -- and the authorities,  we will act, as societies with democratic political systems know  how to do, by trusting our institutions.    Finally and on behalf of the government, I would like to  reaffirm our desire and our resolute determination to have the  state's authority respected. This state will assume all its  functions with more firmness and vigor, particularly the  security of people and goods, of which it is the guarantor. In  this regard, I am convinced that the state can count on the  patriotic mobilization and commitment of citizens yearning for  peace, justice, and freedom so that Senegal, our country,  remains the democratic country respected by the world -- a  country whose legal character is symbolized by the law-abiding  state that we have built within the framework of a strong nation  of solidarity. I thank you for your kind attention.</p>

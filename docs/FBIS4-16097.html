			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Now about the television air time situation. The  Russian Finance Ministry, in the person of Acting Minister  Sergey Dubinin, and the Communications Ministry, in the person  of Vladimir Bulgak, are forming an interesting alliance. These  two official representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers are  considering reducing the amount of television broadcasting to 20  percent. Does this mean that our blue screens will be mostly  silent?    What is interesting is that Western television companies  from  time to time tell us that they are being offered spare air time.  In general, it is not too hard to guess where the remaining  spare air time will go and who will be offering it. It remains  for us to rely on the common sense of the Russian president and  prime minister, who should understand that deprived of  television, they will lose control of the country.</p>

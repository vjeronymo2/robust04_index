			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary </F> general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, by Ibrahim  Humaydi in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the  Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, has stressed that the  failure of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) or any other  faction to boycott the self-rule elections would torpedo the  "Alliance of Palestinian Forces" formed recently by the 10  factions opposed to the peace process. However, he pointed to  the assertion by representatives of Hamas that it will not  participate in these elections.    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said he expects  Fatah--the Revolutionary Council, led by Sabri al-Banna  (Abu-Nidal), to join the alliance. He said: "I am not alarmed"  at that. He said that Iran's "aid to us is much less than many  people imagine." And that the money is transferred to the  leaderships inside [the occupied territories] through trade  operations between the inside and the outside.    Dr. al-Shaqaqi said that he "strongly supports the idea of  expanding the alliance so as to include the largest number of  opposition forces possible," including Fatah--the Revolutionary  Council (led by Abu-Nidal). He expects this movement to request  to join the opposition alliance. "Or we may invite it to join  us" in the future. "I personally am not alarmed at the  existence of this color in the coalition." However, he stressed  that the question "has not yet been raised at the 10 factions'  meetings."    The secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement said  that  he "played a special role" to avert the failure of the central  meeting held recently by the 10 factions. "I managed to bring  views closer among these organizations, due to our awareness of  the seriousness of this stage. No one wants to be held  responsible for obstructing the plan" opposed to the self-rule  [agreement] signed between Israel and the PLO. He stressed:  "None of the participants made any real concession, because all  were winners. We deferred the influence question and left it up  to reality, because it is reality which determines the influence  of every faction" -- a reference to the deferment of the  question of every faction's share in the "leadership committee."  Hamas wants a 40-percent share of representation.    Asked for his opinion of the alliance's ability to form an  alternative organization to the PLO or to rebuild the PLO,  al-Shaqaqi said: "I have no problem. What is important is the  political program. And even when the PLO was formed on the  basis of influence, it did not reflect the reality precisely."    He added that his decision does not focus on a certain  tendency's leadership of the alliance of factions, and its  demand for a larger representation ratio "reflects our  self-confidence, because the organization is not an idol we  worship. What we are interested in is public welfare, hence our  stress on the political program." He pointed out that the real  role of any Palestinian organization should be played on the  ground.    He confirmed that Hamas representatives had stressed their  refusal to participate in the upcoming self-rule elections. "If  anyone deviates from this, we will pull out (of the alliance),  and any deviation from the political program would cause us to  abandon it." He said that the agreed political program "is a  common denominator" among the views of all organizations, while  there are some differences over certain questions.    On the ability of these factions to topple the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are aware of the difficulty of  the matter in view of the absence of international support.  However, the weakness of the agreement, the continuation of the  intifadah, the people's rejection of the agreement, and the  continuation of the jihad indicate that it may collapse."    He pointed to the existence of "Arab and Iranian support"  for  those opposed to the agreement. He said that "there is an  atmosphere of opposition in the region, and we must exploit it.  This can be done by asserting our influence on the ground, thus  prompting our friends to provide further aid. Our weakness  would cause them to lose confidence in us."    Al-Shaqaqi added that "the forces supporting us will be  willing to offer more political support when we are united." On  his relationship with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat,  al-Shaqaqi said: "There is no personal problem between us, and  there has never been any direct contact in our history. The  national criterion is the basis of the relationship, and the  position is political." He pointed to "a war of circumvention  and blackmail" which 'Arafat exercised against the Islamic  Jihad. He said that the Palestinian president "traded in our  movement's name by using some of the distorted names and models  which he tried to manufacture for himself on the Palestinian  scene." And that he "ordered one of his supporters to announce  the Islamic Jihad's support for the agreement."    With regard to the movement's relationship with Syria, the  Islamic Jihad Movement secretary general said that Damascus "is  open to all Arabs. It is in a state of war with the Zionist  entity. It has no objection to the presence of Palestinian  forces working from Syria to liberate their land, as this is in  line with the general political orientation in Syria." He  pointed out that one of the movement's deportees whom Israel  allowed to return from south Lebanon refused to return to the  occupied territories and is present now in Damascus.    Al-Shaqaqi said that Iranian financial to the movement "is  limited; we admire the Iranian revolution's ideas opposed to  international arrogance and calling for the liberation of all  Palestine."    He said that aid is transferred to the inside through "trade  operations between the inside and Europe and Egypt. It is an  easy process. The aid is received by neutral parties inside."  He added that the Jihad leadership focuses "primarily on the  inside. So all our resources are sent there. We do not want to  conduct any organizational development outside."    He noted that coordination between the inside and the  leadership outside is conducted through the normal communication  means, namely telephone, fax, and personal representatives.  "Our cadres total a few thousands while our supporters exceed  this number by far."    He pointed out that the movement is currently considering  the  idea of unifying the military wing in order to adopt one of two  known names: the "Struggling Islamic Forces" [al-quwwat  al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] or "Battalions of the Sword of Islam"  [kata'ib sayf al-'Islam]. He also said that the movement had  carried out several military operations inside; "we acquire our  weapons through arms dealers inside, through smuggling from  neighboring states, or through purchase from traders acting as  brokers with Israeli soldiers."    On his movement's relationship with Hamas, al-Shaqaqi  pointed  out that "there is coordination between us, and we will contest  the engineer union elections in Gaza on one list in the next few  days. We do not deny Hamas' distinguished role" in the occupied  territories. He stressed that the idea of "unity with Hamas is  not far off." And that time "has reduced differences between  us, and political positions are similar now. We are aware that  organizational accounts do not disappear easily, and we are  currently working to end these sensitivities in order to achieve  the cooperation and unity plans." He pointed to the existence  of "security" difficulties obstructing the formation of the  "National and Islamic Command of the Intifadah," which the  opposition factions have agreed to set up, and "we will work to  iron out the difficulties."</p>

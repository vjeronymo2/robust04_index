			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE WOMEN END LOSING STREAK TO POMONA  </P> <P> Was it the confidence boost?  </P> <P> Perhaps it was the fact that the victory was over the second-ranked women's  basketball team in Division II?  </P> <P> No, said Leslie Milke, Cal State Northridge coach, the best thing about  Thursday night's 67-61 victory over Cal Poly Pomona was that no longer will she  be asked about . . . the streak.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors had lost 29 games in a row to Pomona, which already had  clinched the championship of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  Northridge's only previous win over Pomona came on Jan. 20, 1976.  </P> <P> "I am so glad that I won't be asked about that stupid streak every year," Milke  said. "That's the biggest monkey off our backs."  </P> <P> Chris Cavalin and Bridgette Ealy combined for 41 points as the 17th-ranked Lady  Matadors improved their record to 19-7, 7-4 in the CCAA.  </P> <P> Pomona, which also had won 29 consecutive games against CCAA teams, fell to  21-5 overall.  </P> <P> By winning, Northridge assured itself of not having to meet Pomona, which has  won every CCAA title, in the first round of the conference tournament March 2.  </P> <P> "From a player's standpoint, if this doesn't put them on a high, I don't know  what would," Milke said.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors are now likely to receive a Division II playoff invitation  even if they fail to automatically qualify by winning the CCAA tournament.  </P></p>

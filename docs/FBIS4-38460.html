			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a source in Azerbaijan's Defence  Ministry, in the past 24 hours the situation in all sectors of  the front in the Azeri-Armenian conflict area remained calm.  Only sporadic fire exchanges took place.    Saturday night Azeri population centers in Terter, Geranboi  and Agdam Regions in the north of Karabakh came under fire from  the direction of Armenian positions.    According to the source, in the south-western areas of  Azerbaijan Armenian units are engaged in burning houses and  other building, and in destroying material and cultural values.    As Azerbaijan's President, Geydar Aliyev, told a delegation  from Russia's State Duma, evidently the Armenian side is bent on  destroying all material values in the localities it seized,  realizing that soon it will have to leave the invaded areas.</p>

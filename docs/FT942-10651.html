			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Technology changes welcomed Changes to the technology national curriculum should help to produce more skilled recruits, employers said yesterday. Teachers and employers had claimed the original arrangements for technology  -one of four 'core' subjects in the curriculum along with English, mathematics and science - were unworkable. The government has even allowed schools to abandon the existing technology curriculum in favour of the new proposals from September. The new curriculum for other subjects must wait until September next year. More than 2,000 schools in England - about half of all secondary schools - had applied to do this before the new technology curriculum was published. It was seen as a decisive vote of no confidence in the old arrangements. Other schools have until July to register to do the same. Academics and teachers had two central problems which were addressed by yesterday's proposals: The curriculum encouraged so much breadth that it was impossible for pupils to build up a worthwhile skill in a single subject. It was too intellectualised and included a requirement that pupils should 'identify needs and opportunities' for technology in different contexts. A report last year by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said this left less academic children 'disadvantaged and demotivated'. The new curriculum will concentrate on 'designing and making' skills, and support knowledge and understanding. Additional time for design and technology has been found by cutting back time devoted to information technology, which is supposed to be taught across several subjects in the curriculum. Mr Denis Filer, director-general of the Engineering Council, welcomed the new curriculum. 'In respect of design and technology we feel that the core requirements are now closely related to the real world,' he said.</p>

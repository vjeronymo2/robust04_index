			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sales fall sees 3% slip at Macallan-Glenlivet MACALLAN-Glenlivet, the Scottish distiller, yesterday announced its first profits fall in 10 years with a 3 per cent decline at the pre-tax level to Pounds 7m for the 12 months to December 31. Sales were 4 per cent lower at Pounds 16.8m. Mr Brian Cameron, company secretary, said the group had been hit by a decline in demand from blenders, who were cutting back on stock. Sales of blend whisky fell by 28 per cent and were expected to fall again in the current year. Blenders were extremely cautious at the moment, Mr Cameron said, having suffered the consequences of a 'whisky lake' in the 1980s. However, they had indicated that they expected an improvement in 1994. 'We are reasonably confident it will pick up again,' he said. Even at these depressed levels, blend sales were higher than the last downturn. The squeeze in this part of the business was offset by an 11 per cent increase in volumes of The Macallan, the group's bottled brand. Italy proved to be the most successful export market, with the US also showing year on year growth. About 80 per cent of Macallan's production is exported. Mr Cameron said the devaluation of sterling might help foreign retailers to maintain prices, although all of the UK company's exports were paid for in sterling. Sales in the UK had been flat. During the year, Macallan spent Pounds 2.1m to promote The Macallan brand worldwide and Pounds 2.2m was budgeted for this year. Sales of bottled whisky were expected to be more difficult in the current year, although the company intended to maintain production at similar levels. The group's confidence of an eventual upturn was reflected in a higher final dividend of 0.615p, resulting in a 20 per cent increase in the total to 0.915p. Earnings per share were 4.45p (4.87p).</p>

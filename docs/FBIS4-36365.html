			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bitte Hammargren: "Foreign Ministry `No' to </F> Money for PLO"]    [Excerpt] The Swedish Foreign Ministry is saying a  categorical "no" to contributing to the wage costs of the  9,000-man Palestinian police force which has the difficult task  of being responsible for security in Gaza and Jericho. Recently  the new UN assistant secretary general, Norway's Terje Rod  Larsen, called for international help to finance the police  force. Without a functioning police force in Gaza there will be  chaos, Terje Rod Larsen warned.    The PLO's coffers are more or less empty. The situation is  so precarious that the Palestinian policemen in Gaza are not  even having their wages paid to them.    The Foreign Ministry's message is the same which PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat heard from Prime Minister Carl Bildt during his  visit to Stockholm in November last year.    However, Sweden is prepared to help with the training of the  Palestinian police.    The Police High School in Solna has drafted a training  program, said Alf Samulelson, Aid Minister Alf Svensson's under  secretary of state.    The Swedish proposal, which has been passed on to the PLO,  is  about teaching forensic procedures and traffic surveillance.  [passage omitted]</p>

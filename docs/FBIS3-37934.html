In  the Opinion of the Member of the State Duma and Chairman of the  Subcommittee on the Activity of the Armed Forces, Other Troops  and Troop Formations, There Is an Acute Dearth of Professional  Military Men Among the Deputies"]    [Text] In conversation with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  correspondent, Yuriy Rodionov stressed that a considerable part  of the questions which are examined by the lower chamber of the  Federal Assembly require professional knowledge in the sphere of  defense. This is particularly true of the Defense Committee.  However, in the deputy's words, the State Duma has a shortage of  servicemen, that is, of people who know the Army's problems  other than by hearsay. It will take time for the defense  committee to become really capable of work. Although, according  to Yuriy Rodionov, there are "intelligent civilian specialists"  on the committee who are seriously intent on getting to grips  with the problems of the Russian Federation Armed Forces.    Colonel General Rodionov considers the active involvement of  servicemen in the campaign for election to the local organs of  representative power to be essential. "The situation today is  such," he says, "that servicemen themselves are currently the  best representatives of their own interests in the organs of  power. However, it is essential not to make the wrong choice.  The experience of previous election campaigns shows that some  candidates based their programs on a conflict with the command  and were thus less inclined to get involved in legislative  activity, expending their energy on making political statements  instead. The experience of service combined with general human  qualities is the guarantee that our elected representative will  not forget the interests of his voters.    As for the legal basis of the serviceman's period as a  deputy, Yuriy Rodionov said that a group of deputies have put  forward a proposal to introduce amendments to the Law on the  Status of the State Duma Deputy. The amendments envisage the  secondment of the serviceman deputy for the period of the  discharge of his duties as deputy. According to the  parliamentarian's proposal, the relevant statute could specify  the mechanism for the exercise of that right: the servicemen  would be excluded from the roster of a unit (establishment or  enterprise) but would remain on the roster of the Armed Forces,  in other words they would not be discharged and would retain all  their legally enshrined benefits. In that event the rights of  servicemen would not be inferior to those of miners, oil  workers, and so forth.... At the end of his term as a deputy the  serviceman would return to his unit.</p>

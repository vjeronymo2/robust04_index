			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Turkey takes emergency action to stave off run on banks The Turkish government yesterday moved to restore public confidence in the banking system in the wake of recent bank collapses, announcing it would provide unlimited deposit insurance cover, in the case of a bank going under. The move follows public criticism of the handling last month of the closure of three small private banks - Turkish Tourism and Investment Bank TYT, Marmara Bank and ImpexBank. It also reflects growing official concern that other banks could be hit by a run on deposits in the wake of a 50 per cent depreciation of the lira and the recent bank closures. Announcing the new scheme, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, said constant press speculation about the health of the banking sector had 'created an uncertain atmosphere.' IBCA, the London based rating agency, estimates that around 12 per cent of total foreign exchange deposits were withdrawn in the first six weeks of the crisis. Bankers say it is considerably more today. Until now, under the central bank's deposit insurance a depositor would be paid up to TL150bn. The new scheme, which does not cover the three failed banks, will have no upper limit, and will cover lira and foreign exchange deposits. The move was criticised by some bankers, who pointed out that without the risk that depositors may lose their money, competition between banks would now be decided not by the quality of the management but the interest rates being offered. However a shakeout seems unavoidable. This week, Garanti Bank, one of the stronger private banks, took over the troubled Bank Ekspres, and brokers say a number of other banking assets could soon be up for sale. Yesterday's move on deposit insurance comes in the wake of earlier moves to introduce a lifeboat system for banks suffering a run on deposits. It coincides with a mission by the International Monetary Fund to discuss Mrs Ciller's recently unveiled austerity programme. If the Fund approves the package, Turkey will sign a letter of intent, paving the way for agreement on a stand-by facility, and allowing Turkey to return to international debt markets. Turkey's creditworthiness is certain to be affected by the way the government settles the foreign liabilities of the three failed banks, which are estimated at Dollars 200m. Twelve of the leading bank creditors were told by the Treasury last week there would be no repayment guarantee, and settlement would be made as part of the liquidation of the banks, which may take months. The creditors group includes UBS and SBC of Switzerland, National Bank of Australia, Commonwealth Bank, the Australian state bank, and the French banks Paribas and the state owned Banque Francaise Commerciale Exterieure. Half of the liabilities represent letters of credit and pre-export financing for Turkish importers. Isbank and Emlak Bank, the two state banks in charge of administration, have informed foreign creditors that these liabilities will be recovered direct from the importers. The World Bank has approved a Dollars 100m credit to support Turkey's privatisation plans, in a clear signal of support for the government's recently announced economic austerity programme. The bank loan, repayable over 17 years with a five year grace period, will cover the cost of foreign bank consultants, legal advisers and public relations experts. It will also help finance a labour restructuring programme including work on a social safety net, and a feasibility study for the Zonguldak region, where the government has earmarked the coal mines for closures. The government plans to raise Dollars 3.5bn in 1994 to help close the budget gap. With international debt markets all but closed to Turkey in the wake of repeated downgradings by international credit agencies, revenues from privatisation are critical to Turkey's balance of payments. In 1994, the government is aiming to sell Tupras, the state oil refinery corporation and Petrol Ofisi, the retail operator, either to a strategic industrial buyer or through an international share flotation or a combination of the two. Turk Hava Yollari, the Turkish airline is also up for sale this year, together with Erdemir iron and steel works.</p>

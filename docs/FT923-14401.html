			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cellnet helps Securicor to 97% growth A SHARP recovery at its Cellnet mobile telephone system during the half year to March 31 helped lift pre-tax profits at Securicor, the security, parcels and communication company, by 97 per cent to Pounds 26.6m compared with Pounds 13.5m. Sales for the half year were Pounds 288m (Pounds 275m). Cellnet, which is 40 per cent owned by Securicor and its sister company, Security Services, produced in its second half pre-tax profits of Pounds 57m (Pounds 30m). Cellnet's contribution to Securicor's operating profits was therefore increased from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 22.8m. Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive of Securicor, said Cellnet's result was based on the popularity of its new call-back message system introduced in November. Although it was introduced after its main rival, Vodafone, introduced its call-back system, Mr Wiggs described it as the 'most sophisticated' in the market. Benefits from Cellnet's call-back system helped offset the Pounds 3.33m (Pounds 5.19m) loss from Securicor's other cellular operations. Operating profits from parcels delivery increased from Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 3.98m following the group's decision to offer a higher premium service. Its sales were Pounds 110m (Pounds 102m) and 2.2 parcels were delivered to each customer compared with an average of 1.8 parcels. Since the acquisition of most of Federal Express' UK operations Securicor has 15 per cent of the overnight parcel delivery market. Security profits fell from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 3.45m as the group took a Pounds 860,000 redundancy cost over the closure of its West Drayton office near Heathrow. The interim dividend is increased to 0.665p (0.616p). Earnings per share increased to 10.8p (7.1p). Security Services, Securicor's 50.75 per cent subsidiary, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 8.8m). Earnings rose to 9.8p (5.6p). The interim dividend is 1.394p (1.291p). COMMENT An 8 per cent dividend increase against a 97 per cent pre-tax profit increase looks rather mean. It should, however, be remembered that Securicor only derives its contribution from Cellnet in the form of an after-tax dividend at the year end. That dividend is unlikely to top Pounds 15m. Nonetheless, investors will understandably be disappointed if the group does not raise its final dividend by more than a 8 per cent. Cellnet's figures, while better than anticipated, need to be put into context. For the full year to March it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 106m compared with Vodafone's Pounds 272m. Cellnet argues, with some justification, that the figures are not comparable since Vodafone is sitting on a cash pile. Yet Cellnet still has some catching up to do. With Securicor's forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 59.4m, giving earnings per share of 24.6p, its A shares - up 15p to close at 571p - are on a demanding prospective multiple of 23.</p>

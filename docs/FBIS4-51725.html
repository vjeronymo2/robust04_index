			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Unwarranted Pressure Commotion by </F> Brazen-Faced Ones"]    [Text] In its commentary entitled "The Korean Nuclear  Issue Which Is a U.S. Scenario," the Nepalese newspaper (CHOL  POL) dated 4 April wrote as follows: The situation on the  Korean peninsula has become more tense and led to the brink of  war due to the nuclear issue. This is totally because of the  unfriendly [piuhojok] and unfair [pulgongjonghan] attitude of  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] under the  patronage of the United States. In fact, this is nothing but a  scenario.    The DPRK allowed IAEA inspections for the continuity of  safeguards and met all conditions for the inspections as agreed  upon with the agency. However, the IAEA Secretariat overlooked  this fact and concocted a new scenario according to the  instruction of the United States. Now, why is it that the IAEA  follows the United States? It is because this organization was  built by the United States and is under its patronage.    Failing to control the nuclear activities and nuclear  weapons  of the United States, the largest nuclear possessor state in the  world, the IAEA has instead protected them. The United States  insists on the suspicion that North Korea is developing nuclear  weapons. This is aimed at unconditionally applying pressure on  this country, looking down on and regarding it as a small  country. The United States is employing military pressure and  threat.    As the Nepalese paper's commentary correctly indicates, in  reality, the United States and the IAEA have been tenaciously  waging an unwarranted pressure commotion against us by  continuously coming up with the issue of implementing the  safeguards agreement. This can be seen in the so-called  statement issued recently by the president of the UN Security  Council which called for the overall implementation of the  safeguards agreement. Talk on implementation of the safeguards  agreement is nothing but a far-fetched assertion lacking  justification, because our country is, above all, in a unique  situation of having temporarily suspended the effectuation of  the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].    Our country's unique position was caused by the unwarranted  acts of the United States and the IAEA. This is a fact  officially recognized by the world. As is known, on 12 March of  last year, we issued a statement to withdraw from the NPT in  order to defend the socialist fatherland and the supreme  interest of the nation. This was our Republic's extremely just,  self-defending step against the U.S. nuclear threat and the  IAEA's partiality.    However, later, as the United States responded to the  proposal for DPRK-U.S. talks, we unilaterally suspended the  effectuation of the withdrawal from the NPT temporarily under  the condition that DPRK-U.S. negotiations for a peaceful  solution to the nuclear issue continue on an equal and fair  basis. This, however, does not mean a return to the treaty.  Therefore, we are not obligated to implementing the safeguards  agreement pursuant to the legal requirement for the treaty as  treaty signatory countries are. This is particularly so  considering the fact that, from a legal standpoint, the effect  of the safeguards accord is in a virtual state of suspension.    Proceeding from our country's unique position, we have  heretofore only received inspections to assure the mere  continuity of safeguards, and not the regular and irregular  inspections [chonggyu and pijonggyu sachal] pursuant to the  safeguards accord which were frozen. As to our unique position,  the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, as well, could not  but recognize it. Nevertheless, the United States and the IAEA  have been unreasonablly calling for the overall implementation  of the safeguards agreement.    This vividly shows that they are attempting to use the  safeguards accord as leverage for the realization of their  insidious political purposes of refusing our unique position and  crushing our Republic. We can never completely implement the  safeguards accord unless the United States and the IAEA assure  in their actions that they will not crush our Republic.    As the world is well aware, our signature of the safeguards  accord with the IAEA was based on the premise that the  depository states should neither deploy their nuclear weapons on  the Korean peninsula nor pose any nuclear threat against us.  Nevertheless, such a premise of ours has not been addressed at  all. Rather, the United States, which is one of the depository  states, is further posing a nuclear threat against us by openly  making public that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military  exercise, a test nuclear war against us, in November and by  concentrating new type nuclear weapons, including Patriot  missiles--which are mass destruction weapons--and other  aggression armed forces on and around the Korean peninsula.    Our allowance of the inspection for the sheer assurance of  continuity of safeguards corresponding to our unique position  even under such a touch-and-go, dangerous situation is precisely  our justified step. Inspections to assure the continuity of  safeguards is enough to clearly prove that our nuclear materials  have not been utilized for nonpeaceful purposes. We will never  allow inspection activities which are equivalent to regular and  irregular inspections unless the United States suspends its  policy of obliterating the DPRK and its nuclear threat  commotions and unless the IAEA Secretariat eliminates its  partiality.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our  unique position, the nuclear issue will be smoothly resolved.  We do not mean we will maintain our unique position forever.  How long it can continue depends on the acts of the United  States and the IAEA Secretariat.    The day when our unique position comes to an end will be the  day when DPRK-U.S. talks are held and the immediate steps of  simultaneous action for a complete solution to the nuclear issue  under the principle of a package deal solution are put into  practice. In this case, conditions for the complete  implementation of the safeguards accord can be provided.    In the final part of its commentary, the Nepalese newspaper  wrote: Western countries are now exerting all possible  diplomatic efforts to isolate the DPRK, a small country.  However, no matter how hard the West world may clamor, DPRK  socialism will be ever victorious as no force in the world can  crush [apsal] Korea. Western countries should realize this.    Pressure is not a way to solve the problem. Trying to solve  the nuclear issue through peaceful means such as dialogue and  negotiations is precisely our consistent position. Developments  in the situation [satae palchon] depend entirely on the attitude  of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat.</p>

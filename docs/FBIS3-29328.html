			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Taro Kaneko, chairman of Marusan Securities </F> Company: "Historical Role of Official Discount Rate Ends:  Official Discount Rate Is Nothing More Than Bank of Japan  Instrument To Manipulate Major Banks"]    [Text] The Japanese economy cannot pull itself out of  recession despite repeated lowering of the official discount  rate. It is only logical that skepticism is voiced about the  economic stimulating effects of the official discount rate. The  author stresses the need for improvements in financial and  capital markets, while asserting that the official discount rate  has lost its raison d'etre.  <H5>  Transition Signaled by Issuance of Government Bonds </H5>   Japan's official discount rate functioned well as a system  until 1969 when we witnessed implementation of the "first hike  in the official discount rate in the face of international  balance-of-payments surpluses."    After completing the postwar recovery phase and entering  1955, economic cycles looked good to everyone. Because the  Japanese economy still possessed vitality, demand outstripped  supply and management's desire for capital investments was very  strong.    However, because capital accumulations were still meager and  foreign currency reserves had reached only $2 billion, any  growth in economic activity soon led to a shortage in foreign  currency to pay for increasing imports. The barrier posed by the  foreign currency levels would force the government authorities  to convert to tighter monetary policies. Government authorities  would signal their intentions to convert to tighter monetary  policies by postponing government expenditures and raising the  official discount rate. When the economy fell during recessions  and foreign currency reserves accumulated, they would work on  the recovery of the economy by taking the opposite type of  actions.    It was because of these circumstances that the official  discount rate functioned like the "red and green" lights of a  traffic light and the mere announcement of a change had a very  major impact.    A primary segment of the economic policies of those days was  the low-interest policy. During the days when government policy  called for progress toward catching up with European and U.S.  economic levels, a handicap in the area of economic competition  was the difference in interest levels. Because they were the  days of the export tax abatement system to promote exports, a  low-interest policy that sacrificed the interests of depositors  dominated the situation to satisfy the great cause of  compensating for differentials between domestic and  international interest rates.    One phase of those policies provided for undisputed  low-interest, large-volume loans from the Bank of Japan to major  banks. A limited number of major banks were able to borrow huge  volumes of funds at low interest rates from the Bank of Japan.  Preferential treatment of this nature was rarely seen.    After 1960, a topic that received wide coverage in the mass  media was that concerning "excessive loans." All major banks  maintained huge Bank of Japan loans and call loan balances and  constant excess liabilities, while basic industries suffered  from chronic liability excesses because of borrowings from banks  to pay for aggressive capital investments. Arguments for and  against the merits of the policies existed, but I recall that  the final analysis assumed the position that they supplied funds  necessary for growth and that allocation of sorely needed funds  to basic industries on a priority basis led to the sound growth  of the Japanese economy and the enhancement of competitive  strength.    A metamorphosis in the Japanese economy became gradually  apparent in connection with the first oil shock. International  competitiveness of industry was strengthened and capital  accumulations had progressed to a considerable degree. Capital  markets witnessed the full-scale issuance of secondary stock  offerings at market prices and the issuance of convertible  debentures, providing for the establishment of a bond market  albeit not perfect. It came to a point where no one mentioned  low-interest policies, and the nation experienced the  imperceptible demise of the excessive loan issue.    Japan's financial markets reached levels approximating those  of the European and U.S. markets and monetary coordination by  the Bank of Japan could be adequately handled through its market  operations. Further, the underlying growth potential of the  Japanese economy gradually diminished and the provision of  growth funds lost its significance as a principal issue.    These changes in the flow of events were made decisive by  the  issuance of government bonds. Because the Ministry of Finance  adhered to balanced budgets until 1965, provision of growth  funds depended primarily on Bank of Japan loans. However, when  government bonds were issued to overcome the recession of 1965,  adequate growth funds were supplied through the issuance of  additional government bonds. Further, the Ministry of Finance  issues government bonds in the form of government construction  bonds and government deficit bonds, treating the former as  beneficial and the latter as detrimental, but such labeling can  be referred to as conventionalism and the merits of issuing  government bonds should be discussed solely on an objective and  positive basis.  <H5>  Impediment to Economic Countermeasures </H5>   The bubble of the period subsequent to 1985 was caused to a  large degree by imprudent financial decontrol policies, but that  period did signal the transformation of Japan into a capital  supplier nation. Further, the recent collapse of the long-term  Liberal Democratic Party's one-party government and formation of  the Hosokawa coalition government probably reflect changes in  public opinion that seeks a shift from Japanese economic  policies, which strongly favor preferential treatment of  manufacturers and corporations to those which provide for the  interests of consumers and the general public. And, I might add  that, the appearance of the Clinton administration in the United  States represents the antithesis of the trend calling for  emphasis of efficiency and decontrol and deregulation which aims  at the perpetuation of the theories of the strong.    In the case of Japan, controls are much more extensive than  in the United States and regulations that favor manufacturers  and corporations are widespread, thus ensuring that decontrol  will remain a primary issue for the Hosokawa coalition  government, but I feel that the theory of the powerful as  embraced by Thatcher, Reagan, and Nakasone faces the fate of  modification even in Japan.    In looking back at economic policies of the six years  following 1987, there were aspects where the timing was very  faulty, leading to accelerated overheating and intensive  over-cooling. During the initial stages of the bubble, the  Ministry of Finance gave priority to financial reconstruction,  causing an overburdening of the financial policies, confusion  based on the theory of a major creditor nation with low interest  rates and theory of Japan playing the role of anchor nation for  interest rates, and Japan-bashing by the United States, all  leading to excessive liquidity. We should treat as a critical  lesson learned the fact that the money supply grew at  double-digit rates for four years in a row during that period.    If the official discount rate system had not existed, we  probably would not have adhered to an ostensible interest level  of 2.5 percent from February 1987 to May 1989. And, I believe we  could have changed interest rates a more flexible and issued  warnings that excessive liquidity would lead to unexpected  situations in the Japanese economy.    It is obvious that the existence of the official discount  rate impeded the quick action of the Bank of Japan and the  Ministry of Finance even during the economic recession after  1991. First, it was feared that a drop of the official discount  rate in the early stages of the recession would cause a  resumption of the bubble. As evidence of that fear, the Ministry  of Finance did not lift the ceilings on real estate loans on a  conditional basis until very near the end of 1991.    The official discount rate was dropped from 6.0 percent to  1.75 percent between July 1991 and September 1992. The Bank of  Japan stressed during that period that, "Current interest rates  are at a historically low level," and explained that, "The  series of rate drops will soon result in the manifestation of  cumulative effects," but the statements were proven wrong.    The 2.5-percent rate following the sixth reduction was same  as the 2.5-percent level of 1987, and calling that rate a  "historically low level" was not a mistake, but what is  important in relation to the economy is the level of real  interest rates. Even though the official discount rate has  fallen to 1.75 percent, the real interest rates are not at all  low. Stressing historically low levels merely serves to degrade  the authority of the Bank of Japan.    Not only has the cumulative effect of seven drops in the  official discount rate failed to appear at all, but various  sources now speak of long-term recession and a dropping of the  bottom of the economy. There is no way that we can realize a  recovery in the economy solely on the basis of interest  policies, but we cannot deny a conspicuous decrease in the  effects of interest policy. The question is, why?  <H5>  Source of "Subsidies" </H5>   The reason is that the Bank of Japan call rate is being  maintained at a high level. Until the spring of last year,  short-term rates were higher than long-term rates. This  represented the reversal of short- and long-term rates. Call  rates approximate the goals of the Bank of Japan. The Bank of  Japan uses this authority as an instrument to influence the  short-term financial markets as a whole.    The Bank of Japan most probably feared a resumption of the  bubble until the spring of 1992. Accordingly, long-term interest  rates where Bank of Japan controls have little effect continued  to fall in response to market conditions, but the Bank of Japan,  fearing excess liquidity, maintained short-term rates at levels  higher than long-term rates and caused large sums of money to be  parked in call markets.    This artificial, illogical reversal of short- and long-term  rates disappeared with the fourth drop in the official discount  rate in April 1992. Just as we had thought that change led to  the normal condition where long-term instruments called for  higher rates and short-term instruments called for lower rates,  the Bank of Japan introduced unsecured overnight call loans  which carried interest rates that were higher than three-month  certificates of deposit (CD). This second reversal of rates for  short-term instruments continues even to this day when the  official discount rate has fallen as far as 1.75 percent. We can  only reaffirm our amazement at the tenacious attitude of the  Bank of Japan.    The result is the continued retention of over 4 trillion yen  in funds in the call market and the failure of the money supply  to improve despite repeated drops in the official discount rate.  The failure of money policies rests to a large degree in this  situation. It is estimated that normal levels of funds managed  in call markets would be around 20 trillion yen. In this case,  money with nowhere to go in excess of 20 trillion yen has  targeted the Bank of Japan short-term high interest rate  policies as a rare opportunity and has taken refuge in the call  markets. I would like to point out that one condition for  recovery of the economy is the exodus of this 20 trillion yen  pool to where it belongs; i.e., expel it from the call market.    And even more illogical is the situation wherein Bank of  Japan interest rate manipulation and monetary coordination have  caused unsecured overnight call rates to be constantly  maintained at levels 0.25 to 0.5 percent higher than the  official discount rate. In the United States, the federal fund  rate, which is equal to the call rate, is often maintained at  the same level as the official discount rate which is currently  at 3.0 percent. The question is, why does the Bank of Japan  maintain the call rate at a level higher than the official  discount rate?    The first reason most probably relates to consideration  given  to the operation of small and medium financial institutions  which issue call paper. Small and medium financial institutions  traditionally have low loan to deposit ratios and are  historically heavily dependent on call markets. However, that  situation is not one that can be justified at all times.    A second reason is the need to maintain Bank of Japan  influence over large banks. Large banks constantly purchase call  paper and borrow funds from the Bank of Japan, providing fatter  profits from Bank of Japan borrowings if the official discount  rate is lower than call rates. Assuming current Bank of Japan  loans average 6 trillion yen throughout the year and a  difference of 0.75 percent exists between the 2.5-percent call  rate and 1.75-percent official discount rate, large banks which  benefit from the Bank of Japan loans are in effect subsidized to  the tune of 45 billion yen a year. No matter how one views the  situation, it is strange that such huge subsidies are made  available to large banks which forced the management of small  and medium financial institutions into difficult straits and  forced them to find refuge in other industries in the form of  subsidiary companies based on the decontrol of financial markets.    Even more puzzling are signs that the rate differentials  between the official discount rate and call rate are being  misused in salvaging failed financial institutions. If newspaper  reports that top executives of Daiwa Bank lodged a request  saying, "We would like to ask for special consideration for a  Bank of Japan loan," when a decision was made for Daiwa to  assist Cosmo Securities, are true, it appears that he was asking  for the issuance of the type of hidden subsidy discussed in the  preceding paragraph. It may be that a separate secret Bank of  Japan loan fund exists to aid those banks which were forced to  assume huge liabilities in connection with past salvage actions.  <H5>  Abuses Connected With Official Discount Rate </H5>   I believe there are no reasons in existence today for  continuing the official discount rate system.    First, I have already spoken of the issuance of government  bonds to provide for growth funds. Since the underlying  potential for growth in the Japanese economy has declined, the  system whereby the official discount rate was maintained at a  low level and growth funds were supplied through Bank of Japan  loans is now outdated.    Next, the question is what is the situation from the  standpoint of realizing appropriate money supply levels? This  question is answered by money supply records since 1987. I would  like to say that the absence of an official discount rate would  have created a more appropriate money supply.    The third reason is the relationship between monetary  adjustment and economic coordination functions. The mission of  the central bank is to manipulate interest levels and adjust  monetary levels appropriately to prevent both inflation and  deflation and to maintain sustained growth. If we were to be  asked if the official discount rate is indispensable in meeting  those goals, the answer would be that we can do without the rate.    Principal nations that still maintain the official discount  rate system are Japan, the United States, and Germany. Great  Britain and France recognized the shortcomings of the official  discount rate long ago and their central banks have converted to  a system whereby they control interest rates through market  intervention.    A condition that can be noted through observations in Japan,  the United States, and Germany is that the new environment posed  by advances in the information age and huge growth in financial  markets have made it more difficult to manipulate the official  discount rate because it has transcended its symbolic existence  and is subject to wide and constant exposure to the public.  Manipulation of the official discount rate has been subjected to  conditions not conceivable to monetary experts of the past, such  as the requirement that changes must be subject to a surprise  element. Excessive focusing of attention precludes the  effectuation of smooth changes, while the inability to avoid the  situation in which the Bank of Japan president just one week  prior to drops in the official discount rate must say obvious  lies, such as, "We have no intention of dropping the rate," or  "We have no intention whatsoever of dropping the rate," are  indications that the effects of announcing official discount  rate changes have been distorted. Already, the need no longer  exists for central bank presidents of the various nations to  indicate the direction of economic policy through manipulation  of the official discount rate.    Last August [1992], the Bank of Japan, which was concerned  about the future of the economy, introduced lower short-term  interest rates. Since such measures are feasible, the absence of  an official discount rate would enable implementation of more  flexible monetary policy. It would be better in a mature  monetary market that the central bank demonstrate its goals by  constantly intervening in the markets.    Even if a decision is made to retain the official discount  rate system, its levels should be the same as the call rates,  and I believe the source of last resort in the form of the Bank  of Japan should be made available only to problem banks. I would  like to say that we should discontinue the practice of  maintaining Bank of Japan loan balances that are constantly  running at several trillions of yen.</p>

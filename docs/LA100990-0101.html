			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOSS TO BENGALS HAS RAMS RETHINKING DEFENSE;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: ROBINSON PROMISES THAT THERE WILL BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO PUT MORE  PRESSURE ON THE OPPOSING QUARTERBACK.  </P> <P> Even John Robinson, the ever-optimistic Ram Coach, has to squint nowadays to  find a glimmer at the end of the tunnel.  </P> <P> Can the Rams be as mediocre as their 1-3 start appears?  </P> <P> A day after his team's 34-31 overtime loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Robinson  was talking about dire consequences and schematic changes almost as much as he  was seeking to point out the silver lining.  </P> <P> Rose-colored glasses aren't quite as effective when your team is three games  behind the 4-0 San Francisco 49ers and has shown little capability of shutting  down passing attacks. Does Montana-to-Rice ring a bell?  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're shaken by what has happened to us," Robinson said at his  weekly Monday media luncheon. "We just have problems we have to solve, and if  we solve those problems I think we can be a very good team.  </P> <P> "If we don't solve those problems," Robinson warned, "we're headed for a dismal  season."  </P> <P> After Sunday, the Rams' offense was ranked No. 1 in the league. The redesigned  defense was ranked last, yielding 389 yards per game.  </P> <P> Robinson and defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur set a system in which they  hoped to team up linebacker Kevin Greene with one of the Rams' big young  defensive linemen on one side of a four-man line, giving the defense a  consistent push every pass down. But partly because of injuries to Bill Hawkins  and Brian Smith -- the big, young candidates for the job -- and Greene's  holdout rustiness, rush has been non-existent, the scheme has bombed.  </P> <P> After Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason's 471-yard passing performance, the  most ever yielded by the Rams, this team is throwing up its hands and basically  getting ready to start all over again.  </P> <P> "Why can't we get more pressure?" defensive end Doug Reed repeated, "I can't  answer that. I just have nothing to say."  </P> <P> Robinson said he hasn't decided what the defense will do differently, only that  it is time for a change. It could mean more blitzing by the linebackers, or  switching around the four-man rush assignments, or more of the five-linebacker  Eagle defense the Rams used so much in the past years.  </P> <P> Although this week's opponent, Chicago, largely disdains the pass, Robinson  said he wanted a solid pass rush in gear to better deal with pass-oriented  teams such as Atlanta and Houston down the road.  </P> <P> "We clearly have to do something to begin to put pressure on the passer,"  Robinson said of a defense that has only eight sacks. "Our initial plan to try  to get more pressure this year has not succeeded. We're going to have to make  some adjustments."  </P> <P> Robinson did not rule out the possibility of trading for a pass rusher, but  said that those elite kind of quarterback-hunters that could solve the Rams'  malaise are hardly, if ever, offered on the market.  </P> <P> So how hard is it to revamp a scheme the Rams have worked on from Day 1 of  training camp after four games?  </P> <P> "After the game Sunday, not difficult," Robinson quipped.  </P> <P> The Rams have been through worse slides than this, Robinson emphasized, most  recently last year's four-game free-fall after a 5-0 start.  </P> <P> "I don't mean to create the impression that we're saying, 'Whoops, let's try  something else.' We have to adjust what we do," Robinson said.  </P> <P> "The key issue for us is to keep doing a lot of the things we're doing OK, so  we're not abandoning the ship and trying to find a new one in the middle of the  sea.  </P> <P> "I still have those hopes, and I still believe that this football team can win  . . .  </P> <P> "The biggest thing is we don't slide as a team, that we believe in ourselves.  The solutions don't come from the doubt."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSIVE STATISTICAL COMPARISON  </P> <P> The Rams' disappointing 1-3 start is directly attributable to poor pass  defense. Last in that category among the 28 National Football League teams last  year, the team fared even worse this year.  </P> <P> OPPONENTS' PASSING  </P> <P> 1989:  </P> <P> Att.: 136  </P> <P> Compl.: 84  </P> <P> Yards: 1,184  </P> <P> TDs: 9  </P> <P> Pct.: 61.8  </P> <P> 1990:  </P> <P> Att.: 148  </P> <P> Compl.: 93  </P> <P> Yards: 1,106  </P> <P> TDs: 5  </P> <P> Pct.: 62.8  </P> <P> OPPONENTS' POINTS  </P> <P> 1989: 88  </P> <P> 1990: 111  </P> <P> RAM INTERCEPTIONS  </P> <P> 1989: 3  </P> <P> 1990: 2  </P> <P> RAM SACKS  </P> <P> 1989: 6  </P> <P> 1990: 5  </P> <P> RAM RECORD  </P> <P> 1989: 4-0  </P> <P> 1990: 1-3  </P> <P> Source: Los Angeles Rams  </P> <P> </P> <P> RAM NUMBERS  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHT: BOOMER ESIASON  </P> <P> He wasn't exactly a complete stranger to either the Rams or their fans -- they  had watched some of his magic on television since 1985 -- but Boomer showed  Sunday's Anaheim Stadium crowd conclusively why he was the AFC's top-rated  quarterback the last two seasons. The Bengal left-hander completed 30 of 40  passes for a club record 471 yards in his team's 34-31, overtime win. Not even  nemesis Joe Montana of the 49ers has ever thrown for that many yards against  the Rams -- his best being 458 yards last December. It was Esiason's third  400-plus-yard performance as a pro.  </P> <P> SEASON TO DATE (Four-game totals)  </P> <P> FIRST DOWNS  </P> <P> RAMS: 81  </P> <P> OPP: 82  </P> <P> RUSHING YARDS  </P> <P> RAMS: 371  </P> <P> OPP: 426  </P> <P> PASSING YARDS  </P> <P> RAMS: 1,241  </P> <P> OPP: 1,184  </P> <P> PUNTS/AVERAGE  </P> <P> RAMS: 18/41.7  </P> <P> OPP: 15/39.6  </P> <P> RUSHING  </P> <P> RAMS:  </P> <P> ATT: 110  </P> <P> AVG: 3.7  </P> <P> TDs: 4  </P> <P> OPP:  </P> <P> ATT: 112  </P> <P> AVG: 3.8  </P> <P> TDs: 4  </P> <P> PASSING  </P> <P> RAMS:  </P> <P> ATT: 146  </P> <P> CP: 84  </P> <P> TDs: 10  </P> <P> OPP:  </P> <P> ATT: 136  </P> <P> CP: 84  </P> <P> TDs: 9  </P> <P> PENALTIES/YARDS  </P> <P> RAMS: 23/158  </P> <P> OPP: 19/163  </P> <P> FUMBLES/LOST  </P> <P> RAMS: 8/5  </P> <P> OPP: 11/6  </P> <P> INTERCEPTIONS/YARDS  </P> <P> RAMS: 2/44  </P> <P> OPP: 3/16  </P> <P> SCORING BY QUARTERS  </P> <P> RAMS  </P> <P> 1: 28  </P> <P> 2: 35  </P> <P> 3: 24  </P> <P> 4: 24  </P> <P> OT: 0 TOTAL: 111OPP  </P> <P> 1: 17  </P> <P> 2: 45  </P> <P> 3: 13  </P> <P> 4: 33  </P> <P> OT: 3  </P> <P> TOTAL: 111POSSESSION TIME  </P> <P> RAMS: 28:49  </P> <P> OPP: 31:51  </P></p>

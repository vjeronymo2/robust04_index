			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturers Unilever's Pounds 490m restructuring charge throws up further worries about UK food manufacturers as they steady their nerves to report results. If one of the world's strongest consumer products companies continues to apply the squeeze to costs it would be fair to assume that its lesser rivals will have to follow. The fear is that such exceptional restructuring charges may become a permanent feature of the sector - which raises the question whether they should be regarded as exceptional at all. In the squeaky new world of FRS3 accounting, it makes little difference given such charges have to be taken above the line. But it provides another reason for believing the sector's earnings are likely to remain dull for the foreseeable future. That said, many UK food manufacturers rationalised capacity savagely throughout the 1980s as retailers applied the cosh. Moreover, much of Unilever's charge relates to the US detergents market where Procter &amp; Gamble has been muddying the water. The rate of technological obsolescence in that business is certainly higher than that for bread and butter. Food manufacturers retain some defensive charms, given that the sector yields close to 4 per cent. They also account for five of the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the FT-SE 350, while the last time any one of them cut their dividend was back in 1978. Still, dividends have to be paid out of earnings at the end of the day. Food manufacturers must show how they can grow.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / OECD pressed on Pergau Dam document: No political reason behind the delay, says directorate official The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was yesterday coming under pressure to publish a long-delayed report thought to be critical of the controversial Pergau Dam project. Mr Bernard Wood, director of the OECD's Development Corporate Directorate, justified the delay on 'production difficulties' and said there were no other 'sinister' or 'political' reasons behind it. But the World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World which has strong parliamentary backing, described the delay as 'extraordinary', given the continuing public interest in debating the Pergau project. The OECD has been officially reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK and Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau project. Privately however, some senior OECD aid officials are believed to be sympathetic with the domestic UK criticism of the Pergau project which involved a linkage between aid and military contracts. The OECD report is thought to have identified the conflict of interests that arose in the decision by the British government to approve the Pergau project after overruling advice from its own civil servants responsible for aid. The Overseas Development Administration, the government department responsible for overseeing the UK's aid programme, said: 'We are happy for the OECD report to be published as soon as possible.' An ODA official said it was pressing the OECD to explain what the production difficulties involved. The OECD's report was completed in March, following a critical review from Finnish and Belgian examiners appointed by the organisation's development assistance committee (DAC). A draft report was circulated soon afterwards and approved by member countries with minor amendments to its wording. In the OECD's latest newsletter, Mr James Michel, DAC chairman, refers to strong support among members for the principle that all aid be subjected to the full standards of normal assessment, and that 'aid quality should predominate' in decisions. A report by the House of Commons foreign affairs committee is in process of being completed and is due to be published before the start of the summer. Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur: After several months' negotiations, Malaysia says it is ready to sign an agreement with Russia on the sale of 18 MiG-29s for use by the Malaysian air force. Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysian defence minister, said the purchase agreement would be signed with the Russians next Tuesday. Malaysia originally announced plans to buy the MiGs in the middle of last year. But final negotiations were complicated by Malaysia's wish for extensive technology transfer and a stipulation that part of the purchase would be paid for in palm oil. It is believed about a quarter of the Dollars 615m (Pounds 410m) cost of the MiGs will be covered by Malaysian palm oil exports to Russia. The Russians are said to be offering a maintenance and training package with the MiGs. Malaysian companies will also be involved in some parts manufacturing for the fighters. The first MiGs are likely to be delivered to Malaysia by mid-1995. The deal is the first big arms sale by Russia in the Asean region. Malaysia's armed forces are going through an extensive modernisation programme.</p>

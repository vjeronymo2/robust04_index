			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> CAR DEALER GETS DELAY IN MEETING SIGN LAW  </P> <P> The Downey City Council has approved a zoning variance allowing Paramount  Chevrolet to retain three of its pole signs until June, 1990. The 18-month  period will allow the car dealership time to comply with the city's zoning  ordinance for store advertisements enacted under the city's redevelopment  program. The current signs violate size and height restrictions. The  dealership, located at Paramount and Firestone boulevards, has been in Downey  for nearly 50 years.  </P></p>

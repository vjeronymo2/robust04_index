			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Mandarin solution It's to be hoped the Queen's offer to pay tax on her private wealth does not lead to the sort of bureaucratic madness that followed an attempt to bring privileged bodies into the tax net by the Labour government of the 1960s. The instigator was the late Richard Crossman who had previously been not only an Oxford don, but a member of the city's council. As such, he'd been appalled by the income lost to the city because Oxford University, like its counterparts elsewhere, was exempt from paying rates. So, on becoming minister for local government, he withdrew the rates-exemption from universities in general. The snag was that a good many lacked the money to pay the charges because their entire income was committed to teaching and research. Warnings of impending bankruptcies began to spread. But Whitehall mandarins neatly produced a cost-less solution. They increased the central government grants to universities to cover the rate-payments to their local authorities, and decreased the central grants to the relevant authorities by the same amounts. Alas, the resulting money-go-round hadn't been operating for long before another arm of officialdom threw a spanner in the works. Since the new arrangement was purely a book-keeping exercise, whenever the local authorities raised the rates, the universities simply paid up without demur. But that incurred the displeasure of the Committee of Public Accounts, which said they must contest the rate-increases to keep the local councils in check. Whereupon universities on the one hand and councils on the other took to the courts, and soon large dollops of taxpayers' and ratepayers' money were flying off the money-go-round . . . into the pockets of lawyers, of course.</p>

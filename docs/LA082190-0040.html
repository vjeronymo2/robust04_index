			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH ONE SWING, SHARPERSON CUTS REDS' LEAD TO 5 1/2  </P> <P> With bats, fists and a growing fury, the Dodgers slugged their way to within 5  1/2 games of first place in the National League West Monday.  </P> <P> Rick Dempsey knocked Philadelphia's Lenny Dykstra out of the game when both  players were ejected because of a bench-clearing incident in the seventh  inning, then Mike Sharperson knocked a fastball over the left-field fence in  the ninth innning to beat the Phillies, 2-1, before 28,112 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> It is difficult to determine what was more rare -- Dempsey's fight at home  plate with the major league's leading hitter, or Sharperson's home run on a  one-out, 2-and-0 pitch from the Phillies' Terry Mulholland.  </P> <P> Sharperson's blast was the second of his career. It came only four days after  he ended his homerless streak at 446 at-bats. That was the longest streak for  any active player yet to hit a major league home run.  </P> <P> Sharperson's home run moved the second-place Dodgers closer to first-place  Cincinnati than they have been since May 7. The Reds lost Monday for the fifth  time in a row, falling to the Chicago Cubs, 3-1.  </P> <P> "Hitting a home run was the furthest thing in the back of my mind," Sharperson  said. "I seldom hit the ball that hard here. I think I've only had a couple of  homers here all year in batting practice."  </P> <P> Sharperson said he was been inspired, however, since several members of the San  Francisco Giants alerted him to a story in a national baseball magazine that  listed him as the current homerless king.  </P> <P> "I'm on the field a couple of weeks ago and I hear Kevin Mitchell and some guys  calling me, 'The Zero Hero,' " Sharperson said. "I check it out and see that  I've gone the longest without a career homer and so I say, 'Man, I'm getting  that label off me right now.' "  </P> <P> His second homer in his last 14 at-bats barely overshadowed an equally dramatic  blow that resulted in the Dodgers losing a .202-hitter while the Phillies lost  a .342-hitter.  </P> <P> "We lost 150 points right there . . . that hurt," said Phillie Manager Nick  Leyva after Dempsey and Dykstra were ejected with two out in the seventh  inning.  </P> <P> Two innings earlier, with runners on first and third and two out, Dykstra had  been called out on strikes on a pitch that grazed the outside corner. He said a  few things to home plate substitute umpire Ron Barnes then, and continued his  conversation as he stepped in the batter's box in the seventh against Dodger  starter Mike Morgan.  </P> <P> "He was still mad about the last pitch, he said it was 12 inches high and 12  inches outside," Dempsey said.  </P> <P> The conversation stopped for a second, then Dykstra stepped out of the batter's  box and continued talking until Dempsey interrupted.  </P> <P> "I told him, he's hitting .340, what does he have to be mad about?" Dempsey  said.  </P> <P> Dykstra then yelled at Dempsey.  </P> <P> "He said I had been brown-nosing the umpires," Dempsey said. "He should not  have involved me."  </P> <P> Dempsey calmly stood, took off his mask, and slugged Dykstra in the face with  his catcher's mitt.  </P> <P> "It was not my best left," Dempsey said.  </P> <P> He followed with a right to the midsection, but Dykstra blocked it and the  players clenched and tumbled to the ground. Both benches cleared, the players  piled on top of each other at home plate, and the game did not resume until  eight minutes later, after both Dempsey and Dykstra were ejected. It was the  second fight involving the Phillies in 11 days; on Aug. 9 they brawled with the  New York Mets.  </P> <P> "It was between me and him, it was one of those things," said Dykstra, who  offered no further explanation.  </P> <P> When asked whether the fight inspired the Dodgers, Manager Tom Lasorda, who was  bumped to the ground in the incident, just smiled.  </P> <P> "I've seen games affected before," he said.  </P> <P> Sharperson's homer gave reliever Jim Gott his first victory since Aug. 14, 1988  at Philadelphia. Gott retired all six hitters he faced in relief of starter  Morgan, extending his streak to 18 consecutive outs, and he has not allowed an  earned run in his last 13 outings.  </P> <P> "What a great time for us to be doing this," said Gott of the Dodgers, who have  picked up eight games in the standings in a span of 28 games, since July 23.  </P> <P> They have 41 games remaining, and the Reds have 42 left.  </P> <P> "Everybody around here is getting on a high," Gott added. "We know what we can  do, and we are doing it."  </P> <P> The Dodgers had scored in the first inning on a grounder by Kal Daniels after  singles by Jose Offerman and Stan Javier and a wild pitch by Mulholland.  Offerman was making his second consecutive start in place of Alfredo Griffin,  who so far is not complaining.  </P> <P> The Phillies countered six innings later against Morgan when Darren Daulton  doubled to right field and eventually scored on a run-scoring single by Dale  Murphy, who had two hits in 17 career at-bats against Morgan including two  strikeouts earlier in the game.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Alfredo Griffin defused the growing shortstop controversy in a unique  closed-door meeting. Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, who promised Griffin Sunday  that he would be rested only one day so phenom Jose Offerman could make his  major league debut, summoned Griffin into his office before Monday's game.  Considering Offerman had three hits Sunday, including a home run, Lasorda  wanted to ask Griffin a favor.  </P> <P> "It's your decision," the manager reportedly told Griffin, "but the kid had  such a good game, would you consider sitting down one more day so he can have  another chance?" Griffin replied yes, and Offerman made his second consecutive  start. "I understand this game, I'm not selfish," Griffin said later. "I know  I'm still the regular. The kid had a good game. Give him a chance."  </P> <P> In his last start, the Phillies' Terry Mulholland had become baseball's eighth  pitcher to throw a no-hitter this season in defeating the San Francisco Giants,  6-0. However, precedent was not in Mulholland's favor. This season's previous  seven no-hit pitchers all struggled in their next starts, going 2-4 with a 4.60  earned-run average during that time.  </P> <P> Mickey Hatcher made only his sixth start of the season at third base in place  of Lenny Harris, who is hitting .212 against left-handers.  </P> <P> Ray Searage said that a Magnetic Resonancy Imaging test on his left elbow  Monday was inconclusive. He will wait two weeks before deciding whether to have  surgery. Because the medial collateral ligament injury is located within the  joint, Searage faces the prospect of reconstructive surgery, rather than  arthroscopic surgery. "I just hope it's inflamed, I am thinking of surgery only  as a last resort," said Searage, 35, who is facing the first serious injury of  his 15-year pro career.  </P></p>

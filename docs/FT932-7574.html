			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / A very polite middle-class mutiny at sea: What does it take to make one of a number of identical boats go faster? Keith Wheatley has been talking to some of the participants in the round the world yacht race as it nears the finish DAWN HAD yet to break. The yacht's skipper and off-watch crew were still sleeping as a slight hunched figure sent a coded radio message via satellite back to the market town of Petersfield in southern England. Recipient Chay Blyth knew from the pre-arranged sequence of words that he had a polite, middle-class mutiny on his hands. Aboard Commercial Union, one of 10 identical 67ft yachts taking part in Blyth's brainchild, the British Steel Challenge round the world race were 14 individuals. The skipper Will Sutherland was an experienced racing sailor employed by Blyth's company to take the boat safely round the 28,000 mile course. However, the crew had paid nearly Pounds 15,000 each to be part of this extraordinary adventure. They had trained and dreamt of the Challenge for nearly two years. And they were not happy. This articulate, dedicated group with shore jobs ranging from company director to steelworker felt that Will Sutherland was the primary reason why their yacht was trailing over a week behind the race leaders. Blyth had received a deputation from Commercial Union and been told of the crew misgivings just a few days before the race sailed from Southampton last September. The feisty former paratrooper told them to shape up and shut up - adding that he would listen to a further well-grounded complaint if the situation deteriorated on Leg One. As the yacht, identical in speed and potential to its rivals, slipped further behind en route to the Rio de Janeiro stopover it was clear that lack of team-work and morale was the problem. Sutherland left his command in Rio after a brief interview with Blyth. 'We're all under performance review in this project and he didn't perform,' explained Blyth simply. After a race lasting nearly eight months, including stopovers, the fleet is only hours away from the finish in Southampton. Will the fastest boat win? This is not a valid question since the hulls and equipment are identical. No one involved is in any doubt that team-work and the management of human assets has made the difference between first and last in this unique event. 'Human resources have been the most important factor so far in the results,' commented Richard Tudor, skipper of British Steel II, before leaving Cape Town on the final leg. 'You have to manage the characters involved on your boat. Fair but diplomatic is my aim.' 'There's a clear linkage between the man-management aboard and how they do in the race,' agreed Blyth. 'I could tell you which are the best-managed boats in this fleet, we monitor that kind of thing very closely.' Yet this is motivation and team-building of a very unusual kind. Not only did the crew-volunteers begin as virtual amateurs in a hostile and potentially dangerous environment; they were the valued clients, the skippers/managers the hired hands. Their labour and efforts could not be directed as in the Services or business life, with the ultimate sanction of military discipline or dismissal. John Chittenden, skipper of Nuclear Electric and overall race leader since Rio, is at 52 the oldest man to command one of the yachts and is a master mariner by profession. 'When this crew walk off the boat they have to feel happy. When the crew walk off a merchant ship you don't give a damn what they think as long as the ship's clean,' commented Chittenden. He has revelled in the company at sea of his intellectual peers - and superiors. 'There are people aboard this yacht far cleverer than me. I'd venture to suggest that there's more brain power aboard Nuclear Electric than in the entire British merchant navy,' he added. Almost every convention concerning the command structure at sea and in races has been stood on its head in the British Steel challenge. The skippers had no say in choosing their crews. Furthermore they had virtually no possibility of disposing of people they did not take to. Blyth's small management team were careful to balance the 13-strong crews internally by age, sex and even region. However, the crews were allocated to skippers by ballot. 'They all grumbled about the people they'd been given initially,' said Blyth. 'They had to mould complete strangers into a team and they had no authority to throw anyone off except in the absolute direst circumstances relating to safety.' Vivien Cherry, the only woman skipper, is fond of saying that the bedrock problem with many of the crew-volunteers is that 'they have been handed the Dream on a Plate'. It is a harsh judgment, given that many of the CVs have struggled desperately to raise the cash to take part. Those that are affluent have often taken a risky year away from highly-competitive careers or businesses that need tending. Yet there is a contrast between the crews who are, ultimately, 'escapists' and the nuts-and-bolts practicalities of the skippers. All of the latter had proven abilities in ocean racing, a seamanship qualification sufficient to satisfy the Department of Trade, and what Blyth describes as 'the most important point, leadership'. The degree to which the latter has been effectively deployed has been the story of the race. Given that coercion has been the only management tool absent from this nautical situation, it is fascinating to observe that the three leading skippers all come from a military or near-Services background. However, their style owes more to the studied informality of the Royal Marines or the SAS than the eyes-front regime of the Guards, for instance. Mike Golding is a watch commander in the Berkshire fire service and for the past year, skipper of Group 4. His boat was comfortable winner of the Southern Ocean leg from Hobart to Cape Town. As the winds built to 70mph and the waves reached the size of large houses, the Group 4 crew seemed to revel in the conditions, increasing their lead over the fleet day by day. After three legs they were lying second and comfortable. Golding's crew - all-male and the only such group in the fleet - have the reputation of being highly disciplined. If so, it can hardly be on the model of the Fire Service, as Golding freely concedes. 'In my shore job you have a marvellous thing called the Discipline Code which gives you much more leverage than you have in the Challenge,' he said. 'The Fire Service tells someone how to do something without query. Here, especially in the early days, I always had to field the return question 'Why?' Sometimes it's appropriate and sometimes it isn't. Whenever a fire unit goes operational it's inappropriate to ask questions. You haven't got time to brief everyone on every aspect. 'On board I've tried to make people realise the the difference between those types of situation. Early on there was a point when it did seem that everything you did had to be fully briefed. That stage seemed to take a long time to get past and it was an important milestone. 'For instance, when we're sailing in what we term 'Protective Mode' in bad weather and you need to tack the yacht with 55 knots of wind across the foredeck you don't need someone deciding on a whim to do something a different way. 'In less stressed circumstances we might well discuss the manoeuvre and whether there are improvements we can make. The crew can question the menu but not the watch system, if that makes sense.' Of course, it takes a strong and confident leader to be able to erect sensible and acceptable boundaries dividing different areas of team life. Pete Goss is the commander of Hofbrau Lager. A former Royal Marine and single-handed racing sailor, Goss has worked for the Challenge since its inception, running the early training weekends which turned the crew volunteers from eager landlubbers clutching a cheque to trainee seamen acceptable to his other skippers. He became a considerable father-figure to the 130 CVs and there was significant envy among the 90 per cent who were not balloted to his yacht. Goss exemplifies the belief central to the Corps that every individual can find enormous strength through their role in a team. He was a crucial player in determining the Challenge ethos. 'In the beginning the skipper's word was Law because he was the only one who knew what was going on,' said Goss, as his crew stowed food for the five-week voyage from Cape Town to the Solent. 'But after racing over 20,000 miles already they've changed from a spoon-fed group to a highly professional team.' He adds that the skippers as a group possibly had the largest identity crisis of all. They had not selected the crews and their own manager Chay Blyth often seemed to listen to the clients (who, after all, had paid out a total of Pounds 2m) or the sponsors (a further Pounds 2.5m) rather than his own staff. In contrast to the sophisticated programme devised for the CVs, the skippers and management from the Challenge Business were left to rub along with one three-day training weekend at the British Steel business college at Leamington Spa. 'It wasn't long enough,' admits Blyth now. 'When we run the next race it will be a two-or-three week course for the skippers.' Certainly one can be sure that conventional leadership and management training courses will have been overtaken by what has been learned on this first race. 'The skipper's personality comes into it much more than in most management questions because you are living cheek-by-jowl with the rest of the team for weeks at a time,' reflected Pete Goss, whose yacht has consistently been within the leaders at every stopover and may still win the race. 'There are definitely different style from boat to boat and the key determinant is the skipper.' Richard Tudor, a former sailmaker who started his own business at the age of 18, had possibly the worst crisis of morale to cope with. His yacht British Steel II won the first leg comfortably and was bookmaker's favourite to win the whole race. Exactly halfway between Cape Horn and New Zealand, the furthest point from land on the planet Earth, the boat lost its mast after equipment failure. 'Once we realised that we had enough food and fuel to survive and that no one had been injured when the mast fell down, everyone aboard had to come to terms with being without a chance of winning the race. We weren't even sure if we could reach Hobart in time to re-start on the next leg,' said Tudor, a charismatic Welshman given to quoting from 'The Ancient Mariner.' 'We had one crewman sitting at the saloon table suddenly take his spectacles off and beat them to fragments with his fists out of sheer frustration. It was quite dreadful.' Tudor's influence in keeping the boat's spirit in good enough shape to have them arrive in Tasmania raring to go on the next leg is remarkable. While other yachts have had personnel come and go, British Steel II has the same squad it started with 16 months ago, without a change of watch or watch leader. 'My experience of management is running my own business but here I know I'm not trying to sell anyone anything. I'm purely a motivator. I also have to be aware that with a high-powered workforce (and Tudor has several highly successful self-made business tycoons aboard) there only one way to do a job and that's the right way.' Probably the 'skipper's skipper' most admired by his peers is the veteran John Chittenden. Although the most experienced man of the sea, he has rejected almost all of that ethos in favour of a shrewd, patient knowledge of humanity. 'The running of a merchant ship has evolved over hundreds of years into a pretty well bomb-proof routine. Here we're not into all that shadow of the yardarm stuff,' he laughed. 'This has to be invented as we go.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, 16 Jun (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, minister of  planning and international cooperation in the Palestinian  National Authority, has affirmed that he has returned to his  homeland, Palestine, from his second homeland, Egypt. And  despite all the difficulty in leaving Egypt after more than 40  years, he has returned to stay and to plan a new life. He has  returned to live in his homeland.    In an interview with Basimah Nafadi, MENA correspondent in  Gaza, Sha'th said that he has resigned from all his other jobs  and has returned to his homeland. He said: "We have all  struggled to return to our homeland. There should be no  hesitation on the part of anyone to return to Palestine to build  this homeland for whose liberation and independence we have  struggled. The time has now come to struggle to build it."    Sha'th admitted that the current situation in the Gaza Strip  and Jericho is difficult. But he added that hope, anticipation,  defiance, and aspirations fill the hearts of all Palestinians.  He noted that among the problems that must be tackled are the  thousands of detainees, wounded, and handicapped and the need to  rehabilitate them. This is in addition to the problems of  unemployment, building the Palestinian economy, and establishing  a state. This, he said, requires an effective, clean, fair,  capable, and modern government.    Sha'th said that just as we have established the Palestinian  police who regained the people's confidence after 27 years of  occupation, an effective Palestinian government administration  will win the confidence of the donor countries to begin  providing the necessary funds for infrastructure projects.  Palestinian and Arab investors will also begin establishing  projects to build a strong Palestinian economy.    Sha'th said that infrastructure and public utility programs  have already been prepared. About half of the international aid  will be allocated for housing. There are also plans for  tourism, agricultural, and industrial projects. Palestinian  investors, he said, will greatly contribute to the development  of the Palestinian economy, noting that he has met with many of  them since he arrived in Gaza.    Regarding the Paris meeting of donor countries, Sha'th said  that this meeting has created a new relationship with the  Palestinian National Authority. He noted that the problem of  Palestinian police salaries is being resolved and that their  salaries for the months of April and May have been paid.    He said that he met last night and until 0300 today with  Palestinian police and security commanders and discussed their  needs and resolved their problems. He said that efforts are  currently being made to solve the problems of more than 50,000  members of the families of 7,000 Palestinian policemen. He  admitted that this is a big problem, as there is need to provide  housing for these families under difficult conditions that exist  in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    Sha'th said that he was able to see first-hand the enormous  economic problems facing the Palestinian people. Workers are  prevented from returning to their jobs in Israel, and only about  5,000 of the 150,000 workers have been allowed to return. The  Israeli authorities have also not given permits to car and truck  drivers to travel to Jericho or even to enter the West Bank.  This is in addition to problems of unemployment and problems  that people arriving through the Rafah crossing point are facing  from the Israelis.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Marketmakers urged to lift veil of secrecy: Norma Cohen on the debate over rules which allow delays in publication of share prices In financial markets, information is money. So it is not surprising that the question of who has access to information and when has become the subject of emotive debate in the City. Yesterday the Office of Fair Trading released a study concluding that Stock Exchange rules which allow marketmakers to delay publication of the prices at which they bought or sold securities are inherently anti-competitive. At the heart of the debate, regulators and City officials say, is the future of the market-making system through which Pounds 564bn worth of shares changed hands last year. Marketmakers are securities firms which, using their own capital, agree to buy and sell large parcels of shares through all market conditions. They say their system, which provides liquidity for institutional investors, cannot continue unless it is profitable. And if all business becomes public as soon as it is transacted, it will not be profitable. They argue that unless such large share trading remains partly opaque, London will be forced to adopt the order-matching system in which bargains between buyers and sellers are matched with each other in terms of quantity and price - as is the case in most European markets. This, they argue, is a bad deal for shareholders because it reduces liquidity, and London's standing as an international financial centre will suffer. Leading institutional investors, who rely on the system, have generally supported the marketmakers. Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds, the UK's largest shareholder group, said: 'We value both liquidity and transparency but if we had to value one over the other, we would prefer to maintain liquidity.' He conceded that lack of transparency had some drawbacks. For one thing, it has made it difficult to price accurately increasingly important equity derivatives which depend on accurate information about share trading in cash markets. Also, it is difficult to execute 'programme trades' for large baskets of shares because doing so requires 'freezing' the price of each stock at the same point in the day. 'You may be freezing the stock at the wrong price,' he said. All these concerns have weighed on the minds of regulators in considering how to direct the debate about transparency in trading. While anxious not to unravel the market-making system which has proved so successful in making London the world's centre for international share trading, they are concerned that changes in the way share trading is executed around the world will force changes in London. The exchange has largely taken the views of its big market-making members to heart. To buttress its point, it has commissioned a study by consultants Oliver Wyman - which it has not yet released - that concludes that marketmakers already suffer big losses on their largest trades. For trades which are 30 to 50 times normal market size - the average size of deals in that share for the previous 12 months - marketmakers lose roughly 61 per cent of the capital they place at risk. That is because marketmakers - or indeed investors - adjust the prices they subsequently offer for the same security to reflect the most recent trade. The actual price at which shares in a particular company last traded hands has real monetary value. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive at Smith New Court, one of London's biggest marketmakers, said recently: 'I believe we need marginally less transparency, not more.' The OFT has a different view. It has concluded that investors get a bad deal because marketmakers offering to buy or sell their shares do so at a wider 'spread' between the buy and sell prices than they otherwise might. This spread can represent profit to the marketmaker. Because they know they are ignorant of their competitors' deals, marketmakers could be making wider spreads than they would otherwise in order to account for the uncertainty. 'Public information is generally available in the market, while private information is known to only one or more market participants,' the OFT report noted. 'It is private information which allows particular traders to gain at the expense of others.' Marketmakers who agree to buy a large line of stock from an institutional investor are likely to witness an immediate marking down of that share by other market participants as soon as the sale becomes public knowledge. It was this practice in the years after Big Bang in 1986, when all big trades had to be reported immediately, that led to swingeing losses for marketmakers. In response, the exchange decided to allow members to delay trade publication. Current rules allow publication of any transaction at least three times the normal market size of any stock to be delayed for 90 minutes while the marketmaker hedges his position against a sharp price reaction. Moreover, any trade 75 times normal market size may be delayed for up to five days or until the transaction is hedged.</p>

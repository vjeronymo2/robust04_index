			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (26): Classic industrial response to the open market place - Corporate strategy, a Franco-Swedish combine hits the road THE nearly three-year-old alliance between Renault and Volvo, the French and Swedish car and truck makers, is a classic industrial response to the competitive challenges and opportunities thrown up by the single market. When the pair exchanged minority stakes in 1990, they cited as reasons the growing competition in their industry, the costs of stringent environmental rules and the increase in investment needed to keep pace with technology. The purpose has been to share these burdens by spreading costs and ultimately to work towards a full merger, which both partners would dearly like to achieve. A merger looked possible early last year but was subsequently shelved due to changes in the French government's attitude. Losses at Volvo provoked the former government of Mrs Edith Cresson to have second thoughts about the deal. The present government, under Mr Pierre Beregovoy, has no such doubts, but it does not have the opportunity to pass the legislation needed to pave the way for a merger because of the closeness of the legislative election in March. If the partnership has been a political balancing act, it has also required some fine judgment in business terms. Renault and Volvo have had to strike a delicate balance between their pledge to act as if they were one company, and the vital need to keep their brand identities separate, so as not to steal shares of a declining market from each other. This explains why the alliance has made more progress in their car businesses, where Renault and Volvo occupy clearly different markets, than in trucks, where they compete. Like the single market itself, the Renault-Volvo alliance has advanced gradually in small steps, which look uninspiring on their own but add up to much progress. Renault executives say the results have been far more encouraging than they expected. The first step, early in 1990 after the agreement to exchange shareholdings, was the creation of a joint car and truck research centre in France. This is studying joint components like gearboxes and rear axles for trucks and common stamped steel sheets for truck cabs. In cars, the centre is working on areas like safety, new materials and alternative fuels. Another early step was the establishment of joint component purchasing committees for both cars and trucks, which have since evolved into formal joint ventures last June, to represent both companies to their main suppliers. This could turn out to be the biggest cost saver in the alliance, since the partners' car making divisions already buy 15 per cent of components from common suppliers and components represent two-thirds of Renault's manufacturing costs. In trucks, the partners say 60 per cent of their suppliers are shared. Volvo estimates that, as a result, its group will save SKr800m annually in the next two to five years, though Renault has not given a precise estimate. The partners have also agreed to exchange some car engines, saving Renault an estimated FFr1bn on its development bill to date. Volvo's Dutch plant is to take a Renault diesel engine and economy two-litre petrol driven unit, while Renault is to take a Volvo two-litre 16-valve petrol engine for a future model. There are no plans to swap truck engines because they feel that the engine is a part of a truck's marketing identity. There will, however, be some joint products in specific areas, always under the proviso that they will keep their marques separate. A jointly developed range of top of the line executive cars, for example, is planned for sale in Europe by the year 2000. They will use common platforms, engines and gearboxes, but have different body styles and be sold as separate marques through the partners' respective dealerships. There are no such plans for a common truck, though the pair are jointly developing a low floor commuter bus, due to come on to the market this year or next. Again, it will be sold under different names, either as Heuliez, the French bus maker controlled by Renault Vehicules Industriels and Volvo Bus, or as Volvo alone. On marketing, the pair partially merged their French car and light commercial vehicles sales divisions just over a year ago, but have no plans to do so in trucks. Overall, the general pattern at Renault and Volvo has been to combine forces where there are clear common interests, but to stay apart where their interests might clash. It is a difficult balance to get right, just as much between companies as between nations, as the recent history of the European Community itself shows.</p>

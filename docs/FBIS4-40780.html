			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 3, RIA -- "The Russian  military-industrial complex is in a terrible plight," said  Nikolay Zinovyev, secretary of the Executive Committee of the  association of Trade Unions of the Defence Industry, addressing  a news conference here. He told reporters that as of the end of  May the defence industry received from the state only 5 of [as  received] the amount meant for fulfilling this year's state  order, with four trillion rubles still due to it. If the  current rate of recession in production persists (48.7 last  April), defence-industry plants will have turned out this year  five times fewer military and two times fewer civilian products  than in 1991.    Nevertheless, Zinovyev believes, the military-industrial  complex has possibilities of overcoming the crisis. It is  essential to modify the military budget, bringing it into line  with the state order. The slender means available to the  defence industry can be substantially boosted by stepping up the  export of military equipment.    Zinovyev reaffirmed the readiness of defence-industry  workers  to take on June 9 a collective action of protest against the  industry's disintegration. Many enterprises of the  military-industrial complex are to stop work for 10 to 15  minutes, accompanying such a mini- strike by hooting.</p>

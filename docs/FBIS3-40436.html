			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudio Borgonovi: "The Only Thing Going Into </F> Orbit Is The Controversy"]    [Text] Rome. There is now open warfare between the  management of the national space agency, the scientists, and the  Minister of Research who are involved in choosing a national  space policy. Extremely heated accusations are being exchanged  concerning the correctness of behavior in the past, the validity  of the programs, the accounts that do not balance, and the  methods of control that go back at least to 1988 when the ASI  (Italian Space Agency) was set up. The confused atmosphere that  already existed has become incandescent since the Corte dei  Conti [Italian audit department] formally raised numerous points  with the ASI. The Corte dei Conti has requested clarification  of about 20 controversial points, that translated into figures  have a total value of over 600 billion lire.    At present the ASI is under the control of a commission and  will continue to be until 28 February. The commission was set  up to manage the transitional phase leading up to the  appointment of a new board of directors. In reality it seems  that the goal of the commission is simply to restart all the  activities of the ASI that have been subjected to criticisms  from the penal and administrative judiciary regarding funding  for research, the dismissal of Remo Ruffini (former president of  the scientific committee and one of the most regular critics of  the ASI's CDA), the San Marco program of Rome university, and  the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] satellite. Resorting to  three commissions, made up of private citizens who are not  members of state bodies, has not resolved these problems yet.  The real problems are the guidelines for national participation  in the European Space Agency (ESA) and the goals of national  space activity. These still have to be either analyzed or  discussed by parliament, especially now that the adjustment of  new scenarios has become necessary following the cancellation of  the Hermes space plane and the redimensioning of permanent  orbital activities.    There is annual funding of 800 billion lire, and the  obligations to the ESA are somewhere between 560 and 700 billion  a year, to which internal costs of about 70 billion must be  added, together with consistent obligations for expenditure that  have been underwritten for the coming years without either the  necessary authorizations of the CIPE [Interministerial Committee  for Economic Planning] or financial cover. The European  situation, in the light of the increased cuts called for by  Germany and Italy, and the ratification of Maastricht, is  weakening Italian industry, which is already being penalized by  the depreciation of the lira, and has reduced the industrial  returns that come from our participation in the ESA by about one  third, and analogously increased the management costs charged to  us. The fluctuations in exchange rates have intervened on a  strategy that favored long-term programs and the many unknown  factors.    The Tethered and Italsat programs were the subjects of  controversies regarding their real effectiveness in the past,  and today the SAX program is under discussion. SAX is a project  for a light launcher and logistic space station modules. It has  cost 644 billion lire over 14 years. Research Minister Colombo  spoke on this subject at the end of December. He confirmed the  regularity of the project (limiting this to the scientific and  industrial aspects). As far as the national launcher is  concerned, the conclusions of the relative committees are not  yet known (but the delays and some forecasts have already  sparked off discussions and clarifications). In any case, whilst  the 90 billion assigned to Rome university have been blocked for  three years, and the 440 billion requested by FIAT for the VEGA  [Advanced Generation European Carrier] carrier have not yet been  authorized, work is continuing on the construction of the two  logistic modules for the United States space station: 500  billion for the construction and a successive payment for  maintenance and operational activities, without significant  technological, scientific or commercial returns. In the  meantime, yesterday, Research Minister Umberto Colombo presented  the report on the government lines of action for innovation and  research policy. This analysis points once again to the  necessity of favoring innovation in the productive sectors that  are leading our economy, promoting advanced technologies that  have a strong capability of dissemination, reinforcing research  and technological development activities connected with the  modernization of the infrastructure networks (information  science, telecommunications, transport), and favoring the  setting up of industries that have a scientific basis.    Despite the situation of economic crisis, some decisions  taken by the current government have allowed about 3.3 trillion  lire to be recuperated, and 588 billion have been allocated to  national research plans, 300 billion to technological parks in  the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy], 350 billion to training, 540  billion to projects coming under Law No. 46, and 600 billion to  the Italian aerospace research center, that has recently been  reoriented toward aeronautical themes. Colombo declared that  these resources, that total 15 percent of the annual funding for  research "are improvements obtained by eliminating areas of  inefficiency and management errors, but it will soon be  necessary to increase the resources available because the gap  dividing us from the other industrialized countries has become  intolerably wide." The immediate necessities are for the  universities to pay greater attention to research programs that  have fixed goals, for more effective coordination between  programs and public research organizations, and for an increase  in resources for training young researchers but "before asking  for more money it is necessary to spend what is already  available well," concluded Colombo.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Research: A Comparison Between Countries                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Italy without personnel                                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Year              |Country           |Personnel Engaged |  |                  |                  |                  |in R&amp;D in Ind-|  |                  |                  |                  |ustry             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |Canada            |53,860            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |France            |149,822           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |Germany           |296,510           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |Japan             |528,363           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |United Kingdom    |176,100           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |Italy             |64,944            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |Canada            |53,240            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |France            |163,228           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |Japan             |558,261           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |United Kingdom    |155,000           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |Italy             |57,944            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1991              |Germany           |313,300           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1991              |Japan             |563,018           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1991              |United Kingdom    |150,000           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1991              |Italy             |55,461            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

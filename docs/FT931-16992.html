			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / The Year Ahead: Taking sights at prosperity - and for some merely survival After 12 months of setback and disappointment, most people in the industrialised world will be hoping that 1993 will be a year of economic recovery and prosperity after slowdown and recession in 1991 and 1992. Many millions more outside that relatively small group of most favoured nations will have their sights set lower - on mere survival and an end to conflict. The new year begins with some favourable aspects. With luck, the start of the European single market and the inauguration of president Bill Clinton later this month may boost business confidence in Europe and the US and so help restore growth. But the uncertainties are daunting and cover the globe. Many industrial countries are still shackled by high real interest rates. Further tensions are likely in the European exchange rate mechanism, threatening the EC's ambitious plans for economic and monetary union. Germany, supposedly Europe's economic powerhouse, has difficulty finding the right mix of budget and wages policy to tame inflation. Japan is held back by debt deflation. Constitutional problems beset Canada. Little wonder, therefore, that late in 1992 the International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for industrial country growth this year to 2 per cent from the 3 per cent forecast less than three months before. Such growth will not stop further increases in unemployment. Problems abound elsewhere. 1993 will see a continued struggle to bring economic reform to Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union. But eastern Europe's experience since communism's collapse holds out little hope that victory for reform will swiftly bring prosperity. Large parts of Africa face further economic decline. It is unlikely that harrowing pictures of famine will be banished from the television screens of the developed world. Where prosperity beckons, as in China, political freedoms often remain chained. Yet there are glimmers of hope. A rush of upbeat statistics and confidence indicators at the end of last year could signal a clear recovery phase for the US economy after many false dawns. The UK, now freed of the need to hold its interest rates at German levels, stands a good chance of escaping from its longest recession since the second world war. But both countries will need strong political leadership if they are to reduce their swollen budget deficits and make recovery a prospect for the long term. The world will still face difficulties adjusting to the end of the cold war: both the industrialised democracies and the former communist powers have yet to convert their military-industrial complexes to peaceful uses. But local wars apart, the globe is becoming a safer place. Nuclear disarmament continues apace. Elections will be frequent in 1993, testifying to the strength of democracy and its growing importance in the third world. If the IMF is to be believed, developing countries as a whole will grow by a creditable 5.75 per cent, largely because some countries, notably in Latin America, have adopted the free market policies and principles that their industrialised competitors are spurning at their peril. But this year, like 1991 and 1992, will be one in which world leaders find they are at the mercy of unpredictable developments. In so far as foreseeable events affect their lives and ours, the important ones are listed below.</p>

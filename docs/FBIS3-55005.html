			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [BALTIC NEWS SERVICE report] </F>   [Text] As it is known, the government coalition council at  its session yesterday, did not reach a final agreement on the  changes of the government's composition. For this, another  meeting will be held on Thursday [6 January], and in this  afternoon the coalition deputies will be able to acquaint  themselves with the candidate ministers and their programs. In  the words of the Isamaa [Fatherland] deputies, who wish to  remain anonymous, the reason for the delay was the wish of the  social democrats and their leader, Marju Lauristin, to listen to  the program of the candidate finance minister Heiki Kranich. It  is believed that Kranich will present it tomorrow, said a  deputy. He was also convinced that the coalition council will  approve on Thursday all the proposed candidates. The cabinet  changes must be approved also by President Lennart Meri.  According to an assertion by the aforementioned Isamaa deputy,  Lennart Meri may be against the replacement of Minister of the  Economy Toomas Sildmae. According to unconfirmed reports, Prime  Minister Mart Laar does not wish to allow a situation to arise  in which the president would leave some of his proposed  candidates unendorsed. This might bring with it serious  constitutional consequences. Today's meeting with the candidate  ministers was said to have been arranged for gaining time, to  hold discussions on solving this problem.</p>

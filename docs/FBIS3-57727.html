Serious Reshuffles in Defense Ministry May  Follow Two or Three Months From Now"]    [Text] According to confidential information received from  presidential structures, the question about the first deputy  prime minister in charge of the "power" ministries has been put  on ice for the next two or three months. At the same time,  there still remains the question about what practical  conclusions should be drawn in the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  Defense Ministry, Foreign Intelligence Service, and the Federal  Counterintelligence Service on the results of the December  voting, and who and in what way is going to guarantee the  loyalty of these structures to the present authority in the  future. Work is proceeding apace in this connection on the  creation of a special presidential organ for "oversight" of the  "power" ministries, an organ that would inspect all types of  their activities as well as take care of "ideological" work and  personnel policy.    The most probable candidates to take over the position of  head of this organ are Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov and Oleg Lobov.  Incidentally, it has transpired that Mr. Lobov has become the  head of a special commission that has begun compiling efficiency  rating reports on Federal Counterintelligence Service staffers.  This and Lobov's special relationship with the president  increase his chances, while he is also sure going to keep his  post of Security Council secretary. In this situation, Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov would quit the army to become Russia's first  civilian defense minister.    The president is not likely to push Pavel Grachev completely  aside, although many things will come into focus following the  investigation in the State Duma defense committee into unseemly  facts some experts think have a direct bearing on the current  defense minister.</p>

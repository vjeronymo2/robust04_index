			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga April 13 TASS -- An emergency session of the  Latvian parliament scheduled on Friday, was canceled today. The  session was to be held on the initiative of the Latvian  president and prime minister who insisted that draft agreements  on the withdrawal of troops reached with Russia be discussed  before the documents are signed. However, both Latvian top  officials gave up their proposal in connection with Boris  Yeltsin's order on the creation of a military base in Latvia.    A request to cancel an emergency session of the Latvian  parliament was sent by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis from  Paris, where he is currently staying on a visit. Ulmanis'  letter says that in view of the fact that Yeltsin's order has  not been withdrawn in a form demanded by Latvia, the signing of  earlier initialed agreements in their present form is impossible.    Ulmanis believes that a meeting with Boris Yeltsin in the  near future is impossible either. This was announced to the  general secretary of the European Council by Latvian Foreign  Minister Georgs Andrejevs. In his letter the Latvian foreign  minister pointed out that the Russian president's order was  regarded in Latvia as a threat to its sovereignty.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Northrop fears Dollars 232m loss on Stealth bombers NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependent on the B-2 Stealth bomber programme, may lose about Dollars 232m in profits on its first 10 bombers because of manufacturing problems, according to US press reports. The company, which is trying to increase its presence as a supplier of parts to commercial jets, is taking a third-quarter charge of Dollars 152m on a missile programme. Northrop's profit rate on the 10 aircraft is expected to drop to 9.5 per cent from a negotiated rate of 13.8 per cent. As of June, the programme had run about Dollars 555m over the contract target of Dollars 7.4bn. The higher costs were attributed to lower aircraft orders, problems with sub-contractor performance, and a 42-day strike. The company said it had taken these issues into account.</p>

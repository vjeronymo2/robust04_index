			<p>BFN     [Text] Obrenovac, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic,  minister for foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina  [RSK], today cited three reasons why Zagreb is not acceptable as  a site for further negotiations between the RSK and Croatia.    In a statement to Obrenovac Radio, he said that the first  reason is the fact that the Russian Embassy in Zagreb is too  crammed, given that a delegation that would discuss  possibilities of restoring economic relations should be  relatively numerous since the subject of negotiations requires  broader and more frequent meetings.    The second reason is that there is a great deal of pressure  from the Croatian media whose headlines are full of words such  as "criminals from Knin," something that clearly characterizes  the atmosphere and ambience surrounding the negotiations.    Jarcevic also mentioned that representatives of the Russian  Federation, some in Zagreb and some in Moscow, are openly  advocating the recognition of Croatia within its AVNOJ [prewar]  borders and stated that this is what Russian diplomacy will  stick to.    He said that the Krajina side has pointed out that this is a  kind of pressure and demanded that representatives of Russia and  the United States should refrain from such statements for at  least as long as the negotiations are taking place.    ``Because of all this we categorically demand that the  negotiations should resume on neutral ground, in a Russian  Embassy in a neighboring countries. This is what we told  Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister for foreign affairs, and Kai  Eide, deputy cochairman of the peace conference, who have  nevertheless insisted on continuing the negotiations in Zagreb.    Asked to what extent the continuation of negotiations would  depend on what has been going on around Gorazde, Jarcevic said  that this could decisively influence further negotiations.    ``For, it is evident that the United Nations has taken the  side of one party, something we were aware of even when NATO  weaponry was far from our borders,'' he said.    "However, we do not rule out negotiations and the mediation  of Russia and the United States, although they cannot expect any  concession from our side unless the Croatian side agrees to this  too," Jarcevic said in conclusion.</p>

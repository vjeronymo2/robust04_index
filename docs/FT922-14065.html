			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Leading Article: How to pay top executives IS IT poetic justice, or plain foolishness, that has caused Anglo-Saxon big business to wait for an election year to shoot itself in the foot over the sore subject of executive pay? The degree of self-injury is greatest in America, where years of granting astronomic pay packages to top managers, especially through stock options, has culminated in action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This, in turn, has unleashed a spate of shareholder resolutions which, if passed, would improve disclosure by such giants as IBM and Kodak, and curb the incentive deals offered by Chrysler and others. In Britain, the regular spring open season of attacks on top pay got off to a resounding start late last month, when the recently privatised British Gas revealed that its chairman had accepted a near-18 per cent rise last year, at a time of stagnant profits. The company's defence, that it must pay highly in an international market for executives, was not well judged. Only where a company really does operate in an international executive market, or when a particular discipline such as marketing is in especially high demand, is such a rationale valid. Given the continued reluctance of most UK companies even to declare the structure of their pay packages, it is not surprising that some now fear regulatory action - on both sides of the Atlantic, and regardless of which party is in power. At present, only about one tenth of British companies even mention in their annual reports whether any performance-related incentive is included in the scanty remuneration figures which they report. A mere handful say whether this is an annual bonus, a three-year bonus, or a longer-term scheme such as stock options. Fewer still show how the package breaks down. Yet many companies pay all three - and other perks besides. Inadequate disclosure The inadequacy of most companies' degree of disclosure is rammed home by the readiness of a handful of leading companies - such as BOC, Grand Metropolitan and this year BP - at least to summarise their arrangements. It is not enough to tell companies to decide top pay packages through remuneration committees consisting exclusively of non-executives. Yet this is the recommendation handed down by ProNed, the non-executive organisation backed by the Bank of England. If the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance contents itself with proposing such a half-hearted course of action, it will increase the threat of highly inappropriate government regulation. Performance indicator Instead, companies should be required to disclose details of all existing and proposed top pay packages to shareholders. This information should include the types of performance indicator to which the package is linked and - if the incentives are tied to corporate profit levels - whether they will fall as sharply as they rise. The disclosure process should occur well in advance of each annual general meeting, at which all packages should be voted upon. Meanwhile companies which want to extend best practice should do three things. First, they should start to abandon the normal system of free stock options in favour of a long-term incentive programme which fosters a real sense of ownership - and the risk that goes with it. A new BP scheme is not only tied to the company's competitive performance, but the 140 senior managers who benefit from it also have to pay for a proportion of their share-linked 'performance units'. Second, companies should make a reality of their claims to share 'vision and values' with their employees. Instead of having one set of generous incentive programmes for the magic circle at the top, and a more stingy system down below, they should extend many of the incentives lower down - remembering that there is unlikely to be an international market for car park attendants. Finally, they should keep packages relatively simple. In the US many top packages seem written intentionally to confuse everyone except the beneficiary and the remuneration consultant. Such obfuscation gives shareholders little chance to exercise their due right to approve or veto the actions of management.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Learned by this reporter from the provincial  meeting on social insurance of government organs and  institutions, held in Jinan on 1 June, Shandong Province will,  beginning this year, carry out the social insurance system among  all government organs and institutions. As disclosed by this  meeting, the social insurance programs carried out among  government organs and institutions include the old-age pension  insurance, the unemployment insurance, the workers' injuries and  disability insurance, and the child-bearing insurance. At  present, the old-age pension insurance and the unemployment  insurance will be carried out first. And, these two insurance  systems will be carried out among working personnel of all  levels of party, government, and mass organizations, all social  groups, all state-owned institutions, and all the central units  stationed in Shandong as well as among the non-army working  personnel of the units that are affiliated with the army and  stationed in Shandong.    According to stipulations, the raising of the fund for the  old-age pension insurance should be borne by the state, units,  and individuals in common. Of this fund, the portion borne by  individuals should be raised by collecting 2 percent of  individuals' month salaries and the amount should be gradually  increased along with their wage increases.    The meeting pointed out: Establishing and perfecting the  social insurance system among government organs and institutions  is a reform with grave difficulties. All cities and prefectures  as well as all units should be meticulous in organizing this  work and should lose no time to make this work a success in line  with the unified disposition of the provincial party committee  and the provincial government with a view to promoting the  development of the socialist market economy and promoting the  stability of society.</p>

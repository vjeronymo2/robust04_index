			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Accountants get lowest rise for over 25 years ACCOUNTANCY salaries rose by less than 3 per cent over the past year in the lowest average increase for more than 25 years, the annual survey from Robert Half, recruitment consultants, said yesterday. Across the country, 15 per cent of employers said they planned to recruit new staff this year, up from 14 per cent last year. But 18 per cent said they planned redundancies. Mr Jeff Grout, managing director of Robert Half, said: 'It remains a very difficult market for candidates. 1993 is the worst job market ever for accountants.' It was only in the Greater London and south coast regions that most employers said they would be recruiting new accountants. Salaries rose on average across the country by just 2.94 per cent over the past year compared with 4.03 per cent the preceding year and a peak of 12.9 per cent in 1988, according to an analysis of figures provided by a sample of 420 organisations. Newly qualified chartered accountants in London received up to Pounds 28,000 in industry and commerce and up to Pounds 26,000 in professional practice. A financial director of a medium-sized company in London earned up to Pounds 75,000. The largest salary increases had been among staff in the financial services sector. Fifteen per cent of companies had a pay freeze this year and 5 per cent had experienced a pay freeze for the past two years. A growing number of companies - 43 per cent - were using profit-related pay, which accounted for a large proportion of the salary increases. Mr Grout said an increasing number were offering longer holidays to 'sugar the pill' of no increases, with 39 per cent offering five weeks holiday this year against 30 per cent last year. He said employers were wrong to believe that because unemployment was high it was easy to find suitable staff. Many ideal candidates were not moving jobs, although this was likely to change in the next six months. 'The Monty Python image of accountants with very poor communication skills continues,' he said. 'Employers also complain about candidates' lack of commercial acumen.' He said among employers seeking temporary staff there was clear evidence of a preference for Australians and New Zealanders, who made up three quarters of the London temporary market. He added that there was a trend towards wider use of temporary staff.</p>

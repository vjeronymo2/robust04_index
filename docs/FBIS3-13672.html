Once again, the U.S. Administration has revealed  its blatant hostility toward Iraq and the entire Arab nation.    It is also clear that deeply ingrained grudges are behind  maintaining the embargo on the people and children of Iraq in  order to starve them and allow serious diseases to destroy  hundreds of thousands of them.    Since Iraq was totally committed to implementing many  Security Council resolutions and cooperated with UN inspection  teams to destroy their advanced strategic weapons, the Security  Council member states could not find anything with which to  justify their stand that is hostile to the people of Iraq and to  validate the nonlifting of the unjust embargo on its sons and  children. So, they armed themselves with false and baseless  pretexts.    The Security Council has proven, once again, that it is  using  double standards in dealing with international issues and that  it is a tool devoted to serving the U.S. stand at the expense of  persecuted and oppressed peoples.    This exposed double standards in the Security Council's  practices made it lose the confidence of nations and peoples of  the world it.    Therefore, Iraq had no other choice but to signal that it  will reconsider its method of dealing with the Security Council  and will resort to whatever could save its people and children  from possible perdition if the embargo on it continues.    It seems that Iraq is about to lose its patience toward the  UN Security Council's stands and the role of the influential big  countries in it. Moreover, it may resort to any stand that is  not within the calculations of the U.S. Administration and its  allies or within the calculations of the spiteful ones who  continue to seek revenge from the the people of Iraq.    From this premise, one can say that the U.S. Administration  and its allies should reconsider their calculations, review  their stand on the embargo, and seek to end it in order to avoid  any developments with untold consequences.</p>

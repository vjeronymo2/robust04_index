Such revision shall be submitted within 9 months after such failure or determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Submittals made pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be sufficient, together with a transportation control program, to achieve the specific annual reductions in CO emissions set forth in the implementation plan by the attainment date. Submittals made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section shall be adequate, in combination with other elements of the revised plan, to reduce the total tonnage of emissions of CO in the area by at least 5 percent per year in each year after approval of the plan revision and before attainment of the NAAQS for CO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Serious and severe O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a State, for any serious or severe O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area, elects to implement an EIP in the circumstances set out in section 182(g)(3) of the Act, the State shall submit a plan revision to implement the program in accordance with the requirements of this part. If the option to implement an EIP is elected, a plan revision shall be submitted within 12 months after the date required for election, and shall be sufficient, in combination with other elements of the SIP, to achieve the next milestone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Any nonattainment or attainment area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any State may at any time submit a plan or plan revision to implement a discretionary EIP, in accordance with the requirements of this part, pursuant to sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) and other applicable provisions of the Act concerning SIP submittals.

Programs in nonattainment areas for which credit is taken in attainment and RFP demonstrations shall be designed to ensure that the effects of the program are quantifiable and permanent over the entire duration of the program, and that the credit taken is limited to that which is surplus. Statutory programs shall be designed to result in quantifiable, significant reductions in actual emissions. The EIP's shall include the following elements, as applicable:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of goals and rationale. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This element shall include a clear statement as to the environmental problem being addressed, the intended environmental and economic goals of the program, and the rationale relating the incentive-based strategy to the program goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The statement of goals must include the goal that the program will benefit both the environment and the regulated entities. The program shall be designed so as to meaningfully meet this goal either directly, through increased or more rapid emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional regulatory program, or, alternatively, through other approaches that will result in real environmental benefits. Such alternative approaches include, but are not limited to, improved administrative mechanisms, reduced administrative burdens on regulatory agencies, improved emissions inventories, and the adoption of emission caps which over time constrain or reduce growth-related emissions beyond traditional regulatory approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The incentive-based strategy shall be described in terms of one of the following three strategies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Emission-limiting strategies, which directly specify limits on total mass emissions, emission-related parameters (e.g., emission rates per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions reductions relative to a program baseline that affected sources are required to meet, while providing flexibility to sources to reduce the cost of meeting program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Market-response strategies, which create one or more incentives for affected sources to reduce emissions, without directly specifying limits on emissions or emission-related parameters that individual sources or even all sources in the aggregate are required to meet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Directionally-sound strategies, for which adequate procedures to quantify emissions reductions are not defined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

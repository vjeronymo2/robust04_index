			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC WASTE COULD COST FIRM $162,000  </P> <P> A national construction company was ordered Thursday by a Los Angeles Superior  Court judge to pay cleanup costs and fines that could top $162,000 for burying  up to 50 barrels containing toxic residue at its former branch in Arcadia.  </P> <P> Kiewit Pacific Co. pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of unlawful  disposal of hazardous waste and must pay for removal and cleanup costs at the  five-acre site, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Carter said.  </P> <P> Judge William Klausner fined the Nebraska-based company $50,000 plus $12,000 in  restitution to the property's current owner, the Arcadia Redevelopment Agency,  and placed Kiewit on a year's probation.  </P> <P> The agency bought the parcel at 301 E. Santa Clara St. in September, 1986, when  Kiewit moved its offices to Santa Fe Springs. The flattened drums with traces  of a cement curing compound were discovered last March, when the agency began  excavating the site for development. The slurry-like material, used to set  cement, is mildly toxic and contains flammable solvents, Carter said.  </P> <P> The cost of disposing of the barrels and removing the contaminated soil that  surrounded them will exceed $100,000, said Shahin Nourishad, the county Health  Services Department's hazardous materials specialist who is supervising the  cleanup.  </P> <P> This is not the firm's first run-in with the department.  </P> <P> Employees buried between 35 to 50 barrels of the same compound and waste oil in  1981, Carter said. Workers in an office across the street reported the activity  and the health department ordered the company to dig up the barrels.  </P> <P> The second burial -- in 1985 -- occurred before dawn, Carter said. Using  bulldozers already on the site, "they dug a huge hole in the same location,  pushed the barrels in and covered them with dirt," he said.  </P> <P> The employee responsible had probably misunderstood an order to clean up the  yard, Kiewit attorney Stephen Sadowsky said. "He was acting without company  knowledge and approval," Sadowsky said.  </P></p>

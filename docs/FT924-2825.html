			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness under a cloud A SERIES of meetings with City analysts arranged by Guinness after the market closed yesterday added to worries over the outlook for the international drinks group. The meetings followed remarks reportedly by the Guinness chief executive and chairman-elect that conditions in 1993 'will be more difficult than 1992.' Guinness shares tumbled on the news, dragging other international drinks stocks in their wake. In the earlier interview, Mr Tony Greener was quoted as saying that because of expected difficulties 'we are not waiting for recovery.' This was interpreted by some analysts as suggesting that Guinness' earnings growth next year, already forecast to be sluggish, would be flatter than predicted and could be near or down to zero. This compares with forecasts for the industry of around 11 per cent. Guinness said last night that the meetings had been held at the request of analysts to clarify Mr Greener's reported remarks and that others had been arranged for today. Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest said: 'It looks likely that the market will have to pull back some forecasts tomorrow, possibly by around 6 per cent.' The shares fell 23 to 502p. BP active The fall-out from Monday afternoon's presentation to oil analysts continued to influence the ebb and flow in BP shares which were the heaviest traded on the London market yesterday. Turnover topped 22m shares, the heaviest daily total since mid-September. Turnover was said to have been triggered chiefly by one substantial buying order, reportedly from the US. American funds have been aggressive buyers of BP stock and now speak for over 21 per cent of the shares, partly because of the steep devaluation of sterling against the dollar in recent months, but also because of the strong recovery story put forward by BP and many of the US broking houses. BP is scheduled to make a progress report to US institutions and analysts later today and many UK observers are waiting to see the response of the Americans to what should be a similar presentation. London analysts, however, are concerned that any further marked downside in oil prices - Brent crude fell sharply yesterday and closed below the Dollars 18 a barrel mark - may well provide the catalyst for an abrupt about-turn in sentiment in the US. Lonrho advance Ahead of an expected announcement, shares in international conglomerate Lonrho jumped 5 to 79p, in brisk trade of 4.4m. The announcement, made after the market closed, confirmed speculation that chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland would sell half his 15 per cent stake in Lonrho at 115p. Standard Chartered celebrated their elevation to Footsie-100 status with a rise of 12 to 535p and were additionally helped by the better tone of Hong Kong markets. HSBC put on 7 to 486p. The recent profits downgrades, related to worries about increasing property losses, continued to depress Barclays Bank shares which slipped 7 more to 377p on heavy turnover of 6.6m. SG Warburg, still on the reserve list for the Footsie-100, retreated 15 to 505p, despite news that the group has emerged successfully from the beauty parade for lead brokership to BT III. Royal Insurance, also moved back into the top-100 list, suffered a bout of indigestion after their recent outstanding performance, closing a penny off at 264p. The shares were also unsettled by a general downgrading of the whole of the composite insurance sector by Warburg Securities. Commercial Union was the worst of the bunch, closing 13 off at 583p. A strong overnight Wall Street supported both Wellcome and Smithkline, shares in the former adding 5 to 1038p and the latter up 9 at 462p. Lasmo ran back sharply, dipping to 148p, before settling 3 off at 151p, after Strauss Turnbull, the broker, told clients to sell the stock down to 125p. In the smaller stock Clyde lost 2 to 32p after some determined selling pressure, but Premier Consolidated held up well to close unaltered at 17 1/2 p with one of the leading London intergrated houses said to have been mopping up any stock on offer. Theme park operator Euro Disney's rebound gathered pace, the shares, which have fallen 40 per cent in three weeks, gaining 30 to 720p. Stories in the French press that new management contracts may mean more funds for shareholders and less for the Disney group lifted sentiment. The recent surge in Stakis continued with renewed talk that a buyer had been found for the group's nursing homes and that the board would be strengthened at next month's results meeting. The shares rose a penny to 40p. Next was a bright spot in a weak retail sector, the shares adding a penny to 137p. Nomura upgraded the group, forecasting profits this year of Pounds 31m, a rise of Pounds 5m. Profit-takers sent shares in Great Universal Stores down 35 to 1653p. The property sector was hit by a few determined sellers and a lack of the small private buying which has sustained some of the stocks in recent weeks. Among the fallers yesterday, MEPC, hurt additionally by a sell note from UBS Phillips and Drew, slipped 6 to 330p. Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms manufacturer hit by revelations of accounting problems in recent weeks, staged a strong recovery, the shares bouncing 9 to 114p in heavy turnover of 3.3m shares, with BZW a heavy buyer. Mr Howard Seymour, BZW's building analyst, said he had recommended the shares to clients as a buy up to 125p following a presentation at the London broker. 'There are no further irregularities and we feel the shares should be on a market rating, rather than at a discount,' said Mr Seymour. Building materials group Hepworth settled 4 higher at 263p after broker James Capel placed 9.75m shares at 249p to fund Hepworth's acquisition of two Dutch companies. More aggressive buying by Kleinwort Benson Securities drove Volex Group shares up 33 to a record 395p. The broker is said to have been very impressed by the Volex management at a lunch held at Kleinwort last week. Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 10m a substantial part of which was recorded early in the day after a 'bed and breakfast' tax related deal. The shares eased a penny to 100p, with sentiment weakened by the belief that the stock would no longer be a constituent of the FT-SE 100 stocks. Among transport stocks, NFC closed 18 down at 266p, having touched 261p, after a cautious full year results statement which included a Pounds 10.5m pension contribution that surprised the market. Two exceptionally heavy trades in Taylor Woodrow, 9m at 52p and 3.4m at the same price, were interpreted as bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deals. A trade of 4.4m Tarmac at 89p was seen as a tax deal. The FT-SE 100 Committee yesterday approved inclusion in the Index from December 21 of Royal Insurance and Standard Chartered and exclusion of BET and Rolls-Royce. Newly-included in the FT-SE Mid 250 and FT-SE Actuaries 350 will be Taunton Cider, Anglian Grp, Cray Electronic, American Trust and Betterware, and excluded Simon Eng, Ibstock Johnsen, Bullough, Newman Tonks and Ellis &amp; Evered.

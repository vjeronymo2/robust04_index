			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, Jan 11 (AFP)--A Palestinian construction  group put forward Tuesday [11 January] "a giant national  project" to build 13 towns on the West Bank and Gaza Strip at a  cost of some 30 billion dollars over the next decade.    Three cities in Gaza would each house 250,000 people and  another 10 developments on the West Bank a total of 500,000,  said 'Isa 'Awdah, a director of the Philistia building firm.    "To erect a strong and durable economy we see that there is  the need for a giant national project which can concentrate all  the Palestinian forces ... [ellipsis as received] and constitute  the backbone of this economy," he told a press conference.    'Awdah predicted the private sector plan would create  150,000  jobs.    More than 600,000 of the 780,000 Palestinians living in Gaza  are considered refugees by the United Nations and 330,000 of  them live in camps.    On the West Bank, nearly 480,000 of the 1.2 million  Palestinians are refugees, 125,000 of them in UN-run camps.    'Awdah called on the Palestine Liberation Organisation,  Israel and the international community to support the project,  saying 40 percent of the financing would have to be foreign  investment and cheap loans.    According to Hasan Abu-Libdah, in charge of the PLO's  technical committee preparing for autonomy, the housing  situation in the occupied territories is catastrophic.    An average of nine people live in each house or apartment on  the Gaza Strip and 7.5 people in each unit on the West Bank.    Abu-Libdah estimated that 120,000 new units were needed each  year to bring down the number to six people per house by the  year 2000.    However, Ibrahim Sha'ban, head of the Palestinian Housing  Council, hit out at the project. "This will reflect negatively  on Palestinian credibility before donor countries," he said,  calling for coordination.    The council is directing a 20-million-dollar European  Community funded housing project in Gaza.    Philistia, based in Jerusalem, has 75 employees engaged  mainly in construction projects in Israel.</p>

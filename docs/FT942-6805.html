			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Greek currency rallies The Greek drachma rallied yesterday against both the D-Mark and the US dollar, as overseas investors poured in foreign currency to buy next week's issues of Ecu- and US dollar-linked government bonds, with interest rates set at over 7 per cent. The drachma closed at DM149, up from DM150.1 and at Dollars 245.7, up from Dollars 246.4. Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou claimed the battle to avert devaluation 'is still critical but has been won,' saying that short-term interest rates, now at record levels, would start coming down next week. However, economists predict renewed pressure on the Greek currency as soon as interest rates decline. They said the government would be forced to accept a faster depreciation of the drachma over the next few weeks.</p>

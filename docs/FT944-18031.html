			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Huhtamaki lowers forecast Huhtamaki, the Finnish consumer products group, has lowered its full-year forecast after reporting static profits and lower earnings per share in the first eight months. The sales prognosis has been cut by FM500m to FM8.5bn (Dollars 1.8bn) and earnings per share are expected to be lower than last year's FM13.59, not higher. Pre-tax profits will be flat at around FM506m. The company blamed a 15 per cent rise in the Finnish markka against the US dollar for the adjustment, and said a strike in North America's major league baseball may hit collectable card launches towards the year-end. In the first eight months, profits edged up to FM309m from FM307m after acquisitions helped lift sales by 12 per cent to FM5.6bn. The result, struck after a FM4m increase in operating profit, to FM409m, was partially offset by higher financial costs of FM100m, up FM2m. Earnings per share fell 12 per cent to FM8.46 from FM9.58 due to a higher number of shares in issue. Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, was cautiously optimistic, saying 'a turnaround in our key markets is evident at long last'. There was an improved North American performance by Leaf, the world's 10th largest confectionery group, and satisfactory results from Leiras pharmaceuticals.</p>

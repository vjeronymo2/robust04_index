			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Directors warned on legal liabilities Non-executive directors of UK companies may not appreciate that their personal legal liability 'may have substantially increased', a senior British industrialist warned last night. Sir Owen Green, recently retired chairman of the industrial conglomerate BTR, told an audience in London that the 1992 Cadbury report on corporate governance does not have the force of law, but 'it will have legal consequences'. Sir Owen explained that its attempt to create what he called a 'half-way house' between unitary and two-tier boards 'must create legal confusion'. In the event that the courts are involved in any issues of governance 'they will take the (Cadbury) code as representing the reasonable requirements of directors'. The strength of the old legal distinction between executive and non-executive directors may have been diluted, perhaps extinguished, in the case of members of audit, remuneration and nomination committees. In setting out his personal corporate governance vision - at odds in many respects with the Cadbury approach - Sir Owen strongly criticised the role of auditors and renewed his earlier attack on excessive executive pay. He said a review of the auditing profession was 'well overdue' and that auditors' independence from company managements must be restored. This could be done by making any change in auditors subject to a special or extraordinary meeting, while limited liability should also be considered. 'Restore his role as professional watchdog - but not bloodhound,' he said. On pay, Sir Owen called for disclosure of all benefits of high-paid executives. 'The Cadbury suggestion of remuneration committees of non-executive directors is demonstrably not a solution.' Cadbury critique, page 14</p>

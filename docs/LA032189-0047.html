			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Researchers from Iowa State University have come up with a water-soluble form  of Vitamin A that they say is easily absorbed by the body and is safer for  treatment of acne and wrinkles than other approved forms. The findings of their  research into Vitamin A, also called retinol, were reported at a meeting of the  Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in New Orleans. Other  derivatives of Vitamin A, soluble in fats, oils and alcohols, are toxic if  consumed in large amounts and some believe they could lead to birth defects.  Drugs that have been approved to treat acne and wrinkling, such as Retin A and  Accutane, contain forms of retinoic acid.  </P></p>

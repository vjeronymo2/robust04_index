			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Where bland lead the bland: The Commonwealth conference WITH all the pomp and ceremony of the Eurovision song contest, the Commonwealth conference got under way yesterday. Proceedings at Nicosia's international conference centre were occasionally enlivened. Australia's Paul Keating had a go at the French over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad again complained about the west's handling of Bosnia. But for the most part, the bland led the bland, with milestones marked and friendships forged. There may after all be something to be said for a gathering of world leaders in which the highlight promised to be an exposition by Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, of his views on trade negotiations. He is due to take the stage for his star turn at a closed session this afternoon in Limassol. The prospect may have unsettled many delegates, but if the youngest of the 35 heads of government on the platform had any fears about the ordeal ahead, he did not show it. But one would expect nothing less from a soldier. All the same, exposure to the rigours of a Commonwealth conference must have made His Excellency Captain Valentine Strasser, the title accorded him in the official conference handbook, rue the day he staged a coup in Sierra Leone. The 27-year-old dictator who seized power last year has already come under savage attack in the Commonwealth's annual report: his coup was a 'serious setback' to democracy. The conventions of the Commonwealth mean that neither Capt Strasser nor his country were mentioned by name, but it is the club's way of warning a member that he could be blackballed if he behaved really badly. Then Capt Strasser had to endure a moving opening session which must have tested the tolerance of the most hardened democrat on the flag-bedecked platform in Nicosia's conference centre. Lights dimmed and spotlights focused on a childrens' choir singing the Beatles' 'Give Peace a Chance', with a solo from a George Michael look-alike. Not surprisingly, Capt Strasser has promised an early return to democracy. But moving though it was, something was missing. It was supposed to be a day for looking forward, giving the Commonwealth a cutting edge. Instead it became a day for nostalgia. Familiar faces were missing. Dr Hastings Banda, Malawi's nonagenarian life president, is in South Africa recovering from brain surgery. Since then, Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda has had democracy thrust upon him and lost his presidency. KK's absence is keenly felt, together with other giants of the past. 'I also miss Lee Kuan Yew, I miss Julius Nyerere . . . (long pause) I even miss Margaret Thatcher,' said a senior Commonwealth official wistfully. And if the Gatt debate is the highlight of the 1993 Commonwealth conference, delegates recalling past acrimonious rows that gave so much pleasure may well get round to another admission: they also miss apartheid.

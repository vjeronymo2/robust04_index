			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia plans its 1995  budget to have a deficit of 12 billion Slovak crowns, making up  three percent of GDP, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said after  a cabinet session last night.    The cabinet approved a budget proposal for 1995, planning a  15- percent unemployment rate, a two percent GDP growth and an  eight percent inflation rate.    The cabinet asked the Finance Ministry to discuss the budget  proposal with representatives of the central bank and of the  National Property Fund (FNM).    Filkus said a problem was the amount of debt to be paid next  year. Slovakia is expected to pay 38 to 44 billion Slovak  crowns (about $1.3 billion), an increase by 11 to 17 billion  crowns compared with this year. This increase is higher than  the year-on-year growth in budget revenues and would draw a  quarter of annual budget expenditures.    In case the central bank and the FNM refuse to share in  paying back the debt, the budget deficit could not be  maintained, Filkus added.    In an interview published by yesterday's issue of the  economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Premier Jozef Moravcik said  Slovakia's goal for this year was to completely halt the fall of  GDP, reduce the inflation rate to 13 percent (from last year's  23.1 percent) and maintain the budget deficit at 14 billion  crowns.</p>

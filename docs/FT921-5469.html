			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / ABB global instrumentation business put up for sale ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group, is putting up for sale its UK-based global instrumentation business as part of a strategy to concentrate on its core business of electrical engineering. The sale is expected to generate substantial worldwide interest, as it represents a rare opportunity to purchase a large self-contained instrumentation business with a good strategic and market position. The proposed sale comes only two years after ABB purchased the outstanding 45.6 per cent of Luton-based ABB Kent in a deal that valued the world's second largest manufacturer of water meters at Pounds 135m. Two months later, ABB Kent became the lynchpin of a new process instrumentation group which included the Taylor Instrument division of ABB Combustion Engineering in the US. The old Brown Boveri company had originally bought a stake in George Kent, the British instruments group, in 1974. Morgan Stanley International in London has been retained as financial adviser for sale of the business group, which has major manufacturing operations in the UK, Italy, Germany and the US, annual revenues of nearly Dollars 450m, and employs about 4,500 people. The business produces a wide range of instruments and control valves along with water meters. Its principal companies are ABB Kent-Taylor, Kent Introl and Kent Meters. ABB had foreseen the creation of a new business group when it bought out the minority shares in ABB Kent. It had said in February 1990 that, given a highly competitive market and rapidly changing technology, there was a clear need for the co-ordination of product development, manufacturing and marketing. Yesterday, ABB said that more than 50 per cent of the instrumentation business was related to water control and therefore not closely related to its core electrical business. ABB would not comment on instrumentation business profits ahead of the engineering group's annual results due on March 18, except to say that the business was 'doing well'. Mr John Notley, president of the instrumentation business and chief executive of ABB Kent, described business prospects as 'pretty good'. Weakness in the US offset good conditions in Germany, which has benefited from reunification.</p>

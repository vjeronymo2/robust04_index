Yang, 49, from Shanghai, was arrested in Beijing on  November 15, the day after the signing by nine dissidents of a  document calling for multi-party politics and democracy in China.    He was initially placed in a detention centre in Beijing but  was transferred December 5 to one in Shanghai, he told AFP by  telephone.    "After I have recuperated a bit, because my health  deteriorated in prison, I plan to resume my activities with the  Peace Charter and also with the human rights movement set up  last year in Shanghai and which we want to get officially  registered," he said, following his release on Friday.    Yang, who has always been in the forefront of the struggle  to  defend human rights in China, spent two years in jail for his  role during the 1979 Democracy Wall movement. He was also the  author of a letter written in 1990 to Communist Party Secretary  General Jiang Zemin calling for the liberation of all political  prisoners. Yang said he had no news of another Peace Charter  signatory, Qin Yongmin, from Wuhan, central China, who was also  arrested on November 15.    Ma Shaohua and Zheng Xuguang, two human rights activists and  members of a monitoring group in Xian, central China, were  questioned two weeks later for holding a meeting in Beijing with  Charter dissidents. During that meeting the two movements  decided to coordinate their efforts to promote democracy by  legal and non- violent means. Their initiatives on these issues  were the most significant since the crushing of the 1989  democracy movement in Beijing.</p>

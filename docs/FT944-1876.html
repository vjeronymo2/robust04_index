			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): UK retailing - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT The combination of warm weather, two budgets and a rise in interest rates is not auspicious for UK retailers, especially in the vital trading weeks leading up to Christmas. No wonder that the de-rating endured by the sector over the past year has accelerated, with stores' shares underperforming the market recently. Is the gloom overdone? To the extent that it is caused by fears about Christmas trading, the answer is probably yes. There is plenty of time left for a last-minute shopping spree. If retailers can hold their nerve and resist the temptation to slash prices, there is no reason for this December to be unseasonally dire Longer term worries abound, though. Not least, there is the fear that the retail environment has deteriorated now that inflation has dropped. Double-digit growth in revenues becomes difficult to achieve even when volume growth is at respectable single-figure levels. The signs, however, are that the sector's strongest companies, with high market shares and up-to-date information technology, are coping well. They are generating plentiful cash. Moreover, earnings growth could even beat that of the market as a whole next year. Yet, the sector, excluding Marks and Spencer, has shed its traditional premium rating. Weaker retailers have been punished by investors over the past year. By contrast, a re-rating of the stronger companies is overdue. Shareholders could find some good yuletide value in the sector.</p>

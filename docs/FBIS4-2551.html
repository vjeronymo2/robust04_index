			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.C. Tzou and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 11 (CNA) -- The Republic  of China [ROC] is welcome to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as soon as possible, GATT  Director-General Peter Sutherland said here Monday [11 April].    Sutherland made the statement while meeting with ROC  Economic  Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang at a reception given by the  Moroccan Government in honor of delegates from some 150  countries to a GATT ministerial meeting scheduled to open here  Tuesday.    As Taiwan is a major trading country, Sutherland said he  believes Taiwan's accession to GATT will help boost the healthy  development of a world trading system.    Sutherland further said Taiwan's GATT membership application  has nothing to do with Mainland China's.    "They are two separate cases and are being screened by two  different working groups," he explained.    "So I think there is no such problem as which side of the  Taiwan Strait should join GATT first," he said. "Either side  which can win the support of two-thirds of GATT contracting  parties will enter the body first," he added.    Taiwan applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory  in 1990 and was awarded observer status in the world trade  regulatory body in 1992. It hopes to become a full member by  the end of this year. Mainland China, which applied for GATT  membership in 1986, is also a GATT observer.    Chiang, heading a 15-member delegation, arrived here Sunday  to attend the four-day GATT ministerial meeting, which will set  the seal on a sweeping new world trade treaty, also known as the  Uruguay Round accord.    While here, Chiang will hold informal tariff concession  talks  with delegates from the Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,  Egypt, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United  States with a view to accelerating Taiwan's entry into GATT,  which is scheduled to be superseded by the World Trade  Organization next January.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government expressed grave concern Tuesday over North Korea's  announcement of its withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] and strongly urged Pyongyang to respond to  the world community's demand for guaranteed nuclear transparency.    "We express our deep concern because North Korea's  withdrawal  from the IAEA makes the already serious nuclear problem more  serious," said Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku.    Lee, who is also minister of the National Unification Board,  made the statement at a press conference he held after presiding  over a Unification and National Policy Coordinating Committee  meeting Tuesday morning.    North Korea is wriggling out of all nuclear safeguards  arrangements that guarantee the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula, he pointed out.    "The government strongly urges North Korea to cooperate with  all nuclear safeguards arrangements laid down by the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)."    Yi noted that no unusual military movements have been  detected in North Korea and said the Seoul government will  continue working for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear  dispute.    With regard to the government's response to the latest North  Korean move, he said the international community was already  moving toward sanctions, indicating that Seoul will continue to  push for the plan at the U.N. Security Council.    Yi added, however, that North Korea's withdrawal from the  IAEA would not hasten the adoption of U.N. sanctions. "We will  keep a close watch on any development in the coming two to three  weeks," he said.</p>

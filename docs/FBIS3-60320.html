			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Alexandre Varin report: "France and Great Britain Accused </F> of Polluting the North Sea"]    [Text] Eight European countries bordering the North Sea,  plus Switzerland (via the Rhine River) expressed concern on 7  and 8 December in Copenhagen on that sea's poor state of health  due to pollution of oil, nitrogenous by-products, nontreated  sewage, radioactive waste, and the release of sulfur and heavy  metals into the atmosphere.    But only four of them (Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and  Sweden) were represented by both their ministers of environment  and agriculture. Pleading the GATT negotiations, Germany and  France sent higher civil servants, just like Finland and  Switzerland. According to Greenpeace and the World Fund for  Nature, this shows that "there is no real European political  will to protect the North Sea."    However, the report drawn up by a working group is crushing:  1.7 million tons of nitrogenous substances (ammonia, nitrates)  are dumped into the sea every year, 900,000 tons of which come  from agricultural activities. This leads to a rarefaction of  oxygen in the marine environment. The efforts made since the  conference held in The Hague in 1990 have not improved the  situation and the states that border the sea almost unanimously  admit that it will not be possible to reduce by half the dumping  of nitrogen and phosphates by 1995, as expected.    All the more, as Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken  pointed out, since "industrialized countries like France, Great  Britain, and Norway continue to dump nontreated sewage water  from the cities into the sea." "Those countries," he added,  "lack the courage to impose sacrifices on their citizens in  order to pay the costs of filtering stations." Mr. Auken  emphasized that "Denmark has spent ECU1 billion in taxpayer  money to clean waters carrying sewage."    Taking place before the major 1995 conference that also is  to  be held in Copenhagen, this intervening meeting discussed  various types of pollution, whose scope was not known, including  the smoke from ship stacks or the dumping of oil during illegal  degasification of ships, not to mention the leaks and other  incidents in the 4,000 [oil] wells and the 140 offshore oil and  gas rigs in the North Sea.    "Even more outrageous and more dangerous is the release of  radioactive waste from the Sellafield nuclear recycling plant"  (northwest England), reported Greenpeace during the meeting.  The British delegation, which included the agriculture  minister, has not reacted to the protest, which was supported by  Denmark, which has requested that an end be put to the release  of such waste. Great Britain is the only country that has not  published data on the reduction of pollutants in the North Sea.</p>

Bailey, 72,  entered the hospital Monday, and is expected to stay for about two weeks,  hospital officials said. The entertainer suffers from degenerative arthritis,  in which the cartilage covering the ends of bones and joints wears away,  causing the bones to rub together painfully, officials said.

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Ford's global drive Ford's better than expected third-quarter results indicate bright domestic and overseas prospects that could eventually allow the company to outpace General Motors and Chrysler. The group only slightly lags its Japanese rivals in productivity and has become the US's most cost-efficient indigenous vehicle maker. That its north American product mix remains weak explains why Ford's US net profits per unit, excluding financial earnings, were just Dollars 575 (Pounds 364) compared with Chrysler's Dollars 1,013. But the gap should close over the next 12 months as Ford launches a string of new, high-margin vehicles. Ford may make progress at home, but its best prospects are overseas. The group should benefit from the upturn in Europe, where GM is struggling and Chrysler has minimal presence. Ford is also positioning itself early in the fast-growing Asian market, with its 24.5 per cent stake in Mazda and recently announced ventures in India and China. The company aims to speed up and cut the cost of new model development. If it can amortise this investment by marketing the vehicles across the globe, it could achieve large economies of scale similar to those achieved by Japanese manufacturers. Implementation will not be easy. The required internal revolution is starting at a time of increasingly bitter competition at home and abroad, as rivals add capacity in many of their markets. The temptation will be to respond by radically customising models to meet regional tastes, as happened when Ford tried to make the Escort a global car in the 1980s. Ford must ensure such distractions do not deflect it from its current path.</p>

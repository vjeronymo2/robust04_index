			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH CALLED 'TIMID' ON SOVIET TRADE  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell accused President Bush today of being  "overly timid" and urged him to suspend trade restrictions with the Soviet  Union as a reward for permitting freer emigration.  </P> <P> Mitchell (D-Me.) called for the temporary waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment  which links non-discriminatory trade treatment by the United States with the  freedom of Soviet citizens to leave their country at will.  </P> <P> The Democratic leader noted that more than 100,000 people have been permitted  to leave the Soviet Union since the beginning of the year and that as many as  50,000 more have received permission to depart.  </P> <P> "This indisputable rise in Soviet emigration is a step that deserves an  American response," Mitchell told the Senate.  </P></p>

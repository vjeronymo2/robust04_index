			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel-General Anatoliy Kornukov, commander </F> of the Moscow Air Defense District, by Valeriy Buldakov; place  and date not given: "The Duty of the Moscow Air Defense  District. R15 Billion for Defense Enterprises: Rust Will Fly No  More"]    [Text] Today every child knows that there are certain  protective rings around Moscow, but what are these rings? M.  Rust's flight along the route FRG-Red Square is well remembered.  There were no rings protecting the city. What kind of defense  system is this? Our correspondent discusses this with the  commander of the Moscow Air Defense District, Colonel-General  Anatoliy Kornukov.    [Kornukov] Rings around the capital--this is too simplistic  an idea of the air defense structure. Troops of the Moscow Air  Defense District are deployed over a territory of 24 oblasts of  Russia and they monitor the air space over an area of 1.3  million square kilometers. Large and small units of the district  protect 141 facilities, including 59 military ones, 14--with  radiation and nuclear hazards, 17--of high level state  administration, and 11 large cities and industrial centers.    As for the immediate defense of Moscow, I would not call  this  system rings. It is simply that at the beginning of the Cold  War, when missiles for delivering nuclear weapons were created  in the West, we began to deploy our air defense missile units  around the city in two echelons. Incidentally, L. Beria was the  first to work on the new defense system. At that time we began  to arm ourselves with S-25 air defense missile systems. For  those times this was a high class (the technical equipment  served us for 30 years after that). Regiments equipped with  these systems were deployed in such a way that Moscow was  practically invulnerable.    The defense included one external ring and one internal one.  The former was located 100-120 kilometers from Moscow, and the  latter--50-70 kilometers. That is the way it was after that as  well.    [Buldakov] But what changes have taken place?    [Kornukov] By the end of the eighties a decision was made to  create a new system. Now we can wage a controlled air defense  missile battle with all flight equipment attacking both from the  air and from space. Therefore the air defense system itself will  soon be called an air-space system. The basis of this system is  the S-300 air defense missile complex with various  modifications. We have practically finished rearming ourselves.  Field trials were held in 1993: More than 100 aircraft were  "launched" over Moscow and all of them entered the capital zone  at the same time. The air defense battle lasted a couple of  minutes, and all the targets were conventionally fired on and  destroyed. The new air defense missile complex can engage in  combat with air attack equipment created under the Stealth  program, that is, with the so-called "Stealth aircraft," for  example, the familiar F-117 fighter-bombers. Using Moscow's air  defense defense system it is possible to fire on 500 aircraft of  various classes at the same time and destroy them simultaneously  with one volley. These weapons are every bit as good, and in  terms of many parameters (for example, the target location  system) they surpass the renowned American Patriot complex,  which proved itself so well in Desert Storm operations.    [Buldakov] Are there still systems in the world for defense  of large metropolitan areas like the Moscow system?    [Kornukov] Like that--no. That is the only system of its  kind. Without false modesty, it is the pride of our scientists.  So many billions were invested in it...but it was worth it. One  can say that nothing of the kind has been created around St.  Petersburg. As for other large cities of Russia and also  important facilities, they are protected in the overall air  defense defense system. It is somewhat different from, say, the  American one. The United States regards the entire territory of  its country as an especially important object. Washington, for  example, has no special protection systems. The states place  their hopes in the Air Force and Navy in remote regions. Russia  has a territory almost three times as large as that of the  United States and we do not have the forces or money to arrange  defense this way...    [Buldakov] What is the main thing state money is spent on in  your department?    [Kornukov] In keeping with the new military doctrine, we are  relying not on the quantity but on the quality of new military  equipment. For example, we are replacing the obsolete MiG-23,  SU-15, and MiG-25 aircraft which cannot successfully resist  cruise missiles. And the SU-27 and MiG-31 are quite excellent at  this. At the present time 95 percent of the air defense missile  forces are equipped with various modifications of the S-300 arms  system.    New equipment requires colossal expenditures. In order to  guarantee to down one cruise missile it is necessary to launch  at least two to four of our own from the S-300 complex. All this  plus the work of the people amounts to approximately R320  million. One hour of flight of a modern fighter, waging air  combat and destroying three or four targets, costs more than R7  million. In 1993, 40 percent of the missile units went through  training with weapons fire and 70 percent of the fighter  aircraft regiments went through the testing ground. The marks  were high: Of the 62 targets on the testing ground, 59 were  destroyed. So I can say with good reason that the skies over  Moscow are protected.    [Buldakov] From whom? Are the Western countries still  considered to be our main potential enemies? How do the Russian  air defense defense troops feel about their colleagues from the  former Union republics?    [Kornukov] As for the West, not all of the missiles that  were  aimed at Moscow have been aimed somewhere else. Well, we are  working successfully with air defense defense forces, for  example, of Ukraine and Belarus: We notify one another about  aircraft that are coming from our territories. We are very  sensitive to aircraft that carelessly come without notification.  The Baltic republics are frequently guilty of this. Sometimes we  force the aircraft to return to the airfield from which it took  off. But we hope that we will never use weapons against our  former friends in the Union. It is impossible to allow a  free-for-all in the sky. We must agree on "corridors." Soon,  when the Western Group of Forces takes its fighters up, we will  especially need these corridors.    [Buldakov] And, finally, a question inevitably arises as  soon  as the topic comes around to modern weapons. How safe are they  from accidents? Are we sure some untrained soldier will not  press the wrong button?    [Kornukov] We have never placed ignoramuses in front of the  radar screen or behind the wheel of those immense missile  transporters. Only trained officers are seated at the "buttons."  At the airfields the equipment is again serviced by officers and  warrant officers. Basically we do not have enough enlisted men  and noncommissioned officers. And in the last fall-winter callup  the plan was fulfilled by only 8 percent. But I think that in  two or three years we will eliminate such things as having  majors stand guard or be in a detachment for loading coal. There  are 2,400 military servicemen on duty in the air defense defense  system 24 hours a day. More than 10,000 people are serving under  contract (more than half of them are women). There are officer  teams capable of waging combat without enlisted men and  noncommissioned officers. The wages of a fighter pilot (captain,  major) are R150,000-160,000 plus 30 percent of the salary for  special duty. And food is free. Judge for yourself how much that  is when the salary of our district commander when translated  into dollars is barely half as much as that of a sergeant in the  U.S. Air Force.</p>

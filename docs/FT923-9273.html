			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Contest to set up European rating agency intensifies THE battle to create a new European credit rating agency has intensified, with two groups competing for the backing of Bertelsmann, the German media giant which has emerged as one of the main potential sponsors of such a venture. IBCA, the London-based agency which has built a strong reputation by specialising in ratings for financial institutions, has been in recent talks with Bertelsmann. The German company has also held talkswith a Frankfurt-based group set up with the backing of German banks to look into the possibility of a Europe-wide rating agency. Both groups are trying to build a European ratings agency with the resources and reputation to compete with the two leaders in the industry, the US groups Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. IBCA hopes to complete a merger next month with Euronotation, a French agency. This will entail 70 per cent of the new group's shares passing to Centenaire Blanzy, a French publishing group, with the balance remaining with management, said Mr Robin Monro-Davies, chairman of IBCA. The intention is then to sell some of Centenaire's stake to other shareholders later this year, among them Bertelsmann, said Mr Monro-Davies. The involvement of Centenaire Blanzy has caused concern in some quarters due to its close links to Compagnie Suez, the French industrial and financial group. Any link between a ratings agency and a financial institution could undermine the belief of companies that any information they give to the agency would remain confidential. Mr Monro-Davies said: 'There would be no question of any bank having any direct interest in IBCA - or any indirect interest either, unless it was so distant as to be meaningless.'</p>

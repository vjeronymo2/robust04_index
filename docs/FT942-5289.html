			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Seoul on hook of unattractive options: There are risks in both war and sanctions The deepening crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme is provoking much soul-searching in South Korea. The possibility that United Nations economic sanctions could trigger a military response from North Korea is raising doubts about whether the South should risk going to war to stop the North from possessing a nuclear weapon. A conflict could cost several million civilian lives and the destruction of Seoul, the South Korean capital, which lies only 35 miles from the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas. The no-war scenario is also alarming. An international trade embargo could cause the tottering North Korean economy to collapse and with it the government of President Kim Il-sung - a prospect that scares Seoul almost as much as a military conflict. Such a premature reunification of Korea would force South Korea to spend as much as Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133.3bn) on reconstruction costs to absorb the North, while diverting resources from the South's push to create an advanced industrial base that would compete effectively against the West and Japan. The complexity of the situation is in sharp contrast to the clear-cut cold war view of North Korea during the 1961-1987 period of military rule in South Korea. The government and public then widely regarded North Korea as a dangerous foe that must be brought quickly to its knees. That attitude has not completely disappeared under the democratic government of President Kim Young-sam. The military and intelligence service contend that North Korea is intent on developing a nuclear weapon, possibly to support a forced reunification on Pyongyang's terms. They warn that North Korea has talked about reunifying the 'fatherland' in 1995, the symbolic 50th anniversary of Korea's division after the peninsula's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. North Korea's apparent efforts to destroy evidence of its suspected nuclear weapons programme by removing spent fuel rods from its reactor and hiding them from international inspectors has strengthened the position of South Korean officials who favour a hard line toward Pyongyang. But the belief that North Korea still harbours hostile intentions toward the South has been met with increased scepticism among some South Koreans, particularly those born after the Korean War ended in 1953. The South's growing prosperity and democratic progress have increased national self-confidence. It has supported the perception that the South has already won its cold war against the struggling and isolated North and has little to fear from it. Government officials who favour a conciliatory approach toward North Korea argue that Pyongyang is using its nuclear programme as a bargaining chip to win security guarantees from the US, including diplomatic recognition and economic aid. These officials believe that the North may not even have the technical capability to build a nuclear weapon, but Pyongyang needs to create the impression that it is pursuing such a programme to bolster its negotiating position with the US. The action by North Korea to bar international inspections of the spent fuel rods is part of its strategy to maintain uncertainty over the extent of the programme until Pyongyang wins the concessions it seeks, according to this theory. Outside government, there are widening generational differences on the North Korean issue. University students believe that the US and Japan, rather than North Korea, represent the biggest potential threats to South Korea, according to a recent survey. Radical students view the nuclear dispute in a pan-Korean nationalist perspective, claiming that the crisis has been provoked by the US to reverse Washington's dwindling influence on the Korean peninsula and to force Seoul to buy US weapons, such as the Patriot missile. Anti-American feeling is widespread among students because of past US support for the country's military rulers. Distrust toward Japan is even greater as it develops a nuclear reprocessing capability and the potential means to build a atomic bomb. Opposition politicians are demanding that South Korea should acquire nuclear processing facilities in response. There is growing public sentiment that a North Korean nuclear bomb programme may not be such a bad thing as South Korea could inherit it after reunification and use it to defend Korea against Japan. The best-selling book in South Korea recently has been a thriller describing a secret joint North-South programme to build a nuclear weapon, which is then used to stop a Japanese attack on Korea in the late-1990s. 'Many people find the book thought-provoking and wonder why South Korea shouldn't have a nuclear weapon,' said one Korean journalist. The popularity of the novel suggests that one unexpected result of the North Korea nuclear dispute could be growing public acceptance for a more assertive and independent South Korean foreign policy, including the possession of its own nuclear arsenal.</p>

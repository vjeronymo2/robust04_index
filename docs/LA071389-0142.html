			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON BANS NORTHROP UNIT FROM CONTRACTS;  </P> <P> FIRM CALLS FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST PRECISION PRODUCTS DIVISION 'UNWARRANTED'  </P> <P> A Northrop division that was charged with criminal fraud last April, along with  two of its top executives, has been suspended by the Air Force from obtaining  new government contracts for an indefinite period.  </P> <P> The Northrop precision products division in Norwood, Mass., which builds  guidance equipment and gyroscopes, was notified of its suspension Monday by  Daniel Rak, deputy assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition, management  and policy.  </P> <P> Northrop said in a statement Wednesday that "the charges are unwarranted and  exaggerated and the suspension unnecessary." The company also said it will  "provide information in opposition" to the suspension and begin discussions  immediately.  </P> <P> The suspension was not unexpected by Northrop, since the Pentagon has acted in  recent cases to suspend contractors upon criminal indictment rather than  conviction as was the case in the past.  </P> <P> So far, such suspensions against major prime contractors have lasted only a  matter of months. But a letter of notification by Rak said the suspension  against Northrop would remain in force pending the completion of the legal  proceedings against the company, a condition that puts Northrop in a  potentially awkward position.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Strong Actions  </P> <P> "It is clearly something that puts extreme pressure on Northrop," said Wolfgang  Demisch, an analyst at UBS Securities in New York. "It sounds like the  Department of Defense is using its position as a customer more forcefully than  it has to date."  </P> <P> Northrop said it has already taken strong actions to correct the problems at  the Pomona facility where the fraud allegedly occurred. It permanently closed  the facility and fired the plant manager and several employees.  </P> <P> Northrop was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on April 12 on 167  counts of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly falsifying tests on guidance  components for nuclear armed cruise missiles. The indictment was modified last  month to include 22 additional fraud counts.  </P> <P> In addition, the general manager of the precision products division, Joseph  Yamron, and Vice President Leopold Engler were indicted on charges that they  knowingly supplied defective gyroscopes to the Air Force. The two executives  have been put on suspension.  </P> <P> Northrop says the charges "are unwarranted, and the company strongly disputes  any allegations of criminal behavior by the division or by current employees."  Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said in April that the company would stand  behind Yamron and Engler.  </P> <P> The precision products division employs about 1,900 workers and accounts for  $145 million in annual sales, or 2.5% of Northrop's total revenue.  </P> <P> Although the division is only a small part of Northrop's business, the  suspension comes at a politically inopportune time when Northrop is facing a  major budget battle in Congress over its $70-billion B-2 bomber program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Needs Good Will  </P> <P> "Defense contractors live off the good will of the body politic and to the  extent that you are indicted or suspended, then you are more vulnerable in the  halls of government," Demisch said.  </P> <P> But Cantafio said, "This has nothing to do with the B-2."  </P> <P> An Air Force spokesman confirmed that Northrop was suspended and that the  service had planned to announce the suspension today.  </P> <P> In the letter, Rak said the suspension against the firm was based on the  indictment that alleged Northrop and its employees "conspired to defraud the  government by knowingly supplying untested and out-of-specification flight  stabilization and control packages and making false, fictitious and fraudulent  statements and representations" relating to the guidance equipment for a cruise  missile and stabilization equipment for the Harrier jet.  </P></p>

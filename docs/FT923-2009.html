			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Six days that shook the pound Sunday September 13 Italian authorities announce that the Lira is to be devalued by 7 per cent against the D-mark. The Bundesbank says it will cut interest rates the following day. Norman Lamont welcomes both measures and confirms he will take 'whatever action was necessary' to defend sterling's central rate at DM2.95. Monday September 14 London stocks soar - the FT-SE 100 opens up 99.5 at 2,470.4. Pound rallies from DM2.79. Bundesbank announces new interest rates - cut of 0.25 per cent in Lombard rate to 9.25 per cent, and of 0.5 per cent in discount rate to 8.25 per cent. Shares drop. FT-SE closes at 2,422.1 (up 51.2 for the day). Sterling closes 2 pfennigs higher at DM2.8125, safely above the ERM floor of DM2.778. It stands at Dollars 1.8945, compared with Dollars 1.958 three days earlier. Tuesday September 15 Pressure on the pound resumes, following reports of comments by Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, that 'there was room for no more' interest rate cuts, and that a more general realignment of ERM currencies (including a devaluation of sterling) would have been preferable. The Bank of England buys pounds in an attempt to support the currency, but by the close sterling stands at DM2.78 in New York - its lowest since joining the ERM and one-fifth of a pfennig above the minimum permitted level. FT-SE closes off 52.1 at 2,370.0. Wednesday September 16 'Black Wednesday'. Pressure on sterling continues. The FT-SE 100 drops 28 points at the opening. Bank of England buys Pounds 1bn, at 9am, with no significant effect, followed by intervention by the Bundesbank and Bank of France at 9.30. Pressure on sterling continues. At 11am, UK base rates are raised by 2 percentage points from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. Within minutes, the FT-SE hits 2,291.3, down 78.7 for the day (its low for the week). Sterling does not recover, even after Bank of England spends another Pounds 3bn. Pound falls below permitted level. It is announced that base rates will rise by another three percentage points to 15 per cent by the opening of trade on Thursday. Pressure on sterling continues, but shares rally as dealers work on the assumption that a devaluation is imminent. FT-SE closes at 2,378.3, up 8.3 for the day, in spite of the increase in lending rates. The pound closes at DM2.75, well below its permitted level. At 7.45pm, Lamont announces that it has been a 'difficult' day. Sterling's membership of the ERM is to be suspended, while the second base rate rise is cancelled. The pound moves lower. Thursday September 17 FT-SE opens 106 higher at 2,484.9 while pound continues to fall. However, shares fall back to register a gain of only 25.8, until the 10am announcement that base rates have returned to 10 per cent. The Cabinet accepts responsibility, Major and Lamont insist they have no intention of resigning. Meanwhile the French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt all fall to their ERM floors, amid further central bank intervention. Stocks resume their surge, FT-SE 100 closes at 2,483.9 (up 105.6). Sterling stands at DM2.64 and Dollars 1.7795 by lunchtime in New York - 4 per cent below its previous floor, and an effective 10 per cent devaluation compared with its original ERM central rate. Friday September 18 London stocks continue to rally. A modest opening rise is followed by buying in force once a radio interview with Lamont is interpreted as meaning that the pound will stay outside the ERM for some time to come. The market closes up 83.1 at 2567.1, with analysts agreeing that a cut in base rates to around 8 per cent has been discounted. Sterling falls slightly, amid the acrimony between Lamont and Chancellor Kohl, to stand at DM2.61 when the market closes in London.</p>

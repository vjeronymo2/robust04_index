			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BALLY SEEKING FILL-IN FOR SINATRA  </P> <P> Bally's Hotel officials say they are looking for a replacement act for Frank  Sinatra, who surprised the resort Thursday by canceling an upcoming engagement  because of a six-month strike by musicians. The resort said it is seeking a  replacement for Sinatra's engagements Monday through Dec. 9 and Dec. 26-31  because the singer has been "so inconsistent" in his statements about  performing despite the strike. "Bally's can no longer rely upon any schedule of  performances previously agreed to by Mr. Sinatra's representatives," the hotel  said.  </P></p>

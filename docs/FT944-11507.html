			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Private buyers shun UK new car market UK new car registrations fell last month by 3 per cent year-on-year as the market weakened under pressure from declining sales to private buyers. Registrations in October slipped to 122,526 from 126,305 in the same month a year ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The rate of growth in UK new car sales has fallen sharply since the summer. In the first half of this year, registrations rose 14 per cent, but from July to October sales have risen only 2.2 per cent year-on-year. The decline in new car sales in October is the second monthly year-on-year fall this year and follows a drop of 2.5 per cent in July, the smallest sales month. In the first 10 months, new car sales have risen 8.5 per cent to 1,710,842. In contrast to the new car market, registrations of new commercial vehicles rose 15.1 per cent in October and have risen 15.4 per cent in the first 10 months, reflecting stronger business confidence. The main factor behind the decline in new car sales in October was the 11.5 per cent drop in sales to private buyers. 'This is a worrying trend,' said Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive. Mr Neil Marshall, director of public policy at the Retail Motor Industry Federation, said sales to private buyers had fallen significantly for four months. 'There is a growing nervousness in the marketplace over the potential impact of the forthcoming Budget, and consumer confidence is already fragile following recent talk over interest rate rises,' he said. The share of new car sales to private buyers in the UK has declined to 50.1 per cent in the first 10 months from 53.2 per cent a year ago. The share fell as low as 46.2 per cent in October. Until now, the new car market has been sustained by rising demand from the large fleet and small business sectors. The rate of growth slowed in those segments too in October, however, with an increase year-on-year of 5.7 per cent. UK new car registrations, Page 4 Rover spends more, Page 4</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not intend for this requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be burdensome to institutions. This provision merely requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution with a placement service to document that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution does what it claims to do_namely, place students in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters objected to the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution establish and maintain records that support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational qualifications of each regular student admitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution whether or not that student receives Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program assistance, that are relevant to the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admission standards. Both commenters believed that institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should only be required to establish and maintain summary or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate information on the educational qualifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students admitted to the institution. This aggregate data would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be available to the Secretary only if the Secretary could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate a compelling need to review the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes this provision is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish whether an institution is in compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory admission requirements of sections 1201(a) and 481(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (c) of the HEA for purposes of institutional eligibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters urged the Secretary to include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that institutions retain records documenting whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and when a student completes his or her educational program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information is needed to verify completion rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has taken these comments under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration, but concluded that other regulatory provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing the completion rate calculations contain requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to retain documentation to support the computations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.24&blank;Audit Exceptions and Repayments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters supported the Secretary's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for a third-party servicer to notify all institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which the servicer provides the same service, in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those institutions under whose contract the servicer incurred a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability for a Title IV, HEA program violation. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters felt that this requirement was excessively broad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of these commenters argued that this requirement would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily damage a third-party servicer's reputation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters noted that the Secretary's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification requirements were not all that different from full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of all institutions with which the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts. One commenter suggested that third-party servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be required to notify institutions receiving the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service for which the servicer owes a liability only if that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability is material. One commenter recommended that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that is assessed a liability should have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable amount of time to provide the notification to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's clients. Another commenter was of the opinion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary notify all of the institutions with which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer contracts of the Secretary's determination at the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time that the servicer is notified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objected to the notification requirements. If a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer is assessed liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirement, any institution for which the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides the same service in which the violation was found is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially at risk as a result of the servicer's actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obviously, each institution under whose contract the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed a violation should be notified because the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holds that institution responsible for the full amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability. In addition, each institution that contracts with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer for the same service in which the violation was found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should also be informed of the servicer's violation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that an institution that receives the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service should be informed of the servicer's violation of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program requirement because the servicer may commit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a similar violation at that institution and the institution could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be held liable for that violation. This notice will also allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution to take corrective action without waiting for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal action by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the commenter who was concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers should have a reasonable amount of time in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which to notify affected institutions of the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination to assess a liability against the servicer, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not believe that that time frame needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantified. Servicers are expected promptly to notify affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions of the Secretary's determination because those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are also responsible for violations committed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their servicers. Servicers that fail to notify institutions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize an institution's ability to provide information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show that questioned expenditures were proper or take corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action to mitigate violations caused by a third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing a third-party servicer's appeal of the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, the Secretary will take into consideration whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or not the servicer notified affected institutions promptly of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary's determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not agree that it is necessary for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education to provide notice to all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions with which a third-party servicer contracts if that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer is assessed a liability. A third-party servicer, as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible agent of an institution, has an obligation to keep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that institution informed of any developments that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility jeopardize the institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. If the Secretary seeks to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability against an institution for a third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct, he will provide the appropriate notice to the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

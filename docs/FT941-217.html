			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Confusion in shadowy Paris HQ Staff at the Paris headquarters of Cocom, the western export controls body, were in a state of confusion yesterday about whether or not they should pack up and leave. Cocom is due to be wound up today after 47 years, but the fate of its 20 staff is apparently undecided. There was no official word on this from senior officials of the 17 member states meeting in The Hague yesterday to discuss the future of controls on technology exports. 'It is complete confusion here,' said one of the 20 members of the Cocom secretariat, which has long maintained a shadowy existence in a US embassy annexe on Paris's rue de la Boetie. 'No one here knows anything about what will happen', she said, following last November's decision by Cocom member governments to put an end to the organisation 'in its present form' by March 31. The Dutch government chairing the discussions on Cocom's future said yesterday that Cocom members stood by their decision to change the organisation into something less elaborate than the Cold War body which vetted the sale of militarily sensitive technology to the former Warsaw Pact and its allies. But he said there was a consensus in favour of using Cocom's experience to control technology exports to sensitive destinations. There was 'no specifically European position' on this at the Hague meeting attended by officials of 15 Nato allies (11 of them EU members), plus Japan and Australia. Ireland, the EU's only neutral member, attended as an observer, with Sweden, Finland and Austria, Switzerland and New Zealand. EU members wanted to draw on Cocom experience as the basis for common controls on technlogy exported out of their single market. In its final phase, Cocom had become prepared to avow an existence that had earlier been very sensitive to several European governments, particularly those with sizeable communist parties. The predecessors to Cocom's current president, Mr Menno Goedhart, a Dutch official, had, for instance, always been Italian. Successive governments in Rome had always been too embarrassed about their country's membership of Cocom to want to write into their national budget a financial contribution to Cocom's running. So, they preferred to pay in kind by providing the president.</p>

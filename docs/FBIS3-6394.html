Police said the two seamen, one  19 and the other 20, of the Yokosuka U.S. Naval base, were  suspected of attacking an employee of a local public office as  he was returning home around Wednesday midnight.    The 31-year-old victim told police that three black men  approached him on the pretext of asking directions, sprayed him  with a mace-like substance and then punched him in the face.    Police said the two arrested men were among a group of three  persons who fled when they were approached. One of the three  escaped pursuit.    The 20-year-old was identified as Bernard Constantine, a  petty officer, second class. The name of the 19-year-old was  not released because of his status as a minor.    An investigation is continuing to see if the arrested seamen  are linked to two muggings on Wednesday night perpetrated by a  group of three black men.</p>

Secretary Yan Haiwang delivered a speech in which he stated:  Over the past year, all localities as well as People's  Liberation Army [PLA] units stationed across the province have  carried out in a down-to-earth manner activities to build model  two-support cities and counties, with the result that Gansu's  two-support work has made significant headway. Statistics show  that over the past year, more than 400 cadres at the prefectural  level and officers at the division level have personally taken  part in national defense education and propaganda activities.  During the New Year, the Lunar New Year, and the "1 August Army  Day" periods, the provincial authorities sent more than 60  delegations to various border areas and grassroots units across  the province to extend festival greetings, to express  appreciation to officers and soldiers who have been stationed  there for many years, and to help officers and soldiers tackle  problems concerning war preparations, military training,  military maneuvers, and daily life.    Secretary Yan Haiwang went on: Over the past year, though  lacking in funds, the provincial civil affairs department has  managed to allocate some 1.7 million yuan to help demobilized  officers and soldiers resolve problems concerning livelihood,  housing, and medical care; has accepted and resettled some 540  officers who had been transferred to civilian work; and has  secured jobs for more than 100,000 demobilized officers and  soldiers. On the other hand, the PLA units stationed in Gansu  have dispatched more than 800 "cherish-the-people" and  "learn-from-Lei Feng" teams to various localities to provide  assistance to local people. Some 0.45 million officers and  soldiers and more than 9,900 military vehicles have taken part  in the construction of some 130 local projects on different  occasions and have helped build more than 200 public utilities.  The locally stationed PLA troops also have helped deal with  some 190 local emergencies and have provided unreserved disaster  relief to the local people, with the result that more than 3,400  lives and large quantities of public goods and materials were  saved on some 9,200 occasions.    Also attending and speaking at the meeting were Sun Ying,  Yang Huaixiao, and Du Hua, as well as some other provincial  party, government, and military leaders.</p>

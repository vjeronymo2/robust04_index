			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: US media groups in TV shopping deal for Japan Home Shopping Network and Tele-Communications of the US yesterday announced they had set up a joint venture with Sumitomo of Japan to introduce a television shopping channel in Japan. Transmissions are expected to begin within a year. The three companies have signed a letter of intent as a first step towards establishing a television shopping business in Japan similar to those already operating in the US. They said they hoped to involve other big companies in the venture. Home Shopping Network at present operates three cable and broadcast services capable of reaching 60m viewers in the US. It said recently-announced changes in Japanese government policy on television regulation had opened the way to greater openness in cable and direct-to-home distribution. The companies said the channel would be tested soon after a feasibility study.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Appointments: Linread succession Peter Harrisson has been appointed group managing director of Linread, the Birmingham-based nuts and bolts manufacturer, following a boardroom upheaval which has seen two senior departures in the past fortnight. Mike Hughes, the chief executive and Orrie Mead, the former finance director, left following serious problems in Linread's commercial products division. One of the three plants has been closed and the workforce has been cut by 45 per cent to 260; the company's 1991 results will show a loss. Harrisson, 46, joins Linread after 11 years with Davy Corp-oration, where he was chief executive of the mechanical handling division. Like Mike Hughes, who was brought in to revitalise a then loss-making Linread in 1983, Harrisson also spent part of his early career with BTR. After six years which saw profits improve, Linread's recovery came to an abrupt halt last year after faults were identified in the financial reporting system; Linread's 1990 annual report notes that Hughes took direct responsibility for the day-to-day operations. Orrie Mead stepped down from the Linread board last June and was put in charge of the commercial products division. He was replaced as finance director by Pieter Hazenberg. Peter Anderson, a managing director of Newman Tonks engineering, takes over as managing director of commercial products division next week, but is not going on the Linread board. ***** Michael Redmond is appointed md, marketing operations of Fisons' pharmaceutical division; Brian Tempest takes his place as regional director Europe. ***** T&amp;N has promoted Alister McWilliam, currently md of AE Piston Products, to be group chief executive, Piston Products; from July 1 he will be responsible for T&amp;N's worldwide piston activities. ***** J LYONS has appointed Jan Timmer md of Hooimeijer BV. ***** Chuck Pieper has been appointed president and ceo for GE LIGHTING Europe; he was formerly ceo of GE Medical systems-Asia. ***** Michael Harris, chief executive of Mercury Communications, is appointed a director of CABLE &amp; WIRELESS. ***** David Franklin has been promoted to md UK and Scandinavia of MASSEY FERGUSON. ***** Mike Wilkinson has been appointed group personnel director of UNITED BISCUITS. He started his career with UB as a graduate trainee in 1975. ***** BTR has promoted Malcolm Langley to be group md of DCE Group in place of Dick Dodson who is to become group md of Dunlop Slazenger International in South Carolina. Longley's place as md of DCE Ltd is taken by Roger Berkeley, formerly group finance director. ***** Neil Murray has been promoted to financial director of the PG Group, a subsidiary of Ellis &amp; Everard Pool &amp; Leisure International.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Portugal aims to rein back budget deficit THE Portuguese government yesterday unveiled a tough budget for 1993 aimed at reducing its deficit to less than 4 per cent of gross domestic product. Government expenditure will fall in real terms and the public sector be restructured to cut costs and raise productivity. The deficit will be reduced from Esc543bn (Pounds 2.4bn), representing over 5 per cent of GDP in 1992, to Esc488bn next year. This will be achieved without raising taxes but with the help of higher tax revenues due to more efficient tax collection and through a projected 3 per cent growth in the economy. The public sector borrowing requirement will be cut from Esc539bn in 1992 to Esc416bn next year, and the government expects to benefit from lower interest rates. Receipts from privatisations are expected to reach Esc225bn in 1993. Inflation is forecast to come down from just above 9 per cent this year to 5-7 per cent in 1993. To achieve these targets, the government intends to cut back on public services and to contain wage rises sharply. Most ministries will be made to cut recurrent expenditure by 5 per cent. Negotiations with public sector trade unions have begun, with the government offering pay rises of up to 5.5 per cent. This has been rejected outright by the unions which have threatened a general strike if the government does not improve its offer. To soften the blow, the government will spend more on social and health programmes. Investment in infrastructure will also rise, by close to 12 per cent.</p>

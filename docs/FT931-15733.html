			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Sewerage services in Buenos Aires The Argentinian government has awarded the 30-year concession to run Buenos Aires' water supply and sewerage services to the AGUAS ARGENTINAS CONSORTIUM, led by Lyonnalse des Eaux-Dumez. Strategy and documentation for this first water privatisatlon in South America were prepared by Obras Sanitarias De La Nacion (OSN) assisted by a specialist team from UK consultant Halcrow. Unsuccessful bids were made by UK-based consortia headed by Thames Water International Services Holdings and North West Water International, though the Aguas Argentlnas group retains a UK interest through a five per cent Anglian Water stake. The city's water supply services are to be upgraded and expanded. Extensive investment in civil engineering and electromechanical works is expected. Capital investment will include rehahilitation of two water treatment plants serving 2.5m people and 1m people respectively, potable water trunk mains and tunnels and rationalisatlon of the distribution network throughout the city. Sewerage works will include the construction of entirely new sewage treatment facilities to serve a population in excess of 8m, involving screening, primary and secondary treatment. There will also be an extensive upgrading of the sewerage network and new trunk sewers.</p>

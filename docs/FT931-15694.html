			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Japanese companies 'feel overstaffed' MANY Japanese companies believe they are overstaffed, according to an official survey published yesterday, raising the possibility that the Japanese social contract based on lifetime employment could come under strain. The survey of 18 industries, conducted last month by the Ministry of Labour, found that the steel, electrical appliances, securities and information service industries felt that they had too many staff on their payrolls. This mounting concern about overstaffing marks a significant shift in Japanese employers' attitudes. Six months ago, most employers were concerned that Japan's slowing birthrate was creating a structural labour shortage by reducing the rate of growth of the labour force to less than 1 per cent a year. However, senior officials at the ministry believe some companies may soon be forced into taking drastic action to cut employment costs, including compulsory retirement programmes for older workers, if the economic downturn persists beyond the first three months of the year. This raises the prospects of more Japanese companies in hard-pressed sectors such as electronics following the lead of companies such as Pioneer, the audio equipment maker, which recently announced plans for the early retirement of a small group of managers over the age of 50. Although moves such as Pioneer's may make only a small dent in employment costs, they send a powerful message to younger workers that their future security is no longer automatically guaranteed. Over the past few months most Japanese companies have deployed a variety of measures to reduce employment costs without resorting to redundancies, including cutting bonuses and overtime hours, freezing recruitment and laying off part-time workers. However, with most companies facing their third year of declining profits, many are under pressure to improve profitability through a more aggressive approach to cutting employment costs. Nevertheless Japanese companies are not about to adopt western methods of management which can involve sharp cuts in employment to reduce costs during a recession.</p>

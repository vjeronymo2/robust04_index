			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INTEREST IN REDEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Your article on the North Hollywood Redevelopment District (April 8) was very  informative. The article pointed out the lack of interest by the community, so  I called the Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> I was informed that I would be able to attend the monthly advisory meetings but  that under CRA rules, I am ineligible to become a member of the board because  my home lies five blocks outside the boundaries of the redevelopment district.  </P> <P> The official I spoke with also suggested I was misinterpreting the article as  to the lack of community support. She said at least 25 people attend each  meeting.  </P> <P> Judging from this conversation, this is certainly an example of the  inflexibility of the CRA and its advisory committee in meeting the needs of the  community it is supposed to be serving. I plan to attend the next meeting in  May and hope that one day I will have a voice in the direction my neighborhood  is taking. But I believe that the CRA should encourage participation by all  residents, not those that fit in their rules.  </P> <P> SUSAN A. LEVY  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Attorney-general urges quicker trials - Fraud Cases SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, the attorney-general, yesterday called for speedier justice in fraud trials. In the Commons he said that recent cases involving Blue Arrow and Guinness had lasted 'far too long'. Mr John Morris, the shadow attorney-general, suggested that Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, should ask the Lord Chief Justice to set up a committee of judges and barristers to consider changes in court procedure and, if necessary, amending legislation. Mr Morris said juries were 'unequalled in deciding dishonesty', but the burden being imposed upon them by lengthy trials was becoming unfair. He questioned why there had to be such a large number of charges and, sometimes, of defendants, as well as long opening speeches and insufficient identification of the issues for the jury until nearly the end of the trial. Sir Patrick, who strongly defended the prosecution authorities, said the lord chancellor would 'heed' the views expressed by Mr Morris. He stressed that in the Blue Arrow case there had been only one charge, yet comment upon it had included an assertion that there had been a 'scattergun' approach by the Serious Fraud Office. Sir Patrick said there had been five charges in the Guinness II trial, and that in none of the most recent 20 cases had there been more than 22 charges. Some charges had been alternatives and every effort had been made to bring matters into 'clear focus'. Sir Patrick added that Mrs Edna Wijeratna, leader of the jury in the second Guinness trial, had indicated in a letter in yesterday's Financial Times that the prosecution had made 'a very good job of identifying the structure of the case'. Backbenchers from both sides of the Commons warned last night that changing MPs working hours to ensure that the main business of the day is concluded by 10 pm could result in 'making life easy' for the government. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the House, confirmed that no changes will be introduced before the general election.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SEWER GLITCH FORCES CAMPERS TO ROUGH IT  </P> <P> Visitors to the McGrath State Beach campgrounds in Oxnard this weekend may be  getting away from civilization a little more than they had hoped.  </P> <P> Sewer problems earlier in the week shut down toilets and showers, and they are  expected to stay off for about 10 more days, said Jeff Price, chief ranger for  the Channel Coast District.  </P> <P> Fresh drinking water is still available.  </P> <P> About 15 portable toilets have been placed at the campgrounds, but visitors  have not taken kindly to them. Many campers, who have been looking forward to  escaping the smog and inhaling fresh ocean air are annoyed by the toilets'  chemical smell and have complained, Price said.  </P> <P> To appease visitors, the park is refunding $6 off the regular $12 nightly  camping rate. Full refunds will be given to people who have made reservations  but decide to cancel.  </P> <P> All 174 sites at the campground have been reserved for this weekend, and  officials are expecting about 750 people.  </P> <P> "It seems people like to camp out but not having flushable toilets is, I guess,  a little too primitive for some," Price said. "One woman won't let her children  use the portable toilets because she's afraid they'll fall in." Another woman,  he said, threw her hairbrush at a ranger's car "when she found out she couldn't  wash her hair."  </P> <P> "We understand that a lot of people are frustrated," Price said. "Some of them  have been planning on spending their vacation here for a long time and this is  really getting on their nerves." MAJA RADEVICH  </P></p>

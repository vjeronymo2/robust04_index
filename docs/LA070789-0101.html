			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ST. LAURENT STOCK OFFERING HALTED; IT'S TOO FASHIONABLE  </P> <P> The flotation of shares in French fashion legend Yves Saint Laurent was  postponed Thursday after so many would-be investors rushed to buy a stake that  the offering was oversubscribed.  </P> <P> The shares offered in Groupe Yves Saint Laurent, the first French fashion house  to seek a stock exchange listing, were more than 250 times oversubscribed,  broker Francois Dufour-Kervern said.  </P> <P> The issue, representing slightly more than 10% of YSL's share capital, was  rescheduled for Monday.  </P> <P> The offer price of $133 would remain, but investors would be required to place  deposits equal to the number of shares requested to prevent speculative bids,  Dufour-Kervern said.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have put in for 100 times what they wanted, and there will be  a lot of withdrawals next week," one British analyst predicted.  </P> <P> But Thursday's enthusiastic reception was a good start for company Chairman  Pierre Berge's decidedly cautious venture on the Bourse, carefully publicized  beforehand with full page advertisements in French and international  newspapers.  </P> <P> Berge hopes to protect the company from takeover bids and avoid the kind of  bitter power battle seen at luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.  </P> <P> "I was directly inspired by what had happened at LVMH," Berge said in a recent  interview. "LVMH for me was an example of how not to do things, and I studied  what had happened there in order to do exactly the opposite."  </P> <P> LVMH's ambitious new chairman, Bernard Arnault, is admired as a brilliant  financier, but some doubt his ability to safeguard the group's reputation for  quality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Industry Changing  </P> <P> "In general, raiders are financiers who don't know anything about our  profession and don't understand the culture of the luxury products profession,"  Berge said.  </P> <P> The YSL flotation is regarded as a sign of things to come in the increasingly  competitive French fashion world. Family-run fashion houses are being rapidly  bought out by entrepreneurs with their eyes on exploiting their reputations  more profitably.  </P> <P> The special structure adopted allows Berge to choose a successor to himself and  to Yves Saint Laurent, whose creative work is the inspiration behind the  company.  </P> <P> Berge and Saint Laurent have worked together since 1961, when the young  designer emerged from under the mantle of his mentor, the late Christian Dior.  </P> <P> The 52-year-old Saint Laurent, who has reportedly been quite ill lately, is  still the undisputed king of French fashion, although 85% of the $406-million  sales last year were in perfumes.  </P> <P> The YSL group, which had a 1988 net profit of $9 million, has been undergoing  reorganization since buying back most of its perfumes business from U.S.-based  Charles of the Ritz in 1986.  </P> <P> But it needs the cash from the flotation and from a recent $187-million capital  increase to cover debts incurred by buying out most of the YSL stake held by  Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti.  </P> <P> Benedetti's holding company Cerus cut its 49.9% stake in YSL to 15% in June.  </P> <P> YSL aims to use the new injection of cash to strengthen its international  presence, particularly in North America and Southeast Asia. Accessories are  another priority, with a range of new boutiques planned in Paris, New York and  other capitals.  </P></p>

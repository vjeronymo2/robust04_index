			<p>BFN     [Text] The Easter break will be a short one as far as the  politicians are concerned. Silvio Berlusconi has retreated to  his villa at Maccherio; Umberto Bossi has gone to Ponte di  Legno; Gianfranco Fini has gone to Anzio; Achille Occhetto has  gone to Monchiano in the Maremma area of Tuscany. The leaders  will rest for a further 24 hours before returning to Rome on  Tuesday [5 April].    On Wednesday, there will be a fresh round of meetings in  order to form a government -- a task which has proved to be more  difficult than at first thought. Bossi has said that he does  not want Berlusconi to be the prime minister and once again he  has stressed his federalist demands. He is also threatening to  boycott the government, and to this end he has set up a number  of meetings with the electoral losers. Fini has warned Bossi  not to make too many demands; Berlusconi is keeping quiet but  the Forza Italia clubs have asked for Bossi's loyalty. The  strategies at the center of the Freedom Alliance seem to be  diverging. Giuseppe Mazzei reports:    [Mazzei] Victory was easy, but government is more difficult  for the center-right coalition. It now emerges that the losers  have also rejoined the game. Who would have thought it?    The Alliance enjoys a big majority in the Chamber of  Deputies  and has practically put a working majority together in the  Senate; everything seemed clear. Five years of stable  government under the leadership of the victor, Silvio  Berlusconi. However, Bossi has taken it upon himself to wreck  the party; he has taken center stage away from Berlusconi,  claimed it for himself, and is seeking to keep Fini out of the  game altogether. He is scared that his influence will wane in  any long-term government, and so he is brandishing his sword:  federalism now, coupled with constitutional changes, and in one  year's time, according to Gianfranco Miglio's reckoning, Italy  will be transformed into another country.    On this point nobody can attack Bossi, and so he plays his  trump card; in order to win he is prepared to ally himself with  the devil. He wants to hold talks with Mario Segni and even with  the left. For Occhetto and his friends, who are still in shock  at the election defeat, Umberto the Terrible could offer an  escape route. He will tell them that, if they do not want five  years of unassailable center-right government, they should form  an alliance for federalism with him. A constituent government  would be formed, and a fresh election would be called within a  year.    For the losers this will be a temptation hard to resist. The  chess match has still to get under way.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS AND DODGERS / A LOOK BACK;  </P> <P> TROUBLE IS, 91 WINS HAVE WAY OF CLOUDING PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Ninety-one Angel victories: Accomplishment . . . or anesthetic?  </P> <P> Despite appearances to the contrary during their last 10 games, the Angels  insist they haven't been lulled by a season that far exceeded spring  expectations, a season that bettered their 1988 finish by 16 victories and  resulted in the third-best record in the franchise's history.  </P> <P> "We have to make some changes," owner Gene Autry says.  </P> <P> Executive Vice President Mike Port says: "I don't think any of us is  satisfied."  </P> <P> And then there's this from Manager Doug Rader: "If we were good enough, we  wouldn't go through the (slumps) we did this year. I really do think we rose  above most occasions and got through some difficult times, but we've been very  streaky both ways.  </P> <P> "When a team is streaky, that shows inconsistency. And that kind of  inconsistency suggests that you may not be as good as you'd like to be."  </P> <P> What the Angels' 1989 season should be remembered for -- and, really, nothing  more -- is a restoration of the team's self-respect. That, in itself, was a  substantial undertaking, considering the malaise that took hold during  consecutive 75-87 seasons, Cookie Ball and the ignominious 12-game  season-closing losing streak of 1988.  </P> <P> But at 91-71, the Angels still placed third in the American League West, still  finished eight games behind the Oakland Athletics and still require more than a  few alterations if they are to resist backsliding in baseball's best division  in 1990.  </P> <P> The rotation, which produced three 15-game winners and rookie-of-the-year  candidate Jim Abbott, needs another pitcher.  </P> <P> The bullpen, which featured Bryan Harvey with 25 saves, Greg Minton with a 2.20  earned-run average and Bob McClure at 1.55, needs at least one more proven  hand, preferably a short-relief specialist.  </P> <P> The offense, which led the American League with 145 home runs, needs to add a  30-home run, 100-runs batted in threat and, at long last, locate a legitimate,  and willing, leadoff hitter.  </P> <P> "We cannot stand pat," Port says. "Candidly, 90 wins -- despite some good  individual performances -- wasn't what we were collectively shooting for.  Finishing where we did, we still have some ground to cover.  </P> <P> ". . . We have to look for ways to improve our run production and I wouldn't  say we would shy away from any additional pitching."  </P> <P> In many ways, the Angels' success in 1989 was a mirage. The Eastern Division  was badly depressed and the Angels got fat against that division, going 50-34  without having to play either Toronto or Baltimore after July 18. Oakland was  riddled by injuries. And the heart of the Angel revival -- starting pitching --  hinged on four of the club's five starters playing out best-case scenarios:  </P> <P>  -- Bert Blyleven goes 17-5.  </P> <P>  -- Chuck Finley wins 16 games and makes the All-Star team.  </P> <P>  -- Kirk McCaskill avoids injury all year and wins 15 games.  </P> <P>  -- Jim Abbott makes the big club, stays there all summer and, poised and  professional, chips in with 12 victories.  </P> <P> Back in March, who could have predicted any of it?  </P> <P> And who knows if any of them can do it again?  </P> <P> Only Mike Witt and his 9-15 record fell below expectations. But this was hardly  a stunning development, considering how Witt's record and ERA have  progressively worsened since 1986. In the last four years, Witt has gone from  18 wins to 16 to 13 to nine. Over the same span, his ERA has swelled from 2.84  to 4.01 to 4.15 to 4.54.  </P> <P> No wonder the Angels have a keen interest in Mark Langston, the soon-to-be  $10-million free agent.  </P> <P> Offensively, the Angels are in a quandary. They finished first in the league in  home runs and featured three regulars batting better than .280, but they also  led the league in strikeouts, were 12th in runs scored, 12th in RBIs and last  in walks.  </P> <P> It is a strange batting order. With the possible exception of first baseman  Wally Joyner, every member of the regular lineup lacks one important dimension.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- Johnny Ray. He led the team with a .289 batting average and drove in 62  runs. But he can't run and is barely adequate in the field.  </P> <P>  -- Jack Howell. He hit 20 home runs, second most on the team. But he batted  just .228 with a looping swing that produced 125 strikeouts and can send him  into a black hole for weeks at a time.  </P> <P>  -- Dick Schofield. He remains one of the slickest fielding shortstops in the  majors. But he still doesn't hit -- .228 with 26 RBIs -- and now his durability  has become a question.  </P> <P>  -- Lance Parrish. He added 17 home runs and received credit for calling a more  aggressive game behind the plate. But he batted just .238, drove in just 50  runs and struck out 104 times. And, as always, there's his back trouble.  </P> <P>  -- Chili Davis. He was named the team's co-MVP, with Blyleven, after leading  the club with 22 home runs and 90 RBIs. But he, too, struck out 108 times and  remains a liability in the field.  </P> <P>  -- Devon White. He made the All-Star team and stole a career-high 44 bases.  But he also led the club with 129 strikeouts, continues to balk at the leadoff  assignment and plunged in the second half to a season-ending .245 average.  </P> <P>  -- Claudell Washington. His .273 average and 13 home runs were pluses. But his  RBI total of 42 was that of a part-time outfielder and his numerous absences  from the lineup became a burden down the stretch.  </P> <P>  -- Brian Downing. His .283 batting average was his best in a decade. But a  chronic rib cage injury hampers his power stroke, resulting in just 14 home  runs -- his lowest full-season total since 1979.  </P> <P> Add in that only White and Washington reached double figures in stolen bases  and you have a team that has trouble manufacturing runs when home runs are  absent.  </P> <P> What to do?  </P> <P> With the free-agent field sorely lacking in power-hitting, run-producing types,  the Angels might be better off bidding for Langston -- or a second-tier  free-agent pitcher, such as Storm Davis -- and packaging their pitching surplus  (i.e. Witt) and their second-base surplus (i.e. Ray) for one of several  disgruntled sluggers who figure to be shopped this winter.  </P> <P> Cleveland's Joe Carter wants out of Ohio, Cincinnati's Eric Davis and the New  York Mets' Darryl Strawberry both have eyes for Southern California and Kansas  City's Danny Tartabull could be elsewhere by spring training.  </P> <P> To acquire a hitter of such standing, the Angels would have to part with a lot,  and Port ranks among the most cautious traders on the planet. He prefers safe  and sound deals, parceling off a bunch of prospects for a veteran -- a la his  acquisitions of Blyleven, Parrish and Ray.  </P> <P> But to keep pace in the Western Division, where the Canseco-McGwire-Eckersley  A's are making dynastic noises, the Angels have to make an impact move this  off-season. Better yet, two of them.  </P> <P> In 1989, the Angels rediscovered how it felt to win again. They contended. They  came close. Now they need to take the next leap.  </P> <P> For Mike Port, the time to roll the dice is now.  </P></p>

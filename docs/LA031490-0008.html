			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> SENTENCING SET IN SEXUAL ASSAULT  </P> <P> A Ventura Superior Court judge has set April 13 for the sentencing of an avowed  white supremacist from Simi Valley who was convicted of sexually assaulting and  beating a friend of his estranged wife.  </P> <P> Guy Leroy Pederson, 29, will face a maximum sentence of 69 years in prison,  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> A jury found him guilty of 10 felony counts, including eight counts of forcible  sexual assault. Judge Lawrence Storch will impose the sentence.  </P> <P> Prosecutors argued that Pederson repeatedly assaulted a 26-year-old Silver  Strand Beach woman in her apartment to retaliate against his estranged wife,  whom he thought had burglarized his home and taken his gun.  </P> <P> The defense admitted that Pederson struck the woman once but denied the sexual  assaults.  </P> <P> During pretrial hearings, Pederson acknowledged that he is a white supremacist.  </P> <P> His first attorney was allowed to withdraw from the case after being threatened  by anonymous telephone callers who said he would be harmed if Pederson was not  acquitted.  </P></p>

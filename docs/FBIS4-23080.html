			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznetsov] </F> <H5>  It is Just as Important That We Know How to Decommission Them </H5>   [Text] ``Do not shut down any more reactors for any  reason!'' pleaded Victor Mikhaylov, head of the Russian  Federation's Ministry of Atomic Energy, during an interview  published in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He is, of course, aware that  six reactors already stand idle on the territory of the former  Soviet Union, including:     -  reactor 1 at the Metsamor nuclear power plant, idle since  February 25, 1989, and reactor 2, idle since March 18, 1989;    -  reactor 1 at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, idle since  August 6, 1984, and reactor 2, idle since August 29, 1990;    -  reactors 1 and 2 at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant, idle  since September 10, 1981, and September 10, 1989, respectively.    -  Sixteen other reactor systems, including research reactors as  well as critical and subcritical test reactors, are also being  shut down.       The development of nuclear energy worldwide is closely  regulated by the domestic nuclear policies of individual nations  and by international law. Russia, however, although it regulates  the design, start-up, and operation of its nuclear power plants,  has no guidelines for decommissioning them. In a number of  cases, this means delays in proceeding with the dismantling of  plants that are currently in safe storage.    Meanwhile, since 1979, the Commission of the European  Community has been assisting the international community in  coordinating its efforts to resolve problems associated with  decommissioning nuclear power plants. The commission establishes  and finances from its general fund five-year research programs  geared towards safety issues and protection from radiation  during nuclear facility decommissioning.    Between 1979 and 1993, the CEC sponsored three programs for  a  total of 93.8 million European currency units (in December 1993,  1 ECU equaled 1.11 dollars), and 126 program-related contracts  were drawn up.    Programs administered by the International Atomic Energy  Agency have established data bases on handling radioactive  wastes and safely transporting radioactive materials.    In Japan, the RAN-DEC (Research Association for Nuclear  Facility Decommissioning) was founded to study ways to safely  dismantle obsolete nuclear facilities.    In 1979, the Technical Information Center was established at  the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to  provide information on the dismantling and decontamination of  nuclear facilities.    And what is happening with the four idle reactors we now  have  in Russia? At the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, work is  being done to complete the radiation survey of the equipment and  structures (the work is about 70% complete), to develop  experimental technologies for reprocessing radioactive wastes,  and to decontaminate and dismantle the equipment. Spent nuclear  fuel is completely removed and stored on site due to problems  associated with transporting the containers and with the Mayak  production association's (Chelyabinsk-65) refusal to take  delivery of the fuel.    The first and second reactors of the Beloyarsk nuclear power  plant, which are uranium-graphite RBMK-type reactors, were shut  down because their critical components had reached the end of  their rated service life and no longer complied with modern  safety standards, and because they are not slated for  reconditioning.    Beloyarsk-1 was shut down clear back in 1981. All of the  fuel  assemblies have been completely removed from the reactor. No  more than 180 kg of fuel (measured with the gamma method, or 130  kg if the neutron method is used) remains in the form of  ``spillage'' scattered throughout the reactor's pressure vessel  lining. The reactor power control, active ventilation, and  energy conservation systems are still running.    Beloyarsk-2 was shut down in September 1989. Removal of the  spent fuel assemblies is nearing completion. Emissions of  radionuclides into the unit's ventilation system are lower than  levels detectable by the original monitoring equipment.    The plant's spent-fuel pools hold 4990 spent fuel assemblies  in casks designed for ``dry'' storage. Because the seals of some  of the containers have lost their integrity, uranium sometimes  comes in direct contact with the cooling water, the  radioactivity of which has increased 1.6-fold over the last  three years. Technical safety requirements for storing spent  fuel and handling radioactive wastes are not being observed.    Unfortunately, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy has pretty  much left reactor decommissioning up to local authorities,  resulting in missed objectives and unfinished work. Moreover,  inspections by federal agencies have turned up violations of  nuclear power safety practices and procedures, and, as a result,  further decommissioning work has been suspended at the Beloyarsk  nuclear plant until safe and proper working conditions are  restored.    Beginning sometime between the years 2000 and 2005, most of  the reactors at Russia's nuclear power plants will begin  decommissioning, to wit: reactors 1 and 2 at the Kola nuclear  power plant; reactors 3 and 4 at Novovoronezh; reactors 1-4 at  Bilibino; and reactors 1 and 2 at Leningrad. Regardless of the  reasons for decommissioning, it is an inevitable stage in the  service life of a nuclear power plant. Therefore, it is  necessary to formulate a comprehensive policy for  decommissioning nuclear power plants, and this can only be  accomplished with a great deal of theoretical and experimental  information. The current inability to understand this or move  this work forward will only cause additional problems for future  generations.</p>

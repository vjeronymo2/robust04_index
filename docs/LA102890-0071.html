			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD GOTHIC by David J. Skal (W. W. Norton: $39.95). "I am . . . Dracula,"  Bela Lugosi announced to the world as only he could in Todd Browning's 1931  vampire epic, and the Hollywood horror film was born.  </P> <P> But, as author Skal points out in this witty, comprehensive look at "the  tangled web of Dracula from novel to stage to screen," the lure of the vampire  began before Bela and bids fair to continue on long after his passing. Skal  introduces us to Bram Stoker, the book's muddled author, and Florence, the  protective widow who became obsessed with systematically destroying all copies  of "Nosferatu," the classic German vampire film. He tells us how the  46-year-old Hungarian actor (shown above with Dorothy Peterson in a 1927 stage  production) who spoke negligible English both got the role and later became a  prisoner of it. For those who take Halloween seriously, this is something to  gnaw on long after those trick-or-treaters are gone. Kenneth Turan.  </P></p>

The delegation, led by deputy chief of the Chinese  Council for International Trade Development, Ye Peng, will meet  private and public sector economists.    The trade balance between the two countries is still in  China's favor. Jordan's imports of Chinese goods surged from  $29 million in 1991 to $53 million in 1992. Jordanian exports  to China, mainly potash, rose from $18 million in 1990 to 32.5  million dinars [as heard] in 1991.</p>

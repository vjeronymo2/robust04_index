			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Raine shares fall 12% as Pounds 13.1m slips below forecast Shares in Raine fell 12 per cent to 57p yesterday as the housebuilding and construction group reported annual profits at the bottom of market expectations. It also made cautious comments over its US housing and UK contracting businesses. Although pre-tax profits advanced 21.6 per cent to Pounds 13.14m (Pounds 10.81m) for the year to June 30, City analysts had been forecasting profits towards Pounds 13.5m. Turnover showed little growth, coming out only 2 per cent ahead at Pounds 456.5m (Pounds 446.2m). UK housebuilding provided the main source of profits. It increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 12.6m) at the operating level, on turnover 2 per cent up at Pounds 206.79m (Pounds 202.29m). The number of houses sold by the group's Hassall Homes division rose by 7 per cent to 1,985. The average selling price also rose, from Pounds 68,020 in 1993 to Pounds 70,220. The company is forecasting an increase to Pounds 80,000 in 1995, although this would in part reflect a move towards building more 'middle market homes'. Hall &amp; Tawse, which provides housing to local authorities, increased its completions rate by 23 per cent to 1,329 homes. Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the contracting market had been squeezed by higher supplier prices and industry overcapacity. This had put intense pressure on margins. 'We believe we are at the bottom of the cycle and expect some recovery to show through to the balance sheet in 1996,' he said. Operating profits declined from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 429,000 on turnover up 2 per cent to Pounds 249.7m (Pounds 243.9m). The company was also taking steps to shed its Californian housebuilding business. Mr Parkin said investment in the region of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m would be required over the next two or three years in order to make it more saleable. He expected it to fetch in excess of its net assets of Dollars 55m. Earnings per share rose from 4.34p to 4.66p. The final dividend is 2p (1p), maintaining a total dividend of 3p. COMMENT Given the continued difficulties in its UK contracting and Californian businesses, Raine is looking to its UK housebuilding business to grow profits. But here, too, a sprightly start to the year has been marked by a slowdown in sales, particularly since the latest rise in interest rates. The market's fearful response to this prognosis left the shares trailing at 57p yesterday. The high yield and a net asset value of 64p should provide some support from here. But the upside looks equally limited. On a prospective eps of 6.4p for 1996, the shares are on a p/e of nine times, at a discount to the market but well ahead of the likes of Barratt and Beazer.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Know what I mean? Sir, It was surprise and pleasure that I took notice the headlines, 'Japan agrees stimulus deal' (February 9) and 'Nato agrees air strike threat' (February 10). Now, I had regarded myself the only one who thought badly prepositions and proposed that they be done. These pesky words are a disgrace the language. They are susceptible misuse everyone, and frequently get the way comprehension. We do not have to put this confusion. By dropping them our vocabularies, we see how easy it is get one's meaning and make do less space well; and I will argue vigorously anyone who disagrees me. Their elimination also allows one dispense the cumbersome rule that one should never make use a preposition end a sentence. Keep the good work] Long, I trust, I shall be able think pleasure and admiration the famous soliloquy Hamlet: 'Be or not be, that is the question.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tsou and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Paris, June 10 (CNA) -- French Engineering  conglomerate the Bouygues Group is interested in tapping the  Taiwan and Asian markets through cooperation with Taiwan  counterparts, a firm spokesman said Thursday [9 June].    Michel Derbesse, managing director of Bouygues' Construction  Engineering Department, said in an interview that his company is  seeking appropriate partners in Asia to explore the dynamic  Asian regional [words indistinct].    Bouygues, [words indistinct] leader in infrastructure  engineering technology, boasted an annual business turnover of  US$14 billion last year. The company recently completed  construction of the Channel Tunnel linking France and Britain  using its self- developed plate drilling machines.    The French engineering giant entered the Asian market a few  years ago. Its recent achievements in the area include a  colossal open- air all-purpose stadium in Hong Kong, and a new  city in Thailand which is regarded as an engineering marvel.    Bouygues is also a veteran builder of nuclear power plants.  Commenting on the recent controversy over the proposed fourth  nuclear power plant in Taiwan, Derbesse said France had also  experienced similar problems. Opposition, however, died away  gradually as the people were convinced of the safety of the  plants.    Derbesse said Bouygues volunteered its technical assistance  to the Chernobyl nuclear plant after the plant exploded in 1986.    Michel Demarre, manager of the company's Asian operations,  said that Taiwan can serve as a springboard to other markets in  the Asia- Pacific region. Demarre added that he hopes Bouygues  can begin business in Taiwan by working on projects related to  the Six-Year National Development Plan.    Demarre said Bouygues is ready to offer its services in  freeway, bridge, tunnel and seaport development, and in other  fields including oil drilling on seabeds, water treatment,  telecommunications, industrial pollution prevention, foodstuff  processing, and motion picture and television film production.</p>

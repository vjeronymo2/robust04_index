			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yijun: "Overseas Financing Now Crucial to Pudong"] </F>   [Text] With the country facing a shortage of capital,  foreign investment is becoming more crucial in the development  of the Pudong New Area in east Shanghai, a senior government  official said recently.    According to Kang Huijun, director of the Pudong Economic  and  Trade Bureau, by the end of last year, Pudong had attracted  foreign investment of $3.27 billion, 28 per cent more than all  domestic investment.    By the end of last month, Pudong had registered 1,831  foreign-funded projects, more than half of all those in the new  area.    "If there weren't a lot of foreign funds flowing into the  new  area, it would be impossible for Pudong to ensure rapid economic  growth," said Kang.    Kang also said that since the foreign-funded enterprises are  established according to international practices, they will  speed up the formation of a modern enterprise management system  in Pudong.    According to Kang, Pudong has become the top place in China  for foreign enterprises to invest.    Kang said Pudong approved 924 foreign-funded enterprises  last  year, and they involved foreign investment of $1.73 billion.    This year, Pudong will mainly attract investments from  transnational corporations, according to Kang.    By the end of last year, 32 transnationals had invested in  Pudong.    This year, the new area will strengthen the relationship  with  the top 102 transnationals in the United States and the top 100  in Europe.    Kang expects nearly 20 multinational corporations to invest  in Pudong.    Kang also said more and more foreign enterprises in Pudong  will deal in service industries.    By the end of last year, nearly 42 percent of Pudong's  foreign-funded corporations were engaged in service trades.    This year Pudong will focus on developing foreign-funded  banks, insurance companies and finance companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Peace Commission [Copaz] has decided not to  include the subject of the Truth Commission with international  verification in the dialogue with the URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] due to resume within the next few days.    Copaz President Hector Rosada Granados has explained  publicly  the opposition among various sectors within the Army to include  this topic in the talks; therefore, it will be left pending for  a future opportunity. Deputy Clodoveo Dominguez, a retired  military officer, stated this comment this morning.    [Begin Domiguez recording] The Truth Commission is a  commission that, if it were to be formed, should be more within  the legal framework rather than a political framework. The  political framework will only serve to stir things up and seek  confrontation between the various political trends and sectors;  thus, none of the sectors or the Guatemalan people have anything  to gain from such a strong confrontation, as was seen in the  past in Argentina and more recently in El Salvador.    If the Truth Commission really serves to heal wounds and  identify, within the framework of the law, those who in the past  have harmed the country, then the commission is correct. If  what is sought instead are ways to reopen wounds and cause the  Guatemalan people to shed blood again, we must be very careful.  [end recording]</p>

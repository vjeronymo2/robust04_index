Director of the research institute of nuclear reactors in  the  city of Dmitrovgrad on the Volga Valentin Ivanov told TASS that  this is the usual way his institute transports radioactive  sources to Moscow.    "We usually transport to the capital similar radioactive  sources in ordinary passenger trains and we had never received  any complaints because they pose no danger to human health", he  said.    "Today the usual way of deliveries of sources of isotopes  was  disurpted for unknown reasons and was proclaimed criminal. This  is an unpleasant misunderstanding", the director said hoping  that his courier would be allowed to continue the trip.</p>

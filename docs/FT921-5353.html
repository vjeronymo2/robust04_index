			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Backstage anger as leaders clash over NHS - Prime Minister's Questions FRAYING TEMPERS and mounting campaign fatigue were clearly in evidence at Westminster yesterday as the party leaders again clashed over the National Health Service and party officials traded insults over behind-the-scenes smear stories. At what many MPs believed would be the third-last prime minister's question time before the general election, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, tried to link alleged underfunding of the NHS with widely anticipated Budget tax cuts. Quoting a consultant cardiologist at Guy's Trust Hospital, he said that doctors were now turning away patients on the grounds that funding for their operations was unavailable. Mr Kinnock went on to charge the prime minister with planning to borrow for tax cuts when the voters' wanted available resources spent on health and other public services. 'You want to bribe. They want to build. Why don't you listen to them?' he asked, to a chorus of cheers from the Opposition backbenches. Mr John Major responded angrily that while the Conservatives had raised NHS spending beyond the rates promised in the 1987 Labour manifesto, his opponent still refused to reveal how much he would spend on health. 'Your priorities do not add up and you know it,' he told the Labour leader. 'You can't put a cost on your compassion for it is bogus.' The exchange came after Labour had launched a fresh assault on the Tories by publishing an opinion poll on attitudes to the Tory record along with forecasts purporting to illustrate how living standards would deteriorate if the Conservatives won a fourth term. The attack was immediately undermined by the revelation that one key figure was wrong. The claim that 79 per cent of those polled believed their financial situation had got worse over the last 13 years had been subtitled with the slogan Conservative Britain: they'll never get it right. In fact, to Labour's embarrassment, the figure was a misprint that should have read 39 per cent - provoking a jubilant Conservative Central Office to charge their rivals with running a gaffe-ridden campaign. Fewer than one in three staff in tax offices say they will vote for the Conservative party at the coming election, according to a survey by the Inland Revenue Staff Federation. Some 45 per cent of a 1,000-member poll, carried out by Mori, said they would vote Labour, 31 per cent Conservative and 19 per cent Liberal Democrat. IRSF officers believe the figures represent a marked shift towards the opposition parties.</p>

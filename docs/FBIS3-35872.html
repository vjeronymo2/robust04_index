Myechyslaw Hryb Has  Been Elected Chairman of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet"]    [Text] Commenting on his departure, Stanislav Shushkevich,  former speaker of the Belarusian parliament, said: "I am not  acceptable to the majority in this parliament. They do not want  to form a new society, the majority of the present deputies want  to go back to the old ways. I still do not understand how I  managed to become head of the Supreme Soviet at all. The  communist majority suffered a tremendous shock in the fall of  1991 and my election was a great stroke of luck, not an  objective inevitability."    At the same time some local observers see several reasons  for  what happened. Specifically that there was no centrist group in  the Belarusian parliament, that it was split between an  overwhelming majority and a small opposition, and that the  parliament which is unprofessional in status has become an  adjunct of the executive.    Be that as it may, last Friday [28 January] the Belarusian  parliament got a new leader -- Mechyslaw Hryb. Contrary to the  predictions of many observers, who thought that parliament would  take a long time over the election of a new speaker, this  election took just two days. Consultations were held in the  groups and factions on 27 January, and on the morning of 28  January the Supreme Soviet Presidium put Mechyslaw Hryb to the  deputies as a candidate. Of course, the parliamentarians did  not agree to uncontested elections. The list of nominations for  the secret ballot included the candidacies of People's Deputies  Viktor Hanchar and Mikhail Marinich. Even though none of the  contenders managed to obtain the 174 votes necessary for  election in the first round, hardly anyone was in any doubt that  Hryb would win. Incidentally, the left-wing parliamentary  majority gambled on him. They were not wrong. In round two  Hryb received 183 votes against 55.    The new speaker is 56 years old. He hails from the village  of Savichi, which is in Grodno Oblast's Dyatlovskiy Rayon. His  father died in the war. In 1959 he graduated from the Interior  Ministry's Fire-Fighting Technical School in Lvov. He served in  the organs of the Interior Ministry where he rose to the rank of  lieutenant general and chief of the Vitebsk Oblast Soviet  Executive Committee's Internal Affairs Administration. In 1990  Mechyslaw Hryb was elected a Belarusian people's deputy. He  headed the parliamentary commission on questions of national  security, defense, and the fight against crime. He is a  supporter of a strong authority and advocates the introduction  of the presidency. He supported the ratification of the CIS  Collective Security Treaty, which led to serious frictions with  Stanislav Shushkevich.    At his first news conference following the election,  Myechyslaw Hryb told journalists that he sees his main task as  the consolidation of all the forces in parliament. "I have no  other program to extricate the republic from the crisis than  that which was adopted by our Supreme Soviet and government," he  said. "I do not believe that there should be any adjustments to  our foreign policy course. Belarus will remain a sovereign,  independent state, will strive for non-nuclear status and  neutrality, and will conscientiously fulfill all previously  signed treaties and agreements."    Myechyslaw Hryb's election as chairman of the Belarus  Supreme  Soviet has been unambiguously assessed by many observers as a  victory for the left-wing forces in Belarus. In their opinion  this may have quite a powerful impact on the republic's foreign  policy and in particular could introduce ideological aspects to  it. After all, voices have already been raised in parliament on  several occasions calling for "opposition to the West" and its  influence. As for relations with the eastern neighbor, they will  most probably become even closer.</p>

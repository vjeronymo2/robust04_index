			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / International Company News: Eastern German distribution group to be privatised THE FORMER biggest distributor of electrical equipment, tools and materials to east German industry is to go on sale this week, at a price expected to be over DM150m (Dollars 98.60m). At this level, which is based on previous deals involving purchases of European building products wholesalers, it would make the price paid one of the biggest for a privatisation in the former communist-controlled republic. Maschinenbau-und Technikhandel (MBH), which once had a turnover of DM10bn, has been slimmed down substantially and now concentrates mainly on selling tools and components to the region's fast-growing construction industry. Sales last year were DM436m from 65 outlets in 32 cities, making it easily the region's biggest wholesaler of building products. These include lighting and electrical supplies, plumbing, heating and sanitary equipment as well as woodworking and metalworking tools and accessories. Competition to MBH will come from subsidiaries of several large western German public companies which have established operations as well as some smaller privately-owned family businesses. Construction output is eastern Germany is forecast to rise by one-fifth this year, with DM500bn expected to to be spent during the next eight years on building and repairing the region's housing, infrastructure and industry. The Treuhandanstalt, the privatisation agency established to sell former state-owned assets, has appointed Merrill Lynch in London to advise on the sale of MBH, which has already attracted some international interest. Companies from 10 countries, including Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and the European subsidiary of a Hong Kong-based group, have expressed interest in acquiring MBH. MBH owns 120 properties, including the 65 active trading outlets. The purchase price could depend upon which of these properties are to be included in the sale. Merrill Lynch earlier this year arranged the sale for DM90m to Thames Water of the Mitteldeutsche Wasser-und Umwelttecnik (UTAG) the former East German water supply and sewerage treatment engineers.</p>

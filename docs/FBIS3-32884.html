			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 5 Feb (PL) -- The possible lifting of  restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba is being  classified by local analysts as something which the blockade  prohibits and as a minor alleviation to the systematic violation  of the constitutional rights of all U.S. citizens.    In expressing an opinion with respect to the extent of a  measure, which, according to THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper has been  approved by the U.S. Department of State and is currently being  evaluated by President Bill Clinton, Graciella Chailloux from  the U.S. Studies Center told PRENSA LATINA that Washington's  blockade against Cuba will never change.    For the past 35 years, she recalled, the White House has  attempted to economically suffocate Cuba, and what the newspaper  reported in no way provides solutions leading in that direction.    Lifting some travel restrictions to Cuba and easing the way  to information exchange is merely part of a plan they intend to  implement in order to influence Cuban civilian society and  encourage real political intervention which the Americans, she  indicated, would consider given the excellent results in Eastern  Europe.    The real intention, according to the researcher's personal  opinion, is to encourage implementation of the Torricelli Bill,  as this instrument relates to interfering in Cuba's internal  issues.    Likewise, Nicanor Leon Cotayo, Cuban journalist, writer, and  researcher, believes that lifting restrictions to Americans  traveling to Havana will only be a minor alleviation to the  official violation of U.S. citizens' constitutional rights.    Leon emphasized the highly selective nature of the  authorizations granted -- mostly to U.S. officials. In this  respect, he pointed out that more than an opening headed toward  encouraging an improvement in bilateral relations, there would  seem to be a more general intent aimed at less contructive  objectives.    In this respect, he added, it is important to point out that  those persons who would be allowed to travel to Cuba do not  include individuals who would cooperate with the country's  economic or scientific development.    Leon, author of several books on the blockade against Cuba,  emphasizes that the eventual U.S. Government measures constitute  a small favorable step within the context of American-Cuban  relations.</p>

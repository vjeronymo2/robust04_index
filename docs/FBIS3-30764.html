			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> Snezana Rodic and unidentified correspondent in Belgrade on 7  February -- recorded]    [Text] Mr. Jovanovic, how do you assess today's  [Milosevic-Akashi] talks?    [Jovanovic] I view them as encouraging, especially after  what has happened recently. Namely, it is evident that the  efforts to overcome the present situation and steer it back on  the negotiating path to find a solution by political means in  peace are again gaining in prominence. It is evident that Mr.  Akashi is a man of peace, dialogue, and negotiations, and not a  man of confrontation, threats, ultimatums, or punishment. On  the other hand, the entire situation, despite this tragic event,  contains elements of political dynamism [sentence as heard].  For example, Lord Owen and President Karadzic yesterday held  very enterprising talks about Sarajevo and its placement under  the UN administration without waiting for the final peace  settlement. On the other hand, there is talk about the  relaxation of the situation in Sarajevo itself, which is also  encouraging. There has been some progress in the talks  concerning Tuzla airport.    A meeting in Geneva is forthcoming at which, beside the  examination of the measures of trust, the issue of Sarajevo in  the above mentioned context should also be discussed. Finally,  a meeting of the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia  at a ministerial level will also probably take place, which  means that the political momentum has been preserved despite all  the temptations and we should expect further development in this  direction rather than in the direction of confrontation and  escalation of the war.    [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed  simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Mr. Minister how  do you assess the danger of air attacks on the Serbian positions  in Bosnia. Is this possible?    [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous  translation into Serbo-Croatian] I believe that this is  possible in this war, but not likely, I hope, because everybody  is aware that this would not help in the present situation and  definitely would not assist the peace process. First of all,  the strain of the entire situation and the solution to the  crisis can only be seen within the framework of the peace  process and not in the possibility of escalating the conflict  further. Finally, political activities, a visit by Mr. Akashi  and the cochairmen not merely to Belgrade, but to some other  counties in this region are the best proof that the majority of  the international community believes that a political and not a  military solution is needed here. We are definitely inclined to  believe that the solution to the problem lies in the rejection  of the existing structure of political negotiations.    [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed  simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Do you foresee  what will happen in Geneva?    [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous  translation into Serbo-Croatian] If it were up to us, peace can  take place anytime. The lack of peace will depend upon the side  that has been opposed to peace. Unfortunately, this side is  still not in a mood to assist the peace. They prefer to  obstruct the peace, however, there are chances that even this  side might turn more cooperative in comparison to the readiness  of the majority of the international community to assist the  peace process and not the continuation of the war.</p>

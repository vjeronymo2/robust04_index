			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB firmer United Biscuits were firmer in a stronger market, boosted by a broker buy note, and renewed bid speculation ahead of the long holiday weekend. The buy note from agency broker James Capel was based on recovery prospects for Keebler, the US unit. The shares rose 16 to 426p also helped by a return of bid speculation although most analysts were sceptical and the turnover of 3.3m shares provided little opportunity for stake building. Recent speculation has focused on Cadbury Schweppes off a penny at 461p, and Hanson up 1 1/2 at 231p, as likely bidders. The composite insurance sector was given substantial support by Credit Lyonnais Laing ahead of the first-quarter results season which gets underway later this month. 'We think there is good momentum in the composites,' said Mr Charles Coyne at CLL. The broker is particularly bullish about Royal where it sees its current year forecast of a Pounds 4m loss as 'extremely conservative.' Commercial Union, rated a buy by CLL, settled 5 higher at 591p after confirmation that the group's exposure to the Bishopsgate bomb outrage will be no more than Pounds 25m. Royals eased to 318p. Barclays added 7 to 429p and NatWest eased 3 to 458p after Kleinwort Benson reaffirmed its switch recommendation. Press suggestions of big losses by marketmakers SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson, after the setbacks in equities and derivatives this week, were rejected by senior traders around the markets. Warburg shares rallied 9 to 652p and Kleinwort put on 4 to 393p. A buy recommendation helped Reuters Holdings to an early rise. Kleinwort Benson said the news and electronic information group had hit its lowest rating since flotation in 1984. The shares were up 14 in early trade but the gains were flattened out and closed 5 higher at 1259p. Conglomerate Lonrho was the most heavily traded stock in London yesterday as chart analysts predicted that the share price would hit 150p over the medium to long term. The shares will be helped by the higher price of precious metals. The stock gained 5 to 98 1/2 p on , turnover of more than 13m. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries bounced 18 to 856p ahead of first quarter results on Wednesday. Pharmaceuticals Group Smith &amp; Nephew was actively traded, the shares closing slightly firmer at 148 1/2 p on turnover of 10m. The volume reflected 5m shares dealt at 147 1/2 p and a further 5m at 148p. Old bid speculation returned and the company held a presentation at a Society of Investment Analysts lunch earlier in the week. Vague bid stories earlier in the week supported Lasmo which edged off the bottom of the Footsie 100 list of companies and Lasmo shares were firmer at 152p. Fisons, the health and household company, dropped to the bottom of the Index. Packaging and paper group David S. Smith lifted 12 to 350p after announcing a small acquisition. Growing concern that the compact disc industry might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission prompted Thorn to ease a penny to 847p.</p>

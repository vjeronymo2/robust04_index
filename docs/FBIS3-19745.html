			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fikret Bila: "There Are Armed Forces Outside the </F> Military"]    [Excerpts] Socialist Populist Party leader and Deputy Prime  Minister Murat Karayalcin said that there are other armed forces  outside the military, and these forces are getting their  training outside the country, taking an oath to destroy the  regime. Karayalcin, talking about his views on recent political  developments, repeated that he was misunderstood when he said,  "There are those who are preparing to intervene against  democracy." Karayalcin, explaining he did not mean the word  "coup" said, "When I mentioned there are those who are getting  ready to intervene against democracy, I did not mean to say  coups. I meant some particular forces. The methods of  intervention are not the same any more. In less developed  countries, because the military is the most powerful force, the  military carries out coups.    ``However, this is changing. In a neighboring country, the  name of which I don't want to mention, one industrialist,  leasing tanks and soldiers, is able to intervene against the  government. In Georgia, Shevardnadze can state that the ports  of his country are in the hands of the Mafia. Those fighting in  the former Yugoslavia are not soldiers. The traditional  standards for coups are different now. In Turkey there are  sectors arming themselves outside the military. There are  people being trained outside the country and there are those  taking an oath to change the regime. I wanted to draw attention  to these people. It is not possible to govern Turkey without  democracy. Turkey cannot be governed by military rule,  isolating itself from the outside world. This is not possible.''  [passage omitted]    Karayalcin, emphasizing that Turkey is in a geographic  region  where the line between war and peace is very thin, said, "It is  very easy to move from peace to war in the Middle East, in the  Balkans, and in the Caucasus. For these regions peace in Turkey  and in the area has great importance. We have to add `Peace at  home, peace in the region' to our principle of `Peace at home,  peace in the world.' Taking regional characteristics into  consideration, a thesis was put forth recently which says  `Turkey does not have to be an ordinary country in the region.'  According to this thesis, Turkey will be either a strong  country or it will be divided. This is a hypothesis worth  thinking about. It is from this perspective that one can  evaluate Turkey's decision, despite the fact that all its  governments have created inflation and dollar dependency, to  choose a nonnegotiable 7-percent growth rate and to achieve that  goal without fear of going into foreign debt."[passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls on fading hopes of further rate cuts THERE was no clear trend among continental bourses yesterday, as French equities weakened and Italian shares continued to power ahead, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS fell back on fears that last week's interest rate cut was the last reduction for some time. A weak start on Wall Street contributed to the easier tone as the CAC-40 index fell 24.07 to 1,772.73 in thin turnover of FFr1.7bn, generated mainly by arbitrage and domestic activity. Euro Disney dropped FFr5.15 or 6.5 per cent to FFr74.70 following negative weekend press comment in the UK. An article in a US newspaper quoting a recent sell recommendation from Paribas which described Euro Disney as a 'high-risk' share also prompted selling. Michelin dropped FFr8.10 or 4.2 per cent to FFr186.50 after the release of nine-month sales whichshowed a decline in the third quarter. Among smaller stocks, Pernod Ricard, which last week downgraded its 1992 earnings outlook, lost Fl 4.1 to Fl 395, while several large blocks of Bic were crossed yesterday as the shares rose by FFr3 to FFr904 with 65,200 shares traded. FRANKFURT ended a mixed day with distinct contrasts among senior blue chips and the DAX index fell 1.57 to 1,546.95 after last week's 4.1 per cent gain. Turnover fell from DM6.7bn to DM4.8bn. Siemens rose another DM9.30 to DM588, reinforced by last week's better-than-expected results. But Daimler dropped DM14.60 to DM539.40 on unexpectedly low car and truck deliveries since July, and a forecast of a 22 per cent drop in net profit. Several securities houses have downgraded their earnings estimates for Daimler in the past few days. Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner said that his bank had dropped its EPS forecasts from DM55 to DM49 for 1992 and from DM50 to DM40 for 1993. Other notable winners among DAX constituents included Schering, up DM9.50 to DM745.50: Mr Jaarsma said that higher interest income, following sales of subsidiaries should help the company offset weakening in both agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals. Continental, lifted by technical support, rose DM3.70 to DM205.50. MILAN continued its recent rally in active trading on the first day of the final account of 1992, with persistent privatisation hopes and speculative buying by domestic investors fuelling the rise. The Comit index added 11.42 or 2.5 per cent to 472.38 in turnover estimated at near Friday's L410bn. State-controlled banks remained in the limelight, with Credito Italiano adding L80 to L2,910, Banca Commerciale Italiana up L441 or 10 per cent to L4,801 and Banca di Roma L173 higher at L2,450. Other state-owned companies were in demand, and trading in shares of Alitalia and Assitalia was delayed due to an order imbalance. The airline's shares stopped trading at L770, up 3.1 per cent or L23 from Friday, while shares in the insurer closed up L1,045 or 11.8 per cent to L9,895. Trading was suspended in Sme pending details from its parent company, Iri, on how it plans to sell parts of the food company. ZURICH ended lower, the SMI index falling 15.9 to 1,913.4 after weekend polls showed that the Swiss electorate would reject membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) at a referendum in December. Swissair bearers fell SFr35 to SFr435, on fears that the national carrier would find access to the European market more difficult if EEA membership was rejected. MADRID continued to rise on Friday's better-than-expected inflation data, but profit-taking saw it close off intraday highs in active trading. The general index put on 1.15 to 203.81 in turnover up from Pta13.4bn to Pta14.6bn. Nine-month earnings reports from Telefonica and Repsol left the former Pta10 better at Pta1,040 after an earlier gain of Pta30, and the latter flat at Pta2,485. STOCKHOLM gained in moderate trading as domestic interest rates fell back and last week's money market turmoil appeared to subside. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.0 to 725.8 in turnover of SKr430m after SKr527m. The forestry sector led the gains on speculation that the central bank will soon be forced to abandon its fixed exchange rate policy and allow the krona to float. Stora B shares jumped SKr15 to SKr192. Ericsson B shares were up SKr4 to SKr133 on hopes that its nine-month earnings report, due on Thursday, will be stronger than expected. AMSTERDAM ended mixed to firmer, as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 105.2. The brewer, Heineken, was among the big gainers as it picked up Fl 1.40 to Fl 174.40. But DSM shed Fl 3.50 to Fl 73.10. HELSINKI fell on lack of progress in talks on updating the national incomes settlement; the trade union confederation, SAK, said that it would call member federations together on Friday to consider future action if the settlement talks fail. The Hex index fell 14.5 or 1.8 per cent to 779.1.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 16                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes               Open      10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1056.10    1059.64     1061.07     1062.10 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1109.32    1112.92     1112.88     1114.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Nov 13      Nov 12      Nov 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             1059.26     1059.91     1045.16??

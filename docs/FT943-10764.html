			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Electronics groups agree on standard optical disc format Leading electronics companies in the US, Europe and Japan have agreed to adopt a single standard for next generation magneto-optical discs which are used to record sound and video information. The move could significantly boost the market for the discs, likely to be the dominant recording medium for digital information in the multimedia age. Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics company, and IBM of the US have submitted a letter to the International Standards Organisation, which represents 24 companies in the industry, indicating agreement on a standard for advanced MO discs. The companies include Japan's Sony, Sharp and Olympus, Philips of the Netherlands and Hewlett Packard and 3M of the US. MO discs are 3 1/2 -inch discs, resembling a CD encased in a floppy disc. They record information stored in a computer or other equipment, and are removable. They can contain several hundred times more information than the most advanced floppy discs. An example of an MO disc system currently in use is Sony's MiniDisc system, which is a recordable miniature compact disc system. Standardising MO discs and disc drives would reduce prices and broaden the use of the discs, which are likely to replace floppy discs as the main removable recording medium for digital sound, data and video. The adoption of a single standard reflects a trend within the electronics industry to avoid costly and bruising battles over competing standards. However, Matsushita, the Japanese electronics company, a leading maker of MO discs, has not backed the standard, focusing instead on recording technology primarily for consumer electronics products in competition with video tapes. The technology Matsushita is developing - phase change technology - is not expected to compete with the new MO discstandard as it does not handle the quickly changing data requirements of computers. Also, Matsushita buys a significant amount of its MO disc drives from Fujitsu and could adopt the new standard at any time. Since MO discs can also record sound and video as well as data they are expected to play a leading role in multimedia services, such as video-on-demand or interactive television. But a disc drive costs about Dollars 800 (Pounds 520) while a current generation 230-megabyte disc is priced at about Dollars 50. The manufacturers hope that by standardising the next generation discs, which will be capable of recording 600MB of information, or roughly equivalent to a CD-Rom, they can cut prices. The market for MO disc drives is dominated by Japanese companies. Fujitsu has a 30.7 per cent market share for the 128MB generation, says the IDC, the high technology consultancy. Last year, 240,000 disc drives were sold but the IDC estimates sales may rise to 2m units by 1997.</p>

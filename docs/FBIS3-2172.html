			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 4 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin  today underlined the main tasks facing the Russian Government,  stressing the urgent need for energetic reform of the country's  economic mechanism.    "The economic situation remains complicated this year, and  the social and political conditions are quite tough," Yeltsin  told an extended government meeting in the Kremlin.    He pointed out that the government already has the (reform)  program that it adopted last August but it needs to be specified  and implemented.    "We need a policy oriented towards the future and it is  wrong  to call for reforms that are too costly and burdensome for  people to tolerate," Yeltsin said.    The president stressed that the main government action  should  be to forge an energetic transformation of the economic  mechanism and it should shoulder the bulk of the problems as  before.    He described the privatization program, which started last  year, as the major item of the reform package and stressed that  it must be completed "as scheduled and without hindrances".    "It is necessary, therefore, to create a legal framework and  organizational mechanism to attract resources through  investments by domestic and foreign businessmen for a  technological renewal of production", he said.    The president also said that priorities should be given to  curbing inflation, taxation, payment and banking system reforms  as well as agricultural reforms which included ensuring the  rights of private landowners.    He went on: "The government is prepared to usher in radical  reforms this year into the system of management of state-owned  enterprises, or, to be more exact, create it a new, from  scratch."    The president's statement made clear that the  demonopolization of the Russian economy will take time.    "This is why preventive measures are particularly important  to block the formation of new monopoly structures," he  explained.    Stressing the need for the effective mechanism of state  supervision, Yeltsin said that a draft civil code for Russia and  other priority draft bills will be submitted to the State Duma  (lower house of parliament) in the near future.    "Their promulgation into law will lay a firm legal basis for  the market economy and help Russian enterprises establish a firm  footing," the president said.    Commenting on the coal-mine strikes, Yeltsin said: "It is  inadmissible to delay the payment of wages for several months.  I am closely watching the developments and the position of the  labor unions."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA correspondents Fan Liqing (5400 7787 </F> 7230) and Liu Shizhong (0491 0670 1813): "Maintain the Consensus  That Has Been Reached To Push Forward Cross-Strait Talks on  Routine Affairs"]    [Text] Beijing, 31 Mar (XINHUA) -- In accordance with the  consensus reached between responsible officials of the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and  the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] of Taiwan during their  Beijing talks held in February this year, the two organizations  began their fourth round of talks on routine affairs on 25  March. Both sides carried out discussions on three topics,  including "the repatriation of people entering each other's area  in violation of relevant regulations and other issues  concerned," but no agreement was reached because the Taiwan side  repudiated some areas of consensus reached earlier between the  officials of the two organizations during their Beijing talks;  discussions on other items on the agenda could not be held  either. The SEF delegation returned to Taibei [Taipei] on 31  March.    The latest talks were arranged on the basis of the consensus  reached between Tang Shubei, executive vice president of the  ARATS, and Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice chairman and  secretary general of the SEF, during talks in Beijing in  February. Their main tasks were to hold discussions on the  three topics, including "the repatriation of people entering  each other's area in violation of relevant regulations and other  issues concerned" and "the handling of cross-Strait fishing  disputes"; to try to overcome, on the basis of the high degree  of consensus reached by officials during their talks, remaining  differences in order to reach a written agreement at an early  date; and to exchange views or carry out discussions on "a joint  crackdown on maritime smuggling, robbery, and other crimes," on  the "protection of intellectual property rights," on "ties and  mutual assistance between related law courts" on both sides of  the Taiwan Strait, as well as on economic, scientific, and  technological issues listed in "the General Agreement on the  Wang-Ku Talks." This time the SEF arranged to have Deputy  Secretaries General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] and Shi Qiping [Shi  Chi-ping] each lead relevant officials in two echelons to  Beijing for talks.    During the talks which began on 25 March, Sun Yafu, ARATS  deputy secretary general, and Xu Huiyou, chief negotiators of  both sides, discussed the written wording of an agreement for  the three topics on routine affairs. However, after the talks  began, the SEF side raised some issues which had been solved  during earlier talks between the officials in Beijing, thus  changing the nature of the current talks which should have  discussed the written wording for the text of an agreement and  once again leading to debates over past differences. Despite  the eight discussion meetings over five days, no solution  acceptable to both sides could be found, and talks on routine  affairs between the two sides were once again deadlocked. The  second echelon of SEF's negotiators including Shi Qiping and  others have put off their visit to Beijing.    In explaining the reason for once again bringing up  differences which had been resolved, Taiwan's SEF Deputy  Secretary General Xu Huiyu said: "Both sides should be serious  and practical in interpreting the `consensus reached at the  Tang-Jiao talks.' A process of discussion cannot be called a  consensus. The conditions of the specific time should be taken  into consideration in interpreting consensus." Taiwan's  "Mainland Affairs Council" has blamed ARATS for "magnifying the  interpretation of consensus." As a result, the current talks  created a spectacular issue -- how to interpret consensus  reached earlier by officials of the two organizations during  their talks in Beijing.    Let us recall their talks. During the three-day talks, Tang  Shubei and Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho] thoroughly discussed the  differences faced in the consultation of three topics on routine  affairs and reached consensus on solving several issues. Both  sides also agreed to hold the fourth round of talks on routine  affairs on the basis of the consensus. The principled consensus  reached at the talks were written in the "Joint News Release by  Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe After Their Talks." After conclusion  of the talks, SEF Vice Chairman Jiao Renhe issued a statement,  saying, the talks "almost resolved all the issues in the three  topics for discussion. Only one issue -- the use of written  expressions. The joint news release by both sides should be  binding." He said he was confident the fourth round of talks  would succeed in deciding the text of an agreement. Huang  Kunhui [Huang Kun-hui], chairman of Taiwan's "MAC," also said  the SEF conducted consultations within the scope it authorized,  adding the MAC was not only satisfied with, but also highly  affirmed the results of the talks.    According to Taiwan media reports, the MAC convened two  meetings of relevant departments in mid-March to discuss  "countermeasures" for the fourth round of talks. During the  meetings the MAC vetoed some of the consensus reached between  Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe, and "repudiated the important  consensus reached at the Tang-Jiao talks on three topics." It  also asserted the necessity of "maintaining the bottom line in  the Taibei talks between the two organizations under the premise  of upholding the dignity of judicial jurisdiction."    From this one can see it is the Taiwan side that repudiated  the Tang-Jiao consensus and revived the differences that had  already been resolved, thus causing the current talks to be  deadlocked.    Interpreting the consensus reached between the two  organizations' officials during the Beijing talks is, no doubt,  a question that must be dealt with seriously. Only the  preservation of the consensus will help bring about an early  agreement on the various topics discussed at the talks on  routine matters between the two sides of the strait. In  interpreting the "consensus," the two sides should begin with  the following goals in mind:    -- The consensus reached by the two organizations' officials  during their talks must be recognized and earnestly carried out.  This is because the officials conducted their discussions in  accordance with "the agreement on the liaison and meeting of the  two organizations" signed during the "Wang-Ku talks." Moreover,  they were authorized by their respective competent departments.  The authorization and legal basis for the discussions was  beyond all doubt, and so the results are of course effective.    -- In the area of major principle, the consensus reached by  officials during the Beijing talks, for example: "Political  issues should be pragmatically avoided in discussions on routine  matters between the two organizations," was written into the  "Joint News Release by Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe After Their  Talks." As for the specific high degree of consensus reached on  the three topics, only "a high degree of consensus was reached"  was written in the "Joint News Release" without listing the  specific contents one by one, but consensus is consensus -- and  it was the common view agreed on by both sides during their  talks. The words are still ringing in one's ears; the consensus  should be carried out.    -- In their talks on routine affairs, the two sides should  adhere to the guideline of "seeking truth from facts, seeking  common ground while reserving differences, holding discussions  on equal terms, and respecting each other" and to the principle  of avoiding political issues; and resolve the easy issues first  and tackle the difficult ones later in order to quickly find a  way in which both sides can cooperate in resolving issues which  have developed in the course of cross-strait exchanges, to  safeguard and promote cross-strait exchanges, and to avoid  binding their own hands and feet, thus setting restrictions on  themselves. The Taiwan side's adoption of an interlocking  stratagem to confine the two organizations' operations and talks  on routine affairs to one or two issues will cause the scope of  cross-strait consultations on routine affairs and exchanges,  which was very broad at the beginning, to continue to narrow  down to the point where there is no more space to move.    -- Keeping one's word and promise is a traditional, noble  quality of the Chinese nation. Sincerity in resolving issues  constitutes the necessary condition for success in cross-strait  discussions on routine affairs. Therefore, in their talks on  routine affairs, the two sides should conduct discussions by  proceeding from the aim of solving issues and seeking mutual  benefit -- benefit for compatriots on both sides of the strait.  The consensus reached in each stage of the discussions should  be cherished and safeguarded. Even if it is necessary to once  again bring up an issue for discussion, mutual respect and  consultations on equal terms should be adhered to with a  sincerity to resolve issues. One should not negate the  consensus already reached and deliberately raise new issues.    Although the two organizations met with setbacks in their  recent talks, the delegates -- realizing the need for an early  solution of issues developed in the course of cross-strait  exchanges and that the two organizations are willing to maintain  ties and channels of communication -- indicated after the end of  the talks that they will continue. Therefore, maintaining the  consensus reached at the talks and striving to expand the  results of such consensus will be crucial to the success of the  next round of talks. People on both sides of the strait are  expecting the two organizations' officials to continue to work  hard, seek truth from facts, seek common ground while reserving  differences, and discover a way to resolve the issues at an  early date.</p>

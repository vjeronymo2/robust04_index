			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Gambling to lose extra Pounds 15m a year THE TREASURY will get an extra Pounds 15m pay-out from gaming machines this year as a result of the budget's 20 per cent increase in licence duty. Licences for amusement-with-prizes (AWP) machines rise from Pounds 375 to Pounds 450 a year - the fee for jackpot machines goes from Pounds 960 to Pounds 1,150 a year. The increases dented industry optimism, which was raised just a few weeks ago by Home Office approval for higher prizes paid by one-arm bandits. Top prize for the 190,000 AWP machines in operation, many in pubs, was lifted to Pounds 3 cash or Pounds 6 in tokens. The jackpot limit for 35,000 machines in private clubs was raised to Pounds 200. Mr Paul Duckett, marketing manager for Associated Leisure, one of the industry's big three suppliers, said: 'We had expected the higher prizes to give the trade a useful fillip. The licence increase is a big disappointment.' The British Amusement and Catering Trade Association had urged the chancellor not to increase the licence duty, saying that the industry had absorbed the VAT increase two years ago and suffered from lower consumer spending during the recession. Mr Lamont's only concession was to abolish the duty from November 1 on small-prize machines, which cost 5p to play. These account for about 5 per cent of the total. The move is designed to help seasonal operators at seaside sites.</p>

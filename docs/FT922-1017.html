			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (7): Skirmishes in Europe; pitched battles in the US - The Japanese Challenge IT was only days after Peugeot and Rover, the European car makers, decided to pull out of the US car market last year that Mazda, Japan's fourth-largest car manufacturer, announced it was creating a separate luxury car franchise in the US. Mazda is following in the tracks of Honda, Toyota and Nissan. The contrast between European retrenchment and Japanese expansion in the US underlines the startling progress Japanese carmakers have made in the higher reaches of the American car market since Toyota and Nissan launched their luxury franchises in autumn 1989. In some months last year, Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti franchises both outsold BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the US. Infiniti and Lexus came first and second in the latest Initial Quality Study published this month by J. D. Power, one of the most authoritative US analysts of quality and customer satisfaction in the world car industry. The Japanese car makers are yet to enter with force into the luxury and executive car market in Europe, but there are already strong signs that the Japanese challenge will move to Europe during the 1990s. The European car makers know the scale of the problems they are facing because the luxury-executive car battle with the Japanese makers has already been joined in earnest for at least two years in the US. As the Japanese car makers develop their local production presence in Europe  -as they have done in the US in the past decade - they will be able to make some of their main volume cars in Europe and begin importing more executive and luxury cars under their import quotas. By the end of this year Nissan, Toyota and Honda will all be producing cars at their own plants in the UK, while Mitsubishi will follow by 1994-95 at its joint venture plant in the Netherlands. To date, their presence in the European executive-luxury market has amounted to only preliminary skirmishes. Toyota has shied away as yet from direct confrontation with BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar in Europe and is only selling limited volumes of its flagship Lexus LS400 luxury saloon. Nissan is not yet bringing its current generation Infiniti cars to Europe. Mazda is already testing the water, however, with the launch of its Xedos 6 sports saloon, a car which it is pitching squarely against BMW. It is clear that Mazda has ambitions to establish a much broader range of sporty executive and luxury cars in the European market during the 1990s. The pitched battle is in the US, however. BMW's overall sales in the US last year fell by 16.2 per cent to 53,343, while Mercedes-Benz sales plunged by 24.9 per cent to 58,868. In particular segments, the damage was far greater - sales of BMW's top-of-the-range 7-Series fell by 47.3 per cent to 5,508. Porsche sales fell by 52.0 per cent. Jaguar suffered a drop in sales in the US last year of 49.9 per cent, while Audi sales plunged by 41.8 per cent. The local American competitors in the US luxury car market fared little better last year with General Motors' Cadillac sales dropping by 17.4 per cent, and Ford's Lincoln marque suffering a drop of 22.9 per cent. While their rivals were losing sales volume, the Japanese were winning additional market share. Sales volumes of Toyota's Lexus franchise rose by 12.1 per cent to 71,206, outselling its prestigious German rivals, while Honda's longer-established Acura franchise also increased sales by 3.8 per cent. Nissan's Infiniti franchise was the star performer, however. It started much more slowly than Lexus after the autumn 1989 launch but last year it began to close the gap, increasing its sales by 45.6 per cent to 34,890. Lexus and Infiniti have both been helped by the launch of new models, and Infiniti has now expanded to a four-model range with the G20, the recently-introduced J30, the M30 and the flagship Q45 luxury saloon. In the first four months of 1992 alone, Lexus has sold 8,132 units of its recently-launched SC400-300 coupe. This year, the US luxury car market has brightened for several of the players as the US struggles out of recession. Mercedes-Benz has increased its US sales by 18 per cent in the first five months of 1992 while BMW has achieved a 23.8 per cent increase and Jaguar a rise of 12.6 per cent. Cadillac sales are 5.5 per cent higher than a year ago, although Lincoln's fortunes continue to decline sharply with a drop of 18.4 per cent. The Japanese luxury car players are not infallible in the US and Acura has begun to lose ground this year with a drop of 11 per cent. Lexus and Infiniti are both still gaining on their rivals, however, with Lexus boosting its sales in the first five months by 72.4 per cent and Infiniti achieving an increase of 38.9 per cent. Mazda is planning to enter the US luxury car market with a separate sales channel, to be called Amati, in spring 1994. Amati's initial product line-up will be two luxury saloons and the Japanese carmaker aims to sell about 20,000 cars under the new marque in its first year. It is likely that a sporting coupe will be added later. Mazda has been studying an entry into the US luxury car market for two years with its Pegasus task-force and has concluded that the prospects are too mouth-watering to be ignored. It says the number of affluent households in the US with an income of at least Dollars 75,000 a year is increasing from 2m in 1988 to 2.5m in 1995. The Amati cars are to be built at a newly-constructed manufacturing plant in Hofu, Japan, dedicated to producing luxury vehicles. The Amati operation is to be a separate division of the Japanese manufacturer's US subsidiary, Mazda Motor of America, with its headquarters in Irvine, California. A number of regional offices are also to be set up. 'Mazda intends to become a significant competitor in the luxury car market,' says Mr Keijo Asano, senior managing director of the parent Mazda Motor Corporation and chairman of Mazda Motor of America. While Mazda is enthusiastic about the challenge and the potential rewards offered by the US luxury car market, some of its weaker European rivals have decided that the strain of competing as marginal players in the world's most fiercely contested arena can no longer be supported. Rover's decision to stop exporting its Rover 800 Sterling range to the US came after continuing heavy losses and dwindling US sales. Ever since the company re-entered the US market under the Sterling brand-name in 1987, it was dogged by quality problems and was increasingly burdened by excessive stocks of old models. Rover has maintained its separate Range Rover of North America operation to market luxury four-wheel drive leisure vehicles. Like Peugeot, Rover faces a mighty challenge from the Japanese in the UK and in continental Europe during the 1990s, and it could no longer afford prestigious but very costly battles in the US. The withdrawals of Peugeot and Rover from the US mean they will no longer be exposed to the rigours and disciplines imposed by the US market, however. According to Mr Carl Hahn, management board chairman of Volkswagen, the biggest European car maker which has struggled in America in recent years - with both its VW and Audi brands - 'The US market is important in particular because its sets the benchmark for competition in the world market, and also because it shapes social demands on the car, in exhaust emissions for example. 'We simply cannot afford to give up either the opportunities offered by the US market or the learning processes and experience it imposes.' The Japanese challenge in America is still growing and the lessons learned there can be brought to bear at any time in Europe.</p>

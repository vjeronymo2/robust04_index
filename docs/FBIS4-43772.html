			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F> Hideaki Yasuda and Tetsuji Ozuka at OECD headquarters in Paris  on 15 June]    [Text] Paris, 15 June -- Questions and answers from an  interview with Secretary General Paye:    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What are the results of the recent [OECD]  ministerial meeting?    [Paye] Regarding the issues of creating economic growth and  employment opportunities, which are the largest tasks, the  ministers, in addition to reaching an agreement in the financial  area, were able to agree to buckle down to the task of  structural reform. We were also able to agree to strengthen the  multilateral trade system, eliminate protectionism, and  strengthen dialogue with countries that are not OECD members.  We were able to produce overall results. However, true results  depend on each country's future effort.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Ministers of European nations strongly  expressed concern that low wages and low-cost goods from  developing countries in Asia threaten the employment situation  in Europe.    [Paye] I think such a concern is wrong. Since the time of  the industrial revolution, new employment opportunities have  been created while some industries were forced into bankruptcy  every time a new technological invention was made. Low-cost  goods such as textiles created problems in Europe. However, it  is a process of economic development. What we have to do to  overcome this process is to renovate our technologies, educate  capable people, and review our social systems to make them suit  the high-tech era.    Some people are worried that the issue of labor standards  and  competition -- or the issue of how far we should protect the  rights of laborers in developing countries -- may be linked to  protectionism in the developed countries. The OECD plans to  make an objective analysis, which will not be affected by  political pressure or diplomatic tension.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The amount of Japan's trade surplus is huge.  On the other hand, its economic recovery is slow.    [Paye] Japan is an island, and the Japanese people still  have  insular views. Indeed, it is difficult for the United States and  European countries to make inroads into the Japanese market.  However, I do not think Japan is essentially a closed nation.  Since it has a consistent social system and firm systems [as  published], you need to exert efforts to understand its culture  and how the Japanese people think if you want to do business in  the Japanese market. It will become a most reliable partner  once your efforts are recognized.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Japan is buckling down to the task of  political and economic reforms. There are many problems,  however, which will require a considerable amount of time before  being settled.    [Paye] Japan's ability to adapt to a new environment and  long-term viewpoints are highly valued. Japan is moving in the  right direction, so we hope it will speed up the process of its  political and economic reforms. We hope Japan will make changes  in such areas as consumption and livelihood [shohi ya seikatsu]  and the social system in a way that it can cooperate more than  before with its trade partners, including the European countries  and the United States. Some people insist on keeping things  which are peculiar to Japan in various areas ranging from  politics to the family system. However, I think it is also  necessary for foreign countries occasionally to apply pressure  on Japan to make its reforms progress more.    Anyhow, the standard of living in Japan has reached the  highest level in the world. I think Japan will change more. I  am certain that it will be obvious to everybody that Japan is  neither an isolated protectionist nation nor a closed one.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Japan-U.S.  comprehensive economic talks, in which the United States is  assuming a stance of "emphasizing the importance of results?"    [Paye] It is strange that the United States is displeased  with Japan, because the United States is suffering from a huge  trade deficit with Japan. U.S. markets are open to many  countries. It seems, however, that the United States thinks it  is difficult to make inroads into markets in Japan, which has  strong competitive power. If I may express my private opinion,  it is dangerous to insist on bilateral negotiations between  Japan and the United States to settle trade issues. I am  worried about the possibility that the benefits of each nation  may be jeopardized. Negotiations between Japan and the United  States in limited individual areas will not be linked to  promotion of changes in Japan.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Your second term of office will expire in  September. Are you planning to remain in the post?    [Paye] I expressed my hope a year ago to remain in this post  one more term. I have enough experience, and this is an  interesting time of change. I am ready for it.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGNS OF FEINSTEIN AND VAN DE KAMP  </P> <P> Although it is encouraging to see that the candidates for governor are  concerned about education, I am not optimistic that the ultimate winner will  retain that commitment.  </P> <P> After all, George Deukmejian won the seat claiming that he would be a governor  with education as his top priority. Nothing could be further from the truth! He  has broken promises to the educational community concerning the implementation  of Proposition 98. His budget proposals for the upcoming year will be  devastating to our schools.  </P> <P> So, I only wonder if the candidates will maintain their commitment towards  education after election day.  </P> <P> KEVIN D.

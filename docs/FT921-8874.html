			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BP down 14% to Pounds 1.04bn in year - Final quarter sees 'extremely disappointing' fall of Pounds 384m to Pounds 72m BRITISH PETROLEUM saw a sharp fall in profits in the final quarter of last year as the recession took its toll on many parts of the business. On a replacement cost basis, the group made Pounds 72m, down sharply from the Pounds 456m earned in the previous year's final quarter. This brought total profits for the year to Pounds 1.04bn, down 14 per cent from Pounds 1.2bn in 1990. The lower result prompted BP to hold its final dividend at 4.2p, the level of the previous three quarterly pay-outs. The resulting full-year dividend of 16.8p represents an increase of 4.7 per cent on 1990. The profit figure was much in line with market expectations. Investors, however, had been hoping for a small boost to the final dividend, and BP's shares lost ground as a result, closing 10p lower at 274p. BP described the fourth quarter result as 'extremely disappointing'. Mr Steve Ahearne, chief financial officer, stressed that the main cause was recession rather than a weaker oil market. 'The overall picture is not of a company bleeding because of the low oil price,' he said, 'but of a company hit by recession in its key markets.' To illustrate this he pointed to the strong result from exploration and production which produced an operating profit on a replacement cost basis for the year of Pounds 1.8bn (Pounds 1.69bn), including Pounds 149m of divestment profits. Although the average oil price was down about Dollars 3 a barrel, production levels were maintained and cost structures were improved. The refining and marketing side made a full-year operating profit of Pounds 945m, up from Pounds 853m. Margins started high but declined as the year progressed, reflecting weak product demand especially in the US. BP's chemicals business, suffering from the deep cyclical downturn, incurred an operating loss of Pounds 7m against a profit of Pounds 129m in 1990. The loss was concentrated in the fourth quarter as prices weakened against a background of steady costs. Profit from the nutrition business, recently re-designated a 'non-core' activity, was Pounds 37m, down from Pounds 48m. Adding to the company's difficulties was a high effective tax rate of 68 per cent on the historical cost result because stock holding losses are not recognised for tax in countries like the US. In the final quarter BP's tax rate was 114 per cent because of asset write-downs which were not tax-relievable. Mr Robert Horton, chairman, said that the present low level of world oil prices was unsustainable in the long run because it gave producers no incentive to invest in new production. He forecast a 20m barrel a day supply-demand gap by 2000. Nonetheless, he stressed that BP had tested all its businesses on the basis of an oil price of Dollars 18 per barrel and had found them 'robust'. In the short term, the outlook was not encouraging, with conditions in the first half of this year expected to be 'broadly similar to those in the previous six months'. Every part of the group 'is pursuing a demanding cost and profitability improvement programme', BP said. See Lex</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report NICKEL prices recovered some of their earlier losses during kerb trading on the LME in a rally away from 2 1/2 -year lows, but the market still ended weak. Dealers said nickel was undermined by depressed fundamental and negative technical factors, with investment fund and stop-loss selling outweighing producer support and Chinese demand. There is little physical interest or merchant activity at the moment, and with prices having fallen below Dollars 7,000 a tonne, declines towards Dollars 6,000 a tonne on technical considerations are possible. Three-month ZINC breached downside support below Dollars 1,380 as last week's upside momentum petered out. London's robusta COFFEE prices continued to edge towards the top of their recent Dollars 770 to Dollars 800 a tonne range in nearby November, although in quiet conditions. 'We just seem to be slowly and regularly moving upwards. The question is how we manage to get over the Dollars 800 resistance level,' one dealer said. New York arabica coffee was slightly lower at midday. Nymex PLATINUM futures remained higher at midsession following Monday's violence in South Africa, the world's biggest platinum producer.</p>

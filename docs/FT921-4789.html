			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Thorn EMI - Virgin: Down-to-earth ideas or flights of fancy?  -Richard Branson's unrealised horizons I'VE NEVER worked for a company that I didn't own and it will be a bit strange.' Mr Richard Branson was adjusting yesterday to his new role as president for life - but no longer owner  - of Virgin Music Group, which he created 20 years ago. His colleagues say that he had scarcely been involved in running the music business for the past few years, and he agrees. Nevertheless, he concedes the Pounds 510m sale was a wrench. But after 14 months of negotiations, mainly with the winner Thorn EMI, and with interjections from the world's largest media companies, his mind was clear. Where does the deal leave him? For a start, about Pounds 380m richer, after deducting the 25 per cent share of Fujisankei Communications, the Japanese group which was a partner in the music business for the past three years. The price marks a triumph in retrospect over the stock market's view of his creations. He floated Virgin Music, plus the Megastores record shops at Pounds 248m in 1986, but, battered by the October 1987 stock market crash and the market's scepticism of Mr Branson's ability to deliver long-term profits growth, the value fell to Pounds 142m. In exasperation, he took the businesses private at the original flotation price - three years later, Thorn has more than doubled his money. But the deal also marks a turning point in his commercial life. Virgin Music was the largest of the businesses he created and by a long way the most profitable. The main business he retains is Virgin Atlantic Airways, the airline he created eight years ago. He also keeps the Megastores and several computer games businesses. The challenge he faces is whether he can grow those businesses to match the music group's success, or whether, as his critics say, they will remain expensive hobbies. Mr Branson has fiercely denied that he was prompted to sell the record label because the airline was in need of cash. Nevertheless, it did not escape from the double hit of the Gulf war and fierce competition on transatlantic routes. Last year Voyager Travel Holdings, the holding company for the airline, saw its pre-tax profits cut from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 800,000. Within this, Virgin Atlantic made a Pounds 3m pre-tax loss, after taking a Pounds 6m profit on selling an aircraft. This loss was offset by a Pounds 3.3m profit on the tour operator linked to the airline. Part of the squeeze came from winning the right last year to fly out of Heathrow Airport, which brought heavy start-up costs - and head on competition with British Airways and American carriers. Although much larger, with hundreds of planes in their fleets compared to Virgin's eight, these airlines have accused it of cherry-picking the most profitable routes. Despite this vigorous commercial and public relations battle, Mr Branson has said that the airline could meet its immediate cash needs from its own resources. However he concedes that the airline needs more cash to fulfil his latest dream - to apply for routes to Johannesburg, Los Angeles and Chicago, and to take advantage of currently depressed prices to buy aircraft to fly those routes. To support these plans he has been negotiating to raise Pounds 55m by selling a 20 per cent stake in the airline. Despite yesterday's deal, he said: 'We've got a long way talking to two parties and it might be embarrassing to drop the talks now. We'll always see partners as part of our financing plans.' For the same reason, he may continue to search for a buyer for a 20 per cent stake in the continental record shops. But however ambitious his plans for the airline and stores, they will only absorb part of the sudden influx of cash. His latest dream is to run upmarket business rail services along British Rail's tracks, if the forthcoming white paper on rail permits this competition. His vision is remarkably precise - all seats will have seat-back video - although he emphasises Virgin has not begun detailed plans. He is, famously, not short of enthusiasm for new ventures, and yesterday's deal has given him the money to try them out. The next few years will show whether he can build a second half-billion pound business.</p>

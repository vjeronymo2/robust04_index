			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to rethink benefits Sir, Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint (February 17) concludes by suggesting greater targeting of benefits by means testing ('the sums would be much better used in improving income-related benefits and increasing their take-up'). The rise in targeting benefits by income has occurred throughout most of the EU states in the last decade. Although in itself attractive, the concept of greater means testing is prone to lead to less take-up of benefits. The reasons for individuals not to take up means-tested benefits are the stigma attached, the costs of claiming that arise, or a lack of sufficient information. The majority of non take-up is attributed to the former two: stigma is likely to be an intrinsic feature of means-tested benefits, and the process of means testing gives rise to costs to claimants. The fact remains take-up rates for non-means-tested benefits have always been considerably higher than those for means-tested benefits, in spite of attempts by governments to encourage the latter. For social security to survive into the next century, it is perhaps time to rethink social security benefits as we know them and, instead, to consider some of the other options such as a negative income tax.

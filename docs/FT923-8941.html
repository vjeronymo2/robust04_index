			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Rotork advances 11% and forecasts further progress ROTORK, the Bath-based valve control maker which exports three quarters of its products, lifted its pre-tax profit by 11 per cent in the six months to June 30. On turnover of Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 25.1m), the profit advanced to Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 4.35m) after the receipt of Pounds 400,000 in interest. The share price gained 6p to close at 323p. Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, attributed the group's strong performance to 'not being tied to the UK economy'. It also serviced basic industries providing fuel and heat, electricity and water. The proportion of its business that did lie in the UK had benefited from strong demand from the water companies. About 80 per cent of turnover came from the actuation division. Mr Eassie said the operation had a dozen overseas companies selling its valve control products. Fruitful areas had been the US oil and gas sectors, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. The business was driven by margin, not turnover. Rotork Instruments, which provides emergency shut-down systems, did not reach its interim turnover target but a good final quarter was in prospect. Rotork Analysis, a small venture in pollution monitoring equipment, was trading profitably. The group had added Pounds 800,000 cash to the Pounds 11m held at the year-end. With the order book ahead of last year, further progress was expected in the second half. Earnings per share rose to 10.5p (9.3p) and the interim dividend goes up to 4.65p (4.25p).</p>

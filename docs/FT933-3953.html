			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Brand new direction heralds flotation of Japan Tobacco - The company's plans JAPAN Tobacco, the government owned tobacco company set for privatisation early next year, is actively investing in new projects and introducing new cigarette brands ahead of the flotation. The company, the third largest tobacco company in the world, controls 83 per cent of Japan's Y3,000bn (Dollars 28.4bn) domestic tobacco market. JT been restructuring its business since 1985 - when the market was opened to foreign competition - reducing the number of distribution outlets by 36 per cent to 174 and the number of staff by 20 per cent to 24,000. Due partly to this rationalisation, its bank borrowings are low relative to other government-owned companies waiting to go public. Bank debt at JR East, the rail group about to be privatised, is more than 16 per cent of total assets: at JT the ratio is under 1 per cent. The company's operations and decisions on pricing are less regulated than at JR East and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-state owned telecom company. Japan's cigarette market is very mature. Mr Shigeru Mizuno, JT president, says: 'In terms of volume, the industry is declining.' Industry sales for the 12 months ended March 1992 fell 0.5 per cent to 272.6bn cigarettes. JT also faces growing competition from foreign tobacco companies, notably Philip Morris of the US which now hold 17 per cent of the market. Analysts predict that foreign companies will hold over 20 per cent of the market within the next few years. The company's competitiveness is clearly hampered by regulations over the amount of home grown raw tobacco it has to buy in. In general, Japanese tobacco costs between and three times more than foreign grown tobacco. Japanese tobacco makes up around 50 per cent of JT's tobacco purchases. JT is now looking to diversify. Mr Mizuno envisages growth in new business sectors such as foods, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and cigarette exports. The company entered the non-alcoholic beverage and pharmaceuticals market in 1988, and started a hot-dog chain in 1989. Its lily bulb business and an electric power switch manufacturing operation are among its more recent ventures. Exports account for less than 1 per cent of JT's total sales. It is targeting Asian cigarette markets, which unlike western markets, are still growing. Some 60 per cent of JT's overseas sales are in Asia. Analysts feel that some of the new projects will be slow to contribute to JT's profits. Mr Eizo Uchikura, of Nomura Research Institute, says property could make a near term contribution but JT's drug operations are unlikely to make a return before the end of the decade.</p>

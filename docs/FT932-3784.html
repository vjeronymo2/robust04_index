			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UN set for Somalia strike: Leslie Crawford sees the country sinking into a military quagmire LIKE THE rains now churning mud and garbage in Mogadishu's filthy streets, the United Nations' humanitarian intervention in Somalia is rapidly sinking into a military quagmire. The killing of 23 Pakistani Blue Helmets last Saturday has brought UN forces to the brink of war with Somalia's most defiant clan leader, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed. An air strike against his strongholds in the south of the capital was thought last night to be imminent, now that the evacuation of almost 500 UN civilian staff and international aid workers to Nairobi has been completed. In a sign that retaliation was planned, the United Nations Operation in Somalia (Unosom) decided to close Mogadishu airport to all civilian flights from midnight last night. Only Unosom flights and military aircraft will be permitted to land until further notice. Earlier, the US ordered the aircraft carrier Wasp and three other ships to leave the Gulf and stand by for possible action in Somalia. The ships carry 2,200 Marines who have previously served in Somalia. The handful of aid workers who remain in Mogadishu have retreated into heavily fortified compounds. UN troops are combing the suburbs for weapons and have reboubled security at key installations. Military reinforcements, including US AC 130 Spectre precision bombers, are said to be within striking distance of Mogadishu. In a final attempt to avert another bloodbath, the UN delivered a letter to Gen Aideed demanding he hand over those responsible for Saturday's slaughter  -the deadliest single strike against its peacekeepers in over 30 years. The letter is also believed to have included an ultimatum to the warlord: disarm your militias, hand over your weapons and close down your radio station, or face the consequences. But Thursday night's broadcast on Gen Aideed's 'Voice of the Somali Masses' clandestine radio station continued to pour vitriol over the UN's presence in Somalia. It called on UN troops to leave the country and warned that the next message would be 'written in blood.' At a press conference yesterday, however, Gen Aideed appeared to be adopting a more conciliatory stance, although he placed the blame for last weekend's clashes on UN peacekeepers. He asked the UN to appoint an independent commission to investigate the incident. He said the death toll had risen to 89, while another 350 people were wounded. The UN and Gen Aideed continue to give differing accounts of what happened last Saturday. The UN says Pakistani soldiers were ambushed at several points of the city in a premeditated and orchestrated attack. Gen Aideed insists that he no longer commands militias or weapons and that the clashes were a spontaneous uprising. As the military tension escalates, the original ideals that inspired the UN's unprecedented humanitarian mission in Somalia appear to lie in the rubble of the war-torn capital. 'The relief work is dead,' says Jamie McGoldrick, one of only three Save the Children Fund foreign staff to remain in Mogadishu. 'This has become a purely military operation.' Although Mr McGoldrick is still managing to deliver a few emergency medical supplies to hospitals, the 35 feeding centres in the Somali capital are closed. Some 200,000 people in the capital who rely on food rations are going hungry. Meanwhile, 15,000 tonnes of food are lying idle in the port. Outside the capital, UN spokesman Faruq Malawi says food stocks will last 10 days. It is not only months of relief work that have gone to waste. Last Saturday's killings also destroyed the UN's faltering efforts to broker a political reconciliation between rival Somali clans. Since a UN-sponsored peace conference in Addis Ababa in March, mediators had achieved some success in negotiating local truces and bringing the clan elders together. Such tentative diplomatic gains are now at risk. In weighing its response to Gen Aideed's aggression, the UN will have to consider not only its international reputation and role as peacekeeper, but its responsibilities towards a country it has adopted as a de facto protectorate. In private, UN officials say they cannot afford to let the terrorist actions of a gun-toting warlord go unpunished. But retaliation could trigger a wave of sympathy for Gen Aideed and unite rival warlords against UN troops. The 18,300-peacekeeping force would come to be regarded as an occupying foreign army. Already, Somalis regard the UN intervention as humiliating evidence of their inability to manage their own affairs. 'The UN wants to destroy and humiliate Aideed in front of his people,' says Mr McGoldrick. He fears the multinational force underestimates the size of Gen Aideed's constituency - thousands of young men who, by his patronage, can carve out an easy existence from looting, extortion and banditry. They have a vested interest in anarchy. On the streets of the Somali capital this week, there was much brave talk of rallying to Gen Aideed's defence. There is no shortage of guns. Mogadishu was awash with unfounded rumours of UN cruelty against the local residents - 40 hostages held, three Somalis killed, arbitrary arrests. Hostility towards their would-be benefactors was palpable. Others were cutting their losses. War refugees who had sought a safe haven in Mogadishu were leaving the capital in droves. One entrepreneur, who supplied electricity from looted generators to much of south Mogadishu, shut down his business this week and packed his bags. A sign outside his shop said: 'No More War.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Reliable information from Fatah sources indicates  that Khalid al-Hasan, considered one of Fatah's historic leaders  and the most prominent member of Fatah's founding Central  Committee, is currently thinking of emerging from the isolation  that he imposed on himself following the signing of the Oslo  accord and is planning to launch an opposition political party.    It is common knowledge that al-Hasan enjoys the support of  sectors in Fatah as he was the first to broach the issue of a  political settlement with Israel. However, he opposed the  current peace process and the agreements stemming from it  because they do not respond to the Palestinian people's minimum  national rights, as he viewed and continues to view them in his  theory for a settlement.</p>

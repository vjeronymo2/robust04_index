			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Two more banks may limit pay rises BARCLAYS Bank and Lloyds Bank are expected to follow the lead of National Westminster Bank and offer no general pay increase this year, David Goodhart writes. Lloyds said it was permanently abandoning general increases in favour of pay rises based only on performance. It is the first big clearing bank to propose a performance-only pay system. It expects about 75 per cent of its 48,000 staff to get some pay rise this year, but the banking union, Bifu, said only 25 per cent of staff would be assured of a pay rise. Barclays said it had not decided its response to the claim. But Bifu said the bank had rejected it, and 'we expect them to make a nil offer'. A second one-day strike planned for tomorrow against job losses at the TSB bank has been postponed after talks at Acas, the conciliation service, which will resume on Monday.</p>

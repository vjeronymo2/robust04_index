			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UN to send Georgia team The United Nations Security Council decided yesterday to establish a UN observer mission in Georgia, comprising up to 88 military observers plus minimal support staff, Reuter reports from New York. It will be the first team the UN has sent to any of the republics of the former Soviet Union. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general, recommended recently that the mission be set up to monitor compliance with the July 27 ceasefire agreement between the government of Georgia and Abkhazian rebels.</p>

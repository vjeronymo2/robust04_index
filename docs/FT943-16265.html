			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Feel-good factor leads UK growers into danger - Plans for increased spending may be an over-reaction to short-term financial benefits The crops beside the road between my farm in Norfolk and the Royal Agricultural Showground in Warwickshire confirmed my judgment that, in spite of the late spring, the grain harvest would begin at about the usual time in a few weeks. Winter sown barley had turned from green to cream and the hot, dry spell over much of southern England had begun to ripen wheat as well. Indeed there were patches in many fields along the road where the short sharp summer drought had caused crops to die off rather than mature gently; and that bodes ill for potential yields. But even though my car windscreen quickly became splattered with dead aphids, which in large numbers can cause serious damage to cereal crops, I concluded that there was little I could economically do at this stage to influence the result of the harvest and continued on to the show. The cereal variety plots, grown by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany for demonstration purposes on the showground, gave a similar picture. It was interesting to note the emphasis the institute now gives to natural resistance to or tolerance of pests and diseases. Growers are advised to select for such characteristics (defined in NIAB literature) for economic as well as environmental reasons. But it is not as simple and uncomplicated as that. Yield penalties on winter sown wheat, where no fungicides are used, can, according to the NIAB, be as high as 33 per cent and are seldom less than 14 per cent. Clearly a judicious and limited usage of chemical is these days most appropriate in order to optimise yield and maximise profit. A few years ago yield was everything and most farmers applied whatever it took to achieve the maximum. Some of us believe we are a bit more sophisticated today. Meanwhile there is a real danger that the recent short-term improvement in UK farmers' fortunes, which is not shared by most other EU farmers and is based almost entirely on the accident of sterling's devaluation, might promote a false sense of long-term security across the industry. Moreover a survey by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which stages the Royal Show, suggests that may already be happening. Each year the society attempts to measure the mood of the agricultural sector. The results of the poll it took among its members last autumn, which almost by definition are bigger than the average farmer in England, indicate that, based on increases in income, some confidence has returned to the industry following the devaluation. More than three quarters of respondents said they were planning to invest in their businesses within 12 months, the majority intending to buy machinery. A further devaluation of the green pound last Friday triggered by the recent decline in the value of the pound against other European currencies, adds about 1.25 per cent to farm price guarantees and area payments for set-aside and the like. On the face of it this appears to justify the ebullient mood which has already resulted in significant increases in sales of tractors to UK farmers. According to the Agricultural Engineers Association 1993 saw a rise in new tractor sales of 33 per cent and during the first six months of 1994 the figure is up 9.7 per cent on the same period in 1993. Some industry pundits predict that the trade will continue to increase while others suggest the year-end figure will be similar to last year's. Meanwhile manufacturers, who cut back capacity during several years of declining sales, are finding it difficult to keep up with demand. It seems churlish to question the wisdom of all this business during a colourful and jolly trade event like the Royal Show. But I am not the only one doing so. The government's Agricultural Development and Advisory Service is also counselling caution. In a comprehensive strategy document, launched at the show, ADAS points out that the profitability of arable farming 'has now passed its peak and will continue to decline as CAP (the European Community's common agricultural policy) reform measures take effect'. The document considers each sector of agriculture and horticulture in turn and projects the effects of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement as it too is implemented. It concludes that reform measures and the single EU market will intensify competition for home sales; that the Gatt deal will increase competition on export markets; and that a further and much more financially stringent reform of the CAP is inevitable within the next two or three years. 'A two-speed agriculture could develop' says ADAS, 'with the larger, dynamic businesses taking the lions share, with the remainder relying on EU support for their contributions to the wider economy.' And the agency urges farmers with ambitions to be in the dynamic group to adapt their business practices to ensure success. One of the changes necessary is to keep tight control of expenditure. Those booming tractor sales may be good for the farm machinery trade in the short term, but they suggest to me that some of those who have been buying have not yet learned that lesson.</p>

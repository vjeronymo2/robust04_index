			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 2  February; source follows in parentheses after each item.    The Salvadoran economy has been growing at a rate of 5  percent for the last two years, which denotes a strong economic  growth in all areas, according to Central Reserve Bank (BCR)  spokesmen. Economic growth was reported mainly in the areas of  construction, services, the manufacturing industry, and  commerce. "The country is no longer dependent on foreign aid.  The U.S. reduction in aid should not have a major impact on the  economy," the BCR spokesmen have said. (San Salvador EL DIARIO  DE HOY in Spanish 27 Jan 94 p 29)    The cost of living increased by 1,115 colons in the past  four  years, showing that the economic growth mentioned by the  government has not helped the poor. According to investigations  conducted by the Consumer Protection Center (CDC), the poor in  El Salvador do not benefit from the country's economic growth.  Purchasing power has dropped by 18 percent in rural areas due  to the inflation rate in the past few years. There has been a  16-percent drop in urban areas, and there is a concentration of  wealth in a few hands, the CDC states. (San Salvador Radio  Venceremos Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 27 Jan 94)    Salvadoran exports reached $1.022 billion in 1993, which is  $448 million more than in 1989, the BCR announced on 31 January.  Guatemala is the leading importer of Salvadoran products,  according to the BCR. Forty-two percent of all exports in 1993  went to Central America, 30 percent to the United States, and 7  percent to Germany. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2324 GMT 31 Jan  94)    Official sources said on 2 February the Salvadoran  Government  increased credits for the agriculture sector by $199,000 in the  last four years. The BCR said the sector received $149,000 in  credits in 1989, but in 1993 it had increased to $348,000. A  BCR communique also stated there was an increase in the  production of basic grains from 18.4 million quintals in 1989 to  more than 21 million quintals in 1993.

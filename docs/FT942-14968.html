			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / China warned as economic expansion heads for 11.5% China is heading for 11.5 per cent economic growth this year, compared with a government target of 9 per cent, according to a leading Chinese research institution, which warns the authorities they have yet to get a grip on inflation. In another sign of official concern at the overheating of the economy, the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has introduced a moratorium on investment funds, which it fears are contributing to speculation and draining savings needed to finance government bond issues. China's Academy of Social Sciences believes the booming economy, which grew 13 per cent last year, will begin to slow, but it says the government has been too optimistic in its forecasts for a slowdown. Economists at the academy, regarded as the leading Chinese 'think-tank' on the economy, expressed concern about the continuing surge in inflation. Cost-of-living increases in urban centres are more than 25 per cent up on the same period last year. The Chinese government is engaged in the delicate task of reining in its runaway economy, while avoiding the kind of abrupt dislocation that contributed to the social unrest of the late 1980s. The authorities have been seeking to puncture a boom in capital spending which has been one of the chief causes of inflation. Growth in fixed-asset investment is forecast to slow this year to 12 per cent compared with last year's 50 per cent surge. The credit squeeze appears to be taking its toll on the state sector, according to figures released by the State Statistical Bureau, which showed that output by state firms, half of them in the red, grew by just 2.2 per cent in the first quarter. That compared with output growth of 32.1 per cent for collectives, including township enterprises, and 79.1 per cent for other sectors such as joint ventures. Meanwhile, the People's Bank declared the moratorium on new domestic investment funds in a further attempt to reinforce central controls over an unruly financial sector and channel domestic savings towards the purchase of government bonds. China's official Business Weekly reported that about 50 funds had been established with about Yn4.5bn (Pounds 354m) under their control. Only four had been approved by the central bank. China is relying on the sale of some Yn115bn of treasury bonds to fund its 1994 domestic deficit which is expected to reach Yn67bn. It also faces heavy debt service obligations on borrowings for infrastructure. The freeze on investment funds will not affect foreign-related investment vehicles.</p>

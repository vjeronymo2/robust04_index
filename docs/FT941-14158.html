			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Major stands by Owen in wake of no-confidence vote The British government yesterday sprang to the defence of Lord Owen, the European Union's mediator for former Yugoslavia, after the European Parliament passed an embarrassing vote of no confidence in the former UK foreign secretary. Mr John Major, the prime minister, issued a statement declaring full support for Lord Owen. 'David Owen has not spared himself in the search for a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. He has worked unremittingly and courageously to try to help bring this about and he enjoys the full support of the British government,' Mr Major said. Lord Owen said yesterday he intended to stay on in his role in spite of the resolution by Conservative and Liberal MEPs, passed in Strasbourg by a narrow majority of 106 to 95, urging the EU to replace him. He said it was an open secret that he wanted to quit the task, but had agreed to help EU foreign ministers through the current crisis. Asked whether he would now resign, Lord Owen said: 'There's no question of it.' His role is not directly threatened by the MEPs' vote, since he was unanimously appointed by member governments. However, there can be little doubt that his credibility has taken a knock. British Conservative and Labour MEPs failed in a rare show of unity to defeat the resolution to find another mediator 'endowed with an appropriate mandate and a new strategy for exercising it'. MEPs appeared determined to express their dissatisfaction at Lord Owen's failure to find a breakthrough in the latest Geneva talks, which broke down on Wednesday, after nearly two years of inter-ethnic conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, yesterday said he was launching urgent contacts with France's European partners, the US and Russia to review the situation in the light of the latest failure of the warring factions to agree on a three-way division of Bosnia among its Serb, Moslem and Croatian populations. The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said withdrawing the United Nations Protection Force was one possible option, which is also being considered by the British government. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is due to visit British forces in Bosnia today to explore the choices facing the government, including a pull-out at the end of the spring. But officials in several western capitals warned that a withdrawal of UN troops also entailed enormous risks. It would almost certainly lead to bloodier fighting in Bosnia and could trigger a wider conflagration in the Balkans. Meanwhile, General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of France's rapid reaction force, is being tipped as successor to General Jean Cot, head of the UN Protection Force. Gen Cot ran foul of UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali for publicly criticising his refusal to authorise air strikes.

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plans to abstain in Maastricht vote LABOUR MPs will be ordered to abstain in next week's vote on legislation to ratify the controversial Maastricht agreement on European Community treaty changes, the shadow cabinet agreed unanimously last night. Their decision guarantees the government a comfortable majority on the issue and brings to an end an impassioned debate within the Parliamentary Labour party. At a heavily attended weekly meeting of the PLP, about eight MPs argued vigorously that the party had several grounds on which it could justifiably vote against the government. But Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, warned that to oppose the legislation would be inconsistent with Labour's stance at the general election. He was backed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, who wound up the hour-long debate by reminding MPs that an opposing vote could be used against the party at the next election. Mr Stan Orme, the PLP chairman, argued that the Tory rebellion would be limited and the Liberal Democrats would almost certainly vote with the Conservatives. Liberal Democrat MPs agreed last night to support the Maastricht legislation on its second reading. But they will attempt to force debates during its passage on Economic and Monetary Union, the European parliament and the social chapter. The leadership's decision means Labour will table an amendment criticising the government's European stance, but will abstain on the main motion. But some Labour rebels can be expected to defy the whips and vote against. Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood was last night elected unopposed as the party's new chief whip. He replaces Mr Jim Wallace, the member for Orkney and Shetland, who becomes leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.</p>

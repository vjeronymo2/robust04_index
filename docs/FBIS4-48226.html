			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service] </F>   [Text] President Nelson Mandela has taken note of an  article in the London SUNDAY TIMES claiming that he may retire  within two years as president of South Africa. The president  expresses his displeasure with the totally unfounded and  malicious disinformation published by the London SUNDAY TIMES.  The article has absolutely no factual basis, and is nothing  more than rumour mongering written with the intention to create  uncertainty about South Africa's first democratically elected  government. President Mandela wishes to state categorically  that he intends to remain in office for the full term that he  had been elected to. The people of South Africa have given the  president a clear mandate, and he intends to fulfill that  mandate to the fullest.</p>

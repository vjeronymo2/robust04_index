			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: MoDo sells packaging unit to AssiDoman AssiDoman plans to strengthen its position in European packaging papers by acquiring MoDo Packaging from MoDo, its fellow Swedish pulp and paper group, in a deal worth SKr1.2bn (Dollars 167m). The move increases AssiDoman's market share in sack paper, expands its position in the important UK and German markets, and creates co-ordination benefits. MoDo Packaging comprises a pulp and paper mill at Skarblacka in Sweden and two sack companies in England (Papropack) and Germany (Herkules). The unit made a SKr36m operating profit on sales of SKr1.01bn in the first half of 1994, compared with a SKr16m profit and sales of SKr955m in the same 1993 period. Mr Lennart Ahlgren, AssiDoman president, said the purchase represented 'a major step on the way to a position of leadership in Europe in packaging paper'. Mr Bengt Pettersson, MoDo chief executive, said the group was selling the smallest part of its paper business, and would make a modest capital gain on the transaction. 'This will enable us to focus on fine papers, printing paper and carton-board,' he said. It clears the way for MoDo to approve a SKr2.1bn investment in a new newsprint machine without having to fund the move through a rights issue. MoDo will give a final decision on the project later this month. The purchase will lift the annual sales of AssiDoman, which was partly privatised by the Swedish government earlier this year, by SKr2.1bn to about SKr18bn. This means it will overtake MoDo in size to become Sweden's third largest forestry group The purchase will increase AssiDoman's share of the European market for unbleached sack paper from 18 per cent to 26 per cent and its share of the bleached sack paper market from 24 per cent to 32 per cent.</p>

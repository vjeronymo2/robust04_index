			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second of seven installments: Report on interview with Hu </F> Angang [5170 7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342]  specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation,  under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, by staff reporter Liu Lu  (0491 7216); place, date not given: "Economic Conversion and  System Defects Cause Corruption; Obstacles to Anticorruption  Drive Come From Within CPC"]    [Text] I asked Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang: What are the  root causes of corruption in China's realities?    They answered: "The national situation report `Thoroughly  Eliminating Corruption Through Institutional Innovation' makes  it clear that current corruption is mainly the corruption of the  system. The main root causes of corrupt phenomena are the  defects of the existing systems in the period of the  market-oriented economic restructuring. In the process of  transforming the economy into a market economy, differences  exist between market prices and official prices. The larger the  differences, the stronger the motivations for giving and taking  bribes will become, and the more serious the corrupt phenomena  will become. In the past, officials often were assumed to be  "selfless." This assumption can hardly become true in economic  society. As defects exist in the systems, honest people may  rapidly become corrupt once they have power. The only solution  is system innovation. In addition, the corruption activities  also are related to the government's excessive interference in  the market. If there were no market distortion and no special  monopoly position caused by the government's excessive  interference, there would be no foundation for the giving and  taking of bribes.    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: "In our report, we also  point out explicitly that the obstacles to the anticorruption  drive on the Chinese mainland come primarily from with the CPC,  and find their main expression in special interest groups of  various types led by the Communists. The Communist Party is not  a monolith, nor does everyone inside the party share the same  interests and act in unison. Inside the party and within the  state apparatus various special and independent economic  interest groups and political interest groups have appeared.  This is one of the most important characteristics of the  prominent changes in the Chinese social structure since the  beginning of reform.    The report summarizes the main characteristics of the  special  interest groups into following points:    -- Having the motivation of seeking and expanding their own  interests to the maximum, and taking this as their purpose.  They care only about increasing their own groups' gains and do  not consider the losses in the aggregate social wealth.    -- Having the attributes of benefit-sharing groups, as they  participate in the distribution of social resources and profits.  Although they account for only a very small proportion of the  population, they always are able to gain a much larger  proportion of economic resources.    -- Having the character of being exclusive and holding a  monopoly position. They exclude other groups from the  benefit-sharing activities, block the free movement of economic  factors, oppose the participation of other competitive rivals,  and strive to increase their monopoly in society. When  resisting external threats and rectification, they also may  collaborate in order to protect each other, thus forming complex  connection networks.    -- Having strong influence and causing "government  ineffectiveness." They try to influence government policies,  and even the top-level policy-making body, by every possible  means. They demand excessive government interference or even  direct interference by top decision-makers in order to obtain  certain economic prerogatives or favorable policies. They also  try by every possible means to oppose and obstruct the adoption  of some reform measures that favor fair competition.    -- The vested interests are rather "rigid." That is, they  can only increase and must not decrease the absolute interests  they have gained, and the shares they gain can only increase and  must not decrease.    Hu and Kang said: The above-mentioned characteristics  determine that any major measure for reforming the existing  systems inevitably will encounter strong opposition from the  special interest groups. For example, many interest groups  opposed the measures to lower import tariffs, lift import  controls, and remove the foreign trade monopoly system. The  difficulties in market-oriented reforms lie in the handling of  such special interest groups.</p>

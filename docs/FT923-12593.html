			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: A wise man's gold - The connoisseurship of Philip Pouncey THE glorious 'Hommage a Philip Pouncey' at the Musee du Louvre in Paris accomplishes two goals. It is an affectionate tribute to the extraordinary achievement of an English art historian who without doubt knew more about Italian Renaissance drawing than any one ever has. It is also a celebration of the exacting if now unfashionable science - or is it art? - of connoisseurship. When the editor of The Burlington Magazine dropped 'for connoisseurs' from the title in 1948, he did so because the word connoisseur had come to conjure up a comic image of an 'elderly gentleman in white bow tie and trim imperial. . . In one hand he holds a fat cigar and in the other a magnifying glass through which he peers knowingly at the contours of an oriental vase.' Today, connoisseurship itself tends to be dismissed as unimportant by proponents of the new art history. What these historians conveniently fail to acknowledge was well understood by Philip Pouncey and his great precursors, such as Bernard Berenson, and Crowe and Cavalcaselle. Familiarity with an individual artist's style to the point of being able to define it and distinguish it from that of another, is fundamental to any real understanding of art. In the case of Renaissance drawings, almost none of which are signed or documented, an attribution to a particular hand is not easily attained. It may be established by an analysis of style - the 'handwriting' of a draughtsman - or, when possible, by association with a known painting, which depends on extraordinary knowledge and visual memory. Even after this, a sense of quality is required to distinguish original from copy. Stories of Mr Pouncey's feats of memory, and of his capacity to empathise with particular artistic personalities, have become legendary. There is the tale of the drawing of a crouching male nude by Bastianino, an obscure Ferrarese imitator of Michelangelo by whom no drawings were known to survive. 'If Bastianino had made drawings,' declared Mr Pouncey, 'this is exactly the sort of drawing that one would have expected of him.' Sure enough, an altarpiece by the artist subsequently came to light containing a figure for which the drawing was a study. He recognised another sheet as by the 16th century Veronese artist Domenico Brusasorci, and added that it looked like a study for a painting on slate. The relating picture was found in Hungary. Its support was, of course, slate. Such off-the-cuff insights are witness to a rare combination of virtuosity and single-mindedness. They came out of a passion for paintings and drawings and after a lifetime of looking in the churches, museums, galleries and private collections of Europe and, latterly, the US - and of looking long and hard. His French wife Myril, an equally indefatigable traveller and help-meet, recalls their itineraries. Holiday leave was always taken in one lump to make the annual trip longer and, given their very limited means, cheaper. It might include spending every day for three weeks in the Albertina in Vienna, but time in France and Italy was essential. Myril arranged Italian trips around exhibitions and any artist Philip was particularly interested in at the time. A typical day would start with two churches before breakfast of a 'cappuccino-brioche' - 'we never sat in a cafe ever, it took too much time'. After churches and museums closed, there would be simple picnics of bread and cheese, and a siesta, before starting again when things opened in the afternoon. If they did not open, Philip was miraculous at procuring keys or custodians. Once, in Brescia, he was even embraced by a nun because he told her things she had not known about the life of the founder of her order, Santa Angela de Merici. These were the days before the proliferation of the illustrated art book. Photography of interesting paintings and drawings had to be commissioned, and was expensive. It is not surprising that Philip Pouncey should have left the British Museum to go to work for Sotheby's in 1966, lured by the prospect of three months travelling a year and as many photographs as he wished. Even when well into their 70s, the Pounceys - ever curious, and also ever generous with their expertise - could be seen returning to spend yet another day at an exhibition most other art historians had left after an hour or two. Philip Pouncey dedicated his energies and his extraordinary gifts to establishing the drawn oeuvres of vast numbers of Italian artists who, when he embarked on his studies in the 1930s, were often no more than shadowy figures. The discoveries he made, even in list form, make for a file of astonishing thickness. When he first visited the Cabinet des Dessins at the Louvre in 1946, for instance, the Italian drawings had never been systematically studied. Thousands of anonymous drawings languished in boxes filed not even by school or area, but by subject. Over the years, he gave an identity - and restored life - to some 500 sheets, 114 of which are on show. As this exhibition eloquently reveals, he was not merely engaged in a pedantic naming of names, but was also, and more significantly, a prospector extracting nuggets of pure gold from the surrounding mud. Glinting for our delight, for instance, is arguably the most beautiful and most miraculously preserved drawing by Sebastiano del Piombo, a quivering female nude study in black chalk, heightened with white, on blue paper. Its discovery also allows us to see the way in which the artist, not uncharacteristically for his age, hardened and stylised the girl in the finished painting. We owe our knowledge of countless petit-maitres to the connoisseurship of Mr Pouncey. That is why it is so fitting that important drawings by particular favourites such as Coreggio, Peruzzi and Lotto should take a bow here. On show are two sheets by Lorenzo Lotto, an eccentric but great artist, almost all of whose known drawings were discovered by Philip Pouncey. 'L'oeil du connaisseur: hommage a Philip Pouncey' continues at the Pavillon de Flore, Musee du Louvre, Paris, until September 7. Further exhibitions of drawings attributed by Philip Pouncey (1910-90), are planned at the Uffizi in Florence at the end of this year, and at the British Museum in 1994.</p>

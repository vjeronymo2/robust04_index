			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW VICTORIA PUB;  </P> <P> TASTY CRUMBLE;  </P> <P> ROSE CURTAINS, UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS AND PANELING GIVE THE VENTURA RESTAURANT A  SUBDUED ELEGANCE.  </P> <P> When I first heard about the Victoria Pub, I pictured waitresses in saucy  costumes slinging tankards of beer to boisterous customers. Then, when I called  to ask about reservations, I was assured by the cheerful British voice on the  phone that the bar served "pub grub" at all hours. I almost stayed home.  </P> <P> But I'd invited my mother to have dinner with the kids and my husband, and she  loved the idea of an English restaurant. I'm glad we went with her instincts.  The restaurant does have something of a theme quality to it, but it also has a  measure of authenticity and earnestness that I found appealing.  </P> <P> The bar is patterned after an English pub, and judging from the liveliness of  the crowd, it has succeeded in becoming a "neighborhood" social scene -- in  spite of being located right in the middle of a shopping center. There's even a  dart room where the competition is quite intense. (Bring your own darts, but  remember, Monday is league night.)  </P> <P> The restaurant has an entirely different mood from the bar. With heavy rose  curtains, upholstered chairs and wood paneling everywhere, it has the subdued  elegance of an English gentlemen's club. And the menu is as English as the  ambience.  </P> <P> I fell in love with the sounds of the kiddie menu: "Captain Pigwash fish  fingers," "small bangers with bubbles" and "crumble of the day."  </P> <P> The adult fare, however, was somewhat harder to judge. The salad, for instance,  tasted quite peculiar, as if the vinegar had been left out. Was this  authentically English and therefore acceptable? The vegetables, on the other  hand, were beautifully cooked. Aren't the English supposed to overcook their  vegetables?  </P> <P> Smoked salmon with wheat toast and dill mayonnaise was lovely, and the Brie  baked in puff pastry and served with jam and fresh fruit was singularly  satisfying. The soups were marvelous. A carrot soup with coriander and the  pleasant texture of pureed carrots was delicious. And a chicken soup with  mushrooms was exquisitely flavored with a touch of sherry.  </P> <P> Steak and onion pie, while not quite a pie (it had a layer of puff pastry  perched on top) was a decent meal of beef chunks in dark gravy with mashed  potatoes and vegetables on the side. This and the Cornish pasty would certainly  satisfy one's appetite for good, plain, honest food.  </P> <P> Chicken Piccadilly was a potent, Caribbean-inspired dish with a sweet sauce  full of banana bites, corn bits and rum-flavored cream. Beef salad consisted of  thin rolls of sliced cold roast beef on a bed of crisp salad and vegetables. I  really liked the salad that came with the beef, although it floated on a lake  of soy sauce.  </P> <P> My mother ordered the best meal of all. She had the Somerset lamb, a perfectly  cooked, generous portion of lamb -- a steak, not a chop -- with a hearty mint  sauce on the side. And just to prove it hadn't been a fluke, she also ordered  the best dessert -- out of a lineup of very good ones. She had the crumble of  the day, a fresh fruit cobbler, which happened to be rhubarb -- her favorite.  Hot, slightly tart fruit covered with sweet, crunchy "crumbles" in a bowl of  cream. She finished with an excellent pot of tea, then insisted that her skill  in ordering well was the result of a trip to London. I think she was just  lucky, but I'm taking her back to the restaurant next time I go.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> Victoria Pub and Restaurant, 1413F S.

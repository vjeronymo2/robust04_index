Some bright signs continue to emerge in consumption, and  business confidence "has virtually stopped deteriorating," but  the labor situation continues to worsen gradually and overall  and "economic growth remains weak," the central bank said in its  monthly economic review.    "While several economic indicators have recently improved,  and the economy appears to have stopped weakening, this does not  necessarily confirm that economic recovery is in the offing,"  the report says.    It cannot be ruled out that a recovery may be building, but  statistics do not confirm such a movement, a BOJ told reporters.    Spending by manufacturers on plant and equipment continues  to  fall, and excess capital stock remains a drag on the economy,  the report says. But such leading indicators as "machinery  orders and construction starts appear to have stopped  declining," it says.    "Personal consumption remains weak," the report says, with  gains in sales of refrigerators and personal computers, as well  as the number of Japanese travelers.    Large-scale retail and passenger car sales are down but the  declines from year-earlier levels are slimming, it says.    Housing investment remains strong, while public works  spending has slowed in the last year and a half, the report says.    Exports have picked up recently from a falling trend on  stronger overseas demand and a fiscal year-end increase, it  says, while ''imports, particularly consumer goods, have  continued to increase.''    It notes that the BOJ's closely watched ''tankan'' survey of  business sentiment, taken in February, found corporations  predicting profits will begin to rise in the coming fiscal year,  even as they again lowered their profit estimates for the  business year ending this month.    It cites a recent Ministry of International Trade and  Industry report that industrial production rose in January from  earlier large declines and is expected to swell in the following  two months.    But the report calls the rise a ''temporary surge toward the  fiscal year end,'' and the underlying trend remains flat, the  official said.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome finds buyer for environmental health arm WELLCOME Foundation, the pharmaceuticals group, continued its rationalisation with the sale of its environmental health division to Roussel Uclaf, the French company, for Pounds 43m. The division, which sells pyrephrum as an insecticide for household and environmental public health, and protecting wood and stored grain, had turnover in 1990 of about Pounds 83m. Wellcome said the net tangible assets to be sold were worth Pounds 32.5m. The sale is part of Wellcome's drive to become a pure pharmaceutical company. Sir Alistair Frame, chairman, announced in 1990 that the company would be examining all aspects of its business to improve efficiency and financial performance. Last year it sold Calmic International, its hygiene services business, to Rentokil and its vaccines operations to Medeva, the fast-growing UK pharmaceutical group. Roussel Uclaf was assisted in negotiations by JP Morgan, the US bank. Roussel Uclaf would become one of the world's leading environmental health companies following its acquisition, said Dr Pascal Housset, managing director of the group's agrovet division. Sales in the agrovet division should reach Pounds 450m in 1992, he added. In 1991 the division's operations represented 26 per cent of Roussel's turnover.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY CUTS FILM FEES TO ATTRACT MOVIE MAKERS  </P> <P> Monrovia City Council members, in a bid to lure Hollywood production companies  to Monrovia's quiet streets, have approved an ordinance to cut filming fees by  about two-thirds.  </P> <P> The first day of shooting will now cost $150 instead of $468, and charges for  each additional day are down from $234.50 to $75.  </P> <P> The amendment was prompted by a request from the California Film Commission,  which is trying to promote film production in the state. The commission was  created after California lost $3 billion worth of movie production to other  states in 1988.  </P></p>

"It is a fact for all to see that since 1949 and since  the implementation of reforms in China, tremendous progress has  been made," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said.    Wu reiterated Beijing's opposition to U.S. President Bill  Clinton's decision to link the renewal of China's most-favoured-  nation status this year with "significant progress" in its human  hights record. "Trade is after all trade," Wu said. "We are  categorically opposed to any linkage of trade with issues  irrelevant to trade." He also stressed that it was not for  foreign countries to comment on China's human rights policy.  "It is the Chinese government and the Chinese people themselves  who care most about human rights ... and who have the right to  evaluate human rights in China."    Despite its overwhelmingly negative conclusions, the State  Department draft report praised China for engaging in human  rights dialogue with the United States and releasing some  political prisoners. Human rights is expected to be the focus  of a possible meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that might  be held at the end of January in Paris, Geneva or New York. The  issue will also be raised when U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen visits Beijing on January 19 for trade talks with  Chinese leaders.</p>

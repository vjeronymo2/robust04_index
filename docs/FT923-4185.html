			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gains trimmed in very thin trading A GRUDGING response to the meeting of EC finance ministers in the UK over the weekend brought a modest rally in UK share prices yesterday, but gains were halved when sterling stumbled below the important DM2.80 quotation at mid-session. However, the outstanding feature of the first session of the new equity account was the poor level of turnover in a market lacking a lead from Wall Street, which was closed for Labor Day. The lack of business in equities left the stock index futures market to provide the impetus. In spite of the pledge that the Bundesbank would not lift interest rates 'in present circumstances', UK stocks opened lower as London securities houses resolved to take no risks on a Wall Street holiday. However, with sterling firmer and stock index futures better, shares soon turned higher and the FT-SE Index registered a gain of 23.5 at 2,385.7, the day's peak, around lunchtime. Trading volume was well under 200m shares at that point, and many share prices had barely been tested. The shine disappeared from the stock market as sterling turned back from its early gains, both on the short sterling and the foreign exchange cash market. Traders sounded uneasy as the pound began to slip back towards the levels seen prior to Thursday's announcement of a Pounds 7.27bn support loan for the pound. Early gains in shares were steadily eroded and Seaq volume increased somewhat as marketmakers, still unwilling to hold positions, passed parcels of stock around the market. Equities steadied at the close as sterling tried to rally and the final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,372.2 was a net 10 points up. Seaq volume of 299.8m shares compared pitifully with the 546.7m recorded on Friday. Traders pointed out that retail, or customer, business in equities yesterday must have fallen far short of the Pounds 923.5m seen on Friday. Little heed was paid to the UK consumer credit figures for July, showing a sharp and unexpected increase in new credit. The stock market was bracing itself for this week's heavy list of corporate trading results which, traders hope, may provide some indication that the worst of the economic recession has now been seen. In particular, the market is on alert for any further dividend cuts, a factor which continued to weigh on sentiment in the building sector. Reports in the UK press that some stores had seen improved sales levels failed to excite retail shares. The stock market is awaiting the August retail price index, due on Friday, with confidence. The annualised headline number is expected to jump to 3.8 per cent, reflecting distortions caused by a drop in mortgage rates 12 months ago. The underlying rate, however, is likely to show a further dip and to find a warm welcome in the City. But for the short term, that is to say until September 20, the date of the French ref-erendum on the Maastricht proposals, the UK stock market will remain on tenterhooks, with all eyes fixed firmly on the sterling/D-Mark exchange rate.</p>

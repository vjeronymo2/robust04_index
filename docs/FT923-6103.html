			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Thomson urges rivals to cut number of holidays next year THOMSON, the UK's biggest travel company, urged its competitors yesterday to cut the number of holidays on offer for 1993 but said it would not do so itself. Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, unveiled a range of discounts for next summer and warned that the company was ready to cut prices again to achieve its aim of reclaiming a third of the market. 'We've drawn a line in the sand,' Mr Newbold said. 'We're not going to go backwards so that our competitors can succeed.' Thomson's announcement of its programme marks the start of the battle for next year's holiday business. Owners Abroad, the second largest company, is due to launch its 1993 summer programme today. Mr Newbold's comments come at the end of a summer which has seen companies cutting prices sharply as they tried to sell an estimated 500,000 surplus holidays. Thomson said it still had up to 130,000 holidays unsold this summer. Its market share has fallen to about 30 per cent. Mr Newbold accused competitors of behaving irresponsibly by offering too many holidays and said the industry's profits were likely to fall by more than half this year. The number of charter holidays sold in 1992 is likely to be 12-15 per cent higher than last year's 10.3m. 'There are certainly one or two companies that won't survive and the travel business will be well rid of them. It will be a long time before we see the madness we saw this year in the industry,' Mr Newbold said. He denied that Thomson had misjudged the growth of the foreign holiday market. 'The only mistake we made was to believe our competitors would be sensible,' he said. Thomson aims to sell 2.25m 1993 summer holidays, the same number it offered this year. The average holiday price has risen by only 3 per cent, suggesting a rise in real terms is unlikely. The decline in the dollar has enabled the company to offer 8 per cent price cuts for holidays to the US and the Caribbean. The price of packages to Spain has, however, risen by 4.5 per cent, while the cost of a holiday in Cyprus has gone up by more than 7 per cent. Owners Abroad cut more than 100,000 holidays from its 1992 offering in an attempt to trim the industry's over-supply. It says it intends to reduce capacity further in 1993.</p>

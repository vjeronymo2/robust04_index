			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Andreotti signs up Bush adviser A FORMER senior official of the Bush administration is being hired as legal counsel in the US by Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian Democrat prime minister of Italy who is being investigated for alleged collusion with the Sicilian Mafia. Mr Abraham Sofaer, who was the state department's legal adviser between 1985 and 1990, said yesterday he had spoken to Mr Andreotti this week and was in the process of being retained. The hiring of Mr Sofaer, a high-profile lawyer whose last job was as legal adviser to Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, confirms Mr Andreotti's pledge to contest the Mafia-related charges vigorously. Mr Sofaer, who helped to form the US government's legal position for its 1986 bombing raid against Libya under the Reagan administration, said he had gained familiarity with Mafia issues as a federal court judge in New York City between 1979 and 1985. The hiring follows a vote on Tuesday by an Italian Senate commission to waive the 74-year-old Mr Andreotti's parliamentary immunity. The waiver must be confirmed by a secret ballot vote by the full Senate. Mr Sofaer, a managing partner in Washington at the law firm of Hughes, Hubbard and Reed, said that among his first efforts would be to try 'to explain to the western press the way the precise issues before the Italian Senate are not being properly depicted'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Crackdown on Trade Unions Condemned"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  group's suppression of South Korean trade unions is under fire  in MINJU CHOSON today.    The analyst says:    The South Korean puppets a few days ago arrested a working  member, the organizational section chief and two other core  members of the Ulsan-based Hyundai Heavy Industries Trade Union  on the suspicion of the violation of "the National Security Law"  (NSL). Meanwhile, the puppet Labour Ministry put forward "a  policy of intensifying investigation into the operation" of  trade unions and announced that it "would be promoted from the  viewpoint of reforms."    These facts clearly show how craftily and viciously the foxy  traitor Kim Yong-sam is working to suppress trade unions.    The suppression is aimed at keeping the workers from being  awakened and organized and from taking a massive action through  trade unions.    Last year in which the traitor came to power, 2,590 workers  were put on the "want" list and more than 3,000 workers were  fired unjustifiably for their involvement in the labour movement.    As if it were not enough, the Kim Yong-sam group arrested  core elements of trade unions by invoking the notorious "NSL"  and is going to intensify "investigation into the operation" of  trade unions. This reveals their consciousness of crisis.    The reality proves that, with the Kim Yong-sam group left  alone, it is impossible for the South Korean workers to win the  right to existence, let alone democratic freedom.    The South Korean workers will vigorously struggle to  overthrow the traitor Kim Yong-sam engaged in anti-popular  misrule and establish an independent, democratic government,  concludes the analyst.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Thoughts of a fund manager - London Markets AS THE last chimes of midnight died away on Tuesday night, professional fund managers must have breathed a sigh of relief. The FT-SE index had risen 6 per cent over the Christmas period, chalking up half that gain on New Year's Eve. Those fund managers who had stayed in equities in the autumn, shrugging off the market's wave of pessimism, were relieved of nearly half the penalty of loyalty: FT-SE ended 1991 only 7 per cent below its September peak. However, the London market's surge - from 2345.4 on the FT-SE on December 23 to 2504.1 yesterday - took place on very low volume. Market-makers set their price quotations in the light of New York's strong performance during the period, rather than on the basis of any real supply and demand pressures in London. As the chart shows, movements in New York were faithfully echoed in London a day later: when New York soared ahead, London followed at a slightly more modest pace; when New York eased, as in the closing days of this week, London backed off too. The question that awaits Monday's trading, therefore, is simple: will fund managers buy at these prices? If institutional investors decide that the end-year run-up was simply an unexpected bonus, but not a true guide to the London market's value, then prices will drop back down again. If they decide today's prices are more realistic than those of only two weeks ago, then they will be willing to continue buying, in self-fulfilling anticipation of the traditional January surge. Fund mangers' bath-time thoughts are always relevant to the private investor, because institutions are the dominant influence on UK share prices. But they are particularly relevant now, after a rally as precariously based as the one we have seen over Christmas. Here's a summary of the views of one successful fund manager, pondering some of these issues yesterday: Is the market overvalued? No: shares are now close to fair value, having looked very cheap a couple of weaks ago. By international standards, London still looks cheap, especially by comparison with New York. The uncertainties of the year ahead - an election, the uncertain start to economic recovery and so on - are fully reflected in share prices. Is the latest rally over? Probably not. London usually tracks New York closely, and earlier this week there was quite a gap between the two as US share prices accelerated ahead. The gap is now partly closed, but there is some way to go before it is eliminated. Is the election a worry? Yes, but not because Labour may win. In fact, a Labour victory might not be a bad thing (though it would probably lead to the market trading at a slightly lower multiple of earnings). The market would be much more concerned, however, by a hung parliament: that would really be a worry. What other factors are at work? German interest rates: but they may be a positive, rather than a negative influence in the months ahead. The moment will soon come when the market starts looking for German interest rates to come down. Once the market gets a whiff that that might happen soon, it will go higher. Will there be another surge of rights issues? Yes, probably starting towards the end of January. Badly handled issues, as in the autumn, will stop the market dead for a while. But perhaps companies and their advisers will have learnt a lesson from last year. There will also be a steady flow of other calls on cash, such as payments for previous privatisation issues, but institutional inflows of funds remain healthy. At some point there will be a surge of cash from abroad as international investors start to take advantage of the UK market's relative cheapness. Which sectors will do best? Sometime this year, the recovery stocks, especially capital goods, will at last start to outperform the defensive stocks, such as the drug companies and other members of the Health and Household sector of the FT-Actuaries index. However, it may be anything up to six months before the shift happens, because there is still more bad news to come from the capital goods companies in the early part of the year. Will equities continue to outperform gilts? Yes, though the gap has narrowed. UK quoted companies have provided real dividend growth of 2 per cent a year for the past 20 years, and that is likely to continue. Those views, drawn from one fund manager, are probably representative of the mainstream view in the professional investing community. What could upset this generally favourable set of prospects? The biggest likely spanner in the works would be a long delay before German interest rates come down - or, worse still, a further rise. Much therefore hangs on the outcome of the German pay round, now getting under way. Claims already made are for wage rises of around 10 per cent, compared with last year's 7 per cent. The chances are that the final outcome will be increases of around 5 per cent, but getting there will be hard. There is unlikely to be any good news on German interest rates until the Bundesbank is convinced that settlements will be sensible. So UK investors will spend the next few months hoping for moderation on the part of German trade-union officials. Welcome to the new Europe]</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Tougher law on porn video traders A PRIVATE member's bill designed to facilitate prosecutions against traders in pornographic video recordings completed its passage through the Commons yesterday. The video recordings bill, already approved by the Lords, provides for the strengthening of the certification system operated by the British board of film classification. The freedom and responsibility of the press bill, and the right to know bill, were among more than 50 measures which failed to reach the statute book on the final day allocated to private members' legislation.</p>

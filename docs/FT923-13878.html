			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / House prices 'up 0.7% last month' HOUSE PRICES rose 0.7 per cent last month, a possible sign that prices have begun to stabilise after sharp falls in the past few years, Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said yesterday. Its findings conflict with a survey published last week by Nationwide, the second-largest society, which said house prices fell by an average 0.5 per cent last month. Halifax said that, allowing for seasonal fluctuations, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in June, the first seasonally adjusted rise since October. There was no sign of any increase in the number of house sales. Purchasers and sellers, the society said, had been deterred by concern over rising unemployment and the state of the economy. Halifax said: 'The general election result appears to have had little impact so far despite predictions that the decisive outcome would boost confidence by reducing uncertainty. 'The temporary suspension of stamp duty has also had only a very limited effect on transaction levels. 'With some increase in house sales over the next few months, house prices should then move on to a gently rising trend during 1993.' It said that in spite of last month's price rise, the Pounds 65,361 average cost of a home in the UK was 5.6 per cent lower than in the corresponding month last year. In London, prices during the second quarter of this year were 10.6 per cent lower than during the same months last year and 2.2 per cent lower than in the first quarter this year. Halifax said: 'House prices remained generally weaker in the south of England in the second quarter of this year, but small quarterly declines were also recorded in Wales, west Midlands and northern regions. Only in Scotland are house prices currently higher than they were a year ago.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            HALIFAX SURVEY OF PRICES IN THE SECOND QUARTER  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- region                            price          annual                                  pounds        fall/rise%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South-east                       75,340          -8.8 South-west                       60,797          -8.5 Greater London                   81,993         -10.6 East Anglia                      57,163          -7.9 Wales                            50,589          -3.9 West Midlands                    58,686          -5.6 East Midlands                    54,072          -6.2 North-west                       57,426          -3.1 Yorks, H'side                    53,893          -3.3 North                            50,192          -0.4 N Ireland                        38,347          -1.1 Scotland                         58,477          +0.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Halifax Building Society  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

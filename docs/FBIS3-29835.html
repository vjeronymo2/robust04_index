The number of persons above 90 last year was five times the  1980 figure.    Many "villages of macrobians" and "long-lived families" can  be seen in the country.    Migam-ri in Kim Hyong-kwon County, Yanggang Province, is  known as a "village of macrobians", "village of longevity."    The life expectancy at birth of the villagers before the  country's liberation in August 1945 was below 30 due to hunger  and diseases. Now the village has more than 100 people who have  been living to the old age of 80.    Thirty of them are more than 90 years old. Enjoying the  prime of youth at sixty and longevity at 90, they help the co-op  farm in its farm work.    Usi County, Chagang Province, is also known for longevity.    In the pre-liberation days its residents suffered from  endemic diseases. There was only one "community doctor" in the  county. The life expectancy at birth of the county population  lengthened by more than 40 years compared with the  pre-liberation days. The county has nearly 30 hospitals and  clinics.    The family of Pak Ki-sop, an old woman aged 108, in  Najin-Sonbong City is respected as a "long-lived family". She  has more than seventy children and grandchildren, a number of  them above 80 years old. Before the liberation of the country  she lost her husband and five sons and daughters in starvation  and illness. Now her health is normal on all indices.    The state assumes responsibility for the life and health of  the macrobians and looks after them with particular care. They  are regularly supplied with tonics and highly nutritious  foodstuff. All the macrobians are registered at professional  medical organs and undergo regular medical checkup, and  prophylactic treatment measures are taken for them.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sends benevolent  birthday tables to macrobians each on their 100th birthday.  Last year alone, ten old men and women who greeted their  centennial birthday, including Kim Kum-sun in central district,  Pyongyang municipality, and Pak Won-pom in Chungsan County,  South Pyongan Province, received birthday tables.</p>

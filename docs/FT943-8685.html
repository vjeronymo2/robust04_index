			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Trying to achieve linguistic purity can be a laughing matter Sir, The brouhaha about the Loi Toubon ('The French choose their words carefully', August 6) reminds me of the time that Hindi zealots in my native India ran amuck. Notably, public institutions were enjoined to have someone write up, on a daily basis, a 'word for the day' on strip-boards put up at various points in the building. The 'telephone' became (in translation) a 'distant talker'. And further shenanigans to this effect. The positive side of the whole affair was that more people than usual started smiling, and linguistic 'purity' started dissolving in guffaws while people went about the ordinary business of communicating with each other according to their natural compulsions. If the French politician is not careful, he might succeed in prompting the comment that while the French are a great people, the only problem is they speak a language called French] M S Chandramouli, Quai de la Derivation, 4020 Liege, Belgium</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii by NHK </F> commentator Takehiko Mizuki at the NHK studios in Tokyo; date of  interview not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mizuki] Minister, thank you for coming to our  studio. The coalition government has compiled the fiscal 1994  budget for the first time since it was inaugurated. What sort  of priorities have been made within the compilation of the  budget?    [Fujii] Ever since his cabinet was formed, the prime  minister has continued to stress that the coalition government  should build Japan into a fruitful and high-quality nation, and  the coalition government should have the people understand that  policy. I have worked to compile the budget, taking into  account what the prime minister has stressed. At the same time,  the coalition government is faced with the issue of spurring the  stagnant economy. When the fiscal 1994 budget was compiled, I  gave consideration to stimulating the economy. I also gave  consideration to curbing special national bonds, and I intend to  concentrate the allocation of funds on public works projects.  These are what I bore in mind while the 1994 fiscal budget was  being compiled.    [Mizuki] The government's debts will grow again; this is the  most important issue. The coalition government will issue 20  trillion yen in national bonds. How will the coalition  government put the brakes on national bonds? This is an  important matter. Minister, how are you going to deal with this  issue?    [Fujii] A substantial portion of the 200 trillion yen in  national bonds are bonds to finance construction projects. The  bonds will leave our nation with assets worth that much. In  that respect, it is beneficial to ask the people to assume the  burden of some of the bonds. Faced with stimulating the  economy, the coalition government intends to issue national  bonds to spur the economy. The coalition government also  intends to bring about a recovery of the economy. I think the  coalition government should make every effort to curb the  so-called special national bonds.    [Mizuki] Representatives of the ruling coalition parties  have agreed to settle the issue of securing financial resources  in order to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from tax  cuts. Raising the consumption tax is the only way to secure the  financial resources; the ruling coalition parties will thus  focus their debate on whether or not to raise the consumption  tax. When and how will the representatives of the ruling  coalition parties settle the issue?    [Fujii] The representative of the ruling coalition parties  have agreed to settle the issue within this year; this is their  best choice. As you said a while ago, it is a natural for them  to discuss ways to address unfair taxes and to streamline the  administration. They will also discuss ways to reform the  current tax system -- taking into account the balance of income,  assets, and consumption -- and to create new taxes. They have  agreed to do all these things this year. I value the agreement  and think the representatives will resolve the issue as they  have agreed upon.    [Mizuki] As I mentioned a while ago, I would like to ask  about the public works projects. It is said the coalition  government will concentrate the allocation of funds for the  projects on improving the standard of living. The people are  placing high hopes on them.    [Fujii] The budget for public works projects will grow  substantially. While public works projects for natural parks  will grow by 20 percent, those for agriculture will increase by  14 percent. Public works projects for sewage and housing will  also be greatly increased. I believe this allocation of public  works projects reflects Prime Minister Hosokawa's policy. The  growth is quite bold. Public works projects grew by 0.5 percent  in 1993. Given the growth in public works projects for 1994, I  believe the coalition government has made its utmost efforts.    [Mizuki] Looking at the compilation of the fiscal 1994  budget, this time the so-called zokugiin [Diet members who  champion special interests] were not as active as they were  during the era of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, my  impression is that moves by government ministries and agencies  to protect their vested rights and interests are still  deep-rooted. Minister, how do you plan to deal with those moves?    [Fujii] The ruling coalition parties have provided all  those concerned with the opportunity to put forth their views on  the budget. The ruling coalition parties have presented the  government, especially the Ministry of Finance, with their  views. From our standpoint I feel the process has drastically  changed.    [Mizuki] This question concerns the future management of the  economy. The compilation of the budget has been delayed for  more than a month. Minister, how do you plan to manage the  economy as you fill the vacuum?    [Fujii] The budget should have been compiled in 1993;  psychologically this would have been correct. However, we have  compiled the third supplementary budget, and the budget will  certainly give a boost to the economy. The coalition government  will stimulate the economy through the third supplementary and  fiscal 1994 budgets. The coalition government will also  implement a package of stimulus measures totalling 15.25  trillion yen. The package is the largest ever. It will serve  to reinvigorate land transactions, agriculture, and small  businesses. It is very important for the coalition government  to implement the package without delay.    [Mizuki] The coalition government has decided on a package  of stimulus measures totalling 15 trillion yen, as well as a  budget bill, both of which are expected to spur Japan's economy.  However, at this moment the yen is substantially appreciating  against the U.S. dollar following the breakdown in the  Japan-U.S. summit talks. Minister, what do you think about this?    [Fujii] I cannot help saying that the current exchange  markets are affected by speculative moves. The currency's  exchange rate must reflect the country's economic fundamentals.  It is undesirable for the exchange rate to move dramatically  for short periods. This is an agreement reached among the G-7  industrialized nations. I feel these are speculative moves  which will probably last a day or so.    [Mizuki] Various remarks by high-ranking U.S. Government  officials have affected the speculative moves. The G-7  industrialized nations have agreed to cooperate with each other  in dealing with severe fluctuations of the exchange rate. How  do Japanese and U.S. financial authorities see the current sharp  increase in the yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar?    [Fujii] A responsible U.S. Government official has said  there is no change in the U.S. Government's policy on the  exchange rate. I agree with that.    [Mizuki] Over the past few days, there has been no change in  economic fundamentals. The breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit  talks over the opening of the Japanese market is responsible for  the drastic appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. It  is important for the coalition government to settle the issue at  the earliest date.    [Fujii] I have said the drastic appreciation of the yen has  been caused by speculative moves. There are various reasons for  these speculative moves. It cannot be denied that the breakdown  of the summit talks is responsible for it. Although the leaders  of Japan and the United States failed to reach an agreement on  various bilateral issues, they agreed there will be no change in  friendly relations between the two countries. It is necessary  for the leaders to have opportunities to understand each other.    [Mizuki] If the appreciated yen sets back Japan's economy,  this would adversely affect the world economy. The G-7  industrialized nations will meet later this month. Minister,  how are you going to deal with the appreciated yen?    [Fujii] Financial authorities in the G-7 industrialized  nations have agreed that the exchange rate must mirror the  economic fundamentals. Drastic fluctuations in the exchange  rate have an adverse impact not only on the country concerned  but on the world economy. Japan should try to reaffairm the  agreement at the meeting to be held by the G-7 industrialized  nations.    [Mizuki] Then, Minister, do you think the current sharp  increase in the yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is  temporary, and thus does not reflect Japan's economic  fundamentals?    [Fujii] Yes. I believe the drastic appreciation of the yen  has been caused by speculative moves.    [Mizuki] This is my last question. It is unclear why the  yen has appreciated so drastically. Minister, when will Japan's  economy recover?    [Fujii] The government has agreed to put the economy back on  the path of recovery at the earliest possible time during fiscal  year 1994, and to make certain it will continue its stable  growth in the fiscal year 1995. I am and will manage the  economy based on the government agreement.    [Mizuki] Banks are overloaded with bad loans, and there are  other issues. It is not easy to resolve those issues.  Minister, when do you think these issues will be resolved?    [Fujii] I intend to resolve them at the earliest possible  date in 1994.    [Mizuki] Minister, thank you for being interviewed.</p>

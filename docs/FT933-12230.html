			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Throwback to Soviet ways: John Lloyd examines the weekend announcement by the Russian Central Bank that all pre-1993 roubles are to be scrapped THE announcement over the weekend, by the Russian Central Bank, that all roubles printed before 1993 must be exchanged during the next two weeks for new notes is confusing only on the surface. Below the surface, it is Byzantine. First, the timing of the announcement was significant. It came early on Saturday morning, when President Boris Yeltsin was on holiday, when Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, was in the US. Mr Sergei Dubinin, his first deputy, had just left for a summer break - having told journalists on Friday that the government would demand that Mr Yeltsin must veto a range of measures passed by the parliament in the previous week. No government figure commented on the announcement, as would have been expected with regard to a move at once so radical and so uncomfortable for the population. Instead, the official Tass news agency published a Statement of the Russian Government: Text of the Official Document, which says, 'the Central Bank's decision, taken with the aim of stabilising the cash circulation in the country and eliminating the plurality of forms of cash notes, is supported by the Russian Government'. (This was without citing a spokesman or minister  -a throwback to the Soviet period when announcements simply emanated from the communist party politburo from the government.) Second, according to a source close to the radicals in the Russian cabinet, two key reformers - Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, and Mr Andrei Vavilov, the deputy finance minister - had a series of meetings with Mr Yeltsin yesterday and finally secured his agreement to issue a decree cancelling the decision of the Central Bank and sacking Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman. The reformers were horrified by the move, regarding it as a provocation designed to deepen the government's unpopularity, taken without notice or adequate preparation, and largely useless in combatting inflation and crime, two of the stated aims. However, no such decree had been published by yesterday evening. Mr Yeltsin is constitutionally unable to sack Mr Gerashchenko without the agreement of the Russian parliament, to which the central bank chairman is responsible. If the president were to decree such a dismissal, he would be again be in direct confrontation with the parliament. Third, a clash between the president and the executive, on the one side, and the parliament, on the other, is now inevitable. It will probably come soon. The parliament has taken a range of decisions in the past ten days: To strip the privatisation agency of many of its powers to rescind licences given to foreign banks; To tighten control over the Central Bank itself; To pass a budget with a deficit of Rbs22,000bn (Pounds 14.3bn), or 25 per cent of GNP; To give leave to the procurator-general to investigate corruption allegations against Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister. (A parallel investigation is proceeding against Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a deputy prime minister and, like Mr Shumeiko, a close ally of Mr Yeltsin.) These have added up to the most serious challenge to the president since he was forced by the Congress of People's Deputies last december to fire Mr Yegor Gaidar, then the acting prime minister. Mr Yeltsin has thus cut short a planned two-week break by some four or five days, and he was at his desk in the Kremlin yesterday. Fourth, the political temperature is rising rapidly. A congress of the National Salvation Front, the hard-line grouping that unites the nationalist and neo-communist movements, met yesterday to hear its co-chairman, Mr Ilya Constantinov, demand that 'this criminal government be swept away'. The deepening involvement of Russian troops in the Asian border war between Tadjikistan and Afghanistan is raising passions as the number of casualties rises; the worsening relations between Estonians and Russians in the Baltic republic of Estonia is a prime cause for the nationalists in Russia to seize, as is the decision of the Russian parliament to claim jurisdiction over the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, a region of Ukraine. Mr Yeltsin was told by the supportive daily newspaper Izvestiya last Friday that 'the President's voice must now be heard'. It seems that such a hearing cannot be long delayed.</p>

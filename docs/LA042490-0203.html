			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT STEP;  </P> <P> REQUIEM FOR A REVOLUTION?;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA'S SANDINISTAS, WHO ONCE TOPPLED A DICTATOR, NOW MUST ADJUST TO  ELECTORAL DEFEAT. THEY VOW TO REGAIN POWER -- THE QUESTION IS HOW.  </P> <P> A day after conceding defeat in Nicaragua's first democratic elections,  President Daniel Ortega faced 5,000 defiant Sandinistas in Managua's Revolution  Plaza. Stunned and angry, many in the crowd refused to believe that their  party, which a decade ago had toppled the Somoza dictatorship after an 18-year  guerrilla struggle, was leaving the government. "Don't give up power!" they  demanded, raising fists in the gathering dusk. "We've got the guns!"  </P> <P> The scene was a haunting reminder of the Sandinista National Liberation Front's  guerrilla legacy, so threatening that supporters of President-elect Violeta  Barrios de Chamorro, who takes office Wednesday, have yet to hold a public  celebration of her victory two months ago. In the tumultuous days that  followed, throngs of belligerent young Sandinistas, many of them armed, seemed  to own the streets. In one provincial capital they burned the headquarters of  Chamorro's pro-American coalition. In another, a Sandinista helicopter blasted  a coalition leader's home with a grenade.  </P> <P> Sandinista officers, alarmed by desertions from their army after the Feb. 25  election, handed out rifles to thousands of loyal civilians. Party leaders now  admit that scores of Sandinista combat veterans formed an illicit underground  network to resist the Chamorro government. "Companero, when are we going back  to the mountains?" a security guard at the Foreign Ministry asked an official  there. "I'm ready."  </P> <P> These fitful bursts of Sandinista hostility pose a major challenge not only to  Chamorro as she tries to govern a war-divided, economically crippled Nicaragua,  but also to Ortega as he tries to transform his revolutionary vanguard movement  into a legal opposition. In the hot, dusty plaza that day, he used a mix of  tough and conciliatory rhetoric, trying at once to whip up the party's defeated  spirit and to quiet its simmering rage.  </P> <P> "We are willing to contribute to peace and stability as long as the people are  respected and not threatened, because the people have enough power to crush  anyone who comes intent on revenge," he declared. "The great winner of these  elections is the Sandinista Front because we brought democracy here. . . . The  day will come when we will return (through elections) to govern this country.  In the meantime," he added, "we will govern from below."  </P> <P> Can Ortega transform a party that never formally abandoned its commitment to  armed struggle as a means of achieving social change? Will Chamorro's  free-market advisers be able to dismantle the Sandinistas' state-owned  enterprises without a violent backlash? Will anything of the Sandinista  revolution survive in a democracy? Can the party remain united enough to defend  its programs, or will it fall apart in defeat?  </P> <P> In recent interviews, 16 Sandinista leaders -- from comandantes to neighborhood  cadres -- said that their party had mellowed, irreversibly, during its decade  in government. They expressed the unanimous view that a return to clandestine  resistance after their electoral defeat would have brought a Panama-style U.S.  invasion and finished their movement. The constitutional route, they said, is  now the way to defend their revolution and regain power in the next elections,  in 1996.  </P> <P> "I don't know if there is another example in the world of a revolutionary party  that comes to power by force of arms and passes peacefully to the opposition,"  Vice President Sergio Ramirez said with a mixture of pride and resignation now  echoed at all levels of the party. "For this country, that's an immense step  forward."  </P> <P> But the Sandinista promise of peaceful politics is still fragile; it depends on  good behavior by about 8,000 U.S.-backed Contras and, say some party activists,  by the Bush Administration. Many are skeptical that the rebels, who signed a  definitive cease-fire last Thursday after eight years of fighting the  Sandinista-led army, will fulfill their pact to disarm and disband by June 10.  </P> <P> "If the Contras don't disarm, then we have to disarm them," said Ramon  Cabrales, the outgoing vice minister of economy, who has kept a rifle since his  days as a guerrilla commander. "To refuse to hand over the government would be  to commit mass suicide. But it's healthy, mentally, to keep open the armed  option, as long as there are Contras, as long as the U.S. government is going  to have more influence, more presence, in our society."  </P> <P> Even with peace, the Sandinista opposition that Chamorro could face during her  six-year term is daunting.  </P> <P> Still stronger than any of the 14 parties in her broad but fractious coalition,  which won 55% of the vote, the Sandinistas, who got 40%, are well positioned to  "govern from below." They will control the Supreme Court until 1993. They hold  a large enough minority in the new National Assembly to block changes in a  Sandinista-drafted Constitution that enshrines such revolutionary tenets as  state control of all banking and foreign trade. They own two newspapers and  several radio stations. They have better-organized support among farmers, urban  wage earners, women's groups, war veterans and students than does the Chamorro  coalition.  </P> <P> The lame-duck legislature dominated by Sandinistas has scrambled in recent  weeks to bolster their party for life as the opposition. Party members were  given permanent titles to the homes they confiscated and immunity from  prosecution for any crimes. Universities, Sandinista strongholds, won autonomy  from the state. Opposition groups were finally allowed to own television  stations, and labor unions won the right to engage in collective bargaining.  </P> <P> Sandinista leaders insist that their political clout is enough to defend their  revolution -- a socialist-inspired order that provided land to 120,000 peasant  families, free universal health care and education, scholarships abroad for  8,000 students each year and worker participation in the management of  state-owned companies.  </P> <P> With the economy battered by war and U.S. economic sanctions, the Sandinistas  saw those benefits erode. Now they are warning Chamorro, a conservative  newspaper publisher, that her mandate is simply to disarm the Contras and  unlock American aid; to revive the revolution with cash, not reverse it with  free-market ideology.  </P> <P> "The Sandinista Front is ready to cooperate with the new government on matters  having to do with the people and their conquests," said Comandante Jaime  Wheelock of the party's nine-man National Directorate. "The people did not vote  against the Sandinista project. They voted for peace and economic security."  </P> <P> At the Sandinistas' elite cadres school outside Managua, law has replaced  economics as the dominant curriculum as the party moves from managing a mixed  economy to defending the workers' stake in a business-oriented regime. The  sharpest clashes will come if the purest of free-market advocates around  Chamorro win her approval to sell the state's 518 companies, which include the  grain monopoly, confiscated sugar mills, textile plants, coffee and banana  plantations, and seafood processors.  </P> <P> The Sandinista Workers Central and the Farm Workers Assn., which represent  nearly all 60,000 workers in those enterprises, stand firmly against  privatization. They fear the loss of such revolutionary gains as equal pay for  women, day care centers, workers' housing and lunchrooms, as well as their  voice in running the companies. Arguing that money-losing state farms and  factories must be given time to profit in peacetime, the unions have threatened  to seize control of any company that is sold and lock out the new management.  </P> <P> "A lot of former owners have returned to demand their companies back," said  Bernicia Sanders, a Sandinista leader of the textile workers' union. "They have  to come down to earth and realize that the rules are not the same as before  (the revolution). The workers are not robots any more."  </P> <P> Chamorro's advisers must also tread carefully as they whittle away the  70,000-member Sandinista army and the 60,000-strong government bureaucracy. And  as they struggle to tame Nicaragua's 1,700% annual inflation within a  campaign-promised deadline of 100 days, they will face an explosion of pent-up  wage demands that cannot be restrained.  </P> <P> In an apparent warning to Chamorro of their clout, Sandinista unions that  rarely went on strike against their own leaders have in the past week halted  mail delivery, disrupted international telephone service, shut down the banking  system and threatened to disrupt electricity, water and health services. "The  Sandinistas have all the tools to paralyze the country," said Emilio Alvarez  Montalban, a Chamorro aide. To keep social peace, admits Alfredo Cesar, another  of her key advisers, "there will be a permanent process of negotiation."  </P> <P> So far, the Sandinista leadership has shown more willingness to deal than to  destabilize. It agreed in transition talks to accept civilian control of a  smaller, non-political military and to disarm their paramilitary followers as  long as Chamorro leaves the hierarchy of the mostly-Sandinista officer corps  intact. Gen. Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, worked closely with  Chamorro's transition team to achieve last week's armistice with the Contras.  One Sandinista leader spoke of the need for a "secret coalition" and  "underground understandings" with the new government "to get the country  producing."  </P> <P> But a split between Sandinista moderates and radicals surfaced during a bitter  debate in the closing weeks of the old Assembly. A hard-line minority pushed  unsuccessfully for a huge minimum wage hike against moderates intent on  cooperating with Chamorro's forces. "We've had a win-or-die mentality. Now  we're looking for something in the middle," explained Foreign Ministry official  Alejandro Bendana.  </P> <P> Amid their tentative shifts toward a conventional opposition role, the  Sandinistas are debating an invitation to join the Socialist International, an  organization of mainstream socialist and social democratic parties around the  world. The issue is controversial because staunch Marxist-Leninists in the  Sandinista Front want to stay closely allied with Communists in such countries  as Cuba and North Korea, while moderates fear being isolated by the demise of  Soviet Bloc parties elsewhere.  </P> <P> Even the harshest critics, those who claim that its socialist ideals are  bankrupt, recognize the Sandinista Front as an indigenous political force that  will not disintegrate like the Moscow-imposed Communist parties in East Germany  and Hungary. But the Sandinistas' clout will depend on their ability to stay  united, learn from defeat and democratize their Stalinist party structures,  many members say. None of this will be easy.  </P> <P> The radical faction is close to Interior Minister Tomas Borge, the party's lone  surviving founder. He has been heard complaining that the Ortegas blew the  election by ignoring his advice to end the unpopular military draft. Another  comandante, Henry Ruiz, who still uses the nom de guerre Modesto, has  reportedly blamed corruption in state enterprises.  </P> <P> Sidestepping such recriminations, the party leadership delayed a formal  finger-pointing analysis of the election loss to give its displaced members  time to clean out their files and find new jobs. Vanesa Castro, a party  official, estimates that 300 to 400 Sandinistas will lose government posts. The  party can offer them little, she says, because its own 2,000-member payroll  must be slashed by 20% to 30% to compensate for lost government revenue.  </P> <P> Some outsiders believe that the party will be crippled by the loss of patronage  and damaged by the unromantic spectacle of comandantes lingering on in mansions  confiscated from the old order. "A tremendous number of opportunists, probably  a majority of Sandinistas, will abandon the party when they can no longer  benefit from being in power," said Moises Hassan, a prominent former  Sandinista. "The party will break into pieces."  </P> <P> But no such doubts assail the Sandinista leadership, which remembers the trials  of clandestine struggle as far tougher. By easing membership requirements, the  party is moving to strengthen its clout as Nicaragua's largest party. As a  "party of cadres," the Sandinista Front numbered about 40,000 militantes, or  full-fledged members, at the time of the election. Now party officials have  launched a campaign to recruit all of the nearly 580,000 Nicaraguans who voted  for Ortega.  </P> <P> A more important shift is quietly under way in Managua, where some 200 open  assemblies of Sandinista militants have replaced the elitist "base committee"  cells appointed from above. Soon the assemblies will elect coordinators, who in  turn will choose new party leaders for the capital. Carlos Carrion, the Managua  party chief, said the election process "must go all the way to the top," a  controversial idea not yet approved by the party's self-designated National  Directorate.  </P> <P> If the new grass-roots democracy takes hold, it could correct one fault that  many Sandinistas say distanced them from voters and cost the election -- a  tendency to impose party leaders from one city or neighborhood on another.  "We're going to have six long years to build a vanguard that truly rises from  the community," said Edgar Paladino, a Sandinista combat veteran and  neighborhood leader in Managua.  </P> <P> Whatever the changes in the party leadership, Daniel Ortega is expected to  remain on top. He has declined to take the seat he won in the new National  Assembly, chosing instead to work on holding the party together and  strengthening its alliances abroad. Despite his failed candidacy, the  44-year-old comandante appears to have grown in stature among his peers on the  National Directorate and his countrymen as well.  </P> <P> "There was Daniel, two days after the election, up on the stand, speaking to  the cadres, trying to turn defeat into victory," said a veteran South American  ambassador. "He wasn't talking like a revolutionary but like a politician, an  important politician who has a good chance to come back and knows it."  </P> <P> Steps Toward Peace  </P> <P> The Contras and the outgoing Sandanistas government have agreed that the rebels  will gather within rural demilitarized zones -- scattered around the country  and totaling about 1,150 square miles -- by Wednesday. Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro's inauguration day. They will also start disarming immediately after  she is sworn in. The accords are to be supervised by Venezuelan troops, part of  a U.N. peacekeeping force.  </P> <P> Pitfalls for Chamorro  </P> <P> Contras -- The U.S.-backed rebels have agreed to a definitive cease-fire and  pledged to disarm by June 10. They still want Chamorro to purge the army of  senior Sandanista commanders, but she has yet to agree. She could face a  violent Sandanista backlash if she retires too many commanders but risks a  breakdown of the peace agreement if she leaves the army intact.  </P> <P> Inflation -- Prices rose nearly 1,700% last year. To stabilize the economy and  pull it out of a six-year-old recession, Chamorro needs to disarm the Contras,  secure U.S. congressional approval of a proposed $300-million U.S. aid package,  get quick aid to farmers to help them plant grain next month, gain business  confidence and win a truce with Sandanista-led unions.  </P> <P> Property Disputes --  </P> <P> Free-market advocates in Chamorro's coalition want to sell of most of the 518  state-owned companies, some of them confiscated by the Sandanistas and many of  them losing money. They could meet resistance from Sandanista unions  representing 60,000 workers who fear the loss of social benefits. Violence  could result if former owners of confiscated homes or land try to retrieve  their property.  </P> <P> Ortega's Economic Legacy  </P> <P> When she takes over leadership of Nicaragua from President Daniel Ortega on  Wednesday, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro inherits an economy battered by war,  U.S. economic sanctions and what her allies call 10 years of mismanagement by  Ortega's Sandanista Front. Here are some of the measures of Nicaragua's  economic health after a decade of Sandanista rule:  </P> <P> Inflation Rate: Drained by war, Nicaragua say inflation begin taking off at end  of 1987. Through 1988 prices soared, fed by high spending, declining government  income and collapse of public confidence. Austerity measures cut inflation  somewhat last year.  </P> <P> Source: Reuters/Economist Intelligence Unit  </P> <P> Trade Balance: Nicaragua's export-import figures over eight years reflect the  country's cooling of ties with Washington and its increasing reliance on  Moscow.  </P> <P> Note: 1983-88 Soviet-Nicaraguan trade figures are estimates. 1983-88  U.S.-Nicaraguan figures are based on U.S. government reports.  </P> <P> SOURCE: International Monetary Fund  </P></p>

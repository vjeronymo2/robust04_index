			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW SOARS 51.74 ON INTEREST RATE HOPES  </P> <P> Stocks soared for a second straight session today as hopes mounted that the  Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates and oil prices fell.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 51.74 points, or 2%, at 2,540.35. The  advance was broadly based, with gaining shares outpacing losers by almost 3 to  1 on moderately heavy New York Stock Exchange volume of 161.39 million shares.  </P> <P> The sharp jump in the 30-share index followed a gain of 44.80 points made  Friday as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lower rates -- possibly as  soon as this week -- in an effort to jolt the weakening economy.  </P> <P> Adding to optimism was the belief that war is not imminent in the Persian Gulf,  which helped drive oil prices lower.  </P> <P> The price of crude oil for December delivery dropped more than $2 a barrel, to  about $31.75 a barrel, in today's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> "It's de-escalation of the war premium, the prospect that war might be  delayed," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman  Brothers Inc.  </P> <P> Gainers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, up 2 3/8  at 112 5/8; American Express, up 1 3/4 at 21 3/8; General Electric, up 1 1/2 at  55 1/4, and Philip Morris, up 7/8 at 49 5/8.  </P> <P> Pan Am Corp. rose 1/4 to 1 7/8 in active trading following the weekend news of  a conditional bid for Pan Am by Carl Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines.  </P> <P> Municipal bonds prices were higher in early trading today, but corporate bond  prices were little changed.  </P> <P> Trading was subdued, however, as the market for U.S. government bonds was  closed in observance of the Veterans Day holiday.  </P> <P> In earlier trading in London, U.S. Treasury bonds were buoyed by weak oil  prices to close with prices firmly higher than levels reached in New York on  Friday.  </P> <P> The Fed's credit easing is likely to spur a one-half percentage point cut in  the prime lending rate, and home mortgage rates should decline modestly as  well, many analysts said today.  </P> <P> Any reduction in the prime rate, which has been stuck at 10% since January,  would be seen as a boost to economic activity because about one-third of all  consumer and business loans are tied to changes in the prime.  </P> <P> The Fed's top policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet  behind closed doors Tuesday to map interest rate strategy.  </P> <P> Many economists were forecasting that Fed officials would, at the very least,  vote to lower the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on  overnight loans.  </P> <P> Some analysts were looking for an even more dramatic signal that the Fed was  easing credit conditions in the form of a cut in the Fed's discount rate, the  interest the Fed charges to commercial banks.  </P> <P> There was less consensus on that development, however. The Fed hasn't reduced  its discount rate, 6.5%, in more than four years.  </P></p>

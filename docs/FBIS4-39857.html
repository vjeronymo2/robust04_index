			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran 11 June TASS -- A Turkmen parliamentary  delegation led by Parliament Speaker Sakhat Muradov arrived in  Iran on a three-day visit on Saturday [11 June].    Meeting journalists at Tehran's airport upon his arrival,  Muradov said that Iran and Turkmenistan have "very good"  relations and called for their development, including between  the parliaments of the two countries.    Iranian Parliament Chairman 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri welcomed  Muradov's visit as useful for stepping up the implementation of  previous bilateral agreements.    Muradov and Nateq-Nuri will discuss among other things the  construction of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe via  Iran. The agreement to this effect was reached earlier and  confirmed by the Iranian and Turkmen presidents during their  one-day meeting in the Iranian city of Mehrabad in late May.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Thrift and interest rates Sir, A historical analysis which goes back further than 1974 ('Saving days are here again', August 27) suggests a consumer recovery may depend on understanding public attitudes and beliefs as much as economic prospects. Over 40 years ago, J Gordon Lippincott said: 'The major problem is one of stimulating the urge to buy. It must be nurtured even though it is contrary to one of the oldest inbred laws of humanity - the law of thrift - of providing for the unknown and oft-feared day of scarcity.' He succeeded. Whether present day marketers can do so depends on more than real interest rates. L Kreitzman, The Henley Centre, 2/4 Tudor Street, London EC4Y 0AA</p>

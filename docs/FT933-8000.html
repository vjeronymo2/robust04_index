			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Days of the one-way currency bet are over: Speculation in the ERM may be more difficult FRENCH and German politicians have recently expressed grave concern at the profits made by currency speculators during the recent crises in the European exchange rate mechanism. But, ironically, foreign exchange dealers are themselves beginning to wonder whether recent events were the last opportunity to make easy profits by placing big one-way bets on the devaluations of weaker European currencies. Instead, they think that profits will come more from sophisticated marketmaking activities now that governments have allowed currencies to float within very wide bands. Some players, like Mr George Soros, the head of the Quantum hedge fund in New York, have made big returns by selling a currency to its central bank as it approached the ERM floor against the D-Mark and buying it back when it had devalued. But, with the new 15 per cent limits, the build-up of investor pressure as a currency approaches its floor may be less common. 'The phenomenon of central banks providing the market with a profit as they try to maintain fixed exchange rates may not be there in future,' says the head of currency dealing at a top London bank. Instead, dealers are learning to live with a different market, one in which European exchange rates move two ways but over bigger distances than they did when they were straitjacketed in smaller bands. 'A 2 or 3 centime move in the D-Mark/French franc exchange rate is now a daily phenomenon,' says one London currency dealer. 'That cross rate might have budged by only a fraction of that amount until recently.' The new situation highlights the importance for banks of their intermediary role as marketmakers, buying a currency from a client and selling it at a more lucrative price to another. 'It becomes far more important to make markets in this kind of environment,' says Mr Chris Deuters, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Bros in London. Marketmaking may sound less ambitious and exciting than taking aggressive one-way bets. But, currency managers at the leading commercial banks in London - at institutions such as Citibank, NatWest Markets or Barclays - say they have been focusing on this for some time. This is partly through necessity. Commercial banks' balance sheets were weakened by the asset price deflation of the 1980s, making managers much more averse to risk-taking. And, even if they wanted to speculate in currencies, the Bank for International Settlements' directives restrict the amount of long-term risk a commercial bank can undertake with its cash holdings. But, the returns on marketmaking have also been huge. Citibank, which claims to be one of the leading interbank counterparties in the London market, recently reported an increase in revenues from Dollars 377m (Pounds 253m) in the first half of 1992 to Dollars 592m in the first six months of this year. Chase Manhattan, another leading interbank dealer in the London market, also reported increased revenues, up from Dollars 124m in the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 188m in the first half of 1993. A top official revealed his bank's profits were up 90 per cent on those for the first half of 1992. 'These are the kinds of figures being reported by the major banks in the London currency market,' he says. What is striking about these revenues is that they came in a six-month period which saw few crises in the ERM. The punt, peseta and escudo were devalued, but these are comparatively illiquid markets where speculative profits are limited. Instead, several new phenomena in the currency market helped transform two-way pricemaking in currencies into a lucrative activity. The volumes of currency flowing across the foreign exchanges increased because of the greater activity of pension funds in international asset allocation. The International Monetary Fund reported earlier this year that cross-border equity holdings in the US, Japan and Europe had increased from Dollars 800bn in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991. Fund managers invest increasingly large quantities in overseas bond and equity markets - and they first have to buy foreign currencies from the commercial banks to purchase these instruments. The banks are living in a period of increasing turnover in foreign currencies, estimated at a global Dollars 1,000bn a day. Once fund managers and multinational companies have bought overseas equities and bonds, they protect them from volatile exchange rates. After the exit of sterling from the ERM last year, many banks in London and New York discovered greater customer interest in their derivatives, which allow the purchaser to hedge risk. The increased role of fund managers means that a small group of banks have the liquidity to handle the huge flows in foreign exchange, so currency business is becoming concentrated in the hands of the top 10 or 12 commercial banks in the London market. 'We are picking up the business of people we had never heard of two or three years ago,' says Mr Albert Maasland, head of sales at Chase Manhattan Bank in London. Commercial bank dealers may have reasons to feel unsure about the future of the business. The prospect of capital controls has recently been mooted by French and Belgian politicians as a means of containing large-scale capital moves. Implementation of those controls would dry up the fluctuation in European exchange rates. So, too, would any fast track move to European Monetary Union. Both moves would be difficult for governments to take because of the difficulty they have already experienced co-ordinating their monetary policies. But for the moment, currency managers can profit from daily exchange rate movements, whether they are in the thick of a speculative crisis or not.</p>

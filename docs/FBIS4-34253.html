			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mexico City, 16 Jun (EFE) -- More than 10,000  people today took part in a demonstration called by the Crusade  for Peace. The demonstration, which followed the Zapatist  National Liberation Army's [EZLN] refusal to sign a peace  agreement, took place in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas.    The demonstration came four days after the EZLN announced  that it will not accept the government's response to its demands  and that it will not sign a peace agreement in Chiapas. Most of  the demonstrators wore white clothes, which, according to them,  symbolize their hope for restoring peace in the state, and they  asked that war be avoided because it will only engender more  misery.    Jose Perez, leader of the Tzotzil, one of three major Indian  groups in the area, indicated that his people want to live in  peace and that they plan to respect the law, as long as it is  fair and equitable.    Perez stressed that peace begins with respect for the law,  adding: "We, Indians, have our own customs, which do not  contradict the laws of the nation and which also deserve to be  respected by the authorities."

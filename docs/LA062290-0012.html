			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVING HOME NEED FOR ALTERNATIVES TO CARS  </P> <P> Many thanks for Connie Koenenn's inspiring story on people choosing to give up  their cars for more sustainable and healthful modes of transportation  ("Shifting Gears," June 19).  </P> <P> I tell folks quite regularly that switching to sustainable (non-fossil-fueled)  transportation is going to be one of our next big movements for social and  environmental change.  </P> <P> Usually, people just laugh at that. After all, we are the car-consuming capital  of the world.  </P> <P> I'm pleased that now I'll have something in print proving that lots of ordinary  folks are making the extraordinary choice simply to do what's sensible for  personal and planetary health.  </P> <P> LOIS ARKIN  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Cooperative Resources &amp; Services Project  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

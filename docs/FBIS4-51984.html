			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["General Kim Chong-il, Most Outstanding Genius of Military </F> Affairs in Present Era" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Copies of a literature  titled "General Kim Chong-il Is the Most Outstanding Genius of  Military Affairs in the Present Era" were recently scattered at  the barracks and posts of a unit of the South Korean puppet Army  near the Military Demarcation Line, stirring up the hearts of  the officers and soldiers, according to Radio Voice of National  Salvation from Seoul.    The literature in the name of the "Patriotic Soldiers  Committee" said:    The secret of the great might of the North which is  undauntedly standing against the United States styling itself  "the only superpower" lies in that General Kim Chong-il, the  greatest general in the world, is wisely leading the Army and  the people.    General Kim Chong-il is the most outstanding genius of  military affairs in the present era who is possessed of military  resources of chuche, matchless courage and tested commanding art.    Thanks to his military gift, the People's Army could grow up  to be a-match-for-a-hundred invincible army, a genuine national  army capable of repulsing any aggression of outside forces at  one blow and defending the sovereignty of the nation.    It is the great pride and honour of our nation to have such  a  genuine national army as the people's Army. If we are to be a  true national army, we must be led by General Kim Chong-il,  Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.    The "ROK" Army soldiers should know that to turn the guns at  the U.S. aggressors and their stooges with a bold decision is a  patriotic action to become a genuine national army defending the  sovereignty of the nation and to live up to the intention of  General Kim Chong-il, the outstanding genius of military affairs  produced by our nation.</p>

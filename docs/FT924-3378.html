			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: BHP to cut debt after asset sale raises ADollars 400m BHP, the Australian industrial and mining conglomerate, has sold ADollars 400m of assets to Westpac Banking, the Australian bank. BHP said the company had sold a ADollars 400m (USDollars 277m) parcel of A Redeemable Preference shares in Beswick and that further sales were contemplated. Beswick was the vehicle BHP used to buy its own shares in the mid-1980s when the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court attempted to take over BHP. Beswick controls around 20 per cent of BHP. BHP is sitting on a large capital gain on the investment because the shares were acquired at a price of around ADollars 7, compared with BHP's current price of ADollars 11.30. The Beswick vehicle was set up with a complex structure involving BHP holding ADollars 990m in A Class redeemable preference shares, ADollars 73.3m in ordinary voting shares and ADollars 500m in non-voting convertible preference shares. Other shareholders, in various classes of securities, are Fosters Brewing, Westpac and ANZ Trustees. The sales announced yesterday reduces BHP's holding in A Redeemable preference shares to ADollars 590m. BHP said it would apply proceeds of the sale to debt reduction. Earlier this year BHP took effective control of Foster's Brewing for around ADollars 1.7bn.</p>

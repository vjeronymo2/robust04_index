			<p>BFN     [Text] Dariusz Rosati, the coalition's candidate for the  posts of deputy prime minister and minister of finance, has not  yet made a final decision concerning the withdrawal of his  candidacy for these posts. He said in our early morning program  that this will take a few days. Rosati said that, at the  request of representatives of both coalition parties, he has  changed his earlier decision to resign as the candidate. In his  opinion, failing to appoint someone to the post of deputy prime  minister for economic affairs and minister of finance has  aroused concern in Poland and abroad.    [Begin recording] [Rosati] My impression is that the  situation is certainly not good when there is no one responsible  for the economy, when there is no one with whom one can have  responsible talks on what government policy will be in the near  future, on how the government will try to resolve the situation  concerning the pressure of demands for pay hikes, how the  government will solve the problem of restructuring of the state  industries, etc.    [Reporter Olejnik] Would you put your name to this budget?    [Rosati] I have already said that the budget bill, in fact  the budget itself [pauses]... Is this what you mean?    [Olejnik] Yes, yes.    [Rosati] The budget is a compromise between needs and  capabilities, and, personally, I think I would sign my name  under this budget.    [Olejnik] And what is your opinion on the excess wage tax  [Popiwek] law? As you know, the president has not signed this  law.    [Rosati] I was against Popiwek from the very beginning, and  I  did not like the new version of the law, either. I favor  adopting different solutions, as I have written before.  However, at the moment, we are in the worst possible situation  because we do not have any law, and we also do not know if there  is going to be any law in the future. Consequently, there is an  incentive here for work enterprises to take advantage of this  short period, when there is a lack of any legal regulations, and  introduce pay rises. [end recording]    [Announcer] Monika Olejnik was talking to Professor Rosati.</p>

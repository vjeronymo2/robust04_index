			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA HEIGHTS;  </P> <P> 7 AIRPORT-AREA HOMES ADDED TO NOISE LIST  </P> <P> A slight increase in average noise levels at John Wayne Airport has added seven  homes to a list of 73 in the Santa Ana Heights area that must be insulated or  removed from residential use under state regulations, airport officials said  this week.  </P> <P> Officials said the homes will be insulated, purchased by the county or be  rezoned as business-use land. The seven homes are in the area of Pegasus and  Indus streets and Orchard Drive.  </P> <P> So far, four of the 80 residences now in the noise impact zone have been bought  by the county; the remainder are at various stages of processing for either  insulation or purchase by the county.  </P> <P> No specific reason was found for the slight noise increase during the period  from Jan. 1 to March 31, although officials reported major technical problems  that resulted in repairs to one of the noise-monitoring devices stationed in  the area.  </P> <P> And actual average daily jet operations -- takeoffs and landings -- decreased  slightly from 206 in the previous quarter to 205 during the three months ending  March 31, according to a study released by the airport staff. In the first  quarter of 1988, the daily average was 206 jet operations.  </P> <P> Although average noise levels had increased, the number of citizen complaints  declined 22% during the first quarter of 1989, county noise abatement officials  said, compared to the previous quarter, and were down 6.8% compared to the  first three months of 1988.  </P> <P> Historically, county officials said, complaints have peaked during increased  political activity involving airport planning decisions, but otherwise have not  necessarily followed a particular pattern.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Downtown Los Angeles may not qualify as a paradise for athletes yet, but the  Freeway City does offer a growing number of hidden-away sports facilities above  the fumes.  </P> <P> The latest is a driving range for golfers on the roof of the L.A. World Trade  Center off Figueroa Street. Just the thing for the duffer who can't get height  on his shots -- you start out six stories above the ground!  </P> <P> "I think it's a great way to spend your lunchtime -- to kind of get away from  it all," said Trade Center Director Al Dougal.  </P> <P> The driving range joins such out-of-view attractions as the YMCA's rooftop  tennis courts (alongside the driving range), the jogging track atop City Hall  East, and the third-floor bowling alley in Yaohan Plaza in Little Tokyo. (Alas,  the fitness craze suffered a setback when the avant-garde miniature golf course  at the L.A. Contemporary Exhibitions gallery recently closed.)  </P> <P> The Trade Center hopes that the driving range, which opened two weeks ago, will  attract Civic Center types as well as visiting businessmen.  </P> <P> There's even a rooftop pro, Jim Westmoreland, on hand to give lessons.  </P> <P> For those who choose to go it alone (at $5 per half hour), Dougal said: "Our  two lanes are about 70 feet long so you get a good idea of whether you're  hooking or slicing."  </P> <P> While errant shots from the Griffith Park courses often land on the Golden  State Freeway, Trade Center hackers needn't worry about skulling an automobile  or pedestrian below.  </P> <P> "The lanes," Dougal said, "are double-netted."  </P> <P> When he was 15, John Goddard made a "blueprint for life" of 127 goals,  including diving in a submarine, landing on an aircraft carrier, riding in the  Tournament of Roses Parade and walking on the moon.  </P> <P> One of the above has eluded him: The moon walk. Yes, he did survive the terror  of the post-Rose Parade traffic jam.  </P> <P> Goddard, an anthropologist/explorer who belongs to the Royal Geographic  Society, says he has accomplished 108 of the goals. His home in La Canada  Flintridge is filled with mementoes and clippings attesting to his feats, which  he recounts in lectures and motivational speeches.  </P> <P> After thinking up new projects over the years, he drew up a second list. And  the other day, he fulfilled a more recent wish -- flying a B-1 bomber.  </P> <P> Goddard, 64, took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Tex., with a bomber  crew, and flew a four-hour training mission. "It was a tremendous thrill," he  said.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Joseph Purka, a spokesman for the Air Force, said that Goddard -- a  pilot during World War II -- was approved for the mission because he "met the  qualifications." Goddard confessed that he was aided in his dream by a friend,  former Secretary of the Air Force Verne Orr.  </P> <P> What's next? Goddard isn't sure. But there's always goal No. 127 -- "to live to  see the year 2000."  </P> <P> On today's City News Service calendar: "6 p.m., Hollywood -- Frederick's of  Hollywood will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its Celebrity Lingerie Hall  of Fame. Milton Berle will take part."  </P> <P> That's appropriate. The only question is which old female costume from his  television days is Uncle Miltie going to contribute?  </P></p>

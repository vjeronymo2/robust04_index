			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Fresh Start for Deals With French"] </F>   [Text] The arrival of French Premier Edouard Balladur will  push Sino-French business relations into a new era, a senior  Chinese trade official predicted yesterday.    The French premier flies into Beijing for a four-day visit  today and is the most senior French politician to visit China  since 1989.    "China expects Balladur's visit to help push the development  of the two nations trade and economic cooperation," said Tong  Jiemin, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation (Moftec).    The Chinese Government always attaches high importance to  its  business relations with France, a major economic power with high  technology, said Tong, who is responsible for European affairs.    "We're willing to restore the good economic relations with  France that we had before 1989 and we hope the economic  co-operation and trade which has already started between the two  nations will develop for a long period," he added.    Sino-French relations deteriorated in 1992 when the French  government approved the sale of weapons to Taiwan, one of  China's provinces.    Tong said China welcomes French enterprises to join the  competition for the lucrative Chinese market with other foreign  firms.    China is expected to import at least $1,000 billion between  now and the year 2000.    And Sino-French economic co-operation has a good foundation,  especially in energy, transport, telecommunications, chemicals,  agriculture and raw materials.    "We hope France will continue its exploitation of business  possibilities in these sectors as other developed countries have  done," said Tong.    He promised the Chinese Government will help small and  medium- sized enterprises in France to cooperate with their  Chinese counterparts.    China has 410,000 small enterprises, many of them operating  in rural areas, and they have become a major force in the  economy.    Many small Chinese firms are looking for foreign partners to  start joint ventures to open domestic and foreign markets.    Bilateral trade between France and China rose 30 percent to  nearly $3 billion last year.    China's imports of French goods rose 10 percent to $1.64  billion and its exports rose 60 percent to $1.29 billion.    Many French companies have pumped money into co-operative  projects with Chinese firms as the two nations have begun to  trade more.    By the end of last year, French companies had invested $889  million in 549 projects in China. Most of the projects are  located in coastal areas.    Guangzhou Peugeot, a joint venture making cars in Guangdong  Province, is one of the largest foreign-invested enterprises in  China. It is also the third largest foreign-invested car  producer in the country.</p>

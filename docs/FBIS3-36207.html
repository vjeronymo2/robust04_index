			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gerhard Frey, leader of German People's </F> Union, by Boris Vinogradov; place and date not given: "Gerhard  Frey: `I Love Zhirinovskiy and Russia'"]    [Text] As a German newspaper has written, their friendship  flared like a torch in the hands of storm troopers during the  night of the "long knives." The symbolism really does appear  sinister if you consider the fact that the first meeting between  Gerhard Frey and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy took place in Germany  while preparations were being made there to celebrate the 60th  anniversary of Hitler's accession to power, and their second  meeting took place in Moscow while the 50th anniversary of the  lifting of the siege of Leningrad was being celebrated in Russia.    What do the leader of the "German People's Union" and the  leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party have in common?    Considering himself the "best friend" of the German people,  just as Frey is of the Russian people, Vladimir Volfovich cannot  understand why he was refused a German visa. Frey is bringing  an action against the FRG Embassy and is threatening to win the  case, because he has not lost a single court case in his entire  busy life.    Tell me who your friend is.... Evidently knowing this  Russian proverb, at the start of our conversation Gerhard Frey  uttered very flattering words about Zhirinovskiy as the future  president of Russia.    [Vinogradov] Did you know, Dr. Frey, that our readers know  you as an extremist, a neo-Nazi, and publisher of the  ultraright-wing newspaper NATIONALZEITUNG?    [Frey] I have never been either a Nazi or, still less, a  fascist, as the former communist press used to portray me. I  always struggled for my motherland's reunification, but I was  seen as someone who does not recognize the postwar borders and  who demands revanche.    In my opinion, the point is that, having lost an enemy in  the  guise of communism, German journalism, which was created  according to U.S. standards and licenses after the war, lives on  old notions. A new enemy image is now being foisted onto German  society -- in the person of my friend Zhirinovskiy and, thus, in  the person of the Russian voters who voted for him.    [Vinogradov] Did you fall in love with Russia long ago?  After making Zhirinovskiy's acquaintance?    [Frey] I have always loved Russia. Our peoples have much in  common. When Russia and Germany were together, the world only  benefited from that. We suffered the greatest losses, and the  memory of the millions who died must be a guarantee that we  never again end up as enemies.    Let us recall history. Russia saved Frederick the Great in  the Seven Years' War and saved Europe and Germany from Napoleon,  and even in the early twenties, despite the difference in the  systems, the treaty of Rapallo was made possible. Zhirinovskiy  and I advocate the implementation of a friendly policy in Moscow  and Berlin, and then our countries will once again occupy a  worthy place in the world arena. Russia is having a hard time  now, and we must help it to surmount the crisis.    [Vinogradov] How do you rate Zhirinovskiy's calls for the  borders in Europe to be changed? Are they consonant with your  wishes to return to Germany the lands lost after the war?    [Frey] What, in fact, are you talking about? European  borders have long been being redrawn. Examples of this are  provided by Germany, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet  Union. Next came Belgium, Canada, Italy, Ireland.... The 1975  Helsinki Act is a dead document. The Oder-Neisse line is not a  God-given border once and for all. We should proceed from the  peoples' right to self-determination. If the population of  Crimea, for example, or Belarus wishes to reunite with Russia,  who can prevent this? It is perfectly possible that in five or  10 years' time Warsaw will wish to discuss with us the return of  Silesia.    [Vinogradov] But what about Kaliningrad Oblast, the former  East Prussia?    [Frey] I do not doubt that in the future our countries will  find a mutually acceptable way to resolve this problem too.  After all, we have to correct the injustice perpetrated against  Germans driven from their primordial lands, be they Pomerania,  Sudetenland, or Silesia.</p>

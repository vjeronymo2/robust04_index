			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CONDUCTOR MILLER, PIANIST NAOUMOFF AT MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> Friday night, for the second consecutive week, a Los Angeles Philharmonic  program offered the premiere of a work by a living American composer, a  concerto played by a pianist of French conservatory training and, after  intermission, a work from the standard symphonic repertory.  </P> <P> But this week, no scandal enlivened the Philharmonic's performance in the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center.  </P> <P> David Alan Miller, the orchestra's assistant conductor, led a mostly uneventful  concert which opened with a charming, six-minute appetizer, crested on some  elegant, if Romanticized, Mozart and closed with an overblown and noisy reading  of Mahler's First Symphony.  </P> <P> Raucousness is an infrequent, unwelcome guest at Philharmonic events in the  Pavilion. With his precise but unmellow approach to Mahler, Miller seemed to  invite wiry string sounds, poor instrumental-choir blends and tinny brass  playing back into the lively acoustic of the hall. The conductor's strong sense  of pacing at least kept the noise-engine on track, and rolling. But the blast  was not pleasant.  </P> <P> And it was surprising, considering with what sensitivity and full contrasts the  reduced Philharmonic had accompanied Emile Naoumoff in Mozart's G-major  Concerto, K. 453.  </P> <P> The young, Bulgarian-born pianist exhibited admirable lightness and impeccable  technical resources -- masterful trills, exquisite soft-playing, articulate  detailing -- in combination with a bracing directness of expression. Obviously  an accomplished and serious Mozartean -- which is to say, a musician of  substance -- Naoumoff's next visit here ought to reveal his Chopin-esque  side.DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

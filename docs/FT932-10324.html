			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Eurofighter fails to find its wings: The impact of cash disputes and technical delay TO THE embarrassment of all concerned, the Eurofighter is not yet airborne. The prototype of the European Fighter Aircraft, re-baptised Eurofighter 2000 last year, should have flown in 1991, but crucial equipment and software is still awaited. Managers of the joint venture between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain  - which is now expected to cost Pounds 32bn - say the aircraft should fly at Manching in Germany in September. But technical delays are not the only problem. German funding for development work has almost dried up. Five months after a ministerial agreement in December to redefine the project and keep the four-nation partnership, new contract terms are not settled. It is also unclear how the partners will share production work. Eurofighter, the consortium between British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain, is unable even to say who will make the starboard wing. The four governments have agreed, for budgetary reasons, to delay the target date for the first Eurofighters entering service by two years, to 2000. Germany and Spain do not want their aircraft before 2002. But officials say the consortium could not have met the original schedule anyway. At the end of last year the aircraft's electrical generator, supplied by a joint venture between Ferranti International of the UK and the Bendix division of Allied Signal of the US, failed its reliability tests. Fitting an existing generator, heavier and underpowered for the fighter's needs, delayed the first flight by five months. This was less serious than software problems with the 'fly-by-wire' flight control system. The aircraft relies on a computerised system to work its flaps, rudder and the front winglets known as 'canards'. Dasa has overall responsibility for the system but the software comes from GEC-Marconi of the UK. A joint task force including more than 20 British engineers is in Munich carrying out tests on the system. The revised Eurofighter project was designed to allow nations to equip aircraft according to their needs and budgets - the result of Bonn's objection to the project's high price. But the 'menu' approach obscured the question of overall costs. British government and industry officials argued that since Germany followed unique accounting principles, which included in-service costs, its figures could not be translated into sterling estimates. It is now clear that the price asked by the consortium in April 1992, prompting the German crisis, was higher than expected. Reductions forecast in the revised programme were against that price; they were expected to range between 12 and 23 per cent. Britain's saving was put at 14 per cent, through improved manufacturing arrangements and economies in logistical support. But the extra cost in sterling of German components, following the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, has reduced the expected saving to 11 per cent. Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, tried last year to kill the project and have it replaced by a new, smaller aircraft. He failed, but had already cut the funds allocated for Germany's share of the development programme this year. The issue has still to be resolved. Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, new president of Dasa's aircraft division, says the company itself might provide the necessary finance. 'If there are some short-term holes, we are ready to help out,' he said. But the company, which has had to bail out some of its sub-contractors, would claim for the financial charges, adding to programme costs and possibly heralding further budget arguments. The 'silly situation', as Mr Mehdorn calls it, over German funding has clouded work on the revised project. In contrast to the high-profile agreement in December, junior ministers from the four countries agreed on a new programme at a meeting in Bonn on April 5. Under this, contracts for setting up production will not be let until 1995, after the next general election in Germany. Britain consented to a slowing down of the programme only if it did not raise overall costs. The engine consortium Eurojet - comprising Rolls-Royce, Dasa's MTU offshoot, Fiat and ITP of Spain - is expected, however, to receive an increase of up to 5 per cent on its fixed-price development contract to cover a longer period of flight tests. Eurofighter, responsible for the aircraft itself, is also seeking an increase. Government officials say that since Eurofighter is behind with its programme, 'the cost consequences are theirs'. Officials are anxious, however, to prevent a row emerging over responsibilities. They expect new four-nation memoranda of understanding and development contracts to be concluded in the third quarter, coinciding with the first flight. Germany's share of production work has yet to be resolved. Its 33 per cent share in development was based on an expected purchase of 250 aircraft, while the current forecast is 140. Mr Mehdorn says he expects Germany will end up buying more aircraft and is seeking to maintain the same level of participation. The partners want to eliminate the more glaring inefficiencies resulting from collaboration. For example, the radome which covers the radar on the aircraft's nose takes 300 days to produce and spends more than 100 of them moving from one country to another. There is also an overlap between Britain and Spain on the starboard wing. The other wing is Italian. Administrative structures must also be rationalised. Eurofighter, Panavia (an Anglo-German-Italian company overseeing the Tornado project) and two intergovernmental management agencies work side by side in a Munich building. But rivalry makes a merger unlikely for another two years.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-O.C. BANK HEAD, 2 ALLEGED MOB FIGURES ACCUSED OF FRAUD  </P> <P> A former Orange County bank president and two alleged associates of a Los  Angeles organized crime family have been indicted by a federal grand jury for  wire fraud and conspiracy, the U.S. attorney's office announced Wednesday in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The indictments, which stemmed from two separate investigations, were issued in  October, 1987. But they were kept under seal until Aug. 24 and not disclosed  until Wednesday because of another investigation that was recently concluded,  officials said.  </P> <P> Indicted in the first case Wednesday were Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange, former  President of Far Western Bank in Tustin, and Morton Goodman, 53, of West Hills,  an alleged Los Angeles organized crime family associate, according to the  announcement by U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess.  </P> <P> McGinnis was charged with 18 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy  to commit wire fraud. He is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 5 in U.S. District  Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The indictment alleges that McGinnis, while president of Far Western in 1984,  supplied casinos in Las Vegas with fraudulent credit information, allowing  Goodman and his associates to obtain large credit lines for gambling.  </P> <P> Goodman is being held on $250,000 bail pending his arraignment in Los Angeles,  also scheduled for Sept. 5.  </P> <P> Wednesday's announcement follows a lengthy investigation and other indictments.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, John DeMattia, 52, a reputed mob associate of Goodman, pleaded  guilty to wire fraud in the alleged scheme to arrange for gambling credit at  the Las Vegas casinos by inflating bank account records at Far Western. At the  time, prosecutors said DeMattia had the help of an unnamed bank official.  </P> <P> Former federal prosecutor Richard Stavin said last April that Far Western  provided financial references for clients of several casinos, including the Las  Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn and Country Club.  </P> <P> DeMattia also pleaded guilty in April, 1988, to extortion in another case  involving several organized crime figures in Los Angeles. He is still serving  his three-year sentence in Lompoc federal prison, according to Steve Nielsen,  one of the two Los Angeles Police Department organized crime investigators who  worked on the case.  </P> <P> William A. Dougherty, a Villa Park attorney representing McGinnis, said he was  surprised by Wednesday's announcement. "The matter has been pending for over  five years" he said. "We've cooperated, given hand-writing samples. All of a  sudden we get an unsealed indictment. We're planning to plead not guilty."  </P> <P> Dougherty also asserted that all the bank accounts that McGinnis had vouched  for "were good. They didn't put kited checks in the account." McGinnis faces a  maximum of 100 years in prison if convicted.  </P> <P> Neither Goodman nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Goodman faces a  maximum of 25 years if convicted.  </P> <P> McGinnis is no longer with Far Western. The institution is a small bank with an  unusual niche in the industry. After McGinnis left, the bank grew 17-fold  between 1986 and 1988 by purchasing auto loans made by dealers.  </P> <P> In the second indictment announced Wednesday, stemming from a separate  investigation, Feess said that Rocco Toce, 46, of Marina del Rey, also an  alleged associate in Los Angeles organized crime, was arrested by the Los  Angeles Police Department on Aug. 24 after being charged in a federal  indictment with making false statements on a loan application and with  conspiracy. This case also stems from a 1987 sealed indictment.  </P> <P> The charges involve activities at Sunwest Bank in Tustin, where Donald  Hinrichsen, a former bank vice president, allegedly accepted bribes in return  for granting unsecured loans to several reputed mob figures, including DeMattia  and Toce. A trial has been scheduled for Oct. 31.  </P></p>

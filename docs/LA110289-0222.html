			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. AND EUROPEAN TEAMS TIE; STRANGE HAS THE BEST SCORE  </P> <P> Curtis Strange had the day's best score, but the U.S. and European teams  finished in a tie with 6 points apiece today in the $1.03-million Four Tours  World Championship of Golf.  </P> <P> Strange scored a pair of eagles and three birdies en route to a bogey-free 65  and beat Mark James of the European Tour, who had a 71.  </P> <P> Ken Green beat Ian Woosnam, 70-73, and British Open Champ Mark Calcavecchia  edged Jose-Maria Olazabal, 72-73.  </P> <P> The Europeans collected six points after Bernhard Langer beat PGA winner Payne  Stewart, 70-73; Gordon Brand Jr. beat Chip Beck, 68-69; and Ronan Rafferty beat  Tom Kite, the PGA's leading money-winner, 69-70, on the hilly 7,071-yard Tokyo  Yomiuri Country Club course.  </P> <P> "I played well today, especially putting," Strange said. "I am trying my best  all the time. In such team competition, I just beat my opponent but in the  individual competition I must have the best score."  </P> <P> A victory is worth 2 points and a draw worth 1 in the team competition among  four golf tours from the United States, Europe, Australia-New Zealand and  Japan.  </P> <P> The Australia-New Zealand team, led by Greg Norman, beat Japan, 8-4.  </P> <P> After the first round Australia-New Zealand led with 8 points, followed by the  Americans and Europeans with 6 each and Japan with 4.  </P> <P> "We played not aggressively but conservatively in the gusty winds," said  Norman, the captain of Australia-New Zealand.  </P> <P> The United States meets Australia-New Zealand and Japan plays Europe on Friday  in the round-robin tournament.  </P> <P> After the three rounds, the two top teams will face off in the final match  Sunday, which will earn $390,000 for the winning team.  </P> <P> The Americans have won the tournament the last two years.  </P></p>

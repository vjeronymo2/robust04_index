			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Plea on Bank by ex-Treasury chief THE CAMPAIGN to give the Bank of England independent control over monetary policy gained another convert last night when Sir Peter Middleton, until two years ago the top civil servant at the Treasury, said the change would help bring down inflation. Giving evidence to the Commons' Treasury and civil service committee, Sir Peter said he favoured a long-term inflation target of between zero and 2 per cent. This compares with the government's target for underlying inflation of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. Sir Peter is now chairman of the Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment group, and was Treasury permanent secretary between 1983 and 1991. He said letting the Bank set interest rates rather than the chancellor would mean that the government had fewer levers to pull in managing economic policy. But if Britain agreed that keeping inflation low in the long-term was important, an independent Bank was 'probably the best way' to achieve this. The evidence from Sir Peter surprised some members of the committee because, while he was at the Treasury, it was assumed he was among the leaders in the fight to prevent any handing over of interest rate responsibility to the Bank. Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne, Bank of England governor between 1973 and 1983 and also in favour of independence for the central bank, told the committee that Britain would have had greater success in combating inflation if the Bank had been able to set interest rates free from political pressures.</p>

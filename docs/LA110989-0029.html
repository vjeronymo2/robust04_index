			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAINER GETS EARLY WEDDING PRESENT  </P> <P> Four days before the big event, Victor Garcia collected a memorable wedding  present.  </P> <P> Approved To Fly, best known previously for having her number taken down after  the 1988 Del Mar Debutante, rallied under Alex Solis to win the $81,225 Linda  Vista Handicap Wednesday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Owner of only a maiden victory at Caliente and an allowance win at Del Mar in  13 previous starts, the 3-year-old Flying Paster filly overhauled favored  Affirmed Classic in the final yards to win going away in 1:42 1/5 for the 1 1/6  miles.  </P> <P> Approved To Fly's 6-1 upset provided the 25-year-old Garcia, the son of  Caliente operator Juan Garcia, with his second Oak Tree stakes victory. Last  year, he saddled Wait Till Monday to win the Henry P. Russell Handicap.  </P> <P> Given eight months off after finishing fourth in the Bay Meadows Oaks in  January, Approved To Fly cruised in her sprint comeback, then ran second to  Affirmed Classic in the Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> A trip to Kentucky proved fruitless. She never mounted a rally and wound up  sixth, 13 lengths back of Winning Colors at Turfway Park.  </P> <P> "The track was kind of heavy and was favoring speed horses," said Garcia, who  will wed Litta Parra Sunday in San Diego. "The horse had a little heat in the  ankle when we turned her out, but it was nothing bad.  </P> <P> "She's more experienced now. She was green before and used to lug in and out."  </P> <P> Seeking her third consecutive victory for Ron McAnally since arriving in  California, Affirmed Classic appeared to be home free a sixteenth out, but  couldn't contain the winner. With Russell Baze sitting in for Jesus Castanon,  still nursing a bruised shoulder after being dumped in a workout spill Sunday,  she was nearly two lengths clear of stablemate Paper Princess.  </P> <P> "I saved ground all the way to the quarter pole," said Solis, the rider when  Approved To Fly was disqualified for bothering Lea Lucinda in the Debutante.  "At the quarter pole, she got clear and in the last sixteenth I whipped her  left-handed and she took off."  </P> <P> Oak Tree Notes  </P> <P> In his third full day in Southern California, Gary Boulanger doubled Wednesday.  The 21-year-old rider from Longacres in Washington won with 25-1 shot More  Golden in the second and Only The Facts in the fourth. . . . There's a Pick Six  carryover for today of $59,450. . . . Although she has only one stakes win,  Approved To Fly has been second in four others. . . . Her Linda Vista victory  was worth $47,475 to owners Barry and Judith Becker. . . . The Hillsborough  Handicap from Bay Meadows will be simulcast locally Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Nooks and crannies from a fogies' cult THE SPECTATOR ANNUAL Edited by Dominic Lawson HarperCollins, Pounds 20, 309 pages The Spectator is a remarkable survival. When Lord Gilmour owned it in the early 1960s, he said that it could never regularly sell more than 50,000 copies a week and was unlikely ever to make much money. In those years it trailed the New Statesman in readership and perhaps in prestige, though intellectual fashion was already beginning to change away from socialism towards a more radical liberalism. Today The Spectator is a kind of English cult, way ahead of the Statesman. Part of the Conrad Black/Telegraph empire, it appears financially sound. Liberalism has given way to conservatism, old fogies  - in Alan Watkins's phrase - to young fogies, and there is another oddity. The Spectator must be one of the few publications in recent times to have been edited by father and son. Nigel Lawson was the editor in the late 1960s; his son, Dominic, has been in charge for the last few years. P D James, the detective writer, is wrong when she writes in her foreword to this year's Spectator Annual that no one has ever cast the paper aside with the comment 'nothing worth reading this week'. There are times when Jeffrey Bernard is unwell and Christopher Fildes is on holiday when one does precisely that. On the other hand, there are weeks when, skipping a few of its regular columnists, The Spectator is pretty compelling almost from beginning to end. That is the merit of the annual collection. There is bound to be something that one can pick up with pleasure. This year's choice (much of it is from 1992) starts with a wonderful interview by Candida Crewe of the Tory MP, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn. On his colleague Edwina Currie, Fairbairn comments (quite unfairly) 'I can't stand the hag'. And with that, notes Ms Crewe, 'he thumped the desk again and took a final swig from his glass of Meerlust'. Where else would you find a minor politician written about at such length and with such candour? The Spectator is good at digging into the nooks and crannies of English life. There is an essay by Hardy Amies, the fashion designer, which tells much that one didn't know - 'I wanted to work in Europe but ended up in Birmingham'. Then it turns out that Amies is a friend of Enoch Powell, a real Spectator stalwart. At times the paper has a very good Diary. Max Hastings, the editor of the Daily Telegraph, writes well about the problems of running a broadsheet when the tabloids are making the running by intrusions on royal privacy. Alec Guinness and P D James herself have come up with excellent diary contributions, all of which suggests a sense of variety. The trouble is that the variety all comes recognisably from the same stable. Some of it is actually reprinted in the Telegraph, and even where it is not, the writers heavily overlap. Perhaps this is a virtue. If so, it could be extended. Andrew Knight, who was once part of the group, is an accomplished journalist, but appears here only once. Conrad Black would make an outstanding political columnist, but appears not at all. Christopher Fildes, with his City and Suburban, deserves more space than he gets. Still, nothing in the collection will shock you. It is the perfect bedside book.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mitchell family cuts Wimpey stake to 5% A 70-year link between the Mitchell family and George Wimpey was loosened yesterday when Grove Charity Management raised more than Pounds 110m from selling a 29 per cent stake in the construction group. The 84.3m shares were placed with a wide number of institutions by SG Warburg Securities and Cazenove. Wimpey's share price, which fell by 4p following the announcement to 142p, has more than doubled since its low of 67p last September. The charitable trust was established in 1955 by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, who bought Wimpey, a west London stone mason, for Pounds 3,000 in 1919. Grove will remain Wimpey's largest shareholder, with a 5 per cent stake. Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, said yesterday that he had been aware for 18 months that the trust wanted to widen its investment portfolio. The placing would make it more difficult for a predator to mount a takeover bid, as the shares would be more widely held . 'The rules governing charitable trusts meant that if it had received an attractive single offer for all its shares it would have been required to sell in the best interests of the beneficiaries,' said Mr Dwyer. The trust provides funds for a wide range of UK social and welfare projects. It controls investments worth about Pounds 270m, of which the Wimpey stake formerly represented about 40 per cent. Trustees include Mrs Mary Graves and Mrs Helen Dunwell, Sir Sir Godfrey's daughters. Dr Desmond Graves, husband of Mrs Mary Graves will remain on the Wimpey board. Seven years ago the trust reduced its 49.9 per cent stake to 34 per cent. It said it had no intention of reducing its stake below 5 per cent. The disposal, however, may make it easier for Wimpey to issue equity to raise cash, should it eventually consider this necessary.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Prescriptions for world prosperity: Industry to succeed finance - Leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states meet in Munich this week. Four senior economic ministers set out their contrasting views on the micro-economic and structural challenges facing the former states of the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and the west In the '30 glorious years' which followed the end of the second world war, the world enjoyed a period of almost uninterrupted growth. Then came the oil crises of the early and late 1970s, with their attendant disruption: massive unemployment, inflation and budgetary deficits and a currency war. Relative stability was replaced by uncontrolled change. Towards the end of the 1970s, the perplexity of the professional economists was matched by the inability of the governments of the developed countries to produce a co-ordinated response to the world's economic difficulties. In the absence of a solution, they came up with a declaration of intent: only market forces could cleanse the sins of a world which was too interventionist, over-regulated and burdened with too much debt. Fortunately, the governments involved, including those whose public pronouncements were coloured by ideology, demonstrated a high degree of realism and pragmatism. So it was that, throughout the 1980s, the seven leading industrialised nations tirelessly devoted their energies to bringing order to the chaos in exchange rates and financial markets. The Plaza and Louvre agreements of 1985 and 1987, which stabilised the exchange rates between the world's strongest currencies, the third-world debt crisis which has been brought under control but not resolved, and the rapid and effective response to the 1987 stock market crash will all leave their mark on history. The risk of having a 'casino economy' running totally out of control was averted, thanks to an active policy of international co-operation. Can we stop there? Clearly the answer is 'no'. The list of challenges facing the world economy is daunting. Many politicians, businessmen and trade unionists in Germany, Japan, Great Britain and France believe that the priorities have changed. The 1990s will be the decade of enterprise, of micro-economics and the production system; in other words, it will be largely dominated by industry, in contrast to the pre-eminence of finance in the previous decade. Technological progress, protection of the environment, the changing face of labour relations, work sharing in the rich countries and wealth sharing between rich and poor countries, the safety of nuclear power stations and the flow of investment into the countries of eastern Europe will be the most important issues in the years ahead. There is only one possible approach to these problems: international economic co-operation must be extended to cover all these areas. It may surprise some people to learn that so many of us, from such different ideological backgrounds, share the conviction that it is absolutely vital to regulate the 'real' economy. But should we not be paying as much attention to environmental matters, strategic manufacturing, unemployment or economic reform in eastern Europe, as to the topic which dominated discussion in the past: exchange rates? No one is foolish enough to believe that agreement on the problems will produce agreement on the solutions. The content of the co-operation package, even more than its form, will emerge from a confrontation of viewpoints which will sometimes be divergent, if only because national interests do not always coincide. But whatever the difficulties presented by industrial co-operation, we know it can be achieved. National experience offers a wealth of examples - the Keiretsu industrial groups and co-operative agreements maintained under the aegis of Japan's ministry of trade and industry, links between industry and the banks in Germany, military and space programmes in the US. The progress of the economies of Europe, the US and Japan is at stake. Today, industrial co-operation is more necessary than ever, throughout the world, to ensure the development of sectors which are essential to world growth and which will not be nurtured by market forces alone. The author is France's trade and industry minister.</p>

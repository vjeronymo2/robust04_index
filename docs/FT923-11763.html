			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Book Review: No premium on merit FOR WHOM THE BELLTOLLS: the lessons of Lloyd's of London By Jonathan Mantle Sinclair Stevenson, Pounds 18 NIGHTMARE ON LIMESTREET: whatever happened to Lloyd's of London By Cathy Gunn Smith Gryphon, Pounds 15.99 Lloyd's of London, Britain's insurance market, faces a crisis of historic proportions. Record losses have been made, hundreds of Names - the individuals who stake their personal fortunes on its fortunes - face financial disaster, and hundreds more are opting to leave the market, threatening a long-term erosion of the capital base. The depth of the crisis (and repeated warnings from angry Names that the market is poised on the brink of meltdown) has attracted media attention. Jonathan Mantle and Cathy Gunn have written the first two of what promises to be a steady stream of books on Lloyd's. Neither For Whom The Bell Tolls nor Nightmare On Lime Street are without their merits. Gunn's somewhat breathless account has clearly been written at speed. But it does contain a good assessment of the damage done to Lloyd's by American asbestos claims, pollution and lawyers, as well as detailed accounts of such matters as the use of new technology at the Lloyd's market. Mantle's early pages provide an entertaining history of the Lloyd's market, full of telling details: the way, for example, that at the end of the second world war, underwriters 'made a fortune' by selling 'buzz bomb' policies covering Londoners against death or loss of limb - 'death and spare parts' - from V1 and V2 rocket bomb attacks. Mantle weaves the history of Lloyd's by telling the stories of loss-making Names. This is an effective narrative device, and lends shape and coherence to the account. But both books contain serious weaknesses. Both have been overtaken by recent events. Two independent reports into regulation and management at Lloyd's, which will decisively influence the market's shape, were published days after Nightmare On Lime Street and For Whom The Bell Tolls appeared in bookshops. Though the authors can scarcely be blamed for this, both books have other shortcomings. For Whom the Bell Tolls is littered with minor factual errors. At the beginning of the book, Mantle claims that John Julius Angerstein became chairman of Lloyd's in the 1720s, not the correct year of 1795, and again, erroneously, that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake produced cargo rather than fire claims. Mantle also seems to be unaware of the existence of specialist commercial insurance and reinsurance companies, repeatedly implying that Lloyd's and the London market are one and the same thing. His purportedly 'exclusive' account of the Piper Alpha disaster in July 1988 and the operation of the spiral - the mechanism by which Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsured each other's exposure to catastrophe losses - fails to mention the significant participation - and losses - of reinsurance companies. Neither author gets to grips with the central business problems faced by Lloyd's. Mantle's failure is particularly conspicuous because he tells the story of Lloyd's problems purely from the vantage point of the worst hit and most vociferous Names. While the views of outside Names are accepted on face value and quoted at length, there is little evidence that Mantle has talked to anybody who works at Lloyd's. Of the 86 sources listed at the beginning of his book, few, if any, are active underwriters or brokers. Not surprisingly, Mantle fails to describe adequately, or to analyse, the peculiar business structure of the market, in which the relationship between the Name and the agent is probably a unique form of capitalist association. Instead he lumps agents, the market, syndicates, and the corporation together in a catch-all category of the establishment. This elite of greedy and morally bankrupt insiders collectively conspires to the detriment of thousands of gullible and defenceless investors, Mantle indicates. To criticise this approach is not to suggest that the working Names do not, on average, do better than outsiders, or that all in the Lloyd's garden is rosy. As a report by a committee headed by Sir David Walker, the outgoing chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, made clear earlier this month, insiders 'tended overall to fare better than external Names', though not 'in general and in most years, on an immodest scale given (their) inevitably superior market knowledge'. Sir David's report also contains trenchant criticisms of the way Lloyd's has conducted its business - poor management by agencies, poor underwriting by underwriters and inadequate regulation. But Mantle's obsession with conspiracy blinds him to these serious issues and lets those responsible off the hook.</p>

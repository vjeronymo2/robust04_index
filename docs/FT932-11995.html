			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Agents offer broad support MEMBERS and managing agents reacted positively yesterday as they digested the significance of the 70-page Lloyd's business plan. Mr George Stephens, group managing director of Hayter Brockbank, said: 'I took the morning off to read it. I felt I ought to know the details.' ; He ended up extremely optimistic. 'It's the best plan we've got at the moment and it's probably the right one,' he said. 'Really and truly I think Lloyd's should support it.' However, he admitted: 'It will chip our income a bit.' Most market participants particularly welcomed Lloyd's recommendation to ring-fence losses from the insurance market made in past years. Several also said it was good news for encouraging corporate capital into the market, while at the very worst doing nothing to harm further the position of existing Names. Mr Stephens said he had been talking to four or five parties about new capital and said he was 'fairly confident' about how discussions were progressing. 'It's got to be good for Names,' he said. ' At the very least it is neutral and at best it means better profits and more control of the market to help avoid the catastrophes of the past.' Mr Terry Heyday, chief executive of the insurance division of Sturge, said: 'This is a workable, bold and fundamentally sound blueprint for the future. We welcome it.' He added: 'Generally it is extremely good news and a very professional document, given that it was put together in a short time.' Mr Heyday, who chaired the Lloyd's working party within the review of the market on documentation and accounting, said: 'The move to electronic trading is an opportunity to move forward and cut down on the paper that bogs the market down. It will make transactions less costly to handle.' He stressed that Sturge had already reduced its fee as managing agents. 'Some others will find it difficult,' he said. His criticisms were minor. 'There is still a lot of work to be done on taxation and regulatory issues,' he said. Mr John Robson, managing director of Anton members' agency, said: 'My reaction is very positive. I'm delighted by the general thrust of the report. My only criticisms would be on points of detail. Everything we had hoped for has been addressed.' He said his agency had never conducted tax advice and so would not be affected by the reduction. One omission from the report, which he said he welcomed, was the issue of 'divorcing' members and managing agents, to prevent conflicts of interest. 'Names have the choice,' he said. 'Where we see our role diminishing is in back-office administration. But there are clear economies of scale.' Mr Peter Aitchison, executive chairman of Cotesworth &amp; Co, a members' agency, said: 'It required something of this magnitude. I feel the declaration that we finally cast aside the way of ruling the business for 300 years was long overdue.' He said he welcomed the impact that it would have on the professionals in the insurance market. 'It has been very sad to see the good name of Lloyd's undermined by those who should never had been there.' He said the impact of the recommendations on managing and members' agents would be 'to squeeze overheads. We are all going to have to tighten our belts hard . . . but so what? So are Names. That is the nature of capitalism.'</p>

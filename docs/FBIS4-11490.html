			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Concerns and Questions"] </F>   [Text] The February consumer price index (or the inflation  rate, as Colombians see it) has given rise to legitimate concern  among our economic authorities and, in general, among all  players in the economy. The February inflation rate does more  than just affect the pocketbooks of the Colombian people. It  also shows that something about economic policy or the country's  structure of production is preventing us from reaching the not  very ambitious goal (as we have remarked before) of cutting the  inflation rate to 19 percent in 1994 and below that in future  years.    Perhaps because of concern over the failure to achieve quick  success in the battle against inflation, we are starting to  perceive some degree of despair among our authorities,  especially the Board of Directors of the Bank of the Republic,  and private businessmen. The latest news is that a new package  of measures is being cooked up "to stem overseas borrowing and  slow the growth of the money supply."    According to the information that this paper published last  weekend, the idea is to tighten controls over the inflow of  foreign exchange into the country through overseas borrowing and  thus to ease the pressure on the amount of money in circulation,  which is expanding at a rate of 40 percent a year, when the Bank  of the Republic's Board set a target of 21 to 27 percent for  1994.    Concern among the authorities is compounded by concern among  businessmen and production unions over the fast pace at which  the peso is strengthening vis-a-vis the dollar and the  currencies of the countries with which Colombia trades actively.  The fact is that while inflation remains stubbornly at around 23  percent, the exchange rate is declining at 8 to 10 percent a  year. As a result, it is impossible to sustain the real exchange  rate (another of the Bank of the Republic's goals) and to  prevent a greater revaluation of the peso, to the detriment of  the production sector and, in particular, exporters. This is why  various circles, including former presidents, are pressing for  an accelerated devaluation (something that politicians are  welcoming), even if it means faster money supply growth and,  ultimately, an inflation rate that exceeds the Bank of the  Republic's target.    Given this state of affairs, even the casual observer would  notice the conflict between the Bank of the Republic (which is  primarily interested in reducing inflation) and the private  sector, which fears that economic policy will lead to a sharper  revaluation of the peso that will irreversibly harm the domestic  and foreign competitiveness of our companies.    This apparent conflict between the monetary and  exchange-rate  authority (the Board of the Bank of the Republic) and the  private sector ought not to continue and widen, because the risk  is that the process of trade and financial liberalization will  lose "credibility," thus increasing the pressure to reverse the  series of reforms that the Gaviria administration has undertaken  to internationalize the Colombian economy. Even more seriously,  this would be happening in the midst of an election campaign to  choose President Gaviria's successor.    In a way, then, what is required is that the Board of the  Bank of the Republic, the government, and the private sector  alike coldly analyze what is going on. Is there simply an  excessive flow of capital into the country that demands a  tightening of controls, or is an even larger budget deficit  required in these new times? Does the production of foodstuffs  require new and greater incentives after all? Or does the  inflation rate have to be under 10 or 15 percent a year in order  for the liberalization to be successful?    We do not have answers to these questions, but we want to  pose them to shed light on an issue that is all too important to  the country's future development. The credibility of economic  policy and the prestige of the Board of the Bank of the Republic  are not the only things at stake; so is the fate of the various  production sectors and of many Colombian companies.</p>

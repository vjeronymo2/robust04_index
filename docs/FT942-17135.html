			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tobacco growers abandon their pipe dreams - Caution is the watchword for this year's Zimbabwe auctions Zimbabwe's flue-cured tobacco auction auction season open today at a time when, in the words of one marketing expert: 'There's a lot of pessimism around'. Growers and buyers alike predict a cautious, soft start to the sales after last year's shocks, when growers could hardly believe how little was paid for good quality tobacco. In the first four weeks of the 1993 sales, flue-cured tobacco prices averaged 97 US cents a kilogram, little more than half the 189 cents of a year earlier. Even after the mid-season recovery, the record 218.5m kg crop averaged only 123 cents a kilogram, 62 per cent below the record level of 1991 and 25 per cent less than was paid for low-quality, drought-stressed leaf in 1992. Last year, growers misread the market badly, having convinced themselves that the low 1992 price was a reflection on the poor quality of the offerings rather than growing oversupply in the world market. Accordingly, many went for volume, only to find their margins cut to the bone as costs continued to mount while prices tumbled. They now accept that 1991 was a freak year and that market fundamentals are now far more negative than three years ago. Accordingly, output has been cut by more than 20 per cent to about 172m kg. Quality is harder to assess at this juncture. Although the season started well, tobacco growing areas received only about 80 per cent of normal rainfall, while just one region enjoyed above-average moisture. Climatic conditions were very variable, deteriorating in the last six to eight weeks of the growing season, when the rains cut off early amid abnormally hot conditions. This was a godsend for some growers in the north who, up to then, had had too much rain; but it was a serious setback to the quality of leaf for many others. Both growers and buyers are predicting a soft start to the sales. Manufacturers, who are carrying substantial stocks, will be in no hurry to secure their supplies, says one leading tobacco merchant, pointing out that the nature of the Zimbabwe sales has changed with the advent of high domestic interest rates. The big players - the five multinationals that dominate the market - borrow offshore at low, hard-currency interest rates. The local merchants used to play a speculative role, buying up to a quarter of the crop in the early part of the season and selling it on to manufacturers at firmer prices later on in the year. But with high local interest rates - 30 per cent and more - and little likelihood of further significant depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar following the 17 per cent January devaluation, there is little incentive to speculate, especially at a time when global oversupply is estimated at around 275m kg. Today there are two quite distinct markets for flue-cured leaf - a quality market dominated by the US, Brazil and Zimbabwe - and a much larger market for fillers and lower quality tobaccos, which is where the main oversupply has arisen. Like Zimbabwe, Brazil and the US have cut production, but new factors are depressing demand, including President Clinton's latest onslaught on the US industry, the price war in the US cigarette market - forcing manufacturers to seek low-priced supplies wherever possible - and Washington's new protectionism. Last year, the US Congress approved legislation limiting tobacco imports to 25 per cent of total usage by manufacturers, and, because tobacco is a politically incorrect commodity, this has drawn little criticism from the fair trade lobby. The US quota means that new markets will have to be found for most of the 36m kg that Zimbabwe exported to the US last year along with Brazil's 70m kg. Third world exporters hope, however, that US manufacturers will make their cigarettes offshore, as in the case of Phillip Morris in Turkey, using leaf from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in preference to higher-priced US tobacco. Mr Chris Molam, Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, which represents the country's 1,660 commercial growers, says: 'If we can get our tobacco into these offshore-manufactured blends, then we are on our way'. There are marketing problems at home too. With one buyer - the US-based Universal group - building up, partly by taking over smaller operators, a 45 per cent market share at the Harare sales, growers complain that the auctions have become less competitive than they were. This year, however, there will be new faces in the buying line with the admission of the domestically-owned Boka group of companies. Mr Boka, a black Zimbabwean political heavyweight, with little business muscle, hopes, with strong government support, to build market share at the auctions, and 'indigenise' what has always been a white-dominated activity. More competition in the buying line can only be good for the growers, but there are worries about the quality of that buying and the potential for price volatility. The consensus view - and last year the consensus was wildly optimistic - is that the price will harden modestly at the 1994 sales, averaging at least USDollars 1.35 a kilogram (up 10 per cent) and possibly as much as Dollars 1.45. As the country's top export, worth an estimated USDollars 325m last year, tobacco is crucial to the country's export drive under the structural adjustment programme. Exports have stagnated since independence 14 years ago, but must now take off if structural reform is to succeed. In 1991, the World Bank forecast that Zimbabwe's tobacco exports would double within five years; in fact they have fallen nearly 40 per cent since then. Leaf exports are likely to slip further this year, but 1994 could well be the trough of the cycle. 'The market is on the turn,' says one of the more optimistic merchants.  ------------------------------ ZIMBABWE TOBACCO  ------------------------------            Crop      Ave. Price          (m kg)   (US cents/kg)  ------------------------------ 1988        120             218 1989        130             203 1990        134             261 1991        170             325 1992        201             162 1993        219             123 1994*       172             135  ------------------------------ * forecasts  ------------------------------</p>

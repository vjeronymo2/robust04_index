			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Council of Ministers President Alfonso Bustamante  and Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet have defended  before the Budget Commission the tax plan that is being  questioned by the country's mayors. They added that the  government will not back down from continuing the controversial  municipal tax plan.    The AMPE [Association of Peruvian Municipalities]  representatives also attended the meeting with the Budget  Commission and reiterated that Legislative Decree No. 776 is  unconstitutional and violates municipal laws because it reduces  local government revenues substantially. However, although  Bustamante and Camet invited the mayors to a meeting on 17  January, they showed no willingness to reform the plan. On the  contrary, they justified it.    [Begin Bustamante recording] As mentioned many times before,  by implementing this law, we seek the following: first, to  simplify and modernize the municipal tax system; second, to  guarantee, in one way or another, taxpayer stability regarding  rates and taxes; third, it has a very clear decentralization  effect; and fourth, it has a very clear distribution effect.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, Camet said that although Congress is fully  empowered to amend the decree, the government believes it is  excellent because it increases municipal revenues, thus hinting  that there will be no looking back.    [Begin recording] [Camet] This is an excellent reform to the  municipal tax system based, as the prime minister said, on the  redistribution of revenues collected by the central government  to the districts. This redistribution will give more to those  who have less.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Minister, please allow me. There  is a lot of controversy because the government claims that there  will be greater revenues while municipalities claim that there  will be less. You handle figures; could you tell us exactly how  many millions [currency not specified] were channeled to  district and provincial municipalities under the previous law  and how many millions they will receive from now on?    [Camet] Tax collection, as one of your fellow journalists  said, will increase to 610 million [currency not specified].  Thus, all district municipalities will receive more in 1994  than they received in 1993. [end recording]</p>

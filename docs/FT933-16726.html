			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Biggest union has easy birth BRITAIN'S newest and biggest union - Unison - was yesterday formally launched through a merger of the Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse public-service unions. The new organisation will represent more than half the employees in the National Health Service. Mr Alan Jinkinson, former head of Nalgo, is the overall chief with Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, former head of Nupe, and Mr Hector MacKenzie, former head of Cohse, as the two associate general secretaries. The 1.4m-strong union has a combined subscription income of more than Pounds 100m. In contrast to some recent mergers, the arrival of Unison has been meticulously prepared. Welding together the three has caused some unavoidable friction in the distribution of top jobs. For example, Cohse, the smallest of the three unions, has won only one regional secretary post compared with seven for Nalgo and five for Nupe. But the biggest question marks hang over the economics of the merger and the role of women in the new union. When the Unison idea was launched more than two years ago one of the selling points was that women, who make up 1m of the membership, would dominate the executive with 44 positions reserved out of 67. Yet the most senior women in the new union come some way down in the pecking order. Under the male triumvirate at the top come three male deputy general secretaries. Mr Colm O'Kane of Cohse will be in charge of finance and administration, Mr Tom Sawyer of Nupe will head development and services, and Mr Dave Prentis of Nalgo will be the bargaining chief.</p>

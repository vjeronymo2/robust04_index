			<p>BFN     [Text] Xiamen, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  has decided to introduce a market-oriented macro-economic  control system nationwide, according to a senior government  official.    Addressing a national conference on market circulation that  closed in this city of Fujian Province yesterday, Wang Yiping,  secretary-general of the State Economic and Trade Commission,  said that the government will also try to effectively regulate  supplies of and demand for commodities vital to the national  economy and the people's livelihood.    These commodities include grain, cotton, cooking oil, sugar,  meat, vegetables, chemical fertilizers, rolled steel and refined  oil, he told the delegates from all over the country.    He described market regulation as "essential" to China's  steady economic growth and the success of various reforms.    "We should control market prices by economic means and  through monetary policies, guide market demand and achieve a  balance between total supply and demand," he said.    To this end, it is necessary to institute a material reserve  system at the central and local levels, he noted.    The system at the central level is intended to regulate the  relationship between total supply and demand.    The system at the local level is designed to regulate the  supply-demand relationship in local markets in order to keep  prices stable.    Furthermore, it is imperative to introduce a risk-related  fund system for important commodities, Wang said.    The Chinese Government plans to institute a grain  risk-related fund system and plans to establish risk-related  funds for meat, vegetables and other non-staple foodstuffs, he  said.    "Only by establishing such funds, will we be able to promote  protection of production after price decontrol, effectively  regulate the market and prevent steep ups and downs in  production and markets," he said.    Wang Yiping also urged efforts to use both domestic and  foreign markets for macro-economic controls in China, with the  emphasis on coordinating the country's export policies.    He said that imports and exports are playing an increasingly  significant role in regulating the market, as a result of the  introduction of a market-oriented foreign exchange system, the  reform of the foreign trade system and the gearing of the  Chinese market to the global market.    It is, therefore, necessary to coordinate the country's  policies regarding the import and export of major consumer goods  and capital goods, and use taxation and tariffs to regulate the  amount of import and export goods, he said.    The Chinese Government has also decided to introduce a  market  monitoring system, he said.    Specifically, a nationwide information network will be set  up  to forecast and oversee production, marketing, storage and  changes in the prices of major consumer goods and capital goods  in order to make market regulation more effective, he added.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / AGR N-plants lead performance table Britain's advanced gas-cooled (AGR) nuclear power plants performed better than any other atomic reactor type in the world last year. It is a remarkable transformation for a technology which scientists struggled for years to operate efficiently. Last year the AGRs' annual load factor was 73.68 per cent, just ahead of pressurised water reactors at 73.16 per cent, according to Nuclear Engineering International, the magazine for the industry. Only three years ago the AGRs were the world's worst-performing nuclear plants with load factors little better than 50 per cent. The improvement has helped Nuclear Electric, operator of five AGR plants in England and Wales, to increase its market share to more than 25 per cent from less than 20 per cent three years ago. It is making a bid to become the second largest generator in those countries after National Power. Scottish Nuclear operates two AGR stations. The Nuclear Engineering International survey comes before a government review of the nuclear industry. In the review Nuclear Electric is pressing to be privatised, and to gain approval to build a new station at Sizewell C in Suffolk. It is thought that the government has agreed to study privatisation possibilities in the review, the terms of reference for which are expected to be published the week after next at the earliest. Nuclear Electric said yesterday that it was on course to beat its 60 terrawatt hours target for the financial year, with about 39tWh coming from the AGRs. The improvement in AGR efficiency has been achieved by raising power ratings, reducing downtimes, and improving refuelling and thermal efficiencies. The magazine's league table showed that eight of the world's 424 commercial nuclear reactors had 100 per cent availability during the year. Two of them are Magnox stations owned by Nuclear Electric - Hinkley Point A 2 and Oldbury 2. Five of the top 10 reactors last year were Japanese units.</p>

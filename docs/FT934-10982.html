			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Commons clears way for rail sell-off THE GOVERNMENT'S compromise proposals for rail franchising were approved by the Commons last night, paving the way for the railway privatisation bill to become law. British Rail fought the proposals to the end. A leaked memo released at Westminster revealed a ferocious behind the scenes battle between Mr John Welsby, BR's chief executive, and Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister. However, the government secured a comfortable majority in a series of votes on amendments limiting BR's ability to bid for franchises to routes where no credible private-sector bid emerges. The main amendment, overturning an earlier Lords amendment giving BR unlimited freedom to bid for franchises, was approved by 316 votes to 282, a government majority of 34. The government also had a comfortable majority for a further series of amendments watering down its obligations to the railway pension fund. In the main vote, a government motion to overturn the Lords amendment was approved by 316 votes to 284, a majority of 32. Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport minister, has tabled further amendments to widen BR's right to bid for franchises, which are expected to be debated in the Lords today. The amendments raise the possibility that the bill will have to return to the Commons again later this week if Lord Peyton wins the support of enough peers to reverse some of last night's Commons amendments. However, ministers are confident that the Lords will not back his attempt to challenge the government. The frosty state of relations between BR and the government became clear in documents leaked by Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York, which record conversations between Mr Welsby and Mr Freeman. The documents show that Mr Welsby warned the government strongly that its privatisation plans were fundamentally flawed and risked backfiring. Mr Welsby said: 'You are in a hole and still digging. I don't see how there will be anything still to sell; certainly not the cake - just the cherries.' The documents also reveal internal BR projections that trainload freight profits will fall to zero in 1995/96 from Pounds 103m last year.</p>

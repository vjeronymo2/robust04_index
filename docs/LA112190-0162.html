			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOYT SAYS HE'LL QUIT AT END OF '91  </P> <P> More than a half-century of racing will come to an end next year for A. J.  Foyt.  </P> <P> Foyt, the all-time winningest Indy-car driver, said Tuesday night he'll make  one last run in the Indianapolis 500, "finish the 1991 season and then call it  quits."  </P> <P> "I hate that I've got to call it to an end," Foyt said. "But there comes a time  in everybody's life that it's over with."  </P> <P> Foyt, 55, is recuperating at his Houston home from injuries sustained in a race  crash Sept. 23 at Elkhart Lake, Wis. He broke and dislocated bones in both legs  and feet.  </P> <P> "If I get back 100% and finish 1991, I've had an enjoyable career," he said.  </P> <P> Foyt had earlier hinted at retirement but had not made an announcement.  </P> <P> "Yes, this will be the last time," Foyt said of next year's 500.  </P> <P> Foyt, who has won four Indy 500s, said the accident spoiled his plan to wait  until next year before announcing the 1991 season would be his last.  </P> <P> Foyt, who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1961, 1964, 1967 and 1977, is winless on  the Indy-car circuit since a victory in the Pocono 500 in 1981.  </P> <P> His father built him his first race car when Foyt was 3. He won his first  midget car race in 1953.  </P> <P> With career earnings of $5.5 million, Foyt finished his 34th season with 67  Indy-car career victories and 53 poles. He is second to Mario Andretti in  poles.  </P> <P> Foyt's career has not been limited to Indy cars. He is the only driver ever to  win the Indianapolis 500, stock-car racing's Daytona 500 and endurance racing's  24 Hours of Le Mans.  </P> <P> He has won races in 18 different seasons and has nine victories in races of 500  miles, both Indy-car records.  </P></p>

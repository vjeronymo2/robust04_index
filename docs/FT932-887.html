			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / US Senate passes budget cuts plan PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday hailed Senate passage of a five-year, Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) budget-reducing plan approved by a 50-49 vote in the early hours of the day. 'We can now move on to a (House-Senate) conference committee with a clear signal to the financial markets that its interest rates should stay down,' he said. 'For the first time in a very long time, an American president can go to a meeting of the G7 nations in a position of economic strength, trying to lead a renewal of growth and opportunity all over the world.' Mr Clinton acknowledged that the Senate bill had been changed 'to some extent' from his own version, but also praised his Democratic colleagues for having shown 'a remarkable degree of courage'. If the economy fails to pick up steam, both he and they will have to bear the blame from a constituency which gives little credit for valour. Senate and House Democrats, having passed packages which broadly conform to the president's wishes, will have no time to gloat about victories achieved without any Republican support. A conference to resolve their differences could begin as early as next week and tough bargaining lies ahead. A final vote is expected late next month or early in August. The close vote in the Senate emphasises the challenge for the budget negotiators. Six Democrats deserted the president, and Vice President Al Gore was forced to cast a tie-breaking vote. Both versions of the bill achieve budget reduction, but the House version would do more to achieve tax redistribution from the wealthy. The House agreed to a modified version of the president's proposed broad-based energy tax, which the Senate rejected in favour of a 4.3 cents-a-gallon fuel tax (with an exception for jet fuel). The conference is expected to produce something to broaden the fuels tax. Both bills raise top corporate tax rates from 34 to 35 per cent and reduce deductions for business meals and entertainment from 80 to 50 per cent. They ban deductions for lobbying, club dues and executive pay over Dollars 1m. Both allow investment tax credits on machinery, although the House was more generous. Mr Clinton indicated that he would push for a resurrection of his investment incentives so states such as California, hit hard by defence cuts, will get offsetting jobs growth. 'You can't create jobs out of thin air,' he said. The House voted to restrain the growth of the health care programme for the elderly by Dollars 50bn over five years. The Senate added another Dollars 10bn to its bill. Both houses agreed to a repeal of luxury taxes on yachts, aircraft, jewels and furs. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, yesterday laid out the administration's bottom line: Dollars 500bn in deficit reductions, progressivity and a broad-based energy tax. The president, who positioned himself above the fray in the Senate, now seems prepared to take a stronger role in the negotiations. 'If you look at the level of aggression this country has displayed in trying to do something about its economic circumstances as compared with what is going on in these other nations. . . the US should be very proud,' he said.</p>

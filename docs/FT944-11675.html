			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: News Corp's preferred shares trade at discount The limited voting preferred shares issued by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation began trading on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday and developed a large discount to the ordinary shares. When trading opened, the preferred shares were priced at ADollars 4.90, well below the ADollars 5.70 opening level for the ordinary shares. By the close of business the new securities had made up some ground, finishing at ADollars 5.14, compared with ADollars 5.85 for the ordinary shares. The new shares had been issued, by means of a scrip issue, to existing News Corporation shareholders on a one-for-two basis. They have been the subject of much debate, because of Mr Murdoch's recent struggle to find a means of raising new capital for News Corporation without loading the group with new debt or further diluting his family's equity interest. Last year, Mr Murdoch attempted to issue a new class of shares with 'super' voting rights, but the proposal was scotched by institutional opposition. Last month, News said it was activating the preferred shares, as their potential issue had been approved by shareholders in 1990. No stock was issued at that stage. Provided investors can be found to buy the new shares, voting rights for which are extremely limited, capital to fund acquisitions can be raised through the issue of more preferred stock without diluting the Murdoch family's stake. However, the smaller the discount between the new shares and the ordinary shares, the more advantageous it is for News Corporation. The Australian Stock Exchange said it would only include the preferred shares in the calculation of the All-Ordinaries Index, the main stock market marker, on a long-term basis if they traded closely in line with the ordinaries. It said it would include them for a three-month trial and then review the situation.</p>

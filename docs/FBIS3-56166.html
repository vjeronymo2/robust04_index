Khashig says about 20,000 Russians, Armenians, and Jews have  returned to Abkhazia from Russia over the three months since the  end of the war.    The issue of the return to Abkhazia of Greeks sent to Greece  during the war is almost settled, and special Athens-Sukhumi  flights are soon to be organized by a Greek firm for this  purpose.    The government commission for refugees has begun  preparations  to return Georgian refugees to Abkhazia's Galskiy Rayon. The  commission held a random session yesterday in the town of Gali  and met with the inhabitants of the rayon, he said.    The crime situation in the area is bad, which hinders the  return of refugees, the commission pointed out. A decision was  made to tighten the curfew, the video reporter said.    Refugees are returning without waiting for the issue to be  finalized officially. Over 500 have already returned, not by  the bridge over the Inguri River, but by the ford, which is  dangerous. This means they avoid the checkpoint on the Georgian  side that, strangely, is not letting them through. The refugees  themselves told us that it is specifically the inhabitants of  Gali Rayon who are being hindered from returning to their homes,  the reporter said.</p>

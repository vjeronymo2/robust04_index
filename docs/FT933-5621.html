			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Private prisons A STRATEGY for future private-sector involvement in the UK prison service will be launched today by Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary. The opposition, prison officers and penal reformers have issued noisy warnings against any further privatisation of prisons. Mr Howard should not, however, be defensive about the merits of more competition in the prison system. So far the management of only three prisons has been put out to tender. Private sector companies now run two of them: the Wolds on Humberside and Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester. But the benefits of competition can be seen best at Strangeways prison in Manchester, where the contract was awarded to the in-house team. Staff agreed to drop restrictive practices to submit a bid 20 per cent below the average cost of directly-managed prisons. The tendering process will need to continue if such savings are to be extended throughout the prison service. The beneficial effects of privatisation are not limited to greater flexibility in the management of prisons. Privately-run jails can also bring innovation in the prison regime, as Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, stated in last week's report on the Wolds prison. He was fulsome in his praise for the facilities, the staff and the treatment of inmates. Before further prisons are privatised, however, attention needs to be given to the Judge's criticisms of the Wolds. While inmates were allowed out of their cells for much of the day, too little was done to encourage them to use the time usefully. The result was 'a degree of lethargy which can be corrupting', an unfortunate finding at a time when the home secretary is reported to be concerned that prison life is not austere enough. There are special circumstances at the Wolds, which is the only prison devoted wholly to prisoners on remand. Since they have not been convicted, they cannot be compelled to work. But as Judge Tumim pointed out, the regime could provide inmates with incentives to make more productive use of their time, through work, education and training. Yet Group 4, the company running the Wolds, is not required to offer such opportunities by the contract under which the prison is managed. The judge found other deficiencies in the contract. There was a lack of clarity over the responsibility for the care and discipline of prisoners. Responsibility was unclear for many items of expenditure, including utility charges, damage through vandalism and maintenance. There was an absence of systems for checking financial aspects of the contract. The judge concluded that weaknesses in the contract made it impossible to determine the value for money of privatising the Wolds. The contractual arrangements must therefore be urgently reviewed before further prisons are privatised.</p>

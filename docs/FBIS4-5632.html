			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, April 13 (AFP) -- New Zealand will  maintain its ban on nuclear-powered and -armed ships from its  ports, despite high-level U.S. urging for a change of policy,  Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Wednesday.    He told Radio N@w Zealand a change in the ban was "not an  agenda item".    On Tuesday Bolger met with the commander of US Pacific  forces, Admiral Charles Larson, the first time in nearly a  decade that such a high-ranked military figure has been here.    After meeting with Bolger he urged New Zealand to re-think  its anti-nuclear stance and consider the benefits of resuming  full military ties.    New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear laws in 1985 which the U.S.  says prevents their ships coming here and has resulted in  Wellington being frozen out of the Anzus (Australia, New Zealand  and U.S.) Pact.    President Ronald Reagan prohibited military contacts and all  exchanges between high officials but last November Pres@dent  Bill Clinton called for a resumption of ties on "a more normal  basis".    Bolger welcomed Larson's recognition that the two countries  had reached different views on the nuclear issue by following  democratic processes.    It was a U.S. decision to withdraw high-level military  contacts with New Zealand following introduction of the nuclear  policy in 1986.    New Zealand hoped the U.S. would reflect on that decision  and  there would be a greater degree of cooperation in future.    "What we're getting now, I think, is an important opening up  of discussion and that's what I welcome in the visit of Admiral  Larson," he said.    Although a New Zealand government commissioned study had  found nuclear propulsion was safe, the public was not willing to  accept such ships.    "Clearly if New Zealand was to change its propulsion laws  that would be quite significant in terms of U.S. attitudes, but  at the moment the New Zealand parliament is not about to do  that," Bolger said.    The political issue had changed a lot over the past decade,  Bolger said.    The Cold War had ended and nuclear weapons and testing had  been reduced.    He was "quite comfortable" with New Zealand's current  policy.  "It's exactly where the public at large want the policy to be."    New Zealanders had told the United States they wanted to  work  along their own route.    "That's been a little difficult for some people but that's  where the New Zealand public is. And as I say it's not an agenda  item in New Zealand at the present time," he said.    "What I think is an agenda item is how we can co-operate and  work through with others."    New Zealand had a close defence relationship with Australia  and had worked in a peacekeeping role with the U.S. in theatres  of conflict like the Gulf War and Bosnia. New Zealand defence  forces were becoming increasingly involved with peacekeeping of  a higher risk than in the past.    "I think New Zealanders would accept that and say that's the  defence responsibility New Zealand can and should take up," he  said.</p>

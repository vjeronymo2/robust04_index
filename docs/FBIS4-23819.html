			<p>BFN     [Text] Cabinda Province Governor Augusto Tomas has been  talking to all and sundry, namely political forces, traditional  and church authorities, and even youths. The aim is to search  for a political solution to the Cabinda problem. So far, the  meeting has gone well except that the FLEC-FAC [Front for the  Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Cabinda Armed Forces] does not  wish to cooperate.    [Begin recording] [Tomas] As you know, efforts have been  made  over the past few years to reach internal consensus and make it  possible for the government and Cabinda political forces to meet  and find a peaceful solution to the Cabinda dispute. Yet, some  of the radical wings, namely FLEC-FAC, have not responded  positively. Right now, FLEC-FAC and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola are waging hostile actions against  civilians. The residents have condemned such actions.    [Unidentified correspondent] So, FLEC-FAC is the obstacle.    [Tomas] Well, I cannot say that. FLEC-FAC is the political  grouping that has been hindering a rapid solution to the problem  in view of the interference by foreign forces opposed to the  general interests of the people of Cabinda. [end recording]    Tomas says FLEC-FAC's absence from the talks is not a major  problem. Sooner or later there will be a solution to the  Cabinda problem. What matters is for the provincial government  to convey to the central government proposals that are endorsed  by the majority of Cabinda residents. Those whom the governor  has spoken to are for dialogue and reject war.    [Begin Tomas recording] We are encouraged by the fact that  all those we have spoken to believe that dialogue, instead of  war is the way of resolving the Cabinda problem. Another  important aspect is that leading forces living in Cabinda wish  to play an active role in resolving the Cabinda problem. The  idea is to mobilize intellectuals in Angola, whether they come  from Cabinda or not, as well as men of goodwill who live in  Zaire, Congo and elsewhere who are interested in a solution to  the Cabinda problem.

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Pre-strike rate cut bolsters Spanish markets Just two days before Spain's unions plan to bring the country to a standstill in a 24-hour general strike, the Bank of Spain yesterday boosted the stock market and the peseta with a quarter-point cut that brought the benchmark intervention rate down to 8.75 per cent. The move reflected confidence by the monetary authorities that domestic recession has bottomed out, that headline inflation, which stood at 4.9 per cent at the end of last month, will fall as low as 3.5 per cent in the course of this year and that currency turmoil is unlikely in the coming months. The timing of the cut could, however, have been brought forward to undermine tomorrow's union protest against the government's economic policies. The chief issue in the national stoppage is the introduction of labour market reforms that will make it easier to hire and fire workers in order to increase competitiveness. The Madrid Bolsa index rose to touch a high of 343.81 on news of the cut before easing to close at 342.94, up 3.93 from Monday. Top retail banks followed up the new intervention rate by announcing lower lending costs. The peseta, which had been under pressure at the beginning of this year after the rescue of Banesto, the big banking group, had by late afternoon strengthened to Pta80.93 against the D-Mark against Monday's Pta81.61 fix and had firmed by more than a peseta against the dollar to Pta141.90. Analysts believe the benchmark rate will fall by about two points to around 7 per cent this year because of the favourable exchange rate and inflationary trends, and the need to assist economic recovery. But they had not expected the normally cautious Bank of Spain to introduce a cut so soon and, much less so, before the planned general strike. Gonzalez set to face down unions, Page 2</p>

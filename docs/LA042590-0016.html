			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS APPROVE PLANS FOR NEW CALABASAS PARK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved plans Tuesday for Gates  Canyon Park, the first public park to be built in Calabasas in decades.  </P> <P> Plans call for the seven-acre park to be completed in February.  </P> <P> The park will have an activities building, two lighted tennis courts, a  children's play area, volleyball court, picnic and open play areas, said Etsel  Yamasaki, a landscape architect with the county Department of Parks and  Recreation.  </P> <P> For years, Calabasas residents have complained about the lack of parks in the  area. Many activists said Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area,  and the rest of the Board of Supervisors did not make parks a priority.  </P> <P> At the first community planning session for the park two years ago, sheriff's  deputies were called to protect Antonovich from angry protesters. Members of a  grass-roots group, formed to oust Antonovich from office, picketed the meeting  and accused him of using the proposed park as a "political ploy" to hide his  poor record on park development. Antonovich has maintained that he is a strong  advocate of parks.  </P> <P> Doris LaViolette, treasurer of the Malibu Canyon Homeowners, said she is  thrilled that the park will soon be built, adding that it has been a real  hardship for families who have no place where their children can play.  </P> <P> "In order to go to a playground with the children, very often we go to  McDonalds -- they have a playground," LaViolette said.  </P> <P> The park, which derives its name from the canyon it sits in, will be north of  the Ventura Freeway, east of Las Virgenes Road and bounded by Thousand Oaks  Boulevard on the south and east.  </P> <P> The park, on land provided by a developer, will cost $900,000 to build.  </P></p>

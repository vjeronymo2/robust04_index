			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A slowly tightening noose JACK Maddox set up a pension scheme for himself and for the co-founder of his Liverpool-based advertising and marketing agency 14 years ago, but now wonders if this was sensible. Maddox says his two-person pension scheme, now extended to cover four directors, is faced with a growing weight of regulation - with the possibility of more to come in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. When Maddox established what is known as a small self-administered pension scheme in 1979 the setting up and monitoring costs were modest. An actuary's report on the progress of the scheme was required only once every three years. A tightening of the rules has since led to a requirement that accounts must now be filed each year, requiring the use of a registered auditor and the scheme's actuary. The growing burden of legislation on the professions has meant that auditors and actuaries are becoming more painstaking in their approach and their costs have risen sharply. 'What used to be a small, easily administered fund has become a federal case,' says Maddox, chief executive of Michael Bungey DFS, which has 12 full-time employees. He calculates that allowing for inflation, the Pounds 1,000 minimum annual professional fee he is now charged would amount to Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 80,000 if start-up costs were included) over the life of a 30-year scheme. 'That amount would buy a lot of pension but the fund members will see none of it,' he says. Small, self-administered pension schemes, sometimes referred to as directors' plans, serve a double purpose. They allow participants to provide for their pensions and, since funds in the scheme can, within certain limits, be invested back into the business, represent a valuable additional source of finance for small firms. In a broader economic context, these schemes recycle funds generated by small firms back into the sector, compared with the payment of insurance premiums which are usually invested in large companies or in government securities. They also avoid the payment of substantial management charges to insurance companies. The tightening regulatory noose has meant that businesses such as Michael Bungey now face extra costs. 'Today, in the same position, we would avoid a self-administered scheme because a number of better and more lucrative alternatives exist,' says Maddox. 'What seems to be forgotten is that the scheme is the managers' own fund. They have no interest in robbing themselves, so why are the controls excessive?' Maddox has registered his concerns with the Pension Law Review Committee, set up in the wake of Robert Maxwell's death and the discovery of a large shortfall in the Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund. This committee, which is due to report by September, is carrying out a wide-ranging review of occupational pension schemes, including the issue of the appropriate degree of regulation. In principle, the small self-administered pension schemes are designed so that small companies can operate them relatively easily, compared with the rules for the larger occupational schemes. As well as the possibility of further legislation resulting from the pension law review, the European Commission is considering imposing tighter limits on the amounts which the schemes can invest back in the business. The managers of small, self-administered schemes are limited to 'self-investing' 25 per cent of the assets during the first two years and 50 per cent thereafter. But Brussels has suggested an overall limit of 10 per cent on self-investment, despite the fact that no other EC country operates this type of small company scheme, says Dryden Gilling-Smith, managing director of Employee Benefit Services, a consultancy. Maddox contrasts the tightening of reporting rules for small company schemes with the relaxation of filing requirements at Companies House. 'There is no trading data now, only balance sheet information,' he says 'That makes fraud much easier. But nobody who has his own pension scheme is going to rip himself off.' The Department of Social Security says the government has to strike a balance between encouraging employers to set up pension schemes and safeguarding the rights of pensioners. It queries whether an annual audit is particularly onerous. The government's campaign to reduce red tape has made further progress with the appointment last month of the chairmen of the seven deregulation taskforces. But as the company featured here illustrates, conflicting demands for consumer protection will make for difficult choices. The Growing Business Page is running a series highlighting businesses entrapped by red tape. It will award a bottle of Laurent-Perrier pink champagne to each one featured. The owner managers of independent businesses are invited to describe their experiences - on no more than two sides of A4 please.

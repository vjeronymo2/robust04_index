			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Technology: A picture of good health One of the main problems in performing successful surgery has always been that the neat, clean laboratory models of patients' insides often turn out to be far easier to understand than the real thing. However, virtual reality imaging is beginning to make inroads into operating rooms in an attempt to clarify things for the surgeon. 'It's actually more like 'enhanced reality' than virtual reality, since the images are far easier to understand than the actual human anatomy,' says William Lorensen, a graphics engineer at General Electric Corporation. He is part of a team of scientists and surgeons from GE and the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston working with virtual reality images in surgery. The ultimate aim of the US group is to be able to project a three-dimensional picture on to a patient's skin, allowing the doctor to operate on the patient and the image simultaneously. The doctor would see the image through special virtual reality glasses, which enhance three-dimensional vision, but would actually be manipulating the patient's internal organs. The accuracy of the image, which precisely details anatomical parts, would make this possible. The only essential difference between reality and image would be the enhanced clarity of the picture. The joint project has already produced several imaging tools to make surgeons' life easier. Over the last few years, participants have been working with three-dimensional pictures of patients' skulls and brains. The images are produced by taking two-dimensional magnetic resonance and CAT-scan pictures, converting them to three- dimensional ones with advanced computer graphics, then using a video mixer to produce a television image. The new images on the video monitor have already proved an invaluable tool in pre-operation planning. Using an electronic scalpel on the television screen, the physician can simulate surgical cuts, showing exactly which area a particular skin incision will reveal. In brain surgery, it can help physicians plan a safe path to a tumour, avoiding contact with motor strips, for instance, that could leave a patient paralysed. It can also help in facial reconstruction techniques, showing surgeons how a bone should be cut and repositioned. The process has already been used in planning several operations to help correct serious deformities in organ structure. More recently, surgeons started to use the video monitor not only before surgery, but also in the operating room. In brain surgery, for instance, doctors have used the monitor to mark areas on a patient's shaven head. The marks show the surgeon where to make the incision, the location of the tumour and which areas to avoid. The surgeon relies on this map to make the correct incisions and uses the video monitor as a reference throughout the procedure. Inadequate technology has prevented doctors from taking the final step to an actual virtual reality operation, says Lorensen. 'In a pure virtual reality operation, we would project the image directly on to the patient's head,' he explained. 'But right now, the lighting and clarity is not sufficiently developed.' Similarly, virtual reality glasses need to undergo some improvements before they will become a viable option in the operating room. 'Current eyeglasses are too bulky,' says Lorensen. 'Before they can be used, they will need to be lighter and less intrusive.' Even so, he predicts the procedure is only about two years away from becoming a reality. 'We're just waiting on a few technological improvements.'</p>

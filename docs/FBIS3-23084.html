			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 17  February publishes on pages 1, 2, and 7 a 4,500-word report on a  seminar organized by the newspapers AL-JUMHURIYAH and AL-MASA'  to gather 1 million signatures from ministers, officials,  prominent figures, and citizens for a statement condemning  terrorism. The same report is continued in the 18 February  issue of AL-JUMHURIYAH on page 4 in another 3,000-word report.  The moderator of the seminar is Samir Rajab, chairman of the  board of the al-Tahrir Publishing House and chief editor of MAYU  and AL-MASA'. The topic of the seminar is "the role of the  masses in confronting terrorism" and the title is "The Seminar  To Define the Course and Gather Forces."    Participating in the seminar were Culture Minister Faruq  Husni; Ahmad al-'Amawi, minister of manpower and employment;  Cairo University President Mufid Shihab; Dr. Abu-al-Wafa  al-Taftazani, head of the Higher Council for Sufist Ways; Dr.  Milad Hanna, writer and lecturer in national and international  fora; Mu'tasim Rashid, representative from the Popular Committee  for Confronting Terrorism; Dr. Fathi 'Abd-al-Fattah, head of the  research center of al-Tahrir Publishing House; and many citizens  and editors.    Samir Rajab opens the seminar by claiming that "the masses  are the decisive factor in any battle. The masses have  responded to the battle against terrorism with a great sense of  responsibility and eagerness." Rajab then gives examples of  popular support and help in tracking down terrorists. He  comments: "The masses need aware and active forces to maintain  the momentum, reorganize priorities, and activate the sense of  preparedness and initiative." This, he claims, can only be done  through "organized popular action." To conclude, he speculates  on the outcome of the campaign and what it could eventually lead  to. He then gives the floor to Dr. Fathi 'Abd-al-Fattah, head  of the research center at the al-Tahrir Publishing House.    'Abd-al-Fattah proposes that five points be discussed during  the seminar to define the nature of terrorism. These points  appear as questions: "Does terrorism have religious basis?"  "Does terrorism have any social and economic justifications?"  "Does unemployment play an essential role in recruiting  unemployed people to work for the terrorists?" "Is terrorism  unique to Egypt and if not, how is terrorism in Egypt different  from that elsewhere?" and last, "Is there a need to determine  the economic expense of terrorism?"    Culture Minister Faruq Husni then takes the floor and  ponders  several questions. He asks: "Do terrorists have a definite  strategy or do they practice terrorism for the sake of  terrorism? The answer to this question defines the nature of the  terrorist forces operating in Egypt." He then draws  similarities between former Egyptian President Jamal  'Abd-al-Nasir's political ideology and that of the terrorists,  saying: In his quest to assume an international role and have a  say in international affairs, 'Abd-al-Nasir attempted to rally  global support for concepts such as pan-Arabism and socialism.  "With this same logic, I believe there is an international  force that uses terrorism to realize its objectives," he argues.  His justification is that "these forces opted for Islam and  employed it to their benefit," since Islam strikes a sensitive  chord with Arabs and Egyptians. He believes it is a strong  weapon that has the power to "condemn and defame" those who are  not attracted by it. "In this way, the pan-Islamic current  grows," he says, "through preaching, attraction, fear, or  intimidation." The parallel, he believes, is clear in the  slogans. The deteriorating economy had its effect on the state  of the people. "Some felt frustrated and desperate, thus  becoming an easy catch for the call that Islam is the solution,"  he explains. The slogan during 'Abd-al-Nasir's time was:  "Pan-Arabism is the solution."    Husni maintains that the solution lies in "a comprehensive  strategy for action" by all government bodies, because each  ministry alone can do nothing. "The confrontation also needs  imagination to create appropriate methods for dealing with it,"  he says. He expresses his "surprise that the government stands  with its hands crossed when it has so many thinkers and  innovators" and adds: "The solution, in my opinion, is  organized and creative group action. The solution is also to  learn from the experiences of confrontation that others have  had" in Arab countries and elsewhere.    Manpower and Employment Minister Ahmad al-'Amawi disagrees  with Husni. He believes that claiming that the terrorists have  an ideology "gives them more credit than they deserve. We give  them an effective weapon to recruit more men." He states: "The  terrorist uses these confessions with us to raise his morale and  that of his colleagues." The writer says he believes their  arguments are "vague, unclear."    Al-'Amawi alludes to Iran as "one of the countries involved  in promoting terrorism," providing as evidence Jordan's decision  to decrease the number of Iranian diplomats in the embassy  because it found evidence of Iranian involvement in terrorist  acts in Jordan. He also believes that unemployment is not a  reason for terrorism but a situation that terrorists exploit.  In addition, al-'Amawi notes that the Ministries of Information  and Culture cannot alone confront terrorism, because "the  terrorist reads only what his leadership allows him to."    Al-'Amawi's solution is that "real action takes place  through  popular confrontation and through the life network of citizens.  The objective of such action is to fortify youth against the  allures of the terrorist organization."    Cairo University President Mufid Shihab then makes his  remarks. He notes that "there are three concepts that need to be  distinguished from one another: extremism, violence, and  terrorism." He then defines each concept. He says that  violence is not purely linked to religion, but is practiced by  ignorant and uneducated young people who do not know any better.  Shihab states that the "foreign factor cannot be ignored at  all." He accuses "Afghanistan, elements residing in Pakistan,  or Sudan, or Iran, or others." Therefore, he asserts that the  responsibility is ours, "internally and externally" to confront  these elements. He proposes signing "regional and group  agreements to confront terrorism because the phenomenon is  increasing and comes in various forms in the international  arena."    In Shihab's opinion, the cure for terrorism takes place on  two levels: The first is short term and consists of "security,  cultural, and media confrontation"; and the "second is long term  and its objective is to realize a greater number of social  reforms, decrease unemployment, eliminate the slum areas, and  improve the general standard of living." He maintains that  Cairo University is now experimenting with applying these two  levels among students to try and contain terrorism and change  their way of thinking. He concludes that some change has been  noticed among the students and recommends that such methods be  applied nation-wide.    The 18 February issue of AL-JUMHURIYAH continues the report  on page 4 by citing responses from Culture Minister Faruq Husni  to earlier remarks. He believes that terrorism should not be  taken lightly or simplified, because it is not manifested only  in militant acts, but in psychological brainwashing, such as  what is preached in sermons in mosques. He says: "I call for  forming organized popular forces to confront terrorism. I  demand a national committee in which all confrontation  ministries participate." According to him, "confrontation  ministries" are those that should be active in confronting  terrorism, including the Ministries of Culture, Education,  Information, and Religious Affairs, among others.    Minister al-'Amawi interjects by again advocating the belief  that terrorism in Egypt should not be exaggerated because it  exists all over the world.    Mu'tasim Rashid, representative of the Popular Committee for  Confronting Terrorism, then speaks: "We stand before a real  catastrophe, a catastrophe that we created 23 years ago and have  put off confronting. More dangerous is the fact that we  sometimes issue illogical resolutions that have not been studied  well, such as the education minister's decision to ban political  activities in universities." He informs the seminar that the  reality is very different since the result has been that  everyone at universities is involved in politics except for the  National Democratic Party. He criticizes the government's  head-in-the-sand policy and asks why "you are not allowing us,  that is the committee that I represent, to work on all fronts."  He claims that they do not have the freedom to operate. He  explains: "Some decision-makers in Egypt are very good at  sitting on the fence. They do not want to take any risks or  lose anything they have, even if that means victimizing the  homeland. This is more dangerous than terrorism itself." He  recommends that the government should rescue youth from  unemployment. "If we do not interact in serious and creative  actions, we can kiss this country goodbye," he concludes.    Dr. Milad Hanna identifies himself as "a Christian Egyptian  who leads the life of a Muslim. I have learned half of the  Koran." He concentrates on one question: "Could antiterrorist  social forces be employed effectively?" His answer is: "The  government is very late and, at some stage, it played a  countering role." He accuses the government of doing things for  its own benefit. He then reviews the history of Islamic action  in Egypt and how the Islamists were encouraged and discouraged  by various governments depending on whether they were an asset  or liability to that specific government. He advocates the use  of "counter-engineering," which to his way of thinking consists  of encouraging all sorts of counter-activities to Islam and  religion. He believes that by concentrating on Islamic issues,  the government is merely enabling the terrorists to have a  podium and audience. By concentrating on other activities, the  government could divert attention from Islamic subjects. He  praises the Culture Ministry for doing just that, but he admits  that "this, regrettably, is individual effort and action in an  isolated island." He wonders: "Where are the efforts of the  Ministries of Education, Awqaf, and Information?" He calls for  concentrating on the status of women in Egypt, because by  winning them over, "we would come half way."    Dr. Abu-al-Wafa al-Taftazani, head of the Higher Council for  Sufist Ways, concludes the seminar by providing the viewpoint of  a man of religion on terrorism. He maintains: "The Islam we see  these individuals practicing is not the real Islam we know as  men of religion and intellect." He draws parallels between the  Khawarijites, the oldest religious sect of Islam who dissented  from the mainstream religion during the early days of Islam, and  the modern-day terrorists. Both explain Islam in ways suiting  their objectives. He notes: "We need a comprehensive cultural  movement to evaluate extremism and return the extremists to the  correct course of Islam. This is the first step to uprooting  terrorism and the terrorists."</p>

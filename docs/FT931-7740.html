			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Tax settlements - Legal briefs TWO NEW pilot schemes designed to speed up the vetting or 'taxation' of legal bills are to be introduced by the English High Court after Easter. The schemes should lead to the successful parties in litigation receiving their costs from the losers more quickly. Under the first scheme parties will be responsible for identifying the items in a bill which are in dispute, allowing taxation hearings to be confined to those issues. The second scheme, known as 'quick-form taxation', requires the consent of both parties but enables them to ask for costs to be taxed without providing a bill itemising costs and disbursements.</p>

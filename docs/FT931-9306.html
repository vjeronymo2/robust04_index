			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Tristan und Isolde - Opera Tristan und Isolde, perhaps the most influential and significant opera ever written, has been missing from the British opera stages. English National Opera did it last, seven seasons ago. Severe Tristan-hunger was starting to build up. Welsh National Opera have now set about assuaging it. Their new production, given in the original language, opened on Saturday at the New Theatre, Cardiff; it will be shown in six other southern cities (London included) over the next couple of months -  and thence, because it is shared with Scottish Opera, in Scotland also. The initiative is important, and bravely undertaken. The producer-designer Yannis Kokkos, Greek-born, France-based, is making his British debut. Charles Mackerras, probably the most wide-ranging and experienced opera-conductor alive, leads here his first British Tristan. (He is also part-sponsor of the surtitles that are making their WNO debut.) All the cast  - British apart from the American Kurwenal -  come new to their roles. On Saturday, while it was everywhere evident that the production had been mounted with care and seriousness, the mixture failed to settle or blend. It is no doubt grossly unjust to complain of this, as it would be to judge the performance by inappropriate standards: an authentic Tristan style is not built in a day. Yet the WNO habit of soaring above in-built artistic constraints -  as the company did in 1979, in its never-to-be-forgotten Tristan conducted by Reginald Goodall -  was perhaps responsible for raising those unjust expectations in the first place. I recall with admiration Mackerras's ENO Ring and Meistersinger: cleanly executed, bright of sound, crisply forward-moving. In the WNO programme-book he speaks feelingly of those 'slower and slower' conductors of our century who took over the Wagnerian tradition from their 'faster' predecessors. His own approach to the score lacks nothing in energy: in this Tristan one really hears and feels each rhythmic thrust, each application and alteration of colour (much reedy, penetrative wind tone and trenchant brass), the urgency in utterance of every phrase. Nothing in the least sleepy or hazy mars the sound-picture. The unusual clarity of the bass line is a token: this performance unfolds upon a forcefully delineated foundation. Unfortunately, in a opera so deeply rooted in poetic, emotional and psychological contrasts of light and dark, day and night, the unvaried directness of the music-making soon comes to seem as much a burden as a boon. The instrumental textures have a coarse, glaring impact upon the voices; one was reminded (as one never was by Goodall) that the New Theatre is a small house for Tristan in full flood. Driven forward so unremittingly, the music failed to disclose its longer line, its unique system of tension-and-release. On this occasion, the fabled Tristan ecstasies were no more than dimly glimpsed. Kokkos's production is physically clean-cut. The stage pictures for the first two acts are semi-abstract (and obviously Appia-influenced), peopled with figures in elegantly cut and coloured Burne-Jones costumes, and lacking all necessary pieces of furniture; the third moves into the realm of surrealism, with a curious marbled walkway jutting out of the frame. Actions are decorous, bland, occasionally a touch fancy (a falcon among the dramatis personae of Act 2). Nothing seriously impedes the comfort of the singers; equally, there is (to my mind) not a single moment in the staging that stirs the imagination or the intellect. The most positive aspect of this Tristan is its choice of principals: almost all of them have started well and promise to develop greatly. The qualities that caused Anne Evans's WNO Brunnhilde to be so widely acclaimed - unforced lyricism, womanly tenderness -  suit Isolde even more. Even at this early stage, when the furious outbursts of Act 1 were still cautiously offered, with high notes touched (though always purely and accurately) rather than trumpeted, there was a radiance about her performance that graced phrase after phrase and lifted the heart. Jeffrey Lawton, the company's Siegfried, Otello and Aeneas, tackles with extraordinary boldness perhaps the most challenging dramatic-tenor role in the repertory. The big, burly voice is used with heartwarming sensitivity to the colour, weight and emotional import of the music; he rises nobly to the third-act ravings. Peter Rose's first Marke, beautifully grave and reflective, is a big step forward for this young singer; Richard Paul Fink's Kurwenal, though too consistently loud, likewise. Brangane is that fine artist Della Jones -  vigorous in attack, excessively reliant on register gear-change, and altogether unwisely embarked on this (for her) alien vocal venture.

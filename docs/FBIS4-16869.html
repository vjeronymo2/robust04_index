			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 16, BNS -- Estonia has put its full  support behind Latvia's position that negotiations between  Latvia and Russia cannot continue before the President Yeltsin  has officially revoked his April 5 decree on setting up Russian  military bases in CIS and Latvia, Estonian Prime Minister Mart  Laar said after a meeting with his Latvian counterpart Valdis  Birkavs in the Latvian town of Rujiena near the border between  the two countries.    Russia by now has said that mentioning Latvia in the decree  had been an oversight and that no Russian military bases are to  be set up in Latvia. Russia has also defined the Skrunda radar  base as a civilian facility.    Laar in an interview with BNS said that the situation of  Latvia and Russia after the Yeltsin decree has changed and that  resuming negotiations between the two countries cannot be talked  about until Yeltsin has "clearly and unambiguously" revoked his  decree.    Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at a press conference  after the meeting said changes are to be made, though, in the  agreement concluded between Latvia and Russia at the governments  level on the social protection of retired Russian military.    Birkavs said his country's position on the issue was that  all  retired military under 60 years of age have to leave Latvia. A  special foundation for this is to be set up, he added.    The premier said about 8,500 retired Russian military under  60 are currently living in Latvia without having the country's  citizenship.    The two prime ministers discussed Estonian-Russian relations  and working closely between Estonia and Latvia in international  organizations. The Estonian leader reaffirmed his country's  position of not to go to any concessions at talks with Russia.    "Estonia won't back even a single step and will abide by the  existing laws," he said.    The meeting also discussed signing an additional protocol on  farm products exports to the Estonian-Latvian free trade treaty.  The issue is to be again discussed at a meeting of experts from  the two countries in the Latvian capital in the middle of the  next month.    While discussing the customs issues, the Latvian premier  said  that the Baltics must do everything to cut back to a minimum the  tariffs on the borders between the three countries and step up  controls on the eastern border instead.    Other topics on the meeting's agenda included the borders,  and marking down of the land border. The prime ministers  considered the possibility to temporarily suspend marking the  border between the countries for a high cost of the work.    The delegations for Friday's talks included foreign  ministers  Juri Luik and Georgs Andrejevs.    The prime ministers of Estonia and Latvia are next scheduled  to meet in Tallinn in the first half of June.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Central policies of the contenders GEORGE BUSH Defence: Proposes real 4 per cent decline in defence budget 1993-97, with steady reductions in troop levels to 'base force' with 12 active army divisions, 12 carrier battle groups and 15.25 fighter wing equivalents. Seeks 150,000 troops in Europe. Wants to kill off Seawolf submarine, Osprey aircraft. Backs development of GPALS anti-missile defences. Abortion: Would ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest or threat to woman's life. Has repeatedly vetoed bills including federal funding for abortions or abortion counselling. Environment: Helped enact Clean Air Act but has held up some rules implementing act. Wants more attention paid to economic cost of environmental protection. Healthcare: Proposes tax credits worth dollars 1,250 per person to help cover most of those without health insurance. Seeks reforms to workings of insurance market. Encourages health maintenance organisations. Trade: Seeks to help create domestic jobs by expanding exports. Has negotiated Nafta agreement with Canada and Mexico. Seeks similar free trade agreements in future with other countries in Latin America and eastern Europe. Economy Offers a continuation of Republican Party strategies of past 12 years. Underlying philosophy is that free markets, low taxes and minimal government regulation provide best prospect of rapid economic growth and higher living standards. Thus promises a new round of tax cuts, to be offset by unspecified cuts in federal spending. Emphasises the importance of cuts in capital gains taxes as a way of stimulating private investment and favours short-term incentives to revitalise the economy, such as tax credits for first-time home buyers and targeted investment subsidies. Advocates an amendment ot the Constitution mandating a balanced federal budget. Also seeks to strengthen the economy through market-oriented social reforms, such as the promotion of greater competition to control health care costs and raise educational standards and the creation of tax-free 'enterprise zones' to regenerate inner cities. However, the ideas are mostly a late response to Democratic Party proposals. BILL CLINTON Defence: Seeks to maintain strong military, cutting dollars 60bn from Bush's five-year dollars 1,420bn defence budget. Aims for slightly lower force levels, mainly by cutting to around 100,000 troops in Europe. Backs completion of Seawolf and development of Osprey. Abortion: Supports right to safe, legal abortion, but wants to reduce the number of abortions. 'Children should not have children.' Environment: Favours limiting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by year 2000 to fight global warming. Supports higher fuel efficiency standards for cars, more protection for wetlands, old growth forests. Tones down environmentalist message of his running mate Al Gore. Healthcare: Plans national health spending caps and universal coverage. Employers would either provide private insurance or pay into state-run scheme. Every American guaranteed a basic health benefits package. Trade: Wants to 'move aggressively to open foreign markets', calling for stronger 'Super 301' trade bill,  Endorses Nafta, but wants additional job and environmental protections. Economy Advocates a change of economic course involving a greater commitment to investment in people, a more active role for government and a fairer tax system. Supports free enterprise but argues that government can do more to create a favourable climate for growth. Proposes an additional dollars 200bn of federal investment in education, training and infrastructure over the next four years, a more active industrial policy to facilitate the switch from defence to civilian production, and bold reforms of the health care and welfare systems. Advocates modest tax cuts for middle-income families as a way of compensating for tax cuts that favoured the rich in the 1980s. Would pay for these reforms by raising taxes on the top 2 per cent of earners, by clamping down on tax avoidance by foreign companies and by cutting inessential federal spending. Has pledged to halve budget deficit by 1996. Critics say the plan lacks fiscal realism and envisages too big a role for government. Higher taxes on top earners and foreign companies are unlikely to yield as much revenue as projected, while social reforms - such as guaranteed health insurance for all - may prove more costly than expected. ROSS PEROT Defence: Wants to cut at least dollars 40bn from Bush defence budget over next five years, eliminating 'relics from the Cold War' like the B2 bomber and Seawolf. Wants Europe and Asia to pay dollars 100bn more of the cost of collective security. Abortion: Supports woman's right to choose. Backs federal funding of abortions for poor women, but also for education and counselling to reduce unwanted pregnancies. Environment: Favours economic incentives rather than regulations to achieve environmental goals. Wants to end subsidies for inefficient and environmentally destructive mining and logging activities. Would raise petrol tax by 10 cents a year for next five years. Healthcare: Wants short term cost containment and preventitive medicine programme. Seeks national health board to oversee long-term reform, including universal coverage. Trade: Wants to end distinction between the 'high' politics of defence and diplomacy and the 'low' politics of the economy and jobs. Would put 'experienced, hard-nosed negotiators from outside politics' as trade negotiators. Economy Plan assumes big federal deficits are the root cause of US economic problems and proposes, unlike other candidates, swingeing cuts in spending and increases in taxes - enough, he hopes, to eliminate the deficit by 1998. Theory is that tough action to reduce the deficit would raise the national savings rate, allow more capital investment and thus boost productivity growth and living standards. Asks all sections of society to make sacrifices. The rich would have to pay higher rates of income tax and face a cap on mortgage interest deductions. Working families would face sharp increases in petrol and tobacco taxes. Many elderly people would have to pay more for federal health care and face higher taxes on pensions. Employer health schemes would be taxed more. Would increase spending on a few budget items, including research and development and investment incentives. Overall budget savings estimated at about dollars 750bn over five years. Many economists have applauded the tough measures to regain control of the federal budget, although some fear that deficit reduction at this speed would risk plunging the economy into a slump.</p>

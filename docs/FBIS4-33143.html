			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco has broken an  agreement signed earlier with the ruralist bloc in Congress to  secure approval of the economic plan. He has done this by  vetoing a paragraph of a law providing that the same index be  applied to adjust agricultural loans and agricultural minimum  prices.    The presidential veto, which has upset the ruralist leaders  in Congress, affects Paragraph Two of Article 16 of the Real  Value Unit [URV] Conversion Law.    Deputy Nelson Marquezelli (PTB-SP) [Brazilian Labor  Party-Sao  Paulo], chairman of the Agriculture Committee at the Chamber of  Deputies, said: "We found out that Bacha is the one giving  orders within the government."    Marquezelli was thus referring to Finance Ministry special  adviser Edmar Bacha, who had negotiated with the ruralist bloc  members and who had resisted until the last minute the changes  proposed by the lawmakers.    The ruralist bloc consists of nearly 130 congressmen of  various parties who normally vote as a bloc on matters of  interest to their sector.    The ruralists demanded that the same index be applied to  adjust both agricultural minimum prices and loans in order to  stop them from blocking the approval of the government's  economic plan.    Marquezelli said the rural bloc will mobilize to override  the  presidential veto.    Marquezelli added: "The government is represented by its  leader, but it does not honor the commitments he makes." Luiz  Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Sao  Paulo], the government's leader in the Chamber of Deputies, was  responsible for striking a deal with the ruralists. FOLHA  yesterday unsuccessfully tried to find Santos to hear his  comments.    Marquezelli wants to have the veto overridden already in  June. He said he will seek to mobilize congressional leaders  beginning next week.    In light of the president's decision, the law goes into  effect but the vetoed articles are returned to Congress to be  discussed by the legislature. They will be included in the  "list of vetoes."    An absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies (252 votes)  and of the Senate (41 votes) -- in a joint session -- is  required to override a presidential veto.    Based on a justification of the veto drafted by the Finance  Ministry, the government contends that the wording of the law  violates "a precedent set by the Federal Supreme Court that  rejects any breach of contract."</p>

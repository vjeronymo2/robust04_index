			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / This Week: Music One of the biggest voices in opera tackles one of the most shocking roles in the repertoire with the release of Jessye Norman's new recording of Richard Strauss's Salome (Philips). There have been more sensual interpretations, but few have matched Norman's grandeur, particularly in Salome's final, blood-curdling address to the head of the Baptist. James Morris provides solid support as Jochanaan, Seiji Ozawa directs a fluent performance from the Staatskapelle Dresden. There are not too many performers from the Woodstock festival who are still producing fresh material but Carlos Santana, flanked by his brother Jorge and their nephew Carlos Hermandez, keeps the flag flying with Brothers (Island). The startling ambition of 'Transmutation/Industrial' soon settles down into more familiar territory with all three clan members playing some mean guitar, just like the old days. This latest mutation of Santana support the album's release with dates in Manchester tonight and at the Labbatts Apollo in London from September 28-30. The young Milanese ensemble Il Giardino Armonico, who have helped to pioneer the use of period instruments in their native country, release a meticulously-researched version of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons (Teldec), a performance full of nuance and shading which ranks with the finest. Art school favourites Robert Fripp and David Sylvian join forces once again for their third recorded collaboration with Damage (Virgin), a limited edition (50,000) compact disc of a live performance from their 1993 World Tour. Production and sound quality are exemplary, but the whole exercise sounds a little antiseptic. Massive Attack let all their heavy ammunition off early in Protection (Wild Bunch). The album's opening and title track, featuring Tracey Thorn on vocals, is by far the highlight of a set which too quickly settles into a lazy, directionless groove and ends with a ludicrous live version of 'Light My Fire'. Talking of ludicrous, the vogue for opera 'theme' collections reaches new heights of absurdity with Opera to Die For (Philips), a compilation of admittedly wonderful arias by characters about to meet their maker. Probably not one to play too much as the days get shorter.</p>

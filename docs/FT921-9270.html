			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T calls for end to Russian curbs after deal AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) yesterday signed a multi-million-dollar joint venture with a Russian company and called for western restrictions on high-technology exports to be lifted, Reuter reports from St Petersburg. The deal, with St Petersburg-based Dalnya Svyaz (Dals), is to provide and market digital transmission equipment to improve long-distance domestic and international phone links in the former Soviet Union, AT&amp;T officials said. AT&amp;T Network Systems International will own 68 per cent of the new company, to be called AT&amp;T of St Petersburg. Dals will hold the remaining 32 per cent. Mr Alexei Alyushin, Russia's deputy communications minister, said the joint venture was only a small part of AT&amp;T's plans to develop Russia's communications. However, neither he nor AT&amp;T officials gave details of future projects. They would not say how much would be invested in the current joint venture, but said it amounted to millions of dollars. Mr Sam Willcoxon, an AT&amp;T group executive, said the deal was part of an overall plan to improve the infrastructure in the Commonwealth of Independent States and eastern Europe. 'I view this as a tremendous opportunity as our countries begin to develop commerce,' he said. 'The need for communications is going to grow dramatically,' Mr Willcoxon said, adding that gains from the venture would be long-term but the need for such a deal was immediate. Mr Willcoxon complained about western restrictions on high-technology exports imposed during the Cold War by the Paris-based Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). 'Many of us believe that these are an artefact of history and AT&amp;T is working very aggressively to persuade those that need to be persuaded that this particular artefact be done away with,' he said. Cocom has allowed exports of only slow-speed fibre optic cables of up to 45 megabits per second because of fears that a high-speed link would make military communications more difficult to intercept. AT&amp;T officials said there were 93 international circuits between Russia and the US, well below requirements.</p>

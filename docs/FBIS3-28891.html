Prem Suwal,  secretary of the Nepal Worker-Peasant Party, said in his report  at the meeting that the two parties have since the publication  of the joint statement intensified their joint struggle against  imperialism and revisionism, firmly maintaining the socialist  line in keeping with the common idea and principle and tightened  the bonds of comradely and militant unity and cooperation in  this struggle.    He went on:    "The Nepal Worker-Peasant Party and the Workers' Party of  Korea agreed on the joint statement in order that they keep to  the socialist line under the banner of independence against  imperialism.    "Now the imperialist reactionaries are resorting to heavier  pressure and threat, getting noisier in their anti-socialist and  anti-DPRK campaign. But the Korean people firmly armed with the  chuche idea are tightly adhering to the socialist line, not  wavering in face of all moves of the enemies, with the leader,  the party and the masses closely united in one mind. This is  entirely just.    "The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address indicated the fundamental principles and ways of the  solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. He  warned that pressure and threat would not lead to a solution of  the problem but bring a catastrophe, and called for defending  the sovereignty of the country more firmly and meeting all the  challenges of the enemies resolutely.    "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is unswervingiy  advancing under the banner of socialism, defying ever more  undisguised moves of the imperialist forces to isolate and  stifle it. The secret to its might lies in its firm adherence  to independence."</p>

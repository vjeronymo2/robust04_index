			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Chancellor faces growing pressure to cut base rates MR NORMAN LAMONT faces a tough decision this week on whether to bow to growing pressure for a cut in UK interest rates or to hold out for further evidence of a decline in inflation. The signs at the weekend were that the chancellor may hold off from easing borrowing conditions over the next few days, partly to signal his unhappiness about the high level of underlying inflation, particularly as measured by wage increases. However, the government will face a barrage of calls from industry and political opponents to cut base rates, now at 12 per cent, in the light of fresh evidence about the depth of the recession. Concern about the most serious economic decline for 10 years promises to be a factor in the voting in Thursday's by-election in Monmouth. Government figures due on Thursday are expected to show that unemployment rose last month by about 85,000, following the record increase of 113,000 in March. The latest data on bank lending, due today, are likely to illustrate the low level of demand in the economy, in spite of the recent sequence of rate cuts which have brought base rates down from 14 per cent in mid-February. Speculation has mounted that Mr Lamont will use the opportunity of a large fall in the retail price index, due to be announced on Friday, to sanction a further  1/2 percentage point cut. The annual rate of increase in the RPI, 8.2 per cent in March, is likely to have come down by about 2 percentage points last month - largely due to technical factors resulting from the community charge and changes in mortgage rates. Underlying inflation - the RPI less the effects of the poll tax and interest rates - appears to be coming down less quickly. Moreover, the latest figures for the rate of increase in average earnings, to be announced on Thursday, are expected to show this figure was stuck at more than 9 per cent in March, the same as in February. UK monetary officials are concerned that companies may be trying to pass on to consumers, in the form of higher prices, too great a proportion of their own cost increases due to wage rises. Last week Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, issued a veiled warning against the idea of cutting rates too quickly. One theory is that policymakers may deliberately pass on the chance of cutting rates on Friday - if only to keep financial markets from linking announcements about falls in the RPI to an automatic easing in monetary conditions.

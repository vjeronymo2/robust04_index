			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MONTY HALL MAKES A NEW DEAL  </P> <P> Television personality Monty Hall says he can't even go to the men's room  without some wag uttering his familiar line.  </P> <P> Hall says it is almost inevitable when he walks into a restroom and faces a  lineup of stalls that someone will say: "Do you want door No. 1, door No. 2 or  door No. 3?"  </P> <P> "They all think they invented the line," Hall said.  </P> <P> But beginning this week, that line will be uttered by Bob Hilton, who is taking  over Hall's host role on a new version of "Let's Make a Deal."  </P> <P> Hall, who was in Ft. Worth last weekend for a convention appearance, is a  consultant and business partner in the new "Deal." At 66, Hall said he is glad  it is Hilton, and not him, reviving the show.  </P></p>

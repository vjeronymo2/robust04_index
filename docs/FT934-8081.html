			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Tiphook dives on disposal fears SHARES in Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, plunged 40p to 58p yesterday as fears grew that a disposal of assets by bankers will leave little or nothing for ordinary shareholders. Tiphook said on Monday that its bankers were in talks about the possible sale of its container division, the largest part of the group. A US bonds analyst said: 'It looks like the banks are giving up and going for an orderly disposal of the group's assets. Shareholders will be completely wiped out. It's a very sad story.' A UK transport analyst said: 'Bondholders are particularly afraid that that they will be left holding a baby they don't really want - the trailers business.' Analysts suggested Tiphook's fleet of 495,608 containers might fetch Pounds 800 each, producing roughly Pounds 400m. Tiphook has 17 per cent of the world's container rental fleet, second only to Genstar, a division of General Electric Corporation of the US. Tiphook's 25,065 truck trailers, the biggest fleet in Europe, could fetch more than Pounds 250m. Tiphook's debts exceed Pounds 1bn. Disposals proceeds would be more than enough to pay off the total secured debt of Pounds 480m owed to the group's banks, led by National Westminster and Commerzbank of Germany. However, unsecured US bondholders, who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) in the past year, might only receive 45 to 60 cents in the dollar. The US bonds were yesterday trading at more than a 30 per cent discount to face value. Bond market experts said Tiphook was likely to be deluged by litigation from bondholders, claiming to have been misled by over-confident assertions about the company's prospects. Tiphook's debt was downgraded to so-called junk-bond status within months of issue. Tiphook said on Monday that the group and some directors were the subject of four shareholder class actions in the US, which they would defend. Analysts were concerned at the short-term nature of the Pounds 32.3m which Tiphook has been granted by its principal banks. One said: 'It looks as though they are just drip-feeding it with enough cash to allow a disposal of the assets.' Tiphook's market value has collapsed from Pounds 636m in 1991 to Pounds 64m at last night's close.</p>

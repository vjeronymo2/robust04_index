			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Checklist WHAT pointers can be given to individuals to prepare themselves for eventual retirement? First, they cannot rely on the state, whatever the sympathies of the government. They need to make their own provision to ensure an adequate income. Individuals should therefore assess the opportunities offered by private provision: either an employer's scheme, if there is one; or a personal pension. Second, assuming the employer operates a company scheme, individuals should try to compare the benefits it offers with those provided by personal pensions. A company scheme providing pay-related benefits guarantees the pension in terms of salary at or near retirement, with the employer taking the financial risks (and rewards) and meeting the expenses. Such a pension is relatively hassle-free. With a personal pension, the individual has no guarantee as to the level of pension, but has to take the risks (and reap the rewards) of investment performance, managing the pension arrangements and making adequate contributions from an early stage. The charges can be heavy, so try to discover which life company has the lowest expenses. Additional benefits such as life cover have to be paid for. Third, because of financial services regulations, it is difficult for individuals to get comprehensive advice from one source. The company pension scheme adviser cannot deal with personal pensions while the independent financial adviser, unless he is fee-based, will be reluctant to recommend a client to join the company scheme. Individuals may have to get advice from two sources and collate both sets of information before making their decision. Fourth, company pensions generally favour the stayer, married employees, older employees and those not prepared to make much effort regarding pension provision. Personal pensions favour the job mover, the younger, single employee and those who want to do their own thing. Finally, be prepared to continually review and alter the arrangements in the light of changing circumstances. Good luck.</p>

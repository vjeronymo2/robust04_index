			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Israelis unmoved by UN on deportees A United Nations envoy attempting to resolve the plight of 415 Palestinians expelled to Lebanon by Israel ended visits to both countries yesterday without persuading Israel to take them back. He also failed to secure food and medical supplies for them or to meet the deportees. It remained unclear how the issue, which Palestinian leaders say is threatening the future of Middle East peace talks, might be defused. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, suggested after his second meeting with Mr James Jonah, a UN undersecretary general, that a third country should take the Palestinians, but this appeared to have little chance of acceptance. A Security Council resolution passed unanimously after the deportations almost two weeks ago demanded that the men, all said by Israel to be Islamic fundamentalist militants, be returned to their homes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Dr Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, a leader of the deportees, said from their snow-bound camp in south Lebanon they would not accept anything less. Mr Jonah is due to report back to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general. During the envoy's visit, Mr Rabin refused to reverse the deportations and the Lebanese government rejected an Israeli proposal that humanitarian supplies be delivered to the camp from both sides. Yesterday, Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said after a meeting with Mr Boutros-Ghali in Geneva that the deportations were a 'war crime' and a 'form of ethnic cleansing.' He urged the UN chief to do all he could to force Israel to take back the deportees. France yesterday proposed that the Palestinians be placed provisionally under the responsibility of United Nations Forces in Lebanon (Unifil). Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said he had made the suggestion to Mr Boutros-Ghali during talks in Geneva on a range of world issues.</p>

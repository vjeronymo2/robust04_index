			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Gonzalez set to face down unions: Tomorrow's general strike in Spain will expose union weakness Spain is approaching its third general strike in six years tomorrow with a mixture of apathy and detachment that is sorely testing the political muscle of the country's two main trades unions. The strike is in protest at labour market reforms being introduced by the government. While it seems likely that transport and industry will be badly hit, and that pickets will stop many going to work, strong parliamentary support for the reforms has muted normally vociferously anti-government newspapers. The two union leaders, Mr Nicolas Redondo of the socialist General Workers' Union and Mr Antonio Gutierrez of the communist Workers' Commissions, in trying to drum up support for the strike have insisted that the imposition of reforms without adequate negotiation had left them with little choice but to strike. To an extent, that is true. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, making full use of the country's downcast economic mood, has directly challenged the role in policy-making that union leaders have claimed for themselves since Spain's relaunch as a democracy in 1978. The reforms, designed to help Spain claw its way out of recession, will make it easier and cheaper for employers to hire and fire workers, tax unemployment benefits, and introduce what the unions call 'junk jobs' - apprenticeships paid below the minimum wage. Mr Gonzalez put a time limit on talks about the reforms with unions and employers last November and quickly pressed ahead with them after the deadline expired. He had earlier angered the unions, partly in an effort to mollify currency market scepticism about the strength of the peseta, by declaring that he would impose the reforms whether he had union agreement or not. While the government was shaken into increasing social security spending after a general strike in December 1988, ministers this time are declaring loudly that tomorrow's strike, even if it succeeds in closing down the country, will not alter policy. That remains to be seen. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for the unions to claim widespread work stoppages during these strikes as a measure of support for the aims of the strike. Spain is easy to close down - especially by hitting transport - but it seems certain that many Spaniards will simply take the day off, fearful of pickets or simply the difficulty of struggling into work on commuter lines. A half-day general strike in protest at unemployment benefit cuts in 1992 is generally considered to have failed. The unions had hoped to spend most of January building support for the strike but have had the wind taken out of their sails by two events: the Banesto bank crisis, which brought home the depth of the recession to many Spaniards, and the collapse of a union-owned housing co-operative, which has led to protests against the General Workers' Union. in For Mr Redondo the PSV debacle and the prospect of a lukewarm strike tomorrow are serious blows. He is due to retire this spring and many analysts believe that when he goes, the nature of the intercourse between the unions and any government in Madrid will change, with unions concentrating less on regaining their lost political influence and more on their relations with employers. It was Mr Redondo who, in 1974, proposed the young Felipe Gonzalez as leader of the then exiled socialist party at a national congress held on the outskirts of Paris. Then, and until five years ago, the General Workers' Union was an appendage of the socialist party. But as his protege has moved steadily towards the political centre, the friendship and the institutional links have expired. Many of the political battles fought by the unions with the Socialist party since they first came to power in 1982 have born the stamp of a personal war by Mr Redondo against Mr Gonzalez. His departure from the union will leave his younger Workers' Commission colleague, Mr Gutierrez, as the unchallenged authority in Spanish trade unionism. Pragmatic, clever and middle class, Mr Gutierrez is a much cooler customer, less ambitious for the political limelight and easier in the company of corporate bosses. Ministers believe he will have already written off tomorrow's strike as too late to stop the reforms.</p>

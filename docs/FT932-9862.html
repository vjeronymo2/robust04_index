			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Telecoms group to start City service THE CITY of London's streets are about to be dug up by a new telecommunications company laying its own network. It expects to offer local services to rival BT and Mercury by the autumn. City of London Telecommunications (Colt) has been granted a government licence to build and operate its own fixed-wire London network within the M25. It is only the second company to be granted a licence as a public telecommunications operator since the government opened the telephone-call market to new entrants two years ago. Colt, an offshoot of Fidelity, a US investment management company which has several telecoms concerns in America, intends to spend 'tens of millions' in the next few months on the first stages of constructing its own fibre-optic network. It will initially concentrate on the City, with construction starting in the Fleet Street and Bishopsgate areas. It hopes to offer private-network services in the City by October. It also intends to offer leased-line and other services, some in conjunction with new line resale companies, to provide a national and international 'one-stop' facility. Mr Paul Chisholm, Colt's managing director and a former account manager at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the leading US telecoms group, said he planned to compete on price and quality. Mr Edward Leigh, the technology minister, said that Colt would 'increase the range of choice available to customers in the key financial and business centre of the City of London'.</p>

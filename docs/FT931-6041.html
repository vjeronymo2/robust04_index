			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / RJR creates 'smoke-free' stock RJR NABISCO, the US group which was subject to a record Dollars 25bn (Pounds 17.6bn) leveraged buy-out in 1989, is to create a separate class of shares tied directly to the fortunes of its worldwide food operations, technically making them a 'smoke-free' zone. The move will allow investors to hold shares unconnected with RJR's tobacco interests. Tobacco shares have been hurt by discount brands and fears that the US will impose higher taxes and tougher rules on smoking at work. Some institutions are barred from holding them by 'ethical considerations'. RJR's aim is to raise about Dollars 1.5bn, helping to pay off group debt which financial restructurings have already cut from Dollars 30bn at the time of the buy-out to about Dollars 14bn. The shares, to be called RN-Nabisco Group stock, will initially be sold to new investors. The company plans an offering of 93m Nabisco shares, representing 25 per cent of the food group's equity, at a price of Dollars 17-Dollars 19 a share. About six months later, the company will issue further Nabisco shares, representing a 47 per cent equity interest in the food group, to existing RJR Nabisco shareholders. Existing RJR Nabisco ordinary shares will be redesignated as RN-Reynolds stock, and will represent a 100 per cent interest in the tobacco operations and a 28 per cent interest in the food business. RJR will also start paying dividends, on both classes of stock. Someone owning 100 RJR Nabisco shares today would ultimately end up with 12.5 RN-Nabisco shares and 33.3 RN-Reynolds shares. The annual dividend on each RN-Nabisco share would be 52 cents; on each RN-Reynolds share, it would be Dollars 1 in respect of the tobacco interests plus a further 'pass-through' dividend to reflect the retained 28 per cent interest in the food business's equity. This is not a full demerger of the food operations, which had sales of Dollars 6.7bn last year and operating profits of Dollars 947m, and RJR Nabisco stressed there would be no transfer of legal title to assets. Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR's chairman, said the move was designed to 'enhance the value of the company for shareholders and attract new shareholders by underscoring the distinct growth characteristics of the food industry and cashflow characteristics'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Successful Despite Misunderstandings; Press </F> Section of the Presidential Office on Slovak President's Visit  to Poland"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Press Section of the Presidential  Office of the Slovak Republic has been authorized to announce:    The official visit by the president of the Slovak Republic  to  the Republic of Poland was prepared in the same manner as all  previous trips abroad by the head of state. According to the  words of Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik, "the  president's visit to Poland has been prepared for quite some  time and was preceded by extensive diplomatic activity." The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed which treaties ought to be  signed during the visit, and the composition of the delegation  was determined accordingly. A discussion on the specific agenda  of the visit took place also during the president's bilateral  talks with the president of the Republic of Poland in Prague, on  the occasion of the meeting of representatives of the Visegrad  Four countries with President Clinton. The talks between the  presidents of Poland and Slovakia were attended also by  ministers Jozef Moravcik and Jan Ducky. In the course of these  talks, they arrived at the opinion that steps must be taken to  increase economic cooperation between the two countries. For  these reasons, Minister of the Economy Jan Ducky and other  representatives of our economic life were to be members of the  official delegation. It is therefore incomprehensible that the  prime minister learned about the Slovak president's planned  official visit to Poland only on 19 January 1993, as he declared  at the 26th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic.    In spite of instances of misunderstanding between  constitutional bodies, which have also been reported in the  press, we are able to state that the Slovak president's official  visit to the Republic of Poland was successful and represents a  major contribution to the development of Polish-Slovak  relations. On the other hand, the questioning of the activity  of any central state body and its representatives is damaging to  the interests and the good name of the Slovak Republic abroad.</p>

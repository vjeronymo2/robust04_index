			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- President of the  Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) Radovan Karadzic on Sunday ordered  legal proceedings against and severe punishment of persons who  have been trying to create chaos and discredit the civilian  authorities of the Serb state.    Karadzic gave strict orders for the investigation in  Prijedor, a town in the western R.S., to be stepped up and all  persons responsible for the latest developments in that town to  be arrested, a statement released by the presidential office  said.    Karadzic stressed that the enemies of the R.S. were  intensifying attacks on the republic's independence and  sovereignty in an effort to create chaos, discredit the civilian  authorities of the R.S., and thwart the functioning of the Serb  state, the statement, a copy of which has been sent to TANJUG,  said.    The R.S. president gave strict orders to all civilian and  military authorities to offer all necessary assistance to the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).    All perpetrators of the crimes will be tried and most  severely punished before the eyes of the international public,  Karadzic said.    R.S. Prime Minister Vladimir Lukic on Saturday sharply  protested because of an UNHCR report on an alleged deterioration  of the position of Muslims and Croats in the region of the  Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka.    UNHCR officials uncritically drew up the report solely on  the  basis of statements by the local bishop and mufti and  representatives of the Catholic humanitarian organization  Caritas, and failed even to mention the criminal charges brought  against individuals engaged in criminal activities of damaging  the property of Muslims and Croats in the Banja Luka region,  Lukic said in a letter sent to the Zagreb-based UNHCR  representative.    The UNHCR report, which accused the R.S. authorities of  allegedly not respecting the rights of the minority Muslim and  Croat populations, was aimed at discrediting the R.S.  authorities and attracting the attention of the international  community and media, the R.S. prime minister said in the letter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Branko Vojnica,  president of the Assembly of the Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK],  said today that the statement made by German diplomat Horst  Weisel [German ambassador in Croatia] after yesterday's meeting  between the European Union [EU] ambassadorial troika and the RSK  leadership that "Krajina remains within Croatia's borders" was  an unambiguous declaration of support for Croatia's policies,  views, and demands that could jeopardize everything accomplished  so far.    "Such a conspicuous remark will certainly turn Croatian  President Tudjman and his officials into even greater hawks and  encourage them to attempt, as they say, to reintegrate Krajina  into their constitutional and legal system by force if need be,"  Vojnica told Radio Jagodina. "This continuous pressure does not  surprise us, just as we are not deluding ourselves that it will  not become even more complex and even stronger," Vojnica said.  He stressed that the EU is evidently in a hurry to promote its  interests in this area before the United States does.    "The EU has hinted at such a solution and has now announced  it publicly, ignoring our right to self-determination on the  basis of the UN Charter and the will of the Serb people  expressed at the referendum. The Serbs decided not to live in  Croatia because that state had erased them from its  Constitution", Vojnica said. "The Serb people in Krajina have  managed to defend themselves against their Croat neighbors and  their overlords, and they will also defend their right to  self-determination. They have elected their legitimate bodies  of authority that will work in the interest of the people and  will not back off from our basic demands," the RSK Assembly  president said.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GOLFERS HIT THE LINKS LESS OFTEN  </P> <P> The average number of rounds played by each golfer in the United States  declined 7.7% in 1989 from the previous year, according to research by the  National Golf Foundation released today.  </P> <P> The average fell to 19.2 rounds per golfer from 20.8 in 1988.  </P> <P> Total rounds declined 2.7% to 474 million from 487 million.  </P> <P> The survey wasn't designed to identify the reasons for the decline, but  researchers said Hurricane Hugo and record spring rains in the Northeast were  two likely factors.  </P> <P> "Whatever the reasons, our findings show that, while there were certainly more  people than ever playing golf in 1989, they played on average a little less --  meaning relatively little growth overall for the golf industry," said Joseph F.  Beditz, foundation president.  </P> <P> Rounds played is one of the leading business indicators for the industry. In  1987 and 1988, annual rounds played increased 3% and 12%, respectively.  </P></p>

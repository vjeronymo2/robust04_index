			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cost control helps Resort to 27% rise Resort Hotels expanded in the half year to October 31, with turnover increasing 25 per cent and pre-tax profits 27 per cent. A tight control on costs limited the impact on profits of revenue falling below expectations in many locations. Consequently, the result was not significantly below budgeted levels, said Mr Richard Strong, chairman. Turnover amounted to Pounds 7.62m (Pounds 6.09m) and profit to Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.31m). Interest payable was virtually unchanged but interest received rose to Pounds 954,000 (Pounds 652,000). The group raised Pounds 12m via a rights issue a year ago and issued a Pounds 20m debenture last November to replace short term borrowings. Earnings per share fell to 3.82p (4.41p) allowing for the new shares in issue, and the interim dividend is again 1.2p - a 10.7 per cent increase after the bonus element, the company claimed. Three hotels were added to the network by way of management contracts; that brought the total to 44. Agreements had also been entered into with Country Resort Hotels and County Resort Hotels to purchase them by the end of 1992 and 1993 respectively.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: With-profits bonus threat - Norwich Union's signal to the market TWO DISQUIETING signals for with-profits bonuses were hoisted this week. Norwich Union made it clear that it intended to cut 'annual' or reversionary bonuses next year (a full announcement will wait until next month). And the international credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, in its first report* on the financial strength of UK life offices, said that overall strength had declined over the last five years, and that a permanent decline in solvency standards was likely. It even branded four life offices - Guardian Assurance, National Provident Insitution, Prolific, and Windsor Life as 'vulnerable'. All the offices concerned fiercely rebutted this. NU's comments concern its 'with-profits' policies. These are the standard endowments used to back mortgages and guarantee a 'sum assured' to investors when they start saving (usually slightly less than the amount invested), and add on investment profits in the form of bonuses. These come in two forms - reversionary bonuses, which are declared each year and then cannot be taken away, and additional or terminal bonuses, which are only added when the policy matures. Reversionary bonuses need to be supported by gilts and other fixed interest securities, so life offices tend to concentrate policy returns on terminal bonuses. This gives them more investment freedom. But that means less security for investors. Terminal bonuses can be slashed in a moment. Last year, NU cut its terminal bonuses, to reflect the bad market performance of 1990, when the FT-SE fell for the year, and the mediocre performance of 1991. Others followed its lead. Terminal bonus cuts could easily be reversed for future generations of policyholders if the market picks up. Cuts to reversionary bonus would have less immediate effect, but the longer term implications are more serious. Philip Scott, NU's investment manager, says that cuts in reversionary bonus across the industry are inevitable, thanks to the double whammy of lower returns from investment performance, and the demands of maintaining financial strength. NU predicts that nominal investment returns on all classes of assets will be consistently lower in the 1990s than they were in the 1980s. That means that if reversionary bonuses are not cut now, terminal bonuses will have to be cut by a proportionately greater amount in the following years. So reversionary bonuses would account for a greater share of endowment total pay-outs. As they are funded by fixed interest securities, this would weaken endowments' competitiveness as a product. They would be more secure, but they could not compete as a strong capital growth investment, as they do now, with more flexible equity driven unit-linked products. Life offices also have their financial strength to consider. The government strictly monitors their solvency, or in other words the ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. That strength has been affected by falling property and equity values in the last two years, which reduced the level of life insurers' reserves. The extra distribution expenses which many life offices shouldered after the Financial Services Act of 1986, as they raised commissions and established ties with building societies, also ate into reserves. Standard &amp; Poor's says that companies committed to maintaining financial strength will continue to reduce bonus levels. This finding, coupled with the weakening seen across the industry, looks alarming for returns on policies. One of the least painful ways for offices to ease this kind of strain is to cut reversionary bonuses - terminal bonuses are not a commitment to policyholders, but reversionary bonuses, once they have been announced, have to be supported. Scott also says that, for the life industry as a whole, 10-year pay-outs are around 20 per cent more than their share of the assets in the fund in which they are invested. In other words, the offices are digging into their reserves to pay for the maturity values. This cannot be sustained, and so Scott predicts pay-outs will be trimmed back over the next three years, so that maturity values pay for themselves by 1995. That means 10-year pay-outs for Pounds 50 per month policies falling from their current average of just under Pounds 12,000 to a level around Pounds 9,000.

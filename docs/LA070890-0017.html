			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MISSING LINK IN THE BEST-LAID PLANS OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGERS;  </P> <P> CONGESTION: THE LITTLE TRIP THAT WORKING PARENTS MAKE TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO  A CARE PROVIDER CREATES A LOT OF POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC.  </P> <P> Exasperated with the freeway crawl and with noxious fumes, California voters  agreed early last month to pay for some transportation relief by raising the  gas tax. But most commuters ill experience little comfort -- especially working  parents.  </P> <P> The Air Quality Management District's commuter program, for example, neglects  the needs of workers who must drive their children to school or to child-care  facilities. The plan asks employers to help reduce drive-alone commutes from 6  a.m. to 10 a.m. Employers are supposed to reward workers who participate in  ride-sharing programs, use public transit, agree to a compressed work week or  reduce drive-alone trips by other means.  </P> <P> Day-care centers unfortunately aren't geared to 10-hour days, four times aweek.  Car pools and public transit are also less satisfying options for workers who  are parents. Before catching the bus, a parent must typically drive a short  distance to take his or her child to the care provider.  </P> <P> Starting a cold engine for a five-mile drive produces 60% of the pollution a  20-mile trip does, according to the AQMD. A program designed to improve air  quality by reducing the number of vehicle trips, then, must take into account  the needs of working parents. Otherwise, its benefits, at best, will be  limited.  </P> <P> It's not surprising that child-care needs have been overlooked as a  work-related and transportation issue. Today's concept of childhood is quite  different from the days when father and son, mother and daughter worked  side-by-side at home. After the Industrial Revolution, families just moved  closer to the factories.  </P> <P> With the advent of child-labor laws, the wives of men working at the factories  stayed home with the children, largely remaining there until the 1950s.  Exceptions were made during the two world wars, when women had to fill factory  positions left vacant by men in the armed forces. During World War II,  factories provided excellent child-care centers for workers, but the facilities  were closed after the men returned from the war.  </P> <P> During the 1950s, relatives and neighbors took care of the children of working  parents. But as more and more women entered the work force, fewer neighbors and  relatives were available. More divorces and escalating living costs were also  factors driving women into the job market. A growing number of parents began to  take their children to day-care centers and licensed homes located outside  their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> By 1987, 55% of working women had children younger than 6 years of age. A 1988  study by the California Department of General Services showed that of 2,729  state employees surveyed, nearly 20% drove their children to or from school or  day care. Ninety percent of the drivers were women. The trip to the child-care  provider added, on average, eight miles to the round-trip commute.  </P> <P> The survey also indicated that parents did not walk or bicycle their children  to school or day care. Among parents with children at home, ride-sharing  dropped one-third; among working women with children, use of public transit  declined by three-fifths. Because most users of public transit are women, the  survey results suggest that the ability of buses, light rail and trains to  solve the state's transportation problems is limited.  </P> <P> Happily, more employers are beginning to offer child-care programs. Los Angeles  County, for example, provides excellent child care for its employees,  alleviating many of the worries facing working parents. But it does not take  their transportation needs into account, since the centers are only located at  hospitals. Workers assigned to other, sometimes distant county sites must still  detour to deliver and pick up their children.  </P> <P> Child care at the work site offers employers more than a tremendous recruiting  advantage. It is also good transportation policy, since the extra miles that  parents drive to child-care providers would be eliminated. However, the effect  on ride-sharing programs and the appeal of alternative transportation would be  minimal. Few parents would take three children on a bus, and a father or mother  driving three children to the work place would not be among the most popular  ride-sharing partners.  </P> <P> Some employers, including government agencies, have considered guaranteeing  ride-sharers and transit users transportation for personal emergencies. They  have also considered restricting on-site child care to workers who ride-share  or use alternative transportation.  </P> <P> One emerging child-care strategy could increase use of public transit. Some  transportation agencies are planning to build child-care facilities at transit  stations or at park-and-ride lots. Such a facility opened this year on the  light rail-line of the City of San Diego Metro Transit Authority. In San Jose,  one is being considered at a point where buses, light rail and commuter trains  meet. It would include care for mildly ill children, a service working parents  sorely need. Boston, Atlanta, the Port of New Jersey and the County of San  Diego are conducting feasibility studies for locating child-facilities care in  existing transportation centers or along major transportation corridors.  </P> <P> Child-care facilities at residential sites would probably best serve parental  needs and ease traffic congestion. These centers could organize car pools to  drive children to neighborhood schools. Parents willing and able to walk,  bicycle or take a bus to work could eliminate car trips altogether.  </P> <P> By whatever means, transportation-demand managers must make provisions in their  plans for the growing percentage of workers who require child care. A commuter  plan that ignores the needs of a large segment of the work force is doomed to  fall short of its goals of reducing miles driven and number of trips made.  </P></p>

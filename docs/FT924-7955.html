			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Consumer spending forecast to lift GDP by 1% - Economic prospects for 1993 This section contains the main Autumn Statement forecasts from the Treasury on government expenditure for 1993-94 and the two subsequent financial years, and on developments in the economy next year. Also included are releases on spending from the main government departments RECOVERY in the world economy has stalled again. GDP growth in the major seven economies (G7) slowed sharply in the second quarter and industrial production is falling in a number of the larger countries. Moreover confidence has fallen following recent turmoil on the foreign exchange markets. As a result, independent forecasts of G7 growth have been revised down sharply. The Treasury forecast of G7 growth is 1 1/2 per cent this year, rising to 1 3/4 per cent in 1993 - well below the early summer consensus of around 3 per cent. UK demand and activity: Demand and activity in the UK have been weaker than expected at the time of the Budget. GDP fell  1/2 per cent in the first half of 1992 and may fall slightly in the second half, reflecting the recent deterioration in business and consumer confidence. The Treasury forecast is a fall of 1 per cent in 1992 as a whole. However, the substantial easing of monetary policy since mid-September and the measures announced in the Autumn Statement strengthen the conditions for recovery next year. The average independent forecast made since sterling's ERM suspension is an increase in GDP in 1993 of 1 1/4 per cent. Fifteen out of 24 forecasts envisage growth of 1 per cent or more. The Treasury forecast is an increase in GDP in 1993 of 1 per cent. As in most independent forecasts the stimulus to growth is expected to come largely from consumer spending and stocks. Exports are also generally forecast to increase more rapidly than in 1992 in response to the recent depreciation of sterling. Inflation: Underlying inflation has fallen further over the past year. The RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), rose by 4 per cent in the year to September compared with 5 3/4 per cent a year earlier. As inflation responds with a lag to demand, the effect of the recession should continue to exert strong disinflationary pressure over the next year. However, the depreciation of sterling inevitably means that, despite the weakness of demand, prices will be higher than they would otherwise have been. The Treasury forecast shows underlying inflation at 3 3/4 per cent for the RPI excluding MIPs by the fourth quarter of 1993. The average independent forecast puts underlying inflation a little higher than this at 4 1/4 per cent. Labour market: The growth of average earnings fell to 5 1/2 per cent in September from 7 3/4 per cent a year earlier, and is expected to fall further over the next year. The rate of increase of unemployment has picked up in recent months, but is lower than in the first half of 1991. Most forecasters are projecting further increases in unemployment in 1993. Current account: The current account deficit is forecast to be Pounds 12bn in 1992, but it is expected to widen further in 1993 to Pounds 15.5bn. Much of the deterioration arises from import prices rising faster than export prices following the depreciation of sterling. The average independent forecast for 1993 is more optimistic at Pounds 14bn, but the wide range of forecasts indicates the great uncertainty. Financial developments: Since sterling's ERM suspension in mid-September the sterling index has averaged 81, 11 per cent lower than its average in the first half of 1992. The forecast makes the conventional assumption that sterling remains close to recent levels. Short-term interest rates, 10 1/2 per cent a year ago, were down to 8 per cent by the end of October. Equity prices have picked up since ERM suspension, making good earlier losses to show a small increase since this time last year. House prices have fallen 8 3/4 per cent over the last year. M0 has remained in the upper half of its target range over the last year. Broad money (M4) growth has continued to slow and was 5 per cent in September. Bank and building society lending to the private sector has followed a similar profile and was 4 3/4 per cent higher in September than a year earlier. Public finances: The latest Treasury forecast is that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) will be Pounds 37bn in 1992-93, up from Pounds 28bn in the Budget forecast. The upward revision largely reflects lower than expected activity and earnings, but also the measures announced in the Autumn Statement. On the basis of the latest forecasts for activity and inflation, the new public expenditure plans and the other changes announced in the Autumn Statement, together with the standard assumptions of the indexation and revalorisation of taxes, imply a PSBR in 1993-94 of about 7 per cent of GDP. The range of outside forecasts is Pounds 31bn-Pounds 52.5bn, equivalent to 5-8 1/4 per cent of GDP. The actual PSBR for 1993-94 will be set in the Budget. World economy: G7 industrial production rose strongly in mid-1991, led by a recovery in the US, but fell again from the autumn as the US recovery stalled and production began to slide steeply in Japan. In the first half of 1992, the weakness spread to continental Europe, with falls in industrial production in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Following a deceptively strong rise in the first quarter of 1992, GDP growth in the G7 countries slowed sharply in the second quarter. Output was weak in all major countries, and fell slightly in Germany. In the first half of the year, G7 GDP was just under 1 1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier, following growth of  3/4 per cent in 1991. Though G7 industrial production has stabilised in recent months, it remains 2 per cent below its peak in autumn 1990. Also both business and consumer confidence have continued to weaken in the US, Japan and most continental European countries. This may in part be a consequence of recent monetary and fiscal policy developments, especially in Europe. Though interest rates have continued to fall in the US and Japan, strains within the ERM in September forced up rates in some European countries - notably France, Italy, Ireland and Sweden. German market rates have now fallen back by about 1 point from their end-August peak and rates in some other countries have followed, but European real interest rates remain exceptionally high, at around 6 per cent on average. Recent sharp changes in exchange rates may help growth in those European countries whose exchange rates have fallen. But elsewhere in Europe growth will be hit by higher real exchange rates. Many European countries are also tightening fiscal policy, as the prolonged slowdown undermines plans to reduce budget deficits. Sluggish growth and abundant spare capacity in most G7 countries have maintained downward pressure on inflation. During 1992 inflation has stabilised at around 3 per cent in the US and has fallen substantially in Japan, Italy and Canada. In Germany headline inflation has fallen to 3 3/4 per cent from its peak of 4 3/4 per cent in March, as last year's indirect tax increases have dropped out of the annual rate. In September consumer price inflation in the G7 countries averaged 3 per cent, compared with 5 1/2 per cent at the end of 1990. Strong disinflationary pressures in the world economy are also reflected in non-oil commodity prices, which have weakened again in recent months, following a brief revival early in the year. In real terms, non-oil commodity prices are at their lowest level since the early 1970s. Oil prices have been relatively stable since falling back in the first quarter of 1991 from their Gulf crisis peak. They have averaged Dollars 20 a barrel since the Budget and are assumed in the forecast to remain at that level. Forecast: Against this background of weak indicators and tight policy in Europe, most forecasters have revised down their projections of G7 GDP growth, especially for 1993. Forecasts of growth in 1992 fell steadily from 2 1/2 to 3 per cent last autumn to 1 3/4 per cent by the spring. The Budget forecast, at 1 1/2 per cent, was at the bottom end of the range. But the consensus is now close to the Treasury forecast, which is unchanged from Budget-time. The profile of activity through 1992 has, however, been rather different, with a stronger first half and weaker second half than expected. This has implications for the forecast of growth in 1993, which has been revised down to 1 3/4 per cent (compared with the Budget forecast of 2 3/4 per cent in the year to the first half of 1993). The OECD in June and the IMF in September both forecast G7 growth of around 3 per cent in 1993. But the OECD has now indicated that it has revised down its forecast of OECD growth in 1993, to around 2 per cent. This outlook represents an unusually prolonged period of slow growth. Growth is expected to remain well below trend in the second half of this year, and is not expected to recover to around trend until the second half of next year. Despite very low interest rates, recovery in the US is forecast to be sluggish, with growth of 1 3/4 per cent this year rising to 2 1/4 per cent in 1993. The recovery in consumption in the US is likely to be held back by the weakness of employment growth and, with debt levels still high, the absence of much scope for a sustained fall in personal saving. Growth in Japan could be only 1 3/4 per cent in 1992, the lowest since 1974. Though some recovery is widely expected next year, helped by low interest rates and the fiscal package announced at the end of August, the prospects are for growth of around 2 1/2 per cent - well below trend. Growth in the three main continental European economies is forecast to be under 1 per cent in 1993, following 1 1/4 per cent in 1992. The expected boost to German growth from the removal of the temporary income tax surcharge in July 1992 has not materialised. German GNP may continue to fall in the short run, and could show little recovery until the middle of next year. With no strong pick-up in world demand expected next year, real commodity prices are forecast to remain very subdued. This and the persistence of below trend output provide a favourable background for further reductions in inflation. G7 consumer price inflation is forecast to fall from its current level of 3 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1993. This is more optimistic than many independent forecasts which show no further progress on G7 inflation, and some rise in the US once the recovery gets going. These forecasts may understate the disinflationary impact of abundant spare capacity and high unemployment, which are likely to persist well into 1993 in the US, as elsewhere. The Treasury forecast is for US inflation to fall further to 2 1/2 per cent by the end of 1993. Underlying German inflation should fall too, but the headline rate will be boosted by the proposed 1 per cent VAT increase at the beginning of 1993. Despite the slowdown in industrial countries, activity in developing countries has remained buoyant, with strong rises in Latin America and the Far East. This has helped sustain world trade in manufactures, which is estimated to have risen by 4 per cent in 1991. A similar rate of growth is forecast for 1992, rising to 5 per cent in 1993. This would still be below the average for the 1980s. UK demand and output: Domestic demand edged up over the year to the second quarter of 1992, increasing by over  1/2 per cent despite consumers' expenditure remaining flat. But with imports rising more than exports, GDP fell. By the second quarter of 1992 GDP was over  1/2 per cent below its level a year earlier. And although non-oil GDP rose marginally in the second quarter it was almost 1 per cent down on a year earlier. Activity in the first half of 1992 has turned out weaker than in the Budget forecast: GDP growth in the first half was about 1 percentage point lower than forecast. Domestic demand was weaker than expected and, more importantly, imports took a higher share than forecast, largely reflecting a shift in the composition of demand towards manufactures. Within non-oil GDP, output fell in the year to the second quarter in all the main sectors - manufacturing, services, non-oil energy and construction - with the largest fall in the construction sector. But service sector output has fallen only marginally this year and manufacturing output rose in both the first and second quarters. Prospects: The signs are that GDP may have been broadly unchanged or fallen slightly in the third quarter. With the exception of North Sea oil and gas, output may have been at best flat in all sectors, and may have fallen in some. The prospects are that the remainder of the year may be weak too. Consumer confidence has fallen over the summer and into the autumn, and a range of recent surveys show falling business confidence. The fall in the value of sterling following suspension of ERM membership, recent cuts in interest rates and the measures announced, should reverse these trends, but they are unlikely to have a large impact on GDP in the remainder of 1992. Exporters can no doubt expect some early benefit, but there has been renewed weakness in the world economy and part of the additional demand is likely to be met from stocks. The Treasury forecast for GDP in 1992 as a whole is a fall of about 1 per cent, implying a decline of roughly  1/4 per cent between the first and second halves of the year. This is in line with the average of recent independent forecasts. The Treasury forecast for manufacturing output in 1992 shows it falling by a similar amount to GDP. Growth prospects for 1993 have been improved by the recent easing of monetary policy and measures announced. But this needs to be set against the projected weakness of the recovery in the world economy, and the muted response of domestic demand, particularly consumer spending, to earlier reductions in interest rates. The Treasury forecast for GDP growth in 1993 is 1 per cent, well within the range of recent independent forecasts, but a little below the average. Growth in the year to the second half of 1993 is forecast at 1 3/4 per cent. The recovery could, of course, be a lot stronger than this if confidence picks up quickly in response to recent Government initiatives. But it seems prudent not to base the forecast on this assumption. In the Treasury forecast all components of domestic demand are forecast to rise in 1993, but the largest contributions to growth are from consumer spending and stocks. The growth of exports is expected to rise next year too in response to the depreciation of sterling and the projected world economic recovery. The increase in domestic demand in the Treasury forecast is somewhat larger than in the independent average forecast, but this is more than offset by a smaller contribution from net trade. Within domestic demand the Treasury has slightly stronger growth of consumers' expenditure and investment - in part reflecting the measures announced - and a larger contribution from stocks. Personal sector Consumers' expenditure dipped in the first quarter of 1992 but recovered in the second quarter to much the same level as in the second half of 1991. This pattern is probably accounted for by uncertainty in the run-up to the election. Retail sales moved up again in the third quarter, by  1/2 per cent, in spite of declining consumer confidence since the spring. Car registrations also rose. Prospects: The outlook for consumption depends on the balance of opposing influences. Factors pointing to higher expenditure include: Rising real incomes. The  1/2 per cent fall in real personal disposable income in 1991 is expected to be reversed in 1992, with further growth of 1 1/2 per cent forecast in 1993. Lower interest rates. The effects on consumption of interest rate falls prior to the suspension of sterling from the ERM have yet to come through fully. The residual effects of these cuts will add to the effects of the interest rate cuts since sterling's suspension. Income gearing - the ratio of interest payments to income - which peaked at over 12 per cent in 1990, should be down to around 9 per cent at the end of 1992. Factors holding consumer spending back include: Low consumer confidence, which may partly reflect rising unemployment. The high level of personal sector debt: This grew rapidly in the 1980s because financial liberalisation and rising house prices raised the amount of debt people were prepared to hold and the amounts lenders were prepared to advance. Rising interest rates from 1988 and falling house prices from 1989 put these factors into reverse. But it is unclear what level of debt the personal sector is now aiming for, and to what lengths it will go to achieve it. The latest figures suggest that the debt-income ratio peaked during 1991 and has declined a little in 1992. Continued weakness in the housing market, reflected in depressed turnover and falling prices. Housing market: Personal sector spending has been closely linked with developments in the housing market in recent years. The decline in house prices which started in 1989 has continued in 1992, with house prices as measured by the Halifax index 8 3/4 per cent lower in October than a year earlier. The temporary suspension of stamp duty on purchases of less than Pounds 250,000 was effective in stimulating activity, with a sharp pick-up in turnover and a slowdown in price falls towards the end of the concession in mid-August. It would not be surprising if activity were to have fallen back temporarily after the withdrawal of the concession. Private sector housing starts and completions remain on downward trends; new orders have, however, stabilised in recent months.  Falling mortgage rates - now at their lowest levels since the 1970s - and lower house prices mean that house purchase has become more affordable.  This should help to stabilise the housing market, which will also benefit from the measures announced.  Although the current position is unfavourable, it is possible that both turnover and prices will start to rise some time in 1993. In common with most independent forecasts, the view taken in the Treasury forecast is that the balance of factors affecting consumption will result in an increase in spending in 1993, following a slight fall in 1992. The forecast is a rise of 1 1/4 per cent in 1993 - slightly above the average independent forecast of 1 per cent. In the Treasury forecast the increase is more than accounted for by the projected rise in real incomes, with the saving ratio rising marginally in 1993. Earlier forecasts anticipated small falls in the saving ratio. With the saving ratio over 10 per cent in both 1992 and 1993 and housing investment continuing to be weak, the personal sector's financial surplus is forecast to be around 6 per cent of disposable income in 1992 and perhaps around 6 1/2 per cent in 1993. The debt-income ratio at the end of 1993 could be some 5 per cent below its peak. Company income and saving: Industrial and commercial companies' profits (net of stock appreciation) were flat between 1990 and 1991, as the recession squeezed both margins and turnover. But profits were somewhat stronger in the first half of 1992, reflecting improved cost control. So with falling interest and tax payments, and despite high dividend payments, company saving (undistributed income) rose modestly in the first half of 1992 relative to the average for 1991. Business investment: Against the background of extremely large financial deficits in 1989 and 1990 and weak profits during the recession, companies have cut back on investment as they have sought to improve their financial position. Total business investment fell 9 1/2 per cent in 1991, but rose slightly in the first half of 1992, mainly as a result of higher investment by public corporations and North Sea oil companies. For 1992 as a whole business investment is forecast to fall by 1 3/4 per cent. Looking ahead to 1993 it would be unrealistic, with the large degree of spare capacity and only a modest recovery in demand, to expect a sharp turnround in business investment. However, the temporary increase in capital allowances will boost investment in 1993. Non-oil business investment is forecast to rise during the course of the year, but with lower North Sea investment, total business investment is projected to show no change in 1993 as a whole. Even in 1993, however, the ratio of business investment to GDP is expected to be higher than the levels seen between 1970 and the mid-1980s. General government investment: General government fixed investment is forecast to rise in volume terms by 7 per cent in 1992 and, despite the tight public expenditure round, it should increase further in 1993 by 1 3/4 per cent. This compares with projected increases in the volume of general government consumption of  1/2 per cent in both 1992 and 1993. Whole economy investment: The Treasury forecast is a fall of 2 per cent in whole economy investment in 1992, followed by a rise of  1/4 per cent in 1993. This is more optimistic than the average of independent forecasts, which suggests a fall of  1/4 per cent in 1993. This difference probably reflects in part the positive impact on investment of the measures announced. Stockbuilding: Companies shed stocks heavily in 1991, but the pace of destocking slowed progressively from mid-year and into 1992. However, further destocking is to be expected, particularly by manufacturers, in the second half of 1992. Distributors ran down stocks rapidly in the second quarter and manufacturers appear to have been caught out by lower than expected demand, leading to involuntary stock holding. And with demand remaining weak destocking may continue into 1993, before rising sales and output justify a return to stockbuilding. The turnround in stockbuilding is forecast to contribute  1/2 per cent to GDP growth in both 1992 and 1993. Companies' financial position: Profitability of non-North Sea companies, as measured by the real rate of return, is forecast to pick up slightly in 1992, and more strongly in 1993 as demand rises. Companies' saving will also benefit from lower interest rates which will reduce debt service payments. With industrial and commercial companies' saving rising and their capital spending falling in 1992 and rising only slowly in 1993, their financial deficit is forecast to undergo further correction, moving back to balance in 1993. Employment and unemployment: Total employment in June 1992 was over 1.5m down on its peak in June 1990. Firms have shed labour faster during this recession than during the two previous ones. Consequently productivity performance has been better: it has been increasing since the start of 1991, a much earlier stage than usual in the cycle. Productivity gains moderated as the rate of job losses slowed sharply between the first halves of 1991 and 1992. However, it may be some time before employment stops falling - typically it lags the cycle in output. Claimant unemployment has increased by less than the fall in employment during the recession. From its low point in April 1990 it rose about 1.1m to June 1992, though with clear signs that the rate of increase was moderating. But in more recent months the rate of increase has risen reflecting renewed job shedding, particularly in manufacturing. Unemployment may continue to rise for some time, though the rate of increase should start to slow again as activity picks up. Trade and balance of payments Developments in 1992: The current account deficit was about Pounds 3bn in each of the first three quarters of 1992. The visibles deficit was on a gently rising trend with export volumes levelling off after rising early in the year, and import volumes continuing to rise, albeit at a slower rate than earlier in the year. The invisibles surplus in the first three quarters is projected at less than Pounds 1bn - well down on the Pounds 4bn surplus recorded in 1991 when it benefited from overseas contributions to the UK's Gulf expenditure and from unusually low net contributions to the EC. Weaker invisibles than anticipated in the Budget forecast, which showed a surplus of Pounds 4.5bn in 1992, are in part the consequence of revisions to previous outturns which have reduced the invisibles surplus in 1991 by Pounds 1bn. In addition, a downward revision to the UK's net stock of overseas assets at the end of 1991 to Pounds 16bn - half the earlier estimate - has reduced estimated net investment income in 1992. Although the fall in the exchange rate will have increased the net stock of overseas assets, the prospective current account deficits will tend to have the opposite effect. Turning to visible trade, the deficit on manufactures has run ahead of the Budget forecast for 1992. It was Pounds 5bn in the first three quarters - the same as the earlier forecast for the whole of 1992. Non-oil exports fell back a little in the third quarter, after reaching record levels in the second. Non-oil imports have grown more quickly than forecast mainly because the demand for manufactured goods appears to have risen unusually quickly in relation to the overall growth of demand. Competitiveness: Growth of UK unit labour costs has continued to come more into line with that of our competitors. In 1991 UK manufacturers' unit labour costs rose 5 per cent faster than competitors' unit labour costs measured in local currency. In 1992, UK unit labour cost growth is expected to be, if anything, a little slower than in competitor countries. In 1993, this favourable gap is expected to widen further, with UK labour costs perhaps falling a little. The implication is that the improvement in competitiveness from the recent depreciation of sterling will be maintained through 1993. In 1993 on average, cost competitiveness is projected to be some 16 per cent better than in the first three quarters of 1992. Outlook for exports: Manufactured export volumes reached record levels in mid-1992, but fell back in the third quarter. Overall they are expected to rise by 1 1/2 per cent in 1992. Deliveries in the fourth quarter should benefit a little from the improved competitiveness, but this will have its greatest effect in 1993 and later. This should mean exports growing faster than world trade: manufactured export volumes could rise by 7 1/4 per cent in 1993, compared with world trade growth of 5 per cent. Overall, goods and services export volumes are forecast to rise 5 1/2 per cent in 1993. This is a little above the average independent forecast which puts export growth at 4 3/4 per cent in 1993, but within the independent range. Outlook for imports: The improvements in competitiveness will also benefit firms competing with imports. Non-oil import volumes are expected to grow by 7 1/4 per cent in 1993 - the same as in 1992 even though total final expenditure is expected to increase 1 1/2 per cent more quickly in 1993 than in 1992. The continuing specialisation of world production is likely to mean a further rise in import penetration, but this should be muted by improved competitiveness. The volume of imports of goods and services is forecast to increase by 5 3/4 per cent in 1993, less than the rise in 1992. The forecast for 1993 is above the average of independent forecasts of 3 3/4 per cent, but well within their wide range. The North Sea: North Sea production fell back in the first half of 1992, following its strong recovery at the end of last year. Output is expected to rise by only per cent in 1992, less than expected at Budget time. Delays in starting up new fields and in returning old fields to production after maintenance explain the shortfall. Output is expected to rise by 7 per cent in 1993. With production rising and oil prices assumed to remain close to recent levels, the surplus on oil trade is expected to rise to Pounds 2bn in 1993 from Pounds 1.5bn in 1992. Invisibles: Even without the benefit of the lower exchange rate, the balance of interest, profits and dividends (IPD) was expected to improve in 1992. The 1991 balance was depressed in part by stock losses arising from oil price changes at the time of the Gulf war. The lower exchange rate will boost the surplus from the fourth quarter of 1992 by increasing the sterling value of foreign currency denominated credits. While the surpluses on services and IPD are both expected to rise in 1993, the invisibles surplus as a whole rises by less because of slightly higher net outward government transfers. Overall, the invisibles surplus is expected to rise to Pounds 4bn in 1993 from Pounds 2bn in 1992. Current account: The current account deficit is projected to be Pounds 12bn in 1992, rising to Pounds 15.5bn in 1993. The deterioration is more than accounted for by a rise in the visibles deficit. With export and import volumes growing at similar rates, this is largely explained by price movements. Equal rises in export and import prices following the depreciation would automatically worsen the current account before volumes adjust. Moreover, import prices are expected to react more quickly to the depreciation of sterling as exporters keep prices down to increase volumes. The terms of trade (excluding oil) are expected to worsen by 2 1/2 per cent. The forecast of the current account deficit in 1992 is virtually the same as the independent average. The forecast for 1993 is above the average figure of Pounds 14bn, though the wide range of independent forecasts illustrates the high degree of uncertainty. Inflation Good progress has been made in reducing inflation. Underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), fell to 4 per cent in September, down 1.7 percentage points since April. All-items RPI inflation has been a little lower than expected since the Budget and was 3.6 per cent in September. Producer output prices are increasing even more slowly, with the rate excluding food, drink and tobacco at 2.5 per cent in October, the lowest since May 1969. And with unit wage costs in manufacturing in June to August only 2.3 per cent up on a year earlier, pressure on profit margins has been easing. In response to falling inflation, a weak labour market, and the tight financial position of companies, pay settlements have continued to fall over the past year. CBI and other data point to settlements in both manufacturing and services recently averaging just over 4 per cent, about half the level in early 1991. Whole economy underlying earnings growth fell to 5 1/2 per cent in September, down from over 10 per cent in mid-1990 and the lowest since 1967. And the full effect of lower settlements has still to feed through into year-on-year earnings growth. Prospects: Inflation reacts with a lag to demand and activity. The considerable degree of spare capacity in the economy will therefore continue to exert powerful downward pressure on inflation for some time to come, even if the economy recovers as projected. Support for this view comes from the CBI Survey which shows the balance of firms planning to raise prices at record lows in recent months. The prospect for inflation has, however, been altered by the lower interest rates and exchange rate following sterling's suspension from the ERM. The lower exchange rate will inevitably mean higher inflation compared to what it otherwise would have been, as the cost of imports rises and domestic producers face less competitive pressure from foreign producers. But the speed with which the lower exchange rate affects domestic prices and earnings is uncertain. On the one hand the weakness of domestic and world markets may mean both that importers will be more restrained than usual in passing on higher world prices in sterling, and that domestic producers will be more restrained in passing on higher import costs. On the other hand, with domestic margins already pared by the recession, there may be limited scope for absorbing further cost increases. However, against a background of strong disinflationary pressures, the lower exchange rate may imply only a marginal and almost certainly a temporary increase in inflation. Producer output price inflation is now expected to average 2 1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, before rising to a temporary peak of 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993. Underlying RPI inflation may also rise slightly in the months ahead as the lower exchange rate affects import prices directly, and more generally limits disinflationary pressure. But the Treasury forecast is that it will fall back to 3 3/4 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1993. The outlook for the all-items RPI inflation rate will depend on what happens to mortgage rates. The Treasury forecast implies that RPI inflation will be 3 1/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992 on the basis of mortgage rates already announced. For the fourth quarter of 1993, the forecast implies that RPI inflation would be 3 1/2 per cent if mortgage rates remained unchanged from those due to take effect from December. But a one percentage point decrease (increase) in mortgage rates would lower (raise) the level of the all-items RPI by just over 1/2 per cent, other things equal. Other forecasters are rather more pessimistic about inflation prospects. The average of recent independent forecasts for underlying RPI inflation in the fourth quarter of 1993 is 4 1/4 per cent. There are, however, a number of independent forecasts showing inflation within the Government's 1-4 per cent target range. The difference between the Treasury and the average view probably mainly reflects our somewhat less buoyant view of output, and our assessment of the amount of disinflationary pressure in the pipeline prior to ERM withdrawal, rather than a difference of view about the effects of the lower exchange rate. Recent and prospective developments in underlying inflation are expected to be reflected in the GDP deflator, which measures the price of domestic value added (principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output). The GDP deflator is now forecast to increase by 4 1/4 per cent in 1992-93, a little less than forecast at Budget time, and by 2 3/4 per cent in 1993-94. The projected increase in the deflator in 1993-94 is less than the increase in consumer prices because of public sector pay restraint and weak investment prices. Investment prices have fallen over the last year and are forecast to rise by about 2 per cent in 1993-94. Financial developments Exchange rates: Over the last year until its suspension from the ERM, sterling traded for the most part comfortably within its ERM margins, close to its central rate of DM2.95. Since suspension, sterling has averaged DM2.47. In effective terms it was 11 per cent lower on average in October than a year earlier. Interest rates: Short-term interest rates began their fall from their 15 per cent peak in the autumn of 1990; this has continued in 1992. They fell  1/2 per cent in May to 10 per cent, and, after two further cuts since ERM suspension, they stood at 8 per cent at the end of October. Long rates have fallen  3/4 per cent over the last year: an increase following ERM suspension has now been reversed. But the yield curve is now upward sloping for the first time since early 1988. Equity prices have picked up since ERM suspension, making good earlier losses to show a small increase since this time last year. Monetary aggregates: M0 has remained well within its target range throughout 1992. Its 12-month growth rate has been between 2 and 2 1/2 per cent in every month, except June when it dipped to 1 1/4 per cent. M4's 12-month growth rate has continued to decline during the past year from 6 1/2 per cent in September 1991 to 5 per cent a year later. The trend in M4 velocity has flattened recently. The monitoring range for M4's 12-month growth rate has been set at 4 to 8 per cent for the remainder of the financial year. Credit: The growth of M4 lending has fallen further in 1992. In September it was 4 3/4 per cent. M4 lending to industrial and commercial companies in 1991 was well down on recent years at Pounds 1.3bn, and remained low in the first half of 1992. Personal sector borrowing has weakened reflecting the lack of activity in the housing market and weak borrowing for consumption. Subdued lending is consistent with the personal sector's efforts to reduce its debt and also with the weakness of company spending. Public finances PSBR: The forecast is for a PSBR of Pounds 37bn, as compared with Pounds 28bn in the Budget forecast. Borrowing is usually higher in the first half of the year than in the second half. However, this year the proportion of borrowing in the first half is expected to be less than usual for a number of reasons. Mainstream corporation tax receipts, three-quarters of which normally come in the second half of the year, are expected to be substantially down on 1991-92. The growth of central government cash outlays has been relatively low compared with the forecast for the year as a whole, and may pick up in the second half. The bulk of privatisation proceeds for the year (Pounds 5bn out of Pounds 8bn) were received in the first half. Local authorities' net borrowing has been exceptionally low in the first half. Finally the measures announced will increase the PSBR in the last five months of 1992-93, by over Pounds 1bn. Taking all these factors into account, the PSBR for the second half of the year is now expected to be around Pounds 18.5bn, the same as in the first half. Changes since the Budget: The higher PSBR now forecast mostly reflects lower general government receipts, mainly due to lower economic activity and lower earnings growth. General government expenditure is Pounds 2.25bn higher than forecast at Budget time, but around half of this reflects the measures announced, which also have a small impact on receipts. Expenditure: The estimated outturn for the planning total would be unchanged since the Budget, but for the housing measures announced. These account for a Pounds 750m upward revision. The measures, however, only account for around one fifth of the higher forecast of local authority self-financed expenditure, which is up by nearly Pounds 1.5bn. This largely reflects higher than expected capital spending by local authorities. Central government debt interest payments are also a little higher than forecast at Budget time. Receipts: General government receipts are now forecast to be Pounds 6bn lower than in the Budget forecast. The downward revision is more than accounted for by lower tax receipts; other receipts are now expected to be higher than in the Budget forecast. Much of the lower tax receipts forecast reflects a lower level of economic activity and lower earnings than in the Budget forecast. Tax receipts are also reduced a little by the abolition of car tax. Customs and Excise receipts are expected to be around Pounds 3.75bn lower than in the Budget forecast and Inland Revenue receipts around Pounds 4.25bn lower. VAT receipts are forecast to be down by Pounds 2.25bn, and income tax receipts to be Pounds 2bn lower. Receipts of social security contributions are also down by nearly Pounds 1bn. There has also been a substantial downward revision (of around Pounds 2bn) to the forecast of corporation tax receipts; this largely reflects lower than expected tax payments on profits earned in 1991, and larger repayments of tax as companies use current losses against tax liabilities. On a national accounts basis, total taxes and social security contributions are now forecast at 34 3/4 per cent of GDP, a fall of nearly 1 1/2 percentage points on the previous year. Most of the fall reflects the recession, and in particular the substantial reduction in corporation tax receipts. Independent forecasts: The latest Treasury forecast for the PSBR in 1992-93 is, at Pounds 37bn, around Pounds 3.5bn higher than the average of independent forecasts. In part this difference reflects the effects of the measures announced not taken into account in independent forecasts. Uncertainties All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. Recent Industry Act forecasts have emphasised that these are most acute when the economy is at or close to a turning point. This remains no less true on this occasion, and applies as much to the forecast of the world economy as to that for the UK. The recent turbulence in financial markets has added to the uncertainty. The Treasury forecast is based on the assumption that the exchange rate remains close to recent levels. The forecasts presented here are central forecasts, a balance of upside and downside risks. Domestic demand and GDP have been considerably weaker than forecast over the past two years, with errors well above the average. However, the counterpart has been faster than anticipated progress in reducing inflation, though errors here have been less than the past average.</p>

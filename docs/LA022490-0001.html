			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IDENTITY CRISIS  </P> <P> Regarding Charles Champlin's Feb. 8 column on who wrote Shakespeare's works:  </P> <P> A group of graduate students, under my direction, have unearthed several  dust-covered documents and pursued various phililogic and textual theories that  have revealed an historic fact: Charles Champlin does not exist.  </P> <P> One of my students has drawn up a lengthy article that shows, upon philological  and semiotic analysis, that much of "Champlin's" articles are but a compilation  of others: a snippet of Michael Wilmington's attitude, a graft of Kevin Thomas'  esoterica, a collocation of Sheila Benson's critical vengeance.  </P> <P> We don't know much about "Champlin's" origins. It surely cannot be that he had  an uneventful childhood and adult life. A conspiracy of silence is going on in  the Calendar section, and I have arrived to clear the air.  </P> <P> JOSEPH R. PUTERBAUGH, Santa Monica  </P></p>

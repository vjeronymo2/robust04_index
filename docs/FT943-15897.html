			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Water bills face 'green' costs rise British householders could face even higher water bills next year as a way of meeting additional environmental obligations handed to the water companies yesterday by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. The government added another Pounds 522m to the bill water companies must pay for treating sewage and cleaning up rivers in the next five years. Mr Gummer told the industry regulator, Mr Ian Byatt, to take the extra funding into account when fixing price limits for domestic bills. The new money is equal to about Pounds 6 a year for each of Britain's 18m households, but bills will rise more in some areas than in others. Price formulas for Britain's 31 water companies are due to be announced on July 28. They will already take into account a Pounds 14bn to Pounds 15bn clean-up of waste water planned by the industry by the year 2000. Mr Gummer's decision to add another Pounds 500m in environmental spending to companies' obligations will inevitably lead to the charge that householders will end up footing the bill. Water companies have increased their charges to households by 67 per cent since privatisation in 1989. An official at the National Consumers' Council said: 'Consumers have been asked to pay a very large part of the burden of investment and general upkeep of the system since privatisation. But there is no reason why the cost of this environmental spending should be passed on.' The consumers' council said companies should turn to other sources of finance, such as the equity market, for investment capital.</p>

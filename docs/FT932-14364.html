			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (14): A more stable environment - Business Travel in the US BUSINESS travellers in the US may be biting their nails at present. After three years of intense price competition in the US airline industry - which has contributed to the sector's Dollars 10bn-worth of losses over the period, but been a boon to corporate travellers - there are signs of a more stable environment and higher fare levels. The first big blow for the business community was probably struck a year ago when American Airlines, one of the nation's largest carriers, announced its fare simplification programme. Superficially, this appeared to benefit the business traveller. Out went a whole raft of special promotional fares, and instead American said it would focus on four core ticket classes - namely first class, coach, seven-day advance purchase and 21-day advance purchase. Fares within these classes would be generally lower than for comparable existing classes. First class fares under American's 'Value Pricing' scheme, for example, were to be 20-50 per cent lower than existing full first-class fares. The drawback was that American also announced that it was discontinuing the discounts offered to leading corporate travel buyers and was imposing a Dollars 25 fee on every rescheduling or refunding of a ticket. Unfortunately, while the simplified fare structure proved short-lived in the face of an intense bout of summer ticket promotions, the removal of corporate discounts and the Dollars 25 fee for ticket changes have tended to persist. Now, as the industry has escaped the bleak winter travel period and is scrambling to repair some of the damage wrought over the past three years, there are clear signs that airlines are trying to push their prices higher, particularly where the business customer is concerned. Whether these higher fares persist in an often-kamikaze industry remains to be seen. But there is reason to think that they probably will. For a start, the slow improvement in demand - coupled with the cutbacks which some carriers are threatening to make in domestic schedules - may pull demand and supply into better equilibrium. Perhaps even more significantly, the number of bankrupt airlines - whose cashflow needs have often triggered the intense fare wars - looks likely to diminish. Continental Airlines and Trans World Airlines are both poised to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, leaving only America West with an unresolved future. Certainly, the business travel lobby is already girding up for action. The National Business Travel Association, for example, makes the point that travel is the third-largest operating expense for many big companies and that - in a straightened, albeit improving economy - increased ticket prices will either lead to reduced travel budgets or a halt to travel altogether. 'In either case,' says the NBTA, 'airlines are deprived of customers and so are hotels, car rental companies, restaurants, airports and other suppliers in the private sector who depend on the dollars our members spend in the travel network'. How the needs of the airline sector and the business community generally can be meshed will form part of the raft of issues addressed by the new commission set up by Mr Federico Pena, Transportation Secretary, to examine the US commercial aviation industry's problems. Already, some pre-emptive lobbying is under way. The NBTA, for example, is anxious to secure some fiscal breaks. It recommends reducing the domestic ticket tax from 10 to 8 per cent, claiming that this would encourage an additional 6.5m passengers annually, creating 7,500 jobs and profits of Dollars 300m. It also suggests that passengers should be taxed according to actual usage - that is that taxes should be imposed on a cost-per-mile basis, at 5-6 cents per mile. This would also benefit the business traveller. A more fundamental question is whether the commission recommends some form of 're-regulation' of domestic fares, and how this might help or hinder the business traveller. The airlines are generally opposed to any capping or even underpinning of fare levels by a federal body; they remember the bureaucracy and inefficiencies which existed prior to deregulation of the domestic fare environment in 1978, and are not anxious to return to this situation. The business travel lobby is inclined to support this position. The NBTA, for example, acknowledges that some financial stability in the industry might be a good thing, but is equally aware that deregulation has pushed down fare levels for business as well as leisure travellers. Finally, there is little sign that service levels have altered significantly over the past 12 months. Despite the efforts of some carriers to justify their higher fares by boasting about seat comfort, food service and so on, most passengers are probably more conscious of the shrinking size of meal portions. According to Department of Transportation figures, punctual arrivals and the reliability of baggage handling have generally improved - although the statistics themselves have been subject to criticism in the past.</p>

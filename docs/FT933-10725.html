			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Former Eni chief arrested in Rome MR Alberto Grotti, former deputy chairman of Italy's state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, was arrested in Rome yesterday on the instructions of Milan magistrates investigating political corruption, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Mr Grotti's arrest, on allegations of illegal political funding, is the latest in a string of detentions linked to investigations into the former Enimont chemicals joint venture between Eni and Montedison, the chemicals arm of the Ferruzzi group. Last week magistrates warned eight senior politicians and former party leaders they were under investigation for alleged political corruption involving Enimont. According to leaked testimony from two former Ferruzzi executives, the company paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) in kickbacks to ensure favourable treatment when Enimont was established and when it was wound up in late 1990.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, gave a statement to Sarajevo  Radio and TV reporters following [UN Secretary General Butrus]  Butrus-Ghali's request to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner  on the authorization of air attacks against the Serb aggressor's  positions.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I believe that this is a  request to prepare for such an action, to authorize the command  of NATO's Sector South to carry out the attacks, but -- and this  is important -- at the UN request. This means that Butrus-Ghali  will have to order it once again. This is typical of  Butrus-Ghali's manner.    But, I hear that this is obviously being seriously  discussed.  It is becoming a serious issue. As you know, we held talks  with [UN envoy] Akashi yesterday. He then held talks with the  Serb side. We demanded -- to avoid the air attacks but achieve  the goal at the same time -- that the Serbs, of their own free  will, withdraw their artillery and place it under UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] control. This was our latest demand. They  issued some counterproposal or other -- for the artillery to be  just monitored -- that we obviously rejected.    We increased the pressure today by sending another letter to  the [European] Twelve, who have just begun a session, and to the  NATO secretary general -- they are holding a session tomorrow.    Something seems to be moving in the European Union. I heard  that the European Union has made a decision to break the siege  of the city, if necessary with the use of force. So, obviously,  things are moving in some direction. There is at least a 50-50  chance that NATO attacks against those positions will  materialize.    I believe that the Serbs will take the risk. They will try  to test Europe, to see if it will do it or not, for their  experience with Europe so far has shown that Europe is  indecisive. I think they will play that card. I would not say  that they will withdraw of their own [free] will. Something has  changed, but we have paid for it. The price was those 70 lives  and 200 wounded, for people to realize that such absurdity and  evil cannot be tolerated any more. Or they understood that this  is not only the question of Bosnia- Herzegovina, that this is --  as our esteemed visitor from Pakistan [Benazir Bhutto] said --  that this is a moral issue, which concerns every man. Can crime  be tolerated and is it not encouragement for crime and fascism,  opening the doors wide for them in the world? You see, there  are some new, sad phenomena in Russia, which really pose a  threat to the world, to the survival of the world. If we look  back perhaps we could trace it to the lax attitude and tolerance  in Europe toward an evil that appeared in the Balkans some four  or five years ago. [end recording]</p>

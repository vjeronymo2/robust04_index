			<p>BFN     [Text] As North Korea takes up offensives against the  United States to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace  agreement, the government has launched a program to map out  concrete measures to settle this matter by taking it into the  frame of the North-South Basic Agreement officially signed  between the North and South on 14 December 1991.    A high-ranking government official on 8 May disclosed: "The  majority opinion in relevant government officials and civilian  experts holds that in the event that North Korea attempts to  cripple the Military Armistice Committee or the Neutral Nations  Supervisory Commission, their function could be transferred to  the North-South Joint Military Committee stipulated in the  North-South Basic Agreement."    It was also learned that the government has devised a plan  to  push ahead with the adoption of a separate agreement or a  protocol between the North and South if North Korea insists on  the legal termination of the state of armistice.    It was learned that even though there is no need to fully  confront the North's attempt to unilaterally reduce the  agreement to a scrap of paper, the government is studying ways  to propose inter- Korean dialogue so as to discuss the system of  North-South Basic Agreement.    As regards to this, the Foreign Ministry on 5 May held a  first round of meetings in the presence of Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, and major  high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials. On 7 May, a second  round of meetings was held to analyze North Korea's intent and  discuss ways to counter it. Those who participated in the second  round of meetings were Kim Kyong-won, former ambassador to the  United States; Kim Tal-chung, professor of Yonsei University;  Shim Song-pyong, professor of Kyonghui University; Yu Pyong-hwa,  professor of Korea University; Yi Sang-u, professor of Sogang  University; and Ha Yong-son, professor of Seoul National  University.    A high-ranking official who took part in the meeting said:  "Provision 5 in the first chapter of the North-South Basic  Agreement adopted in December 1991 stipulates that the North and  South should exert joint efforts to replace the present  armistice state with the state of peace and that the two sides  should abide by the present Military Armistice Agreement until  the state of peace is achieved," and added that "a dominant  opinion is that if the North-South Basic Agreement is invoked,  the present armistice state could be replaced with a peace  system."    The government plans to clarify its final stance after  studying measures mapped out by the Foreign Ministry at a  Unification and National Security Policy Coordination meeting.</p>

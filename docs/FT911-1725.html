			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Arbitrators cannot hear claim WORLD ERA Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: March 27 1991 AN ARBITRATOR'S jurisdiction on a reference asserting loss to charterers in their own right by shipowners' breach of charterparty, is limited to that cause of action; and he therefore has no jurisdiction to hear an amended claim arising out of a different cause of action in that the charterers claim as agents for loss suffered by their principals as a result of the same breach. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when making a limited declaration in favour of the plaintiffs, Leif Heogh and Co A/S, disponent owners of World Era, that arbitrators on a claim by the defendant charterers, Petrolsea Inc, had no jurisdiction to hear amendments to the Points of Claim in so far as Petrolsea claimed as agents for an undisclosed principal. He rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction on the ground that the amendments were time-barred. HIS LORDSHIP said that a tanker voyage charterparty dated October 24 1980 between disponent owners of World Era and the charterers, was one of a tier of charterparties. The actual owners had chartered the vessel to the disponent owners on terms similar to those between the disponent owners and the charterers. The charterers subchartered the vessel on back to back terms. The charterers and sub-charterers were both subsidiaries of companies in the Marc Rich &amp; Co AG group. In November 1980 the vessel loaded cargo at two Gulf ports for carriage to ports in Italy and Sardinia, issuing bills of lading naming those discharge ports. After the vessel had sailed, the charterers ordered the vessel to discharge at Durban in South Africa. They contended that under their charterparty with the disponent owners they were entitled to give that order. The disponent owners passed on the order to the head owners who refused to accept it, and the disponent owners passed that refusal back to the charterers. The upshot was that the cargo was eventually discharged at Bonaire in the Caribbean. The charterers said that certain expenses had been incurred in supplying substitute cargo to South African purchasers. In 1981 arbitrators were appointed in respect of a claim by the charterers against the disponent owners for damages for breach of the charterparty in refusing the order to discharge in South Africa. Points of Claim were served in November 1984. They described the arbitration as between charterers as claimants and disponent owners as respondents; and referred to the charterparty an agreement between claimant charterers and respondent disponent owners. It was pleaded that by reason of the disponent owners' breach of charter in refusing to discharge at Durban, the claimants had suffered loss and damage and/or had incurred liability to indemnify the sub-charterers. The claim amounted to about Dollars 4,784. The disponent owners raised defences and counterclaims. In preparing their case as the years passed by, it occurred to those acting for the charterers that they might have difficulty in substantiating and proving their claim as alleged. The charterers discovered after all that time that they had not been contracting on their own behalf but on behalf of Marc Rich, a fact not previously disclosed. In March 1990 they sent the disponent owners draft amended Points of Claim. The amendments did not seek to alter the parties to the arbitration. They remained charterers as claimants and disponent owners as respondents. They did not alter the previous allegations with regard to the charterparty and the parties to it. However, they added an allegation that 'the charterparty was made by the claimants as agents for undisclosed principals, Marc Rich'. The damages claim was recast. It was alleged that the claimants 'and/or their principals Marc Rich' had suffered loss and damage and/or the claimants had incurred a liability to indemnify the sub-charterers 'and/or Marc Rich' in respect of loss and damage suffered by them. All the previous particulars were deleted. Allegations were substituted regarding Marc Rich's liabilities to a South African company, and the agency relationship. The final particular alleged in the alternative that if, contrary to the claimant's case, the claimants were not agents for Marc Rich, they were principals and the loss was suffered by them as such. On the present originating summons the disponent owners asked for a declaration that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to hear the amendments, on the ground that they were outside the terms of the reference to arbitration, or were time-barred. Section 5 of the Limitation Act 1980, and its predecessor in the 1939 Act, provided that an action founded on simple contract should not be brought after six years from when the cause of action accrued. By section 34(3) an arbitration commenced where the appropriate steps to appoint, or to require the appointment of an arbitrator had been carried out. The character of the time limit did not go to jurisdiction. It merely provided a defence to the claim. If the defence was disputed, as it was here, the arbitrators must decide it. It followed that in so far as the attack on jurisdiction was founded on time bar, it was misconceived and must fail. The disponent owners accepted that all the matters now within the amended Points of Claim could have been referred to arbitration by the charterers in 1981. They said they were not so referred. The cause of action on which the charterers relied in 1981 when referring the dispute to arbitration and appointing their arbitrator, was the disponent owners' alleged breach of charter in declining to deliver in South Africa. That was the original cause of action, in respect of which the arbitrators were appointed. Subject to one point it remained the cause of action which the charterers sought to enforce. No new breach of charterparty was alleged or relied on. That was sufficient to dispose of most of the points on which the disponent owners relied in their attack on jurisdiction. But, in one respect the charterers, although still putting themselves forward as the only claimant in the arbitration, did purport to raise a new or different cause of action. That was the allegation that they were entitled to recover not only in their own right, but in right of Marc Rich. In the clause pleading loss and damage, in so far as the charterers alleged that they had incurred liability to indemnify the sub-charterers and/or Marc Rich, those were matters properly pleaded and relevant to their claim. In so far as they also alleged that 'their principals, Marc Rich' had suffered loss and damage, the charterers were going beyond what they could claim by their asserted cause of action. To recover in the right of another was to assert a cause of action of that other person. Such cause of action had not been referred to prior to delivery of the draft amendments in 1990. On the face of it it was a new cause of action not included in the original reference. The only entity that had claimed arbitration and referred its claim to the arbitrators was the charterers. Marc Rich chose not to make a reference. All it had done was to cause its agents, the charterers, to claim in the right of Marc Rich. That was not permissible within the existing reference. In the absence of a further reference, that claim must be excluded. Once one had identified that a claim in the right of Marc Rich was not within the reference, questions of the extent of recovery to which the charterers were entitled in their own right, fell within the arbitrators' jurisdiction. In so far as the amended Points of Claim alleged that the charterers were contracting agents for undisclosed principals, that the principals suffered loss and damage, and that the charterers were entitled to recover damages in the right of the sub-charterers and Marc Rich, they made claims and raised disputes which had not been referred and which the arbitrators did not have jurisdiction to decide. For the plaintiff disponent owners: Bernard Eder QC and John Lockey (Sinclairs). For the defendant charterers: Michael Howard QC and Nigel Meeson (Clyde &amp; Co).</p>

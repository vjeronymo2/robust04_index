India has managed to get  significant concessions for the recently concluded Uruguay Round  of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations,  and the areas in which it will get the benefits are,  agricultural exports services, chemicals and pharmaceuticals  exports and even textiles.    This was disclosed by the Deputy Director General of GATT,  Mr. Anwar Hoda at a discussion on the Uruguay Round, organised  by Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies.    Mr. Hoda, who was formerly India's chief negotiator in the  Uruguay Round, however, said the country would have to make  major legislative as well as policy changes in order to fully  reap the benefits of the GATT agreement. For instance, the  Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act could be amended  to provide stricter norms for anti-competitive measures by drug  companies to allow easier recourse to competitive licensing.  Similarly, he agreed with the participants that a legislation on  plant breeders' rights would enable India to have greater  control in the area of gene patenting.    Clarifying several issues on intellectual property rights,  he  said that wide ranging policy changes would have to be made in  the field of patent laws. At the same time, drugs produced under  present patents would not be affected. The new regime would  apply only to drugs based on inventions made after the document  actually comes into effect in early 1995.    Certain areas, he said, had not been specified clearly.  "Public non-commercial production" of drugs, Mr. Hoda felt,  could be applied to pharmaceuticals distributed through  hospitals or public institutions. These areas would probably be  clarified in the coming months.    Giving a comprehensive picture of what he termed the "end  game" of GATT talks, Mr. Hoda said unilateral action was still  possible by countries such as India, in order to gain greater  benefits from the multilateral regime. But the U.S. would no  longer be able to take any action under the section 301 of its  Trade Act without reference to the newly created World Trade  Organisation which will probably be finally set up by January  1995. This follows ratification of the agreement by member  countries during 1994.    "Exports will go up:" On exports, Mr. Hoda was  optimistic that the country would increase its share of  agricultural exports substantially, owing to reduction in tariff  barriers. Wheat, rice and sugar are the commodities in which  India could be highly competitive in world markets, he felt. The  reduction of subsidies on the total volume of agricultural  exports would also help. For instance, with the total volume of  wheat trade ranging around 40 million tonnes, the reduction of  subsidised trade would be in the region of eight million tonnes,  thereby benefiting more efficient producers in developing  countries.    In chemicals, he said industrialised countries have agreed  to  harmonise tariffs and bring down the average tariff levels from  20 to 6.5 per cent. In pharmaceuticals, tariffs would be brought  down to zero, giving a substantial benefit to India which is  already exporting large quantities of bulk drugs.    Mr. Hoda said that contrary to public perception the Indian  delegation was able to make a major contribution to the final  agreement, greatly disproportionate to its 0.5 per cent share of  global trade. For instance, it was not widely known that it was  through the efforts of the Indian and Pakistan delegations that  the developed countries agreed to end the Multi-Fibre Agreement  and provide a specific transition period for phasing out of  quotas.    Even in services, the movement of personnel was brought into  focus by India, though the developed countries were only  interested in other areas. He said a thin wedge had been opened  to allow Indian personnel from consultancy and computer  companies to be transferred and located abroad. The Indian team  was also able to ensure that the differing airn of food  subsidies in this country, compared to the developed world, was  highlighted an recognised. Similarly, the import restrictions on  consumer goods owing to balance of payment difficulties was  accepted by GATT.    India also played a major role in ensuring that the three  agreements on TRIPS (trade related aspects of intellectual  property rights), goods and services were kept separate, he said.</p>

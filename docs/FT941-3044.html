			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Polisario snubs UN on W Sahara deal The Polisario Front which has been battling Morocco for the independence of the former Spanish colony of the Western Sahara since 1975, has rejected two United Nations options for a settlement and expressed strong reservations about a third. Last weekend, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, proposed three options to break a deadlock over the UN-sponsored peace plan, first proposed in summer 1991, for a referendum on the fate of the disputed territory. The first was to hold a referendum at the end of this year, irrespective of whether either side had agreed on those Saharans entitled to vote. The second was for the UN to drop the proposed referendum and withdraw most of its peacekeeping force. The third option would be for both parties to continue talking until the end of June in the hope of reaching a compromise. Polisario could not support the third option unless it was 'revised and reformulated'.</p>

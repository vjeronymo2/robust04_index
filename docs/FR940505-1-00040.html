			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, EPA is proposing to strengthen the recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for cars and light and medium duty trucks. Vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's recall responsibilities will be determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing the emissions performance of typical vehicles instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only vehicles which have been properly maintained. EPA is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to increase manufacturer's liability for repair of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle emissions control equipment. Both of these proposals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to provide incentives to manufacturers to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> durability of the emissions control systems in the vehicles they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce (III.D.2.d., Appendix I.A., and 40 CFR 52.2962).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also seeking comment on a program which would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that on-board diagnostic systems of new vehicles be capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control system. This approach would be intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly target high emitting vehicles, and would remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect for the life of the vehicle (III.D.2.d.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the South Coast, EPA is also proposing a requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain commercial vehicle fleets make the majority of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases from inherently low emitting vehicles (ILEVs), <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including, for example, natural gas and electric vehicles, 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52.2962.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Beyond very low exhaust emissions, these vehicles must have little or no evaporative emissions even when emissions control systems malfunction. In practice this means using fuel sources which have little or no evaporative emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For light-duty vehicles, EPA proposes to prohibit California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents from importing or registering vehicles purchased outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of California that are not certified to meet California's stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle standards. This prohibition would begin in 1999, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section III.D.2.h. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52.2964.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the level of emissions reductions necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate attainment in each of the three FIP areas, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is absolutely essential to propose an enhanced inspection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance (I/M) program for vehicles which meets national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance standards. As previously discussed, the structure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP proposal will follow EPA's model program. If the state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacts and submits approvable legislation and regulations for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own enhanced program which meets national performance standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will withdraw or rescind the FIP I/M program. This issue is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in more detail in sections III.D.1.b.(7).(a). and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.2.c. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 52.2963.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For heavy duty trucks, the FIP proposals include tighter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon (HC) and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exhaust standards for model years 1999 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond, strict evaporative HC standards to minimize shifting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel to gasoline beginning in 1999 as well, and a declining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  level for fleet operators beginning in 2000. Fees for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fleet emission averages above the declining NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  targets are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to help maintain turnover to the newer, cleaner engines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the option of the fleet owner, interstate trucks may comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with limitations on the number of stops allowed within FIP areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning in 1998 rather then complying with the declining NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. The heavy duty truck proposals are discussed in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.3. and the proposed regulations are in 40 CFR 52.2966.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, for the 1999 attainment date option in Sacramento,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to include an accelerated retirement strategy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-highway heavy duty engines. This accelerated retirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy is discussed in section III.B.3..  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Programs for nonroad vehicles and engines. EPA is proposing to regulate a number of categories of nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and equipment: Nonroad heavy duty engines, small nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, motorcycles and recreation vehicles, and marine engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See discussion in section III.D.4.(a)-(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For nonroad heavy duty engines (at or above 50 horsepower, 37  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kW), a phased approach would begin with a national program targeted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for final rulemaking in May 1994. In the next phase, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing additional standards for the FIP areas and increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers liability for repair of emissions control systems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help ensure continued low emission performance. An emissions-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based, fleet-average fee system with a declining emission levels is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for the FIP areas to maintain turnover to the cleaner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. For the 1999 attainment date option in Sacramento, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing a growth cap for the nonroad heavy equipment category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This cap is discussed in section III.B.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For small nonroad equipment (spark ignited engines at or below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25 horsepower, 19kW), EPA is proposing to employ a two-phased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy of first setting national standards for implementation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, and then employing negotiated rulemaking to achieve still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further reductions after 2000 or 2001. This strategy reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions already underway at the national level. The standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will propose in the first phase will be similar to the State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's regulation for utility and lawn and garden equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines manufactured in 1995 and beyond. In both phases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of this action will be to extend regulations to engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which California is currently pre-empted from regulating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (III.D.4.b.2.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FIP proposals include more stringent exhaust emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for motorcycles and recreational vehicles such as mopeds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and go-karts sold in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California after January 1996. The level of stringency may require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution of 4-stroke nonroad engines for some current 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications (III.D.4.c.(1).).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA is proposing to apply national emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, scheduled to be proposed in 1994 and finalized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 1995, to spark-ignited marine propulsion engines such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outboard engines, personal watercraft (``jet-skis,'' etc.), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sterndrive and inboard engines. These national rules will apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new spark ignition marine propulsion engines produced after August  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1998 and are proposed to be combined with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration/permitting and fee system for marine engine use in FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area waters. Marine engines meeting the new national standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be exempt from the fees which are proposed to begin in 2004  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (III.D.4.b.(3). and III.D.4.c.(2).). For the 1999 attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option in Sacramento, EPA is proposing a fee system or boating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restriction to reduce emissions from recreational boating by one-third.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alusuisse sells Lonza Graphites to Mircal Alusuisse-Lonza Holding, the diversified Swiss industrial group, has sold its Lonza Graphites and Technologies unit to Mircal, a subsidiary of Immetal of France. The price was not disclosed. Alusuisse said the unit did not fit into its core chemicals businesses of fine, speciality and polymer chemicals. Lonza Graphites, with a 1993 turnover of SFr57m (Dollars 44m) and gross earnings of SFr12m, makes synthetic graphites and lubricants for high temperature applications. Alusuisse is nearing completion of a radical restructuring programme involving the sale of loss-making and non-core activities. Lonza Graphites, which has two manufacturing plants in Switzerland, will be integrated with the industrial minerals division of Immetal, another diversified group with activities in building materials and metals processing. Last year Immetal recorded gross profits of SFr75m on turnover of SFr1.6bn.</p>

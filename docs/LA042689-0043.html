			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY IN KIDNAPING CASE  </P> <P> An 18-year-old man pleaded guilty Tuesday to assault with a deadly weapon in  connection with the abduction of a woman he thought had burglarized his  sister's Cal State Northridge apartment.  </P> <P> Christopher Daniels pleaded guilty to the lesser charge in exchange for  dismissal of attempted murder and kidnaping charges. Daniels, who was 17 at the  time of the incident, entered his plea in Sylmar Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> Daniels' 19-year-old sister, Christi, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Ceasar, were  also arrested in the Jan. 5 abduction of Czarian Ramsey, 18. Both pleaded  guilty to assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Christi Daniels was sentenced Friday to 300 days in County Jail. Ceasar was  previously sentenced to a year in County Jail.  </P> <P> Christopher Daniels, who was released from custody Tuesday, was ordered to  return to court June 28 for sentencing. His sentence could range from probation  to four years in the California Youth Authority, authorities said.  </P> <P> Christi Daniels had suspected Ramsey of burglarizing her campus apartment. She  said $17,000 in clothing, jewelry and other items had been taken.  </P> <P> Daniels, accompanied by her brother and Ceasar, went to Ramsey's Sherman Oaks  apartment to discuss the burglary. They then took Ramsey to a park-and-ride lot  in Newhall, where Ceasar held a gun to her head while Daniels continued to  question her about the burglary, authorities said.  </P> <P> Investigators said Ramsey told them she believed that she was about to be shot  when sheriff's deputies, on routine patrol, pulled up.  </P> <P> Ramsey has denied involvement in the burglary, which is still under  investigation, authorities said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Union enlargement issue remains  deadlocked. Britain's and Spain's disagreement with the other  Community partners over minority blocking rights continued after  another day of tense negotiations. The compromise proposals did  not work. The next attempt will be made at the weekend in  Greece.    [Brussels correspondent Julio Bernardez] The struggle of 10  versus two, or the minority blocking votes battle, is still a  draw. Nobody has changed their minds. And all are thinking  about a solution next weekend in Greece. However Spanish  Minister Solana is not optimistic at all.    The formal meeting lasted an hour and a half, the time  needed  for each to outline his position; a position that was already  known anyhow. Seeing the result, President Pangalos ended the  meeting amid general disappointment.    [Begin Javier Solana recording] Spain, as you know, is in  favor of enlargement. We are also in favor of finding a formula  in the institutional area which will protect our interests, with  an efficient mechanism that will work. That is what we have  stood for and that is the position we will continue to defend.  [end recording]    [Bernardez] Delors was disappointed and he has promised that  our country will see the fires of hell. France and Germany,  however, played a conciliatory role because they know that the  alternative is a serious crisis in the European Union.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Market cool on Time Warner deal SHARES in Time Warner, the US media group, fell yesterday morning despite an announcement late on Wednesday that Seagram, the Canadian drinks group, had spent some Dollars 700m to acquire a 5.7 per cent stake in the company 'solely for purposes of investment'. Seagram, in filings with US regulators, sought approval to buy up to 15 per cent of Time Warner's outstanding shares. The news came after the New York Stock Exchange closed on Wednesday, and had been widely expected to boost Time Warner's price, which fell instead on profit-making. At lunchtime, it was quoted at Dollars 37, down Dollars 1. Some analysts tracking the mysterious buying of Time Warner stock said the identification of Seagram as the purchaser was anti-climactic, since it seemed an unlikely bidder for the company. The 21.12m shares so far acquired were bought in a series of open-market purchases from February 2. Mr Edgar Bronfman, Seagram chairman, said he believed media and entertainment was one of the great growth sectors for the 1990s. Time Warner was the company best positioned to benefit from growth in the field, he said.</p>

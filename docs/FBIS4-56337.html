			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the Justice and Labor Ministry by Anibal Gomez </F> -- live]    [Excerpt] [Gomez] Yes, Mr. Nielsen, a meeting between  Interior Minister Carlos Podesta and the justice and labor  minister has just ended. Mr. Interior Minister, what can you  tell us; is there something new?    [Podesta] We have been looking at the information the  justice  and labor minister has received on all the firms and companies  throughout the country and we have seen that more than 75  percent of all companies throughout the country are working  normally. This is very positive because it means that most  companies have respected the rights of both those who wanted to  strike and those who did not.    [Gomez] Is this information objective, Mr. Minister?    [Podesta] Let us not waste any time.    [Gomez] I am asking you this question because the union  leaders are saying something else...    [Podesta, interrupting] That is all right, but your question  is...[pauses] You have my report and I will not start casting  doubts on my own report.    [Gomez] What is your objective, Mr. Minister? Are you trying  to say the strike was not successful?    [Podesta] That is really irrelevant. The objective is to  take advantage of the news media's goodwill and work to keep the  people informed.    [Gomez] What will be the result of all this, and what will  be  the government's reaction to this?    [Podesta] Nothing will come out of this, and the strike is a  very important event. The union leaders and the people who have  supported the strike have had the opportunity to exercise their  right to demonstrate and those who do not agree with them are  working normally.    [Gomez] Mr. Minister, although we already have official  information on this, it is somewhat frightening to know that  these tanks are ready to move in if the National Police were to  ask...    [Podesta, interrupting] I cannot believe that you can be so  biased, even though your medium is on the side of the strikers  and I have noticed that you journalists are wearing T-shirts  supporting the strike. Even so, I do not believe you can be so  biased not to realize that union leaders and strikers have been  aggressively trying to hamper transportation, to prevent  downtown stores from opening, to close streets. Well, if one  looks for something one is bound to find it. The state will not  give up its right nor will it fail to do its duty to preserve  public order. That is all there is to it.

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;  </P> <P> YOUTHFUL GERMAN QUARTET SPARKLES ON A SOVIET GEM  </P> <P> Though the program book was not emblazoned with the now-familiar red logo of  the San Diego Soviet arts festival, Saturday evening's Auryn Quartet concert at  UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium did feature a minor treasure of the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The youthful, visiting ensemble from Cologne, West Germany, opened the 15th  season of UCSD's chamber music series with a compelling performance of Alfred  Schnittke's Third String Quartet.  </P> <P> Born in 1934, Schnittke is considered one of the leading Russian composers from  the generation after Shostakovich. At last year's Soviet arts festival in  Boston, Schnittke's Requiem Mass for chorus and orchestra was one of the major  musical performances of that cultural exchange. This UCSD event was not part of  the current Soviet Arts festival, but the performance of Schnittke's work  expands the festival's portrait of contemporary Soviet music.  </P> <P> Schnittke's three-movement quartet, written in 1983, revealed that the composer  is keenly aware of trends in Western European composition. Although his idiom  is demanding, it is not daunting. Like Western composers who have taken their  cues from Edgar Varese, Schnittke values sound for its own sake and tends to  use sonic clusters as motivic building blocks.  </P> <P> Though this approach made the Third Quartet's droning, modal first movement  seem unusually static, the rest of the work was replete with contrasting ideas  organized by a recurring dissonant chorale theme. The composer even included an  agitated, highly motoric section that sounded like an homage to Shostakovich.  If Schnittke's structure was elusive on a first hearing, surely his dense  concentration of feeling was unmistakable.  </P> <P> The Auryn Quartet (violinists Matthias Lingenfelder and Jens Oppermann, violist  Steuart Eaton and cellist Andreas Arndt) followed the usual practice and  surrounded this unknown contemporary work with two familiar offerings,  Beethoven's A Major Quartet, Op. 18, No. 5, and his F Major Quartet, Op. 135.  Neither performance shed new light on these works, although the A Major Quartet  was notable for unusually clean delineation and a sunny balance among the  players. Beethoven's Op. 135, however, received a perfunctory and sometimes  ill-tuned reading.  </P> <P> All that jazz. Although the surprises in the world of music resulting from  glasnost cannot compete with the startling political events unfolding in  Eastern Europe, they are worth noting. Tonight at Elario's in La Jolla, two San  Diego Symphony guest soloists in town for the Soviet arts festival will hold a  unique jam session. Russian pianist Nicolai Petrov and U.S. clarinetist Richard  Stoltzman will play a program of American jazz for 150 friends and supporters  of the symphony.  </P> <P> These two soloists can be heard in their usual context Nov. 2-3 at Symphony  Hall, when Petrov will play the West Coast premiere of Rodion Shchedrin's  Second Piano Concerto and Stoltzman will perform American composer John  Corigliano's 1977 Clarinet Concerto.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Batting 0 for 2. The San Diego Symphony has not been having any luck thus far  importing guest conductors for the Soviet arts festival.  </P> <P> Last week, Soviet conductor Evgeny Kolobov failed to show for the orchestra's  "Alexander Nevsky" production. Now this week, Soviet conductor Pavel Kogan  canceled his Nov. 2-4 symphony concerts on account of illness.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Jansoug Kakhidze, San Diego Opera's guest conductor for its "Boris  Godunov" production, was able to fill in for Kogan on short notice. One of the  featured works on Kogan's program is Rodion Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto,  a work performed only a few times in this country. In an interview before  "Boris Godunov" opened, Kakhidze noted that he was well acquainted with  Shchedrin's concerto, and in fact had conducted it last year in Boston as part  of that American city's Soviet arts festival. Kakhidze, creative director and  principal conductor of Georgia's Tbilisi State Opera Theatre, received high  accolades for his conducting of the San Diego Opera orchestra in "Boris  Godunov." Local culture vultures eagerly await Kakhidze's symphony debut here.  </P> <P> Music and the future. In the 19th Century, Richard Wagner immodestly claimed  that he was composing the music of the future. Since Wagner's time, most  composers have been content to write for their own era. UC San Diego's Center  for Music Experiment, however, regularly works on the frontiers of tomorrow's  music.  </P> <P> Much of the center's current research will produce the next generation of  musical computers, according to F. Richard Moore, the center's director.  </P> <P> "These will be the first computers to have their musical capacity built in  rather than added on," explained Moore, who will lecture on these new  electronic tools and on the related topic of psychoacoustics (the perception of  sound) at the La Jolla Athanaeum Nov. 6 .  </P> <P> "Technology in Music and Art," the La Jolla library's current lecture series,  began last night with a lecture by UCSD's Pulitzer Prize-winning resident  composer Roger Reynolds. One of the founders of the center, Reynolds has  composed many of his works using the center's computer facilities. On Nov. 13,  UCSD art professor Harold Cohen will talk about his computer-collaborated  artwork, and all three men will participate in a panel discussion on Nov. 20.  </P> <P> According to Moore, in the last decade -- he came to the center in 1979 -- the  most significant thing researchers have learned is how little they really know  about musical processes.  </P> <P> "At one time, it was common wisdom that, by analyzing the works of great  composers, we could get a computer to write, say, Beethoven's 10th Symphony.  This was one of many early misconceptions," Moore said. He further noted that  breaking down seemingly simple musical expressions into the requisite series of  step-by-step instructions needed for programming computers has usually turned  out to be much more complex than originally thought.  </P> <P> Though he was a composer before he became the center's director, composing has  taken a back seat to his research and administrative chores. Moore now  describes himself as a musical engineer, a term Wagner probably never  contemplated when he was looking into the music of his future.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of </F> the Russian Federation, by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent  Dmitriy Makarov: "An Optimist in a Sea of Pessimism"]    [Text] [Makarov] Many Russian politicians and political  scientists are filled with gloomy predictions today. Production  is declining, inflation is on the rise, ethnic conflicts are  raging on Russia's periphery, and conservatives have come to  power in the Russian Government. Tell me, how do you see  Russia's immediate future?    [Rybkin] I would call myself a cautious optimist. Yes, of  course, the crisis is all-encompassing, and it will not be easy  to overcome it, but it seems to me that we have reached a point  where people have begun to understand not only down below but  also here, in the upper echelons of power, that a creative  principle and national accord are more important than anything  else. This is the main source of my optimism.    The most important thing that distinguishes the present  government and parliament from those that existed before October  of last year is that they are prepared and have already begun to  work together. This has always been difficult, but today the  absolute majority of those who have left the government at  various times are working in the State Duma and the Federation  Council. They or people with similar convictions are working  today in key posts of committees and commissions of parliament.    Leaders of the Duma and the government have just prepared a  consolidated report on the condition of the country's economy.  In the next few days it will be submitted for parliamentary  hearings.    [Makarov] I am very much afraid that words about working  together, although they sound very nice, will end up as  meaningless noise. The government, without asking anyone, has  already allotted a trillion for agriculture. You and I are well  aware that this money will immediately end up on the stock  market, because you cannot obtain from the land such gigantic  profits as you can on the stock market playing the game with the  rise of the exchange rate of the dollar. The money simply will  not make its way to the peasants, and the Russian economy will  follow the path of the Ukrainian.    [Rybkin] Your misgivings are quite justified. We must not  turn Russia into a universal social security department....    [Makarov] But what if the government does this without your  permission?    [Rybkin] The Duma has a powerful means of control--the  budget. Gathered together in the budget committee are the most  powerful economists and financial experts, who belong to various  factions--M. Zadornov, A. Pochinok, G. Kulik. Like many of my  colleagues, I am categorically against thoughtlessly pumping  money into the economy, and therefore the budget will be fairly  austere. The budget is the law for the government, and in order  to monitor it an Accounting Chamber has been created, in which  530 people will be working. In the near future Duma organs will  be able through their own committees to monitor the granting of  credit precisely for the final result.    [Makarov] According to the Constitution, you have to give  your consent for the appointment of a prime minister. But for  Chernomyrdin the consent was given by the Congress of People's  Deputies, and for some reason they did not ask for your consent,  even though almost the entire government changed.    [Rybkin] It was explained to us that this was a  reorganization, and not a change of the cabinet. We must not get  ahead of ourselves. We must wait until 18 February, when the  president delivers his message in the Duma.    [Makarov] I am afraid that even having control over the  government will not do much. The power is gradually making its  way to the bureaucrats, who are answerable neither to the  parliament nor to the government.    [Rybkin] It only seems that way. I am convinced that the  power is indeed trickling away. But not from the government into  the presidential structures, but from the center to the regions.  And thank God. But we need a clear-cut delimitation: What part  of the authority should go to the regions so that they will eat  better and not suffer from indigestion, and what should remain  at the federal level. This has not been done so far.    Additionally, all three branches of power must be clearly  separated: Who should be in charge of what. A bureaucrat who has  gotten out of control is transformed into a power in his own  right.    We have the advantage over the other power structures that  our discussion of candidates for any post is public. We form  public opinion. And the further we go, the more strongly its  voice will be heard. Today, perhaps, a person who has no use for  the parliament will achieve local success, but ultimately he  will meet with defeat, immense and all-destroying. It is no  accident that promising young politicians have gone to the  Duma....    [Makarov] They are preparing a place in case Chernomyrdin  does not accept them into the government.    [Rybkin] Not only that, but there is undoubtedly an element  of horse sense here. Just look at what kinds of people have  gathered here! They are highly intelligent and purposeful. They  are vitally interested in raising the status of the Duma.    [Makarov] You have said that bureaucrats must be under  control, but the Federation Council is made up of provincial  bureaucrats in the absolute sense. How can they be controlled  locally if the Federation Council is the supreme power in the  country? That would be the worst version of the Supreme Soviet.    [Rybkin] I will not deny that I am apprehensive about this.  But I will say something else too. Be that as it may, all of  them have passed through the filter of the elections. That was  not easy. Along with leaders of the regions, there are also  people who hold insignificant positions or no positions at all.  And still their high potential for reform was observed in the  elections. And you know that in any assembly at least 10 percent  of the people are the most powerful irritant. And in the  Federation Council there are plenty of these irritants on both  the left and the right. It will not be easy for a bureaucrat to  remain a bureaucrat there. He will have to think on the scale of  the state.    [Makarov] Ivan Petrovich, the Army is causing a very great  deal of uneasiness. With relatively small salaries, they still  are not paid for several months at a time. Someone in the  Russian leadership is persistently playing with fire. Can you  make an official statement regarding this?    [Rybkin] I am very familiar with this problem; my brothers  are serving in the Army. At the session of the State Duma on 4  February, we heard a promise from the finance minister and  chairman of the Central Bank to immediately rectify the  situation that was created. I personally will monitor its  implementation.    [Makarov] Have you met with the president since you were  elected to the post of chairman of the State Duma?    [Rybkin] Three times. One meeting was during our trip to St.  Petersburg for the 50th anniversary of the breaking of the  blockade, and we took two business trips. I have had a detailed  exchange of opinions with the president regarding the entire  range of issues we have just discussed. Ultimately, we arrived  at the conviction that we have similar views regarding many  issues.    [Makarov] Tell me, cross your heart, do you still consider  yourself a communist?    [Rybkin] Well, what is a communist? In 1918, when we adopted  the new name for the party, it was a time of militant communism.  Then everything really was shared equally, in a communist way,  in both the country and the city. In a state of euphoria over  the civil war, we departed from social democracy. During the  years of the NEP [New Economic Policy] we returned to it again,  but later we tried to prolong the condition of military  communism again. And we experienced severe disturbances because  of this.    Things are now such that we must get away from all nicknames  and titles as quickly as possible and not look back. Someone put  it well: We are walking backwards, and it is very dangerous that  way. People who call themselves members of the Russian Communist  Party today are hardly communists in essence. After all, they  have included in their program a diversity of forms of  management and their equality under the law. Today in the Duma  there are entrepreneurs and bankers in the communist faction. In  the agrarian faction there are farmers, bankers, lawyers,  economists, and even anticommunists. Actually, many of the  former labels are simply obsolete.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS aluminium agency makes contact with EC INTERCOMALUM, THE organisation set up last month to promote and defend the aluminium industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States, has made its first contact with the European Commission. The commission is being urged by European producers to impose draconian quotas on CIS aluminium imports and is inquiring into the complaints under rules that allow measures to 'safeguard' European Community industries. Mr Elliott Spitz, a vice chairman of Intercomalum and also a director of AIOC Corporation, the New York-based trading company, said it was believed this was the first time that there had been contact between the CIS aluminium industry and the Brussels-based commission. It was hoped that there would be regular discussions between them from now on. A commission official confirmed that lawyers representing Intercomalum had made contact with its delegation in Moscow. 'It is up to them to take the next steps,' he added.  -------------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS        (As at Monday's close)  ------------------------------------- tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium  +6,125 to 1,791,325 Copper     +3,175 to   403,475 Lead         -275 to   251,025 Nickel       +474 to    91,980 Zinc       -3,425 to   644,775 Tin           +80 to    20,475  -------------------------------------</p>

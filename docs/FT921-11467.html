			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Appointments: Pretty leaves Budgens Graham Rigby, one of the management troika brought into Budgens by unhappy institutions at the end of last April, becomes group finance director following the resignation yesterday of Derek Pretty. Rigby, 50, a chartered accountant previously at Dunlop and BTR, joined the board of the small food retailer - one of the pioneers of Sunday trading - as executive director in charge of distribution. 'Now that I think we have made headway on that side, I am returning to my own discipline which is finance,' he says, adding that he will retain responsibilities for distribution. Pretty, 44, had been in the post only a year when chief executive John Fletcher was ousted by a group of shareholders. Pretty says that while the new chief executive John von Spreckelsen asked him to stay, he found his own position gradually squeezed; Christian Williams, who also joined in April, was running the treasury and Rigby began to take on more of the financial controlling tasks. 'I knew it would be a difficult job when I joined - although maybe I didn't foresee how difficult,' says Pretty. Rigby, who is English, is surrounded by a cosmopolitan team. Von Spreckelsen is German, and had just turned round the troubled German retailer Kafu Wasmund before he arrived at Budgens. Williams, who possesses dual English and Danish nationality, worked with von Spreckelsen on the Kafu enterprise.</p>

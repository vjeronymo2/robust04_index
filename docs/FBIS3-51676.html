			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diego Fajardo; from the "NTC" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] Military troops rescued this morning Dr. Carlos  Upegui Zapata from his captors, who were holding him in a hilly  area between the Municipalities of Viani and Chaguani,  Cundinamarca.    Carlos Upegui Zapata has lived the worst five months of his  life in these hills. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  [FARC] guerrillas had kept him moving constantly, always in the  mountains between the Cundinamarca Municipalities of Viani and  Chaguani. The operation that freed him began at 0550.    [Begin recording] [Fajardo] How were you able to rescue the  doctor alive, considering that he was in, practically speaking,  a guerrilla hideout?    [Unidentified speaker] Due to the way the operation was  organized and due to the energy and aggressiveness the soldiers  exhibited. [end recording]    One of the guerrillas died in the house in which Upegui was  hidden; the others fled when they noticed the soldiers' presence.    The people of the area say this is an area of working  peasants and that they did not know anything about the presence  of guerrillas or kidnapped individuals. [passage omitted]</p>

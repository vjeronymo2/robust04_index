			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the NATO decision to positively respond  to request by the UN secretary general concerning the use of  NATO air forces for the protection of safe havens in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haris Silajdzic, head of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina government, has sent a letter to NATO  Secretary General Manfred Woerner, in which he says:    The NATO decision to positively respond to the request by  the  UN secretary general concerning the use of NATO air forces for  the protection of the safe havens in Bosnia represents  significant progress that will improve the safety of the  civilians exposed to aggression from Serbia and Montenegro and  lead to serious (?negotiations). On the other hand, Gorazde  needs measures that should be taken immediately to save the  children, women, and men exposed to intensive fire. Many of  them were forced to come out in the streets with choking gas and  irritants, and then massacred with mortar and sniper fire. As  of yesterday, the aggressor forces have been using  surface-to-surface missiles, which have devastating effects.  Allow me to remind you that nearly 80,000 people have been  forced to go to a very small area. They represent an easy  (?moving, target) [words indistinct]. Your excellency, the  bloodshed must immediately be stopped with all available means.  I am sure that your organization will take action (?in the name  of humanity and justice) without delay. The mass killing of the  innocent civilians of Gorazde must stop.    This was stated in a letter which Haris Silajdzic has sent  to  Manfred Woerner.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / State labs expected to close STAFF AT Warren Springs Laboratories are expected to be told today that closure of almost all of the government research centre is likely, according to union officials, Bronwen Maddox writes. Mr Jim Magee, national officer of the Institution of Professional Managers and Specialists, said last night that Mr Douglas Cormack, the laboratories chief executive, had told officials yesterday that the 'preferred option' was the merger of about a third of the activities with other laboratories and the closure of the rest. Warren Springs, which has about 265 staff, is one of the DTI's five laboratories, and is mainly engaged on environmental and energy research. The DTI said last night 'no firm decision' had been made.</p>

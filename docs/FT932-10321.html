			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / China likely to cool economy: The fears of a repeat of the boom and bust cycle THE SENIOR Chinese official chose his words carefully, avoiding expressions such as credit curbs and import restrictions, but his meaning was clear: China is, belatedly perhaps, seeking to cool its overheated economy. 'Although the credit situation in China is tolerable we shall try to exercise greater control so as to avoid a repetition of the sort of the situation that occurred in the late 1980s,' Mr Wang Zhongyu, director of the newly established State Economic and Trade Commission, told reporters. This was the most explicit public signal in recent months that the authorities are intent on calming the economy, although fear of a return to the 'boom and bust' cycle of the 1980s is encouraging caution. Mr Wang complained of excessive duplication in some manufacturing industries. China's economic boom was also placing an intolerable strain on the country's infrastructure. He also made it clear much stricter controls would be placed on fixed asset investment to curb its astonishing growth of 70 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the corresponding period last year. 'No country can give carte blanche to investment. Every country needs a quota for its fixed asset investment. . . so we shall try to exercise more effective control,' he said. Western economists, who have long been arguing that China's spectacular growth rates - 14 per cent for the first quarter on top of 13 per cent last year - are unsustainable, believe that the main issue for the country's economic managers is whether, in their efforts to 'fine tune' the economy, they can avoid a 'hard landing'. China's increasingly complex economy, in transition from rigid state control to a market-oriented system, will not prove easy to calm without resort to the tough administrative measures employed in the past. Yet these are the very devices the authorities wish to avoid in this latest phase. In the 1988 boom economic growth reached 12 per cent and urban inflation exceeded 30 per cent, prompting a panicky administration to institute savage credit curbs. Mr Wang made it plain that a more rigorous approach would be applied to granting credit, and priorities would be re-ordered. Preference would be given to what he described as 'basic industries' such as transport and energy in an effort to redress one of China's most critical problems. Mr Wang, regarded as a reformist and thus close to Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier and China's 'economic czar', said the economy was 'quite healthy' but expressed concern about urban inflation, which reached 15.7 per cent in the first quarter. He attributed the rise in retail prices both to the lifting of controls on prices of some commodities such as grain, and also to excessive demand due in part to the explosion in fixed asset investment. Steel prices, for example, have gone through the roof. State-owned enterprises are among the main culprits of the fixed asset binge, and the most wasteful. The state sector recorded losses equivalent to Dollars 76bn (Pounds 48bn) in 1992. The Chinese official gave no indication that more strenuous efforts might be made to restrain growth in the money supply which, according to the broader M2 measure, charged ahead by 30.6 per cent last year and continued in similar vein in the first quarter; but he did hint at possible interest rate increases to cool activity. Mr Wang gave no indication what steps, if any, might be envisaged to stabilise China's exchange rate. The local currency is continuing to depreciate. The import surge, accompanied by a deterioration in China's trade balance, spells further trouble for the yuan, which is now in sight of 10 to the US dollar on the 'grey market' compared with an official rate of 5.7 and a 'swap market' rate of about 8.5. China's official growth targets for this year, spelt out at the recent National People's Congress, or parliament, are between 8 and 9 per cent. However, with growth exceeding 14 per cent, a figure of 10 per cent seems more likely, unless the authorities lose their nerve and decide a harder landing is necessary.</p>

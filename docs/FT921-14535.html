			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Takeover Panel chief will be ally of industry MRS FRANCES HEATON, the first woman to be appointed director-general of the Takeover Panel, said yesterday she intended to give more weight to the views of industrial and commercial companies. Mrs Heaton, a corporate finance director of investment bankers Lazard Brothers, will take over as director-general on March 11. She said one of her main objectives was to ensure that all interested groups were involved in the formulation of views on takeover policy. That would involve 'not just the practitioners, who are the intermediaries, but also their clients'. She added: 'There has been quite a heavy weighting on the City side of the panel in the past.' The panel had already moved to represent industry's views better by providing for the appointment of three senior industry figures to advise it, she said. Mrs Heaton, 47, who joined Lazards in 1980 after a 10-year career at the Treasury, has advised on privatisations while with the bank. She has also advised property groups including London and Edinburgh Trust and the group seeking to develop London's County Hall. Her experience of contested takeovers includes Hanson's bid for London Brick and TSB's for Hogg Robinson. Observer, Page 18</p>

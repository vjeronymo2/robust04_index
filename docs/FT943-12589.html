			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Railtrack defiant on strike-day services Rail users can expect a slightly better service during next week's 48-hour stoppage than during last week's one-day strike, Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for the railway infrastructure, said yesterday. Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, was questioned by the Central Rail Users Committee, the official watchdog of rail travellers, at a scheduled meeting in London where he expressed little optimism for a quick resolution of the signal workers' dispute. He said: 'We are anticipating that we should be able to provide a very similar, if not improved service.' Mr Ellis said 30 per cent of the normal weekday rail network would be available during the strike period, which begins from noon next Tuesday. This will mean about a quarter of normal weekday trains operating, although a number will be special shuttle services with less capacity than usual. He hinted that contacts had been established between Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary. He said: 'I personally have not had contacts with him but there has been some initial contact with the new secretary of state.' There has been speculation about a breakthrough in negotiations next week. Mr Ellis, who did not rule out talks this weekend at Acas, the arbitration and conciliation service, said he could not say when the dispute would end. RMT, the transport union, wants an 'up-front' pay rise for past productivity improvements before it will agree to talks on restructuring signalling work. Railtrack wants a binding agreement on such discussions before it will talk about any such payment. On the safety of managers and supervisors operating signals during the strikes, Mr Ellis said: 'There is absolutely no compromise on safety. I deplore what RMT have been doing in raising totally unnecessary fears about this issue.' The Health and Safety Executive confirmed that its inspectors had made spot checks this week during the strike. The executive said: 'In none of these instances were there grounds for the inspectors taking enforcement action.'</p>

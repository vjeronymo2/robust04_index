			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Two ways to resolving the possibility of GATT failure Sir, The accounts you carry of the various contingency plans in the event of the multilateral trade system breaking down as a result of failure to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round are getting progressively more depressing; and now you report (Commodities and Agriculture, February 27) the prospect of 'hand to hand combat' between Europe and America. Less copiously reported, although diligently analysed by my colleagues Adrian Hewitt and Sheila Page, are the severely damaging consequences for developing countries if world trade is to break up into regional blocs. It is ludicrous that so much damage to the world economy should be triggered by a failure to reach a political agreement on agricultural protection in Europe and North America. There appear to be two main ways of resolving this. The best solution is clearly a political initiative at the heads of government level. The prime minister, when chairing the G7 London summit, undertook that leaders would knock heads together if the negotiations did not reach a prompt, and now overdue, Uruguay Round settlement. Election or no election, the time has now come for Mr Major to take action. The timing is no less felicitous for presidents Bush and Mitterrand, who are also confronting awkward electoral calendars. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks have now been going on for 5 1/2 years and action should be taken to agree a comprehensive settlement, based broadly on the present Dunkel draft, by the end of next month. If this proves impossible, the alternative solution (and one barely worthy of the term the second-best) was hinted at by Lord Trefgarne (Letters, January 10). Temperate agriculture could be dropped from the Uruguay Round and a settlement agreed forthwith on everything else. For those who profess to believe in an open trading system it is nonsense, of course, to leave agricultural production and trade outside the norms and rules of the GATT. But if such nonsense enables progress on other fronts it may be acceptable nonsense. Achievements on textiles, services, manufactures, and in instilling in scores of once defiantly protectionist developing countries the firm belief that they can benefit from free trade, are considerable and must not be put in jeopardy by politically-driven stubbornness of tragic proportions.

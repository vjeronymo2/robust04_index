			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: AF Bulgin losses increase to Pounds 212,000 Higher exceptional costs contributed to pre-tax losses increasing from Pounds 107,000 to Pounds 212,000 at AF Bulgin, the electrical components maker, in the year to January 31. Directors said that the year had been extremely difficult, but trading had improved in the first three months of the present year at all three sites. Two purchases had been made since the period end, with one already having an effect and the benefits of the other expected later in the year. Turnover was Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 12.2m) and losses were after exceptional costs of Pounds 141,000 (Pounds 71,000). Losses per share came out at 0.76p (0.4p) while an unchanged single final of 0.1p is proposed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The decision by the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) to quit the ruling coalition has  caused an impasse in the formation of a new Japanese cabinet  headed by newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    The SDP's decision is an angry reaction to the abrupt  establishment of a parliamentary group that excludes the  socialists.    In a statement issued after a meeting early today, SDP  Chairman Toriichi Murayamua said that the formation of such a  group infringed upon the relationship of trust among the  coalition parties.    The 130-member parliamentary alliance named "Kaishin"  (Renovation) includes the Shinseito Party, the Japan New Party,  the Democratic Socialist Party, the Jiyuto (Liberals) and  Kaikaku No Kai.    This new group will be the largest force in the coalition  and  will have more members than the SDP.    Hata earlier today invited the SDP to remain in the  coalition, while defending the formation of the parliamentary  group.    "Unless we have such a group, coalition parties will not be  able to cope with the difficult problems and act in solidarity,"  Hata said.    Several meetings were being held this morning to discuss the  situation after the SDP announced it was quitting the coalition.    Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday  afternoon has been postponed because of the delay in forming a  new government.    A large-scale reshuffling of the cabinet now seems  unavoidable since the SDP held six cabinet posts in former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Alarm over freeze on earnings cap - Pensions / The Budget and You / Industry sees it as the 'thin end of the wedge' IN A THROWAWAY line during his Budget speech, chancellor Norman Lamont announced casually that the earnings cap on pensionable income would be frozen next year, a tribute to the government's efforts in subduing inflation. No sooner were the words out of his mouth, however, than the pensions industry sounded the alarm. 'This is potentially a pernicious trend,' said Tina Norris, of actuarial consultant Noble Lowndes. 'The industry had originally wanted the cap to rise in line with earnings. Instead, it is rising in line with prices, which do not increase as quickly.' The fact that it has been frozen for a year has significant ramifications, both for occupational and personal pension-holders. The cap is critical because it is the ceiling beyond which earnings cannot count for pensions purposes and still attract tax relief on contributions. For most people, the present 1992-93 fiscal year cap of Pounds 75,000 sounds like a sufficiently healthy salary; and the anticipated Pounds 77,400 salary, which would have come into effect in the 1993-94 tax year had the freeze not been imposed, seems healthier still - although those earning close to the national average may well wonder why those on such handsome pay even deserve tax incentives to help them make pension provision. 'It's the fat-cat syndrome,' said the finance director at one of the UK's largest pension schemes. 'For most of the country, it doesn't matter tuppence.' With that comment in mind, it is not surprising that complaints about the earnings cap have come mostly from high-earning executives and those who organise schemes on their behalf. But Ron Amy, pension and benefits manager at Grand Metropolitan and chairman-elect of the National Association of Pension Funds, points out that a dangerous trend is underway. 'It's the thin end of the wedge,' he said. When the earnings cap was set originally, the ceiling was Pounds 60,000. Through retail price inflation, it has risen steadily over the past decade. But salaries have, historically, risen 1.5 to two percentage points faster each year than prices. As a result, what is considered a very generous salary now might not be so in 20 or 30 years when many pension scheme members are ready to retire. The cap could soon capture people on relatively modest incomes, Amy said. He added: 'Labour unions are starting to notice that a relatively young guy in his 20s now could well fall outside the cap by the time he retires.' That is not to say that well-paid people now are denied pension provision - expressed typically as a percentage of final salary - for income earned above the cap. They are simply not entitled to tax relief on contributions towards it. As a result, employers have set up so-called unapproved schemes. These do not have approval from the Inland Revenue and are, typically, unfunded. This means that no contributions are made into a pool: employers simply promise to meet pension costs above the cap out of current earnings. 'These offer a lot less security than funded schemes,' Amy notes. But pension experts point out the irony of the government's desire to cut tax incentives for pension provision at a time when it is looking at ways to encourage people to make greater provision for their own retirement. The cap affects personal pension-holders as well as occupational schemes. Personal pension-holders may earn tax relief on contributions on a sliding scale up to the cap, beginning at 17 per cent of salary for a person in his 20s and moving to 40 per cent for someone aged 61 and over. While only a small percentage of the population is likely to be able to devote 40 per cent of salary to pension savings, the ceiling could act as a deterrent - say, to a self-employed individual who had neglected to make pension provision early on in his career.</p>

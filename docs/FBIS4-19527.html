			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mysterious Death in Libya"] </F>   [Text] Being guessed at in the Federal Office for the  Protection of the Constitution [BfV]: How did a high-ranking  BfV official and his wife die in Libya? Silvian Becker, section  head of BfV Department 6 (international terrorism), died in a  military hospital in Tripoli the week before last. At the time  of going to press, details of the circumstances, including the  death of his wife, were still unknown to German officials; the  bodies had not yet been released by Libya.    Becker had told the BfV in Cologne that he was going to  Egypt  for a vacation. A passenger car, which had obviously been used  by the couple, was found undamaged in Tripoli. There is a basic  ban on travel to Libya for all BfV employees. The BfV is  wondering whether the tourists were kidnapped or enticed away  from Egypt. Relatives claim that the Beckers went to Libya  through Tunisia. The official was highly valued as an expert on  the Middle East and northern Africa. His colleagues describe him  as a "prudent man, and not an adventurous type." A double  agent? "Very unlikely, if you knew him," it is said in Cologne.</p>

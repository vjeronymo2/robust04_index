			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The Chinese may soon be getting a look at Madonna. Promoters are trying to  arrange a tour for the Material Girl this spring, which would make her the  first American pop star to sing in the People's Republic, China Youth News  reported. The newspaper said negotiations are under way between mainland China  promoters and agents in Hong Kong for the singer to arrange the tour. Last  year, Shanghai promoters were reported to be negotiating with agents for  Michael Jackson to arrange a tour for him but nothing came of it. ALEENE  MacMINN and Judith Michaelson  </P></p>

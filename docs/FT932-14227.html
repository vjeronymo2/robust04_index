			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Pint of view A conflict of political theology is coming to a head at the Department of Trade and Industry. Neil Hamilton, the free-market minister in charge of the government's deregulation initiative, is pressing for the abolition of regulations that insist a British pint of beer must be just that - exactly a pint. The froth cannot be included. Hamilton argues that drinkers know if they are getting short measures and can remove their custom. It is all unnecessary red-tape, he says. Enter Edward Leigh, industry minister and as much a Thatcherite as Hamilton. But the regulations on a pint of beer were largely his creation and a notable publicity winner for him back in December 1991. He is putting up a strong fight to stop Hamilton getting his way. Right arms they may be but cheers is not the word.</p>

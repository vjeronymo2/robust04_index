			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Boardroom shake-up at Arcon A boardroom row at Arcon International Resources, the Irish company in which Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz Foods, has a 23 per cent stake, has resulted in the resignation of Mr Richard Conroy as chairman and chief executive. Mr James Jones, director responsible for finance, and Ms Maureen Jones, responsible for administration and management, have also given up their executive functions but, like Mr Conroy, who founded Arcon, are staying on the board. Arcon said that it had been informed by the three directors 'of their declared inability to carry out their respective executive functions as, in their opinion, the company had unilaterally and wrongfully repudiated their contracts.' Mr Conroy said last night that for the past 2 1/2 years his executive functions were gradually eroded 'until it became a nonsense. In practice we were not observing any serious executive function.' He said he would consult his lawyers but 'I don't wish to harm the company I founded.' Mr Brendan Gilmore, who has been appointed chairman and chief executive, said he did not know why the directors had taken this action. 'We refute totally any allegations of constructive dismissal.' He said the one contentious issue between Arcon and Mr Conroy was the private company he set up last year and whether it was to become an exploration company. If it was, there would have been a possible conflict of interest. Mr Gilmore said Arcon was at an exciting and strenuous stage, and, once the directors announced last week they had given up their executive roles, the gaps had to be filled immediately. Mr Tony O'Reilly Jnr has been appointed deputy chief executive, Mr Gilmore's previous role. Arcon is preparing to start a Dollars 65m (Pounds 41m) lead-zinc mine at Galmoy in County Kilkenny, Ireland's first new base metals mine for 20 years. With his associates, Mr O'Reilly controls 29.9 per cent of the company while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish resources group, owns 21.6 per cent. Mr Conroy, with associates and family, owns about 5 per cent. Mr O'Reilly moved into Arcon, then called Conroy Petroleum, when it acquired his Atlantic Resources for Pounds 7.7m in 1992. Mr Conroy is also a professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin and an Irish Senator.</p>

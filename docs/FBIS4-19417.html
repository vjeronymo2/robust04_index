			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Madrid, April 14 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali said Thursday [14 April] he would "not  hesitate" to ask NATO forces to carry out new air strikes if UN  peacekeepers were endangered in ex-Yugoslavia.    The UN chief told a news conference: "We have the  responsibility to protect the security of our United Nations  troops in former Yugoslavia, and we will not hesitate to ask for  an air support in case that the security of the United Nations  forces, among which (are) Spanish troops, is in danger."    He spoke alongside Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana  after arriving here late Wednesday from Germany for a three-day  official visit.    Butrus-Ghali recalled that the UN Security Council had  unanimously approved Resolution 836, which constitutes the legal  basis for North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes.

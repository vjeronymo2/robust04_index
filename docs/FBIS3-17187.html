			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["F.O." report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Creation of </F> Financial-Industrial Groups Gets Moving"]    [Text] A session of the interdepartmental commission on  the formation of financial-industrial groups chaired by First  Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets has taken place in Moscow. One of  the men behind the idea of the formation of financial-industrial  groups in our country back in 1991 was Andrey Kokoshin, today's  Russian Federation deputy defense minister. In a commentary for  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Andrey Kokoshin pointed out that given  today's budget and financial crunch it is extremely important to  create financial-industrial groups. They may ease the pressure  on the federal budget. The establishment of  financial-industrial groups is one of the necessary conditions  for progress in capital investments in industry, for getting  industry circulating capital from budget funds. The formation  of financial-industrial groups as components of a market-based  economy depends in the first place upon the enterprises of the  defense complex which are becoming diversified. The most  probable potentially powerful financial-industrial groups, in  experts' assessment, are the Ilyushin Design Bureau and Voronezh  Aviation Plant.</p>

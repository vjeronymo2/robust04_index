Kine told TANJUG that those who would have to leave Germany  would be the nationals of Serbia and Montenegro (constituent  states of the F.R.Y.) who had failed to legally regulate their  stay in Germany. He said they were those who either had not  sought asylum or had been denied it, or had no other right to  stay any further in Germany.    The German authorities on Monday confirmed that they would  begin to expel Yugoslav nationals on Thursday. Kine added that  exempted from this decision were about 230,000 refugees with  Yugoslav passports from the ex-Yugoslav Republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    "For now, the refugees from the BiH (Bosnia-Herzegovina) are  to remain in Germany, while talks are in progress with Croatia  about the procedures regarding the return of its refugees," Kine  said. The German press, however, had announced that around  200,000 people carrying Yugoslav passports would be expelled.    This was practically confirmed by the Interior Ministry of  the state of North Rhine-Westphalia when it said that a first  flight with 160 expelled would leave Germany on Thursday for the  Romanian town of Timisoara, while more flights were scheduled  for March 17, 24 and 31. From Timisoara, the expelled would  travel by buses to the Yugoslav border.    On the list of those to be expelled, as was announced, the  predominant number (near under 95 percent) accounts for ethnic  Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija. The  expulsion of nationals with Yugoslav passports coincides with a  hunt against and arrests of Serbs in Germany over their alleged  war crimes in ex-Yugoslav territories.    In Germany, the decision on expelling Yugoslav nationals --  which appears to be, among other things, in the service of  political pressure -- had spurred on hardly any protest other  than that raised by the "Green" party.    Of the German papers, it was the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU alone  that commented on the decision on Monday, stressing that  "Germany's rush" to expel Yugoslav nationals was "shameful."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, June 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  will set up a group of experts to study slimming down  legislation holding back private initiatives, economic  development and job creation, German Finance Minister Theo  Waigel announced in Luxembourg on Monday [6 June].    EU finance ministers, meeting here, approved establishment  of  such a group, which will make proposals for simplifying EU and  national legislation, he said.    German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt had sent a  memorandum to other EU countries suggesting creation of a panel  of experts to study deregulation.    But European Commission President Jacques Delors strongly  opposed the idea at a finance ministers' meeting in Brussels on  May 16, giving rise to a lively debate between Delors and the  German ministers -- backed by British Chancellor of the  Exchequer Kenneth Clarke.    Germany wanted the experts group to be fully independent of  the Commission --but Delors thought that would mean entrusting  outside experts with decision-making power. The EU finally  decided that the experts could belong to the Commission or be  independent, and the group will meet under Commission aegis.    Its first conclusions are expected some time next year.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric will jointly develop with  Hitachi flash memory (read-only memory which can be  electronically erased and rewritten all at once) which is the  next-generation leading memory. They will employ the Mitsubishi  method in 16-megabit products and the Hitachi method in  64-megabit products, develop and sell uniform specification  products. The aim is to rival Toshiba which is leading the flash  memory market by tieups with U.S. and South Korean  manufacturers. Since Toshiba, Hitachi, and Mitsubishi are  respectively proceeding with development of unique methods with  different specifications for flash memory, making their own  method the de facto standard such as the format for VTR [video  tape recorders] has become a big task for survival in the  market. Various companies are competing furiously as they  consider flash memory the next big product after DRAM [dynamic  random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary  for memory storage operations). However, it smacks of just talk  in advance and there are some rather vague parts such as  realistically to what applications will it be most directed?  Moreover, viewed internationally, since the large U.S.  semiconductor manufacturer Intel now hold the greatest market  share, it seems a big task will be how to destroy the Intel  stronghold.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Leicht editorial: "Retaliation Is Not an Objective </F> of War"]    [Text] The horrendous pictures from Sarajevo make the war  in Bosnia omnipresent. The baseness of the perpetrators, the  excruciating pain of the victims -- they make the world succumb  to enormous rage, but rage that is at the same time helpless.  Helpless Rage? Yes, because the hope is deceptive that other  states could and will put an end to this war from the outside  and against the will of the three parties to the war -- the  Muslims, the Croats, and the Serbs in and around Bosnia.    Who could not understand that, in view of the terrible  massacres, more and more citizens and politicians demand action,  at least air strikes at the Serb artillery positions around  Sarajevo? If it was indeed the Serbs, who have those 68 dead  and more than 200 injured on their conscience. However,  retaliation -- no matter how vital and understandable the need  for it is -- is no motive for responsible military action.    Even in the storm of disgust and despair one cannot avoid  the  nagging questions that must be asked about the second and third  step that will follow the first: Who is the opponent? What  does one want and can one force him to do it definitely with  military means? Is success likely? What effort and sacrifice  would the fight cost? And can one politically expect one's own  citizens to accept these sacrifices because they are in the  interest of their state?    Many who are now calling for "just" air strikes on Serb  positions avoid these questions. Behind that there is the  double illusion that one can certainly do some good -- and worse  things will certainly not happen because of it.    A few air strikes -- everybody admits that -- can neither  end  nor shorten, nor really influence the war in Bosnia. It will  keep dragging on murderously, until one side wins, everybody is  exhausted, or political insight gains ground among all three  opponents at some time in the future. In the best case, the  atrocities will be committed differently and in different places  in Bosnia in the future, not so much in the limelight of the  media. Is this a serious objective of a war?    Everyone says that there is no real intention to wage war  there. In reality, however, something like "a little bit of war"  does not exist. The result that could be achieved at best with  surgical air strikes, namely pushing certain combat actions out  of the world's awareness, must be weighed against the danger of  escalating and expanding the war. If the international  community undertakes just one direct military intervention in  the Bosnia war, it makes itself, the United Nations, or NATO a  direct party to the war. The UN troops, who are stationed in  the country without heavy weapons to provide humanitarian aid,  would continue to be unprotected targets of the Serbs. And what  then: withdrawal of the UN soldiers, an end to humanitarian  aid, leaving the war to itself? Or more air strikes, or even  ground forces sent to Bosnia? There is only one military action  that rules out the risk of further escalation -- and that is  victory. Whoever does not want to fight to win, should keep his  finger off the trigger.    Whoever wants to intervene in this war -- and be it only  with  "surgical" strikes, as some people imagine -- must be absolutely  clear about the purpose and meaning of the entire operation.  However, there is no clear goal of war. For what does Europe  want to fight, for what should it fight in the Balkans? The  noble phrase that the West will not recognize any borders that  have been changed by force has long become an outdated, empty  shell. No one is willing and able to reestablish the status quo  ante, the starting position, by use of armed force and with  acceptable casualties. Should the international community  instead get entangled in fighting for some version of the plans  for division, which are pointless anyway -- or for the  difference between two of them? And with whom and whose  behavior should it take sides -- with the Muslims, the Croats,  and the Serbs, every one of whom is tactically superior in  another place and at another time? To all these questions there  is no clear answer to justify a serious military intervention.  Whoever, instead, starts some air strikes himself acts  dangerously on the basis of that helplessness that he allegedly  wants to fight.    In this situation the West can have only three goals:    First: Preserving its own security. It is not endangered by  the war in Bosnia. It is also absurd to claim that NATO's  credibility is at stake. As regards its actual purpose,  self-defense in the alliance, Bosnia has never called it into  question. If at all, Bosnia casts doubt on the credibility of  new out-of-area goals.    Second: Containing the Balkan conflict. This is difficult  but possible. However, it would be made more difficult by  direct intervention in Bosnia. It is very likely that the  Russians would leave the coalition in the UN Security Council.    Third: Continuation of humanitarian aid. This is possible  only if the aid workers are not turned into combatants or  hostages of the warring parties -- e.g. through pointless  military actions by the West.    This is truly no heroic program. However, it is much more  realistic than the heroism of some tactical air strikes without  a strategic goal. Such a concept cannot pacify Bosnia -- and  cannot satisfy the world. After the peoples' spring of 1989 the  world must again adjust to the terrible realization that peoples  also wage war -- and to how horrible wars are in detail; to the  fact that there are, by the way, conflicts where one can help  and those where one cannot even act as a balancing influence;  and, above all, to the fact that, before taking any action, it  must be carefully determined what kind of conflict one is  dealing with.    A terrible war is raging in the Balkans -- one of many that  we usually like to ignore. Europe is helpless. This is true --  and it is depressing. However, how helpless it is would become  completely obviously only when it engaged in a military  intervention in this war just for the sake of pretense. And  then, only then, would Europe bear its own guilt -- for this  helplessness and for this war.</p>

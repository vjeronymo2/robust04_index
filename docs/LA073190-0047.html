			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE ORCHESTRA OFFERS A LITTLE FLAIR AT ROYCE HALL  </P> <P> There were enough comings and goings, offstage peepings and beckonings,  unexplained bangs and creakings, and shtick with the physical properties at  Royce Hall Sunday evening for something by Feydeau. The official scripts for  the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute Orchestra, however, by Jacob Druckman,  Mozart and Shostakovich, were treated with becoming intensity and flair.  </P> <P> After a bit by Druckman and Institute director Lynn Harrell with a  malfunctioning public-address system, the comedy peaked in a routine for stage  crew and piano lid, with score by Mozart. As part of the lengthy reshuffling of  the stage between Druckman's "Aureole" and Mozart's E-flat Piano Concerto, K.  482, the lid of the piano was removed, much to the loudly muttered befuddlement  of soloist Yefim Bronfman.  </P> <P> Harrell dashed down the aisle to intervene, but after consultation Bronfman  decided to try the instrument as he found it. After the first movement, though,  Harrell insistently beckoned conductor Lan Shui and Bronfman over to the side,  and out came the crew with the lid, with more grumbling commentary from the  pianist.  </P> <P> The restoration of the lid did much to focus and clarify the instrument's  sound, and Bronfman worked out whatever feelings of persecution he may have had  in a chilly dissection of the Andante, followed by an athletically pointed  Rondo. Bronfman was originally scheduled to lead the orchestra from the  keyboard, but Institute fellow Lan Shui proved a valuable substitute on the  podium, guiding a reduced band in a mellow, pertinent accompaniment.  </P> <P> Druckman's "Aureole" is a colorful, percussion-rich soundscape from 1979, more  explosive than shimmering but also purposefully committed to clear linear  direction. William Eddins, an Institute associate fellow, maintained the  forward momentum inherent in the piece, eliciting crisp, clean playing from the  very full orchestra.  </P> <P> The only thing funny about the culminating Shostakovich Fifth Symphony was the  awkwardly wiggling podium dance it inspired in conductor David Alan Miller in  the Allegretto. His was a reading more convincing in suave, affecting lyricism  than poorly balanced thunder, encompassing a world of tragedy in his  dramatically articulated Largo.JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

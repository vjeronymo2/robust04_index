			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Clinton appoints housing chief PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton added two more members to his cabinet yesterday with the nomination of Mr Henry Cisneros, the former mayor of San Antonio, to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Mr Jesse Brown, director of Disabled American Veterans, to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mr Clinton also named Mr Herschel Gober, who is in charge of veterans affairs in his Arkansas cabinet, to be Mr Brown's deputy. Mr Cisneros, perhaps the US's most prominent Hispanic politician, faces a particular challenge at HUD. His predecessor, Mr Jack Kemp, has provided a vision of urban renewal in the wake of upheavals such as the Los Angeles riots, but is viewed in Washington as having only partly completed his department's overhaul after the scandals of the Reagan administration. Mr Brown, a 48-year-old former Marine, is expected to give particular emphasis to the concerns of Vietnam veterans, who have often felt the Veterans Administration was run largely in the interests of second world war veterans. Mr Clinton is expected to complete his domestic team soon. Mr Richard Riley, a former governor of South Carolina, may be named education secretary today.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Observer: Political loyalty Having an ex-chancellor on the board did not keep GPA out of the mire, nor has Lord Lawson's magic wand kept Barclays entirely free from trouble. So Observer wishes Sir Evelyn de Rothschild better luck with his decision to invite Norman Lamont back to his former employer. 'We are showing loyalty to someone who worked here,' says Sir Evelyn of the man who was employed in treasury and fund management at the bank from 1968-1979. Meanwhile, Sir Evelyn professes to be unruffled by any unguided missiles Lamont might launch on the fringes of the party conference, hence possibly endangering those close government links that are so valuable to merchant banks. 'He has more friends than people think,' says the chairman of NM Rothschild.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Parent likes the sound of the Detroit shuffle: Michael Skapinker and Ronald van de Krol explain the warm reception for PolyGram's purchase of the US record label To anyone over 30, PolyGram's artists roster contains some strange and bewildering talents, including Chaka Demus and Pliers, the Gin Blossoms, Boy Krazy and Positive K. The Dollars 301m purchase of Motown, the label which nurtured such names as Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and the Jackson Five, therefore comes as something of a relief. The markets thought so too. Following yesterday's announcement of the purchase, PolyGram's shares rose 6.4 per cent on the Amsterdam stock exchange to close at Fl 59.50. Philips, the Dutch electronics group which owns nearly 80 per cent of PolyGram, gained 4.8 per cent to Fl 32.60. PolyGram's 19 per cent rise in first-half net profits to Fl 204m (Pounds 71m) was also welcomed. Mr Hendrik Hijink, an analyst at Kempen &amp; Co in Amsterdam, said: 'A profit rise of nearly 20 per cent, particularly in difficult economic times, is fantastic.' The Motown acquisition is to be funded by the issue of 10m new PolyGram shares. The cash-strapped Philips will not take up any, reducing its stake to 75 per cent. The Motown purchase is part of a pattern of consolidation in the music industry, which has seen the disappearance of almost all the best-known independent labels into the industry's multinationals. PolyGram bought Island Records in 1989 and A&amp;M Records in 1990. Geffen, a US label, was acquired by MCA in 1990. Thorn EMI, the UK-based group, bought Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music last year. PolyGram has expanded furiously through acquisition over the past few years but Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, does not think there are any substantial music industry purchases still available. Apart from the Island and A&amp;M purchases, the group bought a 30 per cent stake in Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Holdings in 1991. PolyGram has also made film industry acquisitions, including Propaganda Films, makers of In Bed with Madonna, and Working Title, which made My Beautiful Laundrette. Mr Levy sees no immediate prospect of other film purchases. Most of the independent record labels accept that the large groups, with worldwide distribution networks, can give their artists better exposure. Mr Berry Gordy, who founded Motown in Detroit in 1959, said yesterday: 'The recorded music and entertainment industries - and the world for that matter  -are changing rapidly. Motown is ideally positioned to lead the multicultural, multimedia revolution that is under way.' Hopes for a multimedia revolution, in which consumers enjoy their music through a mixture of sound, pictures and screen-based text, still lie in the distant future as there are few signs so far that consumers will be prepared to invest in the necessary gadgetry. A more immediate prospect is that PolyGram will exploit Motown's extensive back catalogue and license its name to merchandise manufacturers. Mr Levy says the share issue necessary to fund the deal, will, by reducing Philips' stake, give PolyGram's shares greater liquidity and widen its shareholder base. These perceived advantages could also be seen as arguments for reducing Philips' stake still further, but Mr Levy said yesterday this would not happen for at least a year. Philips was also quick to dismiss speculation that it might sell a larger stake in PolyGram, which it brought to the Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges in 1989. Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' chairman, has pointed out that PolyGram is one of its most successful businesses, generating a stream of profits and dividends, and that he has no desire to forgo future profits. Philips said yesterday a slight dilution of its stake was acceptable because it enabled PolyGram to seize a rare opportunity to buy one of the world's best-known labels. 'We very much welcome this deal.' Divestments by Philips over the past three years of its minicomputer, defence electronics and telecommunications cables businesses have involved the sale of loss-making or barely profitable operations. Mr Hijink said: 'There is clearly synergy between Philips and PolyGram, unlike the other businesses Philips has sold.' Analysts believe Philips will remain keen to hold on to a large majority stake in PolyGram. Contributing to Philips' consumer products division, PolyGram represents the more lucrative 'software' side of the consumer electronics industry - compensating for losses in 'hardware' products such as compact disc players, televisions and video cassette recorders. PolyGram is also helping to promote the digital compact cassette (DCC), which Philips invented to replace conventional music tapes and to compete with the rival Mini Disc system produced by Sony of Japan.  --------------------------------------------------------- POLYGRAM  --------------------------------------------------------- Net income:               Income by geographic source (%) (figures in Fl m)                           1992     1991  --------------------------------------------------------- 1988:   262               Europe:             71       75 1989:   333               US/Canada:           7        2 1990:   357               Asia:               21       19 1991:   446               Other:               1        4 1992:   506  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

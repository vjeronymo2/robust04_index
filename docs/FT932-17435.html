			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London drivers may face road pricing LONDONERS could be charged for driving in the capital on a pay-as-you-go basis by the end of the decade, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday. The aim would be to tackle congestion by making people think twice before taking cars on the roads at busy times. The most likely system would require drivers to fit their cars with electronic meters at their own expense. The meters would clock up charges by communicating with roadside beacons. Drivers would pay by inserting rechargeable 'smart cards' into their meters at the beginning of each journey and the meters would deduct payments from the cards as journeys progressed. Drivers penetrating the charging zone without a functioning meter, or an equivalent device for visitors, would have their licence plates photographed and face punishment. The controversial plans emerged as the Department of Transport published the results of a study of road pricing technology by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Mr MacGregor said: 'We have to consider new ways of preventing road congestion in London from getting worse as car ownership grows. Charging drivers for using the capital's crowded roads is one possible solution.' No decisions would be taken until a three-year investigation into the options for road pricing in London had been concluded by the Department of Transport next year. The report says that although there is not yet a suitable road pricing system for the capital, the technology is moving fast. It concludes the political obstacles are likely to prove greater than the technological ones. A Review of Technology for Road Use Pricing in London.

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Several articles in recent issues of the  Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI have examined problems with the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's new dinar, the value of which  is supposed to be pegged to the German mark [DM]. A shortage of  the foreign currency that serves as the dinar's backing and an  abundance of dinars, combined with aggressive illegal money  markets, are eroding the new dinar's value. The "culprits" are  not only illegal street dealers, but also some legitimate  businessmen. The government is considering various remedies  ranging from a gold-backed dinar to arrests of currency dealers.  The paper indicates that the problem is widespread, occurring in  numerous cities in Serbia and Montenegro.    According to an article entitled "Dinar Being Tested" in the  10 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI, "the inability of the state to fight  successfully against the unregulated sale of hard currency is  due, first of all, to the fact that hard currency reserves have  been depleted and that the stabilization program started with  about DM300 million, an amount that was actually insufficient.  That much was purchased during the first two months of the  program, and since then demand has exceeded supply."    The shortage of hard currency, which undermines the new  dinar, is not caused by ordinary citizens, states an article in  the 9 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI. The main culprits are the private  dealers who line up daily at the banks to buy hard currency.  "Sales of marks and dollars by banks and exchange offices far  surpass purchases. `Agrobanka' of Podgorica, for example, sold  6,000 marks while it bought 800. The situation is similar in  other banks."    Dealers are playing for larger stakes on the streets,  reports  VECERNJE NOVOSTI on 5 April: "They don't bother with small  change any more. Now they offer 110 dinars for DM100, 1,200  dinars for DM1,000, and 2,500 `super' dinars for DM2,000."  Aggravating the erosion of the dinar and the depletion of hard  currency, the paper adds, are dealers from Bulgaria and Romania  who offer 1.2 to 1.5 dinars for a mark. The greatest damage is  done by large-volume dealers who work with tens and hundreds of  thousands of marks, according to a 6 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI  article, which reports that two groups of dealers were recently  arrested in Belgrade for transactions totaling DM750,000. Most  of these people are owners of businesses, the paper notes.    The article goes on to examine where all the dinars are  coming from. Milorad Vlakovic, director of Plevlje Bank,  believes that many dealers are buying marks for various  businesses, which thus convert their daily dinar profits into  hard currency. It notes that while such transactions may be a  major source of dinars, they are not the only ones. It cites a  TANJUG report that "yesterday morning in Podgorica, several  dealers had several thousand new dinars each. These dinars were  in their original bank wrappers, stacked according to their  serial numbers." The article adds that in Montenegro one type of  business takes a direct approach in collecting hard currency.  Service stations sell gasoline strictly for hard currency. This  is legal in Montenegro, and it forces many people to buy hard  currency in order to obtain gasoline.    An article entitled "It Costs Less in Marks" in VECERNJE  NOVOSTI of 10 April notes that many products sell on the black  market for as much as a 30 percent discount if they are paid for  in marks rather than dinars. These items include electronics  products, clothing, cosmetics, and some imported foods. The  article also reports on measures such as cameras in banks and  identity checks that are intended to prevent repeated purchases  of hard currecny by the same individuals. Such measures are  easily defeated, the paper observes; dealers simply send proxies  to the banks. The 9 April VECERNJE NOVISTI reports that banks in  the city of Zajecar have found a more effective way to avoid  depletion of their foreign currency supplies: They sell only as  much foreign currency as they buy.    The Belgrade Institute of Economy has proposed that the  National Bank of Yugoslavia introduce gold coins weighing four  grams and valued at 92 dinars as a way of reducing the number of  dinars in circulation, states the 10 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI  article. The institute has also proposed the introduction of  special-product bonds. To deny currency dealers access to dinars  intended for the purchase of the wheat crop, for example, bonds  redeemable for wheat would be issued. The paper concludes,  however, that in spite of the efforts to ensure the stability of  the new dinar, "bankers are already talking about devaluation."</p>

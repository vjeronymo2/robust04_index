			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY  </P> <P> "Hope and Glory" (1987), directed by John Boorman. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13.  War from the perspective of an awe-struck youth, a 7-year-old London boy  roaming like a terrier, sniffing out fresh shrapnel to add to his collection,  escaping his basement shelter to see the bombs exploding -- the best fireworks  ever.  </P> <P> Yet Boorman never turns war into something flip or trivial.  </P> <P> "Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An  Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit, but gets  one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect  him. It's a comic tarantella with a soft-shoe style, and lots of little moments  that make up for sentimental excesses.  </P> <P> "The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among  the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said  to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's intentionally  spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: the alien turns out to be a  vegetable, of all things.  </P> <P> "Vampire's Kiss" (1989), directed by Robert Bierman. 96 minutes. Rated R. A  contemporary spin on the vampire fantasy, with Nicolas Cage as a neurotic New  Yorker who thinks a one-night stand (Jennifer Beals) has turned him into  Dracula. May be too offbeat for devoted horror fans, but this clever,  cartoon-ish metaphor has bite.MARK CHALON SMITH  </P></p>

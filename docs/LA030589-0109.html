			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DON'T FALL FOR SHAM  </P> <P> Recently you ran an editorial entitled "The Real Issue Is Students' Health." In  that editorial it was opined that a previous attempt at establishing a health  clinic failed at a San Diego high school because of "protests from the Roman  Catholic Church and from some narrow-minded parents who objected to the  possibility that the clinic might dispense birth-control information or  devices." I was a member of the Advisory Committee of the San Diego Unified  School District, and future funding, the role of school districts in solving  social problems, the primacy of curriculum and an upcoming election had a part  in the decision to forgo further exploration of the concept.  </P> <P> Now a joint effort of city, county and school district officials, under the  umbrella of "New Beginnings" is attempting a way of coordination of services  and saving resources by non-duplication of effort.  </P> <P> While such an effort must be applauded, it is unfortunate that the divisive  issue of a school-based clinic has been introduced into the picture. It is  truly in the best interests of the proposers of "New Beginnings" to clearly and  quickly state that a school-based health clinic is not and will not be a part  of their considerations.  </P> <P> The example cited in the Feb. 19 editorial was informative but also misleading.  It is true that parents may sign consent forms to specify which services their  children may receive. It should also be known that access to reproductive  health services may be obtained without parental consent. Thus, while your  child may need your consent for an eye exam or medication, they can obtain a  pregnancy test or birth-control devices without parental consent.  </P> <P> Private funding of clinics is advanced as an important reason for utilizing  school-based health clinics since it saves district funds and offers expanded  services without direct cost to the district.  </P> <P> The other side of this truth is that private funding is usually a combination  of foundation grants, federal or state funds and donations most often with a  fixed percentage match of dollars or resources from the school district.  Several of the large foundations supporting school-based health clinics require  family planning services as a part of the range of services for funding  purposes (i.e. no birth-control, no support). The federal and state funds are  tax-collected monies supporting the Office of Family Planning or the  implementation of the Adolescent Pregnancy Planning Act (hardly what I call  private funds).  </P> <P> If the real issue is students' health, why doesn't the Board of Education  target certain at-risk schools and generate an expanded health care program  with their school nurses? If the real issue is students' health, why hasn't  there been a greater coordination of health care prior to this time? Health  care for the poor is a shambles nationwide; indigent health care in our county  is a disaster. Medicare providers are bailing out of service delivery daily.  </P> <P> To presume that a health clinic on or near a school campus will resolve health  care problems is naive at best. Referrals for service after the screenings at  the campus clinic must be dealt with and funded. Access to health care is  desperately needed, but let us not fall for a sham delivery system.  </P> <P> THE REV. DOUGLAS REGIN  </P> <P> St. Francis Church  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

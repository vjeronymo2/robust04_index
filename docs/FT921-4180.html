			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Agents' paying and collecting systems to be simplified - Tax Collection THE chancellor proposes in his Budget to change the way in which UK paying and collecting agents - mainly banks and stockbrokers - account for the tax which they deduct from payments of foreign dividends and interest. Under the proposals, agents will be required to account for the tax within 14 days from the end of the month in which it is deducted. The special remuneration which agents receive from the Inland Revenue will be discontinued. The proposals will introduce a simpler system and will speed up receipt of the tax by the exchequer. And it will bring the treatment of these agents more into line with others who have similar statutory obligations. The changes will apply from 1 October 1992. At present, paying agents are required to make a return to the Inland Revenue at, or shortly after, the time of payment showing the details of payments and the amount of tax deducted. Most collecting agents make returns on a quarterly basis. When these returns are received, an assessment is issued, the tax on which is due 30 days after its issue. Under this system, there can be a considerable delay between tax being deducted by the agent and it being paid over to the exchequer. Under the proposed system, paying and collecting agents will be required to pay to the Inland Revenue the tax they have deducted from foreign dividends and interest within 14 days of the end of the month in which the dividend or interest is paid. Payment of the tax will not depend on the issue of an assessment. Interest will be chargeable if the tax is not paid by the end of the 14-day period. The returns which agents make to the Inland Revenue will, as at present for most collecting agents, continue to be made on a quarterly basis. These will show the details of all payments made in the quarter, the tax deducted and the tax which has already been accounted for to the Inland Revenue. The statutory provision for the payment of remuneration to agents will be repealed. The present level of these payments is 90p per Pounds 1,000 of income from which tax is deducted. Payments of this sort are not made to others with responsibility for deducting and accounting for tax. The change will result in a public expenditure saving of some Pounds 1.6 million a year. The proposals will bring the arrangements for foreign dividends and interest more into line with other deduction at source arrangements eg large employers accounting for PAYE. Tax relief for insolvent deposit-takers: The chancellor proposes to allow tax relief for expenses and unrelieved trading losses against interest income received during the compulsory liquidation of companies which were authorised deposit-takers under the Banking Act 1987. These companies are unable at present to obtain this relief against the interest income they receive after their trade has ceased; and the income is therefore taxed more severely than if the trade had continued. The effect of this relief will be to increase the amount potentially available to repay depositors and other creditors. The relief will apply to chargeable periods ending after today. Income arising from a trade after it has permanently ceased remains taxable, but certain expenses incurred can be offset against that income. Relief is also available for losses incurred before cessation. But some income arising after cessation, such as interest, is taxed differently and without the benefit of any deduction for expenses and losses. Under the proposal, that difference will be removed in the case of companies which are insolvent and being compulsorily wound up by the Courts, but which were authorised deposit-takers under the Banking Act within the 12 months before trading ceased. The relief will be available against all income which arises after cessation on the assets of the former business and which would, had trading continued, have been either a trading receipt, such as interest on loan advances, or income taxed at source against which trading losses brought forward could have been set.</p>

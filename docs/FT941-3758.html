			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Technology: Science brought down to earth - A programme to promote terrestrial uses of innovations developed for space missions For two decades, space technology has provided innovative technical solutions to everyday problems as well as making glamorous space exploration missions possible. The European Space Agency (ESA) has realised, however, that many more earth-based uses for space technology could be found in fields such as medicine, electronics, communications, energy and materials science. Everyday examples of space technology transfer, the process of applying innovations developed for particular space missions for earth-based use, include the anti-scratch protective layer on plastic contact lenses, air-filled soles of high-tech running shoes, aluminium foil, digital clocks and microwave ovens. Although technology transfer has occurred informally in space research for several years, many potential terrestrial applications remain unexploited. Lack of time, and tunnel vision on the part of research engineers, are two of the main reasons for this. ESA therefore initiated a technology transfer programme in October 1991, with the aim of identifying space technologies that might have civil or commercial applications, and encouraging their transfer. The initiative is run by Spacelink Europe, a consortium of technology brokers from the UK (JRA Aerospace), France (Novespace), Germany (MST Aerospace) and Italy (D'Appolonia). Spacelink scouts ESA contractors for possible transfers, catalogues the ideas, contacts non-space companies which may be interested, and eventually negotiates a deal and takes care of inquiries. The Spacelink catalogue, featuring the space technologies available for exploitation, is called Test (Transferable European Space Technologies) and is published annually. The latest edition, Test 3, contains 60 technologies in many fields such as optics, sensors, communications, life sciences and robotics. Including the earlier catalogues, there are 170 technologies on offer. Spacelink's objective is for non-space companies to sign a licensing agreement or form a joint venture with the 'owner' of the technology. This is either the ESA contractor, ESA itself or shared between the two. The technology may be protected by a patent, but this is not always necessary to license the technology. Although one of the original goals of the programme was for it to become self-financing, through licensing and technology transfer services, its main aim is not economic benefit but to show that space is not just for sending rockets but can have applications on earth. Anne Marie Hieronimus-Leuba, head of ESA's space com- mercialisation office, says that it is 'more concerned with showing that investment in space is paying dividends in terms of terrestrial applications, and that it is not just about sending beautiful objects into space'. The ESA also hopes the programme will increase each of the member states' financial return and share in the technology spin-off. It is an ESA policy that each accounting unit paid by a member state into the agency budget awarding industrial contracts should eventually flow back to that member state. The direct terrestrial applications of space research (weather forecasting, communications via satellites, satellite television, etc) are more evident than the indirect ones, or spin-offs, which do appear in nearly all fields of science and technology: lucid image processing software, developed for use in remote sensing, has applications in the security forces in number plate detection, face recognition and fingerprint analysis; Aerocoat fire protection materials, developed to protect equipment on the Ariane space rocket from very high local temperatures generated during the launch phase, are now used to protect sensitive equipment in trains for the Channel tunnel link; human waste management systems, developed for use in space, are now being considered for hospital clean rooms, where hygiene is also a priority; Cream (Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor), developed for the Nasa Space Shuttle, has been adapted for high flying aircraft and fitted to Concorde; and Radfets, miniature real-time radiation dosimeters, used to monitor background radiation on ESA spacecraft, are being developed to measure radiation doses during cancer treatment. 'Technology transfer is a very slow process and financial return cannot be expected in less than four years,' says John Rootes, managing director of JRA Aerospace. 'There is a time delay of about a year and a half between the initial contact with a technology, the definition of the licensing agreement and the signing of a contract. A further two years is then needed for the adaptation, testing and fabrication of the technology.' Although the process is traditionally slow, the programme has advanced more rapidly than expected. When it began, the goal was to secure six transfers in the first three years. The fact that nine have already been agreed (and that there are many more in the pipeline) indicates great prospects for the programme. The rapidity of these transfers can, in part, be explained by the fact that 40 per cent of them have occurred in the field of software engineering where transfer modifications are minimal. ESA invested Pounds 2m in the programme at its conception. The majority of this is used to pay the members of Spacelink to run the programme but, occasionally, if a transfer looks interesting and there is a shortage of finance to carry it out, ESA may offer some financial support. This was the case at the Brunel Institute of Bioengineering, where shape memory alloys, originally used to make linear actuators for a space bioprocessing facility, showed prospects in medicine as 'staples' to mend broken bones. The institute received Pounds 12,000 from ESA to develop these staples, and general advice was given with regard to the technology transfer. Financial support was also gained by AEA Technology after the huge interest shown in its solid lubricants which appeared in Test 1: Pounds 5,600 was donated to help pay for a short study into possible terrestrial applications. Tony Anson, the research engineer at Brunel, is an 'enthusiast' of the programme. He says that besides the programme being an encouraging initiative, the financial support is 'extremely welcome in a country like the UK where the government does not have a particularly philanthropic approach towards research and where there is a dire shortage of funding'. He believes he has a dozen or so technologies which could realistically have a considerable impact in the medical field, if only he could find the money to exploit them. One of these is the use of shape memory alloys as a prosthesis for hole in the heart. Other transfers which have taken place as a result of the programme include: high stiffness composites developed by Dornier to build space structures for the Rosat X-ray satellite, which are now used for ground-based telescope reflectors and for large screens needed for training systems; ESA's software standards, which have been adopted by many space and non-space companies and which are about to be published by Prentice Hall for worldwide distribution; and image processing software, developed to analyse astronomical images, such as those from Hubble, licenced by Photek for possible application in an image intensification camera. This camera, which contains a Swedish optical chip, again identified through the programme, could be used for research into arthritis and cancer. The latter examples demonstrate the range of applications for space technology and highlight how separate European initiatives can combine for common good. ESA ultimately hopes that space industries themselves will strive to identify potential technology transfers as early as possible in the R&amp;D stage. Such lateral thinking should lead to joint development schemes and more marketable products.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Usdaw to fight Sunday law THE SHOP WORKERS' union, Usdaw, has moved to counter government proposals for legislation to expand Sunday trading, expected in today's Queen's speech. Delegates at the union's annual conference unanimously backed their executive committee's call to move the focus of the anti-Sunday trading campaign to influencing new legislation and away from simple condemnation of shops trading illegally. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary, said the union would continue to call for law enforcement, but delegates had to realise that large stores would continue to trade illegally, especially over the Christmas period. The union gave qualified support for the so-called 'rest' proposals, formulated by Keep Sunday Special (KSS), the anti-Sunday-trading lobby. Mr Connor said the proposals were acceptable because they meant most shops would be closed on Sundays, law-breaking employers would face fines of up to Pounds 50,000, and boards of directors would be held legally liable. He criticised KSS for having little to say about Scottish shopworkers and for suggesting that illegal traders be closed for up to 14 days, without clarifying the position of staff during that time. The union will press EuroFiet, the body that represents the interests of shop workers at European community level, to join Usdaw in sponsoring a conference on trading hours legislation. Earlier, the union reaffirmed its support for wages councils, the bodies that set minimum statutory pay levels for about 2.5m workers, of which more than 1m are shop workers. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, told the conference he would fight the abolition of wages councils line by line and comma by comma in the House of Commons. He said the government had no mandate to abolish wages councils because the Conservative manifesto did not refer to that.</p>

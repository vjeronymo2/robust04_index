			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Ghost of campaign past drives Democrats: Carter's 1976 success in Ohio is lifting Clinton camp DEMOCRATIC party organisers usually recoil from any parallel with President Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat to win the White House. But in the mid-western state of Ohio Governor Bill Clinton's campaign is trying to take a leaf from the Carter book and win it away from the Republicans for only the second time in 25 years. Mr Carter, like Mr Clinton the governor of a southern state, did well enough in the conservative and rural areas of south and west Ohio as well as the traditionally Democratic north-eastern belt to carry the state in 1976 by a scant 11,000 votes. 'Democrats usually try to run very, very hard in northern Ohio to make up for losses in central and southern Ohio. We made a strategic decision to attack Ohio across the board,' says Mr Mark Longabaugh, state director of the Clinton campaign. Republicans, too, remember the 1976 campaign and they are determined not to repeat the weak scores of President Gerald Ford in traditional Republican strongholds. Mr David Yost, a spokesman for the Bush campaign in the state, says: 'Although Ohio has a Republican base, they are independent Republicans and you have to go out and persuade them.' With just two weeks to go to the election it is the Democratic strategy which seems to be paying off. One poll published by the Columbus Dispatch showed Mr Clinton trailing President George Bush by substantial margins in the Dayton and Cincinnati areas of south-western Ohio, but more than holding his own in the central and south-eastern parts of the state. He also held a 20 percentage point lead in the north-east, which accounts for more than 40 per cent of Ohio's votes. That poll gave Mr Clinton a statewide lead of 7 points, but more recent polls have shown a steadily widening margin of as much as 17 points, with Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, barely making inroads. Ohio's Republican leaders have voiced open dissatisfaction with Mr Bush's campaign efforts. 'I have to tell you I'm a frustrated governor,' said Republican Governor George Voinovich on Sunday, adding he believed the election would be won by the Democrats 'unless George Bush can do a better job between now and election day to define who Bill Clinton is in terms of his experience'. At this stage of the campaign Ohio's fate is critical to Mr Bush's chances of re-election. The Republicans have all but written off their prospects in California and Illinois, and with Michigan and Pennsylvania leaning firmly in Mr Clinton's direction it is hard to see how Mr Bush can muster a majority in the electoral college without Ohio's 21 votes. Yet issues the Bush campaign has sought to exploit in the state - such as Mr Clinton's espousal of higher fuel economy constraints, which could damage carmakers in northern Ohio - do not appear to have swayed many voters. Nor have Mr Bush's more venomous attacks on his opponent's patriotism and morals done him much good, to judge by interviews with voters. Indeed, Ohio has had its own bout of sniping, with the Republicans suggesting the Clinton campaign had won the endorsement of former Perot supporters by offering to pay off their earlier campaign debts, a charge Mr Longabaugh dismisses. At the same time Mr Bush's opponents say his campaign in Ohio is mirroring the plight of his national campaign, where he has had to devote unusual amounts of resources to traditionally Republican states like Texas and Florida. The president's visits to Ohio have been concentrated on Republican strongholds such as the north-western farmbelt. 'It's fertile farmland, but it's not a fertile place to pick up undecided voters,' says Mr Longabaugh. But the state's Republican party has able campaigners and a strong organisation. It is still buoyed by Mr Voinovich's victory over the Democrats in the 1990 gubernatorial election. And despite Mr Bush's difficulties, the Republicans appear at the moment to have a better chance than they could have dreamed of three months ago of winning one of Ohio's US Senate seats. Democratic Senator John Glenn, an astronaut who has never won less than 62 per cent of the vote since he was first elected in 1974, holds no more than a 3 point edge over his challenger, Lieutenant Governor Michael De Wine, according to some polls - although other pollsters put his lead as high as 20 points.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mid-States lower in difficult year Mid-States, the Nashville-based automotive parts distributor quoted on the USM, reported 1991 pre-tax profits down from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 3.73m in an 'extremely difficult year' for the US motor industry. However, the company said that it had increased market share appreciably. Turnover increased 17 per cent to Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 41.9m) mainly reflecting a full 12 months contribution from two acquisitions in 1990. Net interest costs increased from Pounds 169,000 to Pounds 735,000 due to debt to fund acquisitions. Earnings per share fell to 6.3p (8.9p). The proposed final dividend is maintained at 2.25p for a total of 3p.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Eximbank backs huge Caterpillar deal with Russians THE US Export-Import Bank yesterday granted Russia's leading natural gas concern, Gazprom, an Dollars 86.2m (Pounds 60.7m) loan to purchase 295 tractors from Illinois-based Caterpillar. The loan is the largest ever approved for a Russian project by the bank. The US-backed financing comes at a time when Russia is Dollars 367.7m in arrears on US-guaranteed grain credits, and is struggling to reschedule foreign debt. An Eximbank spokeswoman said fears that Caterpillar would lose the tractor sale to Komatsu of Japan helped push the loan through. Caterpillar had already lost the pipeline equipment portion of the deal to Komatsu, which had arranged Japanese financing. The loan is a coup for Caterpillar, which has been seeking to expand its business to the Russian oil and gas industry. The Caterpillar earthmoving tractors will be used in the construction of a large pipeline system connecting the Yamal Peninsula in northern Siberia to Gazprom's gas pipeline system to the west at Torzhok. Gazprom controls 40 per cent of the world's natural gas production. Gazprom will pay Mitsui, the Japanese trading company that arranged the Dollars 96.5m tractor sale, Dollars 14.5m in cash. The balance will come from the Eximbank loan, which carries 5.93 per cent interest and extends over 5 years, beginning in March, 1994. Gazprom's repayment to Eximbank is guaranteed by the Bank for Foreign Trade of the Russian Federation. The Eximbank is in the process of arranging an oil and gas sector agreement with Russia to have oil and gas revenues as security for loan financing. However, that agreement is not complete, and will not apply to this loan. Caterpillar will begin producing the tractors in its East Peoria, Illinois, plant in the second quarter. The order represents about eight months' production.</p>

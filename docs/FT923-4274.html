			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / People: Yurko is Siebe's heir-apparent Will Allen Yurko, yesterday revealed as the heir-apparent at controls manufacturer Siebe, exhibit the same sureness of touch as Welshman Barrie Stephens, who has inhabited the chief executive seat for the past 29 years? 'Any company that is dependent on one man has not been structured properly,' says Stephens, who has taken sales from Pounds 370m to Pounds 1.6bn in the past six years alone and presided over one of the few engineering companies to continue to defy the ravages of recession. The City has been awaiting confirmation of Stephens' promise at the time of the half year results in June that his successor was in place. At yesterday's AGM, he announced that he has picked Yurko, a 41-year-old American who is president and chief operating officer of Siebe's temperature and appliance controls division - 'a warrior' he says, which from Stephens, 64,with his reputation for boundless energy and toughness, is praise indeed. Yurko moves to London next month, into the new position of managing director and chief operating officer. Stephens says all reporting lines will then filter into Yurko - save the chief financial officer who will continue to report to him. While Stephens, who took on the role of chairman in December 1990, says he had intended to retire from his executive role this Christmas, his board has 'prevailed' upon him to defer his departure. At the end of 1993 Stephens will step down as chief executive, but remain as non-executive chairman. Born in Canada, into a family of Romanian and Ukrainian stock, Yurko has been at Siebe in the US for the last three and a half years, joining the main board in June 1991. He had earlier worked with Mueller Holdings and Eaton Corporation. ***** Steve Ireland, controller of regional programmes at TYNE TEES TELEVISION, is appointed director of programmes on the resignation of Adrian Metcalfe. Metcalfe becomes a programme consultant. James Lancaster, currently director of resources, takes on the new position of deputy MD. ***** Michael Marriott has been appointed company secretary of SUTCLIFFE SPEAKMAN in place of Peter Norman. ***** Gerry Arnold has been appointed director of sales of HOOVER EUROPE; he moves from Unilever. ***** Mark Gravatt (above), a senior consultant at Touche Ross, returns to Welton Packaging, part of BOWATER, as finance director. He had been management accountant at Welton from 1985-1987. ***** Brian Baylis is the new chief executive of CHESSBOURNE INTERNATIONAL. He had been chief executive of Dewhurst. ***** Kevin Bryett has been promoted to MD of MERIEUX UK. ***** Frank Cooper has been appointed engineering director of Smith Flow Control, a HALMA subsidiary. ***** Sir Dennis Landau, the recently retired chief executive of Co-operative wholesale society, takes over this month as chairman of Unity Trust Bank, the small bank set up by the CWS and a number of trade unions in 1984.  He succeeds Terry Thomas, the managing director of Co-operative Bank, who is to remain on the Unity Trust Board.  Co-op Bank currently owns about a third of the equity of Unity Trust.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A national forest conservation plan is now being  implemented. It provides for systematic forest management and  reforestation. Strict penalties are to be imposed for the  destruction of forest. In addition, the master plan for  forestry is to be revived.    Sri Lanka has lost over 400,000 hectares of its forest cover  during the last decade. The rapid deforestation has been blamed  on the growing population and other issues. Only 20.3 percent  of Sri Lanka's land area is under forest. The forest cover  stood at 70 percent at the turn of this century. The declined  forest cover has caused natural disasters such as floods, soil  erosion, and landslide.</p>

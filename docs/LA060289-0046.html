			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: STANLEY NEWMAN RESIGNS FROM MCA  </P> <P> Stanley Newman, the MCA vice president who heads the entertainment company's  consumer products group, has tendered his resignation although he will continue  as an active consultant, the company said.  </P> <P> In his 15-year stint at the company, Newman's publishing unit responsibilities  expanded to include LJN Toys and Spencer Gifts, the company's specialty retail  and mail-order operation. All three units will now report directly to MCA Chief  Operating Officer Sidney J. Sheinberg, the company said.  </P> <P> Sheinberg, who has long counted Newman among his closest associates, said  Newman has made "incalculable contributions" and said the vice president's  resignation was not the result of any quarrel.  </P> <P> Newman will continue to serve as a director on the board of Cineplex Odeon  Corp., the movie-theater concern in Toronto that is 49%-owned by MCA, the  company said.  </P></p>

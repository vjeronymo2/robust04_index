			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (6): Mr Rubio fights on two fronts - A personal view of the central bank crisis IN A few weeks, the Madrid government will make one of most important economic policy decisions of the year and appoint a new governor to the Bank of Spain. Six months ago, it seemed a fair bet that the present governor, Mr Mariano Rubio, would be renominated, but his chances of a third term have been overtaken by a ferocious financial scandal. Briefly, Mr Rubio's modest portfolio - Dollars 120,000 - was managed by his friend and broker for 25 years, Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former chairman of the Madrid stock exchange. The money was not to not be invested in any bank. In the late 1980s, Mr De la Concha applied for a banking licence and, as he met the capital requirements, was given one. He formed Ibercorp, a small financial services boutique - a bank, a stockbroker, and a series of small portfolio companies. It was in one of these, Sistemas Financieros, that he invested Mr Rubio's money. In the spring of 1990, Sistemas Financieros accumulated vast amounts of its own stock, triggering an investigation by the stock market commission. Soon after the repurchases, the price of Sistemas Financieros stock collapsed, leaving a vast bulk of shareholders to take bad losses. But Mr Rubio had been bought out in the spring, and had been spared financial ruin. Earlier this year a Spanish newspaper reported the stock accumulations, and accused Mr De la Concha of deliberately favouring the governor. Worse, a list of Sistemas Financieros shareholders whose stock had been bought back by the company was sent to the stock market commission without Mr Rubio's name on it. The names of other well-known Spanish personalities had also been altered. Few of the Sistemas Financieros shareholders seemed to have been aware of precisely what Mr De la Concha was doing with their money or their names. But the accusations unsettled the governor, and a few weeks after the scandal broke he appeared before parliament to report on the matter and made his first mistake. Bank of Spain investigators had recently completed an audit of the Ibercorp group, and concluded that it was a highly speculative operation, dedicated to supporting the price of its own stock, and whose net worth was rapidly crumbling. But Mr Rubio, facing members of parliament, told them the group's bank was 'in perfect condition'. Mariano Rubio is a decent, honourable man. He offered his resignation soon after the scandal broke. But he is also quite arrogant, or perhaps aloof - traits not uncommon in central bankers. He would not have appreciated being asked questions by a motly collection of MPs, many of whom clearly did not really know what to ask him and were using newspapers as source material. He did not lie to parliament. The Ibercorp bank's net worth, at the time of his testimony, was positive. But it was falling, and he did not tell them that. Neither, strictly speaking, did he have to. But by then (late February) the Ibercorp scandal was out of control, and the Bank of Spain report leaked. It also emerged that Mr Rubio's sister was a shareholder in Sistemas Financieros. That was no crime, and he might even have introduced her to it or to his broker. The world is full of bad investors. At a second parliamentary hearing in June, though, Mr Rubio appeared to compound his initial economies with the truth by refusing to allow parliament to inspect the Bank's audit of Ibercorp. But the effect was that the central bank governor had told the nation that a bank was in perfect condition when it quite clearly was not. Would he be believed the next time? There was no getting out of the trap he was in. Mr Rubio was fighting two battles: one personal, the other for the autonomy of the Bank of Spain. Under the rules governing the European Community's drive to economic and monetary union, governments are required to make their central banks independent. That would free them from political interference, especially the manipulation of interest rates to prop up economic policies. In Spain, the central bank remains a prisoner of government whim. Not even a draft statute of autonomy has been drawn up, but Mr Rubio's predicament has highlighted the dilemma in making a central bank independent: how does a statute accommodate both the Bank's monetary policy role and its role as regulator of the banking industry? Politicians may be less resigned to losing control of monetary policy, but they will be loath now to entertain a law which puts the banking regulator beyond public scrutiny. But it would be dangerous to allow political access to all corners of the industry. Secrets die young in Spain. Ibercorp may temporarily weaken the Bank of Spain's case for autonomy in regulation, but the tragedy of the scandal is that Mr Rubio's efforts to strengthen the Spanish banking system, to liberalise it and make it transparent, may now be unrecognised and unappreciated. At a time of great change, only two tiny banks, including Ibercorp, failed under his stewardship. Ibercorp is not a corruption scandal. It is the story of a rotten, badly run little financial empire that let its clients down. Mr Rubio was one of them. There is a lot of speculation now about a successor, but only one man stands out - Mr Rubio's deputy, Mr Luis Angel Rojo. The 'professor', as he is called by former economics students and by alumni of the Bank's impressive research department, Mr Rojo is a no-nonsense, technically brilliant central banker. He would guard the Bank from politicians; and any other appointment by the government would smack of political intrigue and an attempt to have a 'flexible' man at the top of an independent institution. Ibercorp has not done much damage to the Bank of Spain, and certainly nothing that Mr Rojo's appointment would not heal in an instant.</p>

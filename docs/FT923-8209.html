			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese bank shares buck trend JAPANESE bank shares rallied on the Tokyo stock market yesterday, on hopes that a change in accounting rules would allow the banks to hide their evaluation losses on stock holdings. Although a 48.77 point fall depressed the Nikkei stock average of 225 leading stocks to a new six-year low of 14,773.79, the banking index was one of the few gainers, rising 7.74 points to 2,913.56. For the fiscal year to last March, Japan's 11 commercial banks saw operating profits rise 31.5 per cent to a total Y1,920bn (Dollars 15bn), thanks to bigger profit margins on loans. But pre-tax profits fell 14 per cent due to increases in loan loss write-offs and evaluation losses on stock investments. A ministry of finance official denied reports suggesting banks would be allowed to switch accounting principles where stocks can be carried at cost, but analysts pointed out that such measures were highly likely.

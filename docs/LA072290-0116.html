			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRAZED ABORTION MOM KIDNAPS FIRST LADY;  </P> <P> THE AMENDMENT BY SUE ROBINSON (BIRCH LANE PRESS/ CAROL PUBLISHING GROUP:  $17.95; 237 PP.; 0-55971-018-2)  </P> <P> Set in the future, "The Amendment" begins in New Orleans where abortion  conservatives are celebrating their victory: the ratification of a  constitutional amendment denying all women in America the option of legal and  safe abortions. Until recently, this premise seemed remote, perhaps even  contrived. However, the passage in Louisiana legislature of an almost identical  statute gives "The Amendment" a chilling prescience.  </P> <P> The novel turns on a plot to kidnap First Lady Mary Morgan, leader of the  Rights for the Unborn League, and to extort from her and the League the huge  sum that will be required to set up an underground that will provide American  women safe abortions in Sweden. Most readers will already have strong emotions  and opinions on the subject of abortion. Author Sue Robinson, a former United  Press International and Associated Press reporter, surely knows that their  intense feelings will help carry this story and hold it together.  </P> <P> The book exploits a white hats/black hats, David-and-Goliath mentality. The  narrow-minded injustice and hypocrisy of the league engages the reader's own  sense of vulnerability. A Southern-backwater sort of evil fills the reader with  suspense: How will the league, now at the height of its power, be stopped?  </P> <P> We know -- and hope we are wrong -- that young, innocent Hilary Foster, and the  courageous physician who has risked his career to help her, will die at the  hands of one of the league's back-street patrols that search out and destroy  illegal abortion clinics.  </P> <P> Thus set up, I accepted the proposition that Hilary's unconventional but  heretofore law-abiding mother will kidnap the First Lady. I wanted to know  whether Mrs. Foster would elude the cynical Jack Riley, the league's mercenary  bloodhound, who sniffs out her scheme.  </P> <P> It was easy to side with Robinson's good guys, who also include a warm-hearted  nurse in love with the murdered doctor/musician who, we are reminded, will play  the dulcimer no more; the bright, capable Elizabeth McKinley, who suddenly  finds meaning in life in avenging her best friend's death; a respectable  girls'-school dean who risks her own position (Jean Harris with a good cause?)  to help young ladies in need of abortions. Never mind that these characters are  white, affluent, educated and very well-connected, or that their possible  success will most likely benefit their sisters who are similarly situated.  </P> <P> The bad-guy league members are the kinds of sanctimonious uglies we love to  hate. Robinson pointedly suggests at the outset that they are contemptible:  </P> <P> " . . . First Lady Mary Holt Morgan's voice vibrated to a high- fever pitch,  soaring on hot-fevered wings across the high golden ceiling of the Louisiana  Superdome, reaching out to the multitudes gathered there, their sweat-streaked  bodies jammed tightly into every high-backed bleacher seat . . . their hot,  shining eyes were fastened on the podium on the ramrod-straight, triumphant  figure of the First Lady of the United States . . . the sweat of this exultant  capacity crowd reeked not of the sour, salted crust of fatted perspiration, it  ran sweet instead, sweet and pure as only the mother's milk of the righteous is  sweet and pure . . . Saint Mary of the terrible swift sword of righteousness .  . . Saint Mary, the glorious blond Madonna of the forces for life."  </P> <P> Readers familiar with Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale" may be reminded  of Serena Joy, another evangelical figure whose zeal in saving the unborn also  is equaled only by her own self-deception and barrenness.  </P> <P> Robinson's overwrought and peculiarly repetitive style has a distracted -- and  distracting -- life of its own. The volume of images (heat, lights, circles,  mirrors, eyes, darkness, and especially sweat) stupefy like a night of restless  dreams. Repetition of names, words, phrases and syntax, a mannerism currently  practiced with success by Joan Didion, often seems to abduct the author  herself, leaving the reader in a confusion of pointless echoes and mixed  metaphors: ". . . It was Jonathan's eyes that startled Elizabeth. They were an  extremely light blue, an almost transparent blue, as if lights were on behind  them, and set in Jonathan's slender, aquiline face, and punctuated by his light  eyelashes and eyebrows and his light-blond hair, his light eyes seemed to  glitter across a long distance at Elizabeth, glittering transparently like  clear water in bright sun. . . ."  </P> <P> Readers in search of an examination of the issue of abortion or the subtleties  of sex and politics will not linger over "The Amendment" -- obviously. In fact,  this novel is so generic that any of a number of other issues -- gun control,  for instance -- could provoke equal emotional intensity for readers and provide  a backdrop for this plot.  </P> <P> Robinson relieves the reader of any responsibility for logic or consideration  of diverse views and claims -- not to mention the broader contemplation of the  meaning of life or the taking of it. The shape of our thinking on the matter of  abortion and other gender issues and its implications is far better exposed in  "The Handmaid's Tale."  </P> <P> "The Amendment" entertains in the mechanical way a bizarre amusement park  attraction entertains: a ride in the gloom accompanied by lots of special  effects and action, but, in the daylight an experience that would be easy to  forget were it not for its particular relevance to our darkest fears.  </P> <P> It's summertime. For a quick thrill, take "The Amendment" on the airplane or to  the beach and pass it on to a friend. With that idea in mind, more practical  abortion liberals may want to wait for the paperback edition, and, meanwhile,  write to their legislators.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> As an 18-year-old viewer of "The Outsiders," I think Fox has the best midseason  replacement series on television. The six actors who portray S. E. Hinton's  beloved characters are right on target. These young men -- Robert Russler,  Harold Pruett, Boyd Kestner, Rodney Harvey, Jay Ferguson and David Arquette --  certainly spice the series.  </P> <P> Brenda M. Absmeier, Ventura  </P></p>

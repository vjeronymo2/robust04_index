			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trygg stops writing new reinsurance business TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurer, is to stop writing new reinsurance business immediately to concentrate on its Swedish activities and international industrial and corporate insurance. The move ends an involvement dating back to the start of the century and follows the company's March decision to halve its reinsurance activity. The group is ranked as one of the world's top 50 reinsurers with 1992 premiums of SKr2.5bn (Dollars 316.4m). Mr Lars Pihlgren, head of Trygg's reinsurance and marine operations, said the decision to pull out of reinsurance was logical when it was no longer considered a core business. Last year, Trygg suffered a SKr470m loss from reinsurance because of losses from credit insurance and exposure to hurricane Andrew. In 1993, a break-even reinsurance result is expected. The winding down process will take a number of years, as claims can be expected to come in even though premiums are no longer generated. The group is seeking a European partner in industrial insurance and it wants to strengthen its position in Sweden. The company's US affiliate Home Holdings said last month it would raise Dollars 335m through an initial public offering and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Membrane Absorber Removes SO2 From </F> Waste Gases"]    [Text] The TNO [Netherlands Organization for Applied  Natural Science Research] has developed a membrane absorber  which removes 95 percent of the sulphur dioxide from waste  gases, as became clear from tests in the potato flour plant  Avebe. The collected sulphur dioxide can be recycled. A  membrane absorber is a device which brings gas in contact with  fluid. It consists of a series of hollow fiber membranes,  through which a fluid passes. The noxious fumes flow on the  surface of the fibers, with some being absorbed by the fluid. In  the membrane absorber, the stream of fumes is crosswise to the  stream of fluid. The advantage of this is that the reduction of  pressure is small and the unwanted oxidation of sulphite to  sulphate is low.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa hits 6 1/4 -year highs - Market Report London COCOA futures surged to 6 1/4 -year highs yesterday as investment fund buying swamped the market, leaving many in the trade wrong-footed. The July contract closed at Pounds 1,066 a tonne, up Pounds 68, after touching Pounds 1,085 at one stage. 'It looks very, very good. It's a got a strong base and the upside potential is a couple of hundred pounds,' one trader said. At the London Metal Exchange three months COPPER hit a 16-month peak of Dollars 2,335 a tonne in the morning, underpinned by speculative buying, fund interest and short-covering. But profit-taking set in and the price was trimmed to Dollars 2,296.50, up Dollars 19.50 on balance. Most other LME contracts lost early gains.

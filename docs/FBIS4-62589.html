			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Mikhail Shevtsov and Andrey </F> Palaria]    [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- The Russia-brokered talks on  Nagorno-Karabakh which began in Moscow on Monday between the  defence ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh  failed on Tuesday and the defence chief of Azerbaijan flew to  Baku for consultations with the president.    The sides failed to sign the final protocol on the ceasefire  and the disengagement of troops, Russian Deputy Defence Minister  Georgiy Kondratyev told TASS. The major provisions of the  document were agreed upon thanks to mediation by Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev.    Armenian Ambassador in Russia Feliks Mamikonyan told TASS  that Azerbaijan insisted that its territories be freed  simultaneously with the beginning of troops disengagement. He  added that it was that question which demanded additional  consultations with Baku.    However, Kondratyev told TASS that Mamadrafi Mammadov, as it  turned out, was not authorised to sign the final document and  requested additional time for consultations with the president  of Azerbaijan.    The embassy of Azerbaijan in Moscow confirmed that the  republican defence minister had left for Baku, but refused to  comment on the disagreements at the talks.    Kondratyev expressed hope that the protocol would be signed  in the near future.    According to the Armenian ambassador, representatives of  Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Russia had signed the ceasefire  and disengagement protocol.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A few minutes ago, we received a statement from the  press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of  Ministers. On 10 February, REUTER inaccurately reported on the  stance of Leonid Kravchuk on the possible bombardment of Bosnian  Serb military positions around Sarajevo. In particular, REUTER  claims that the Ukrainian president said that he does not see  any alternative to the onset of air attacks on the Serbian  positions sanctioned by the United Nations. In connection with  this, REUTER reported on the evident change in the Ukrainian  president's previous position on this issue. This does not  correspond to reality.    The statement from the press service of the Ukrainian  president and the Cabinet of Ministers cites the entire text of  Kravchuk's interview with REUTER. This text shows that  President Kravchuk confirmed REUTER's supposition that the  stances of Ukraine and Russia, which are opposed to air strikes  on the Bosnian Serbs, are close to each other. In addition,  Leonid Kravchuk stated that, in general, this is not the first  time the stances of Ukraine and Russia have been close to each  other. I am convinced that our stances on such international  issues as strengthening global peace, the social protection of  people and their human rights and freedoms, and on other  international issues were, are, and will be close. We will  cooperate and coordinate our policy with Russia, said Leonid  Kravchuk. Answering a question as to who -- NATO or the UN  Security Council -- will decide on the bombardment of Bosnian  Serbs, Leonid Kravchuk definitely spoke in favor of the UN  Security Council, because the issue under discussion is  connected with a forceful invasion. Next, Leonid Kravchuk said:  I admit this option when there is no other way out, when blood  is shed and people are dying. Simply put, my hair stands on end  when I hear the reports of how people, including children, are  dying there, in what terrible conditions they are living, and  how much has been destroyed. Both the land and people's soul  are devastated. If there is no other way to stop this  nightmare, we have to use other approaches, however, this should  not be the decision of a single country, this should be a  decision made by the entire international community. I always  favored and still favor this option. [Words indistinct],  however, there are international organizations -- the United  Nations and its Security Council, the EC, and others. This  issue should be resolved by the highest level international  organizations.    Therefore, you can see that the REUTER report does not at  all  correspond to what Leonid Kravchuk really said. The press  service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers  is authorized to denounce the REUTER report as totally changing  the gist of the Ukrainian president's remarks.</p>

(Mexico City XEW Television  Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94)    While in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State, Soto  said  the peace process is not advancing, because "the state and  federal governments lack a sufficient commitment to resolve the  problem of landownership and land reform." (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 28 May 94)    In Mexico State, Jorge Gonzalez Torres, Mexican Green  Ecologist Party presidential candidate, has said Article 27 of  the Constitution had to be amended back to the way it was  originally drafted in order for the 21 August elections to be  credible and honest.

He reiterated what he said a  month ago in the studios of Radio Acir. Trevino said if he does  not win the elections, he will support Zedillo. He has said his  party is not a parastate party or a satellite of the PRI.  (Mexico City Radio Acir Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 1 Jun 94)    During a ceremony at PRI headquarters, candidate Zedillo  spoke in favor of maintaining a "healthy distance" between the  government and PRI. Zedillo has said: "We want a nation of  welfare, opportunities, and a firm hope," saying poverty in  Mexico does not admit "indifference or evasion." Zedillo has  said his efforts will be directed at increasing the people's  security and property, eliminating impunity, and fighting  narcotrafficking. Zedillo has recognized the merits of  President Carlos, saying he has left the PRI government a legacy  of patriotism and undaunted determination. (Mexico City EL  FINANCIERO in Spanish 30 May 94 p 6)    As instructed by Zedillo, the PRI has sent representatives  to  Japan, the United States, South America, Spain, and Portugal to  brief the country representatives on the electoral process that  will take place in Mexico in August, Jose Angel Gurria has  announced.

He said  he hoped all the candidates would agree to participate. He  described the disappointment among PRI members regarding the  selection of candidates as normal, adding the PRI "has again  shown its strength, unity, and will continue to strive to win  democratically." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish  0430 GMT 27 May 94)    Zedillo has flown to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua State, and  visited an assembly plant. He has promised to sustain sources  of employment but, rather, "under decent conditions" for  workers. During a meeting with local businessmen, he heard of  their views on the bad economic situation, the crime wave, and  drug trafficking. "We are going to reform our country's  apparatus of justice," he said. Zedillo also met privately with  PAN Governor Francisco Barrio. If elected, the PRI candidate  affirmed, he will maintain close cooperation with local  governments ruled by opposition parties. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94)    Zedillo has expressed reservations about signing several  points of the Agreement for Democracy. He asked for a four-week  period to present suggestions to the commission sponsoring the  agreement. Zedillo has said the idea behind the agreement is  good but that the agenda must be broader on judicial matters and  on the division of power. So far, only PAN candidate Diego  Fernandez, PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and PT candidate  Cecilia Soto have signed the agreement.

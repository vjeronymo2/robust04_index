			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / On the ropes but still fighting: The Tories' dire election result may spell ruin for Major It's simple, explained one of Mr John Major's erstwhile supporters at Westminster. Conservative MPs had only to decide whether the prime minister could lead them to victory in another general election. If, once the votes had been counted for the June 9 European elections, the answer was No (and he fully expected it would be), they would replace him. Ruthless maybe, but then the Tory party had never worried too much about spilling its leaders' blood. Politics, of course, is never that simple. As they surveyed the devastation wrought by Thursday's local elections, some in Mr Major's embattled government were drawing an altogether more sombre conclusion. The question was not whether the prime minister could recover, but whether a divided and embittered Conservative party could sustain any leader in office. Nobody in the Tory party expected good results this week. But the scale of the defeat blacked out any remaining shafts of light. The 100 or so Conservative MPs who regard their seats as marginals did not need a calculator to work out that a much smaller swing against the government in a general election would pitch them into the dole queues. It was an across-the-board revolt. Middle-class disgust in Tunbridge Wells was mirrored by working-class anger in Croydon and Basildon. The Conservative share of the vote, put by the BBC at 27 per cent, was the lowest this century, leaving the government alongside the Liberal Democrats. There were no doubts at Westminster as to why. Badly bruised by recession and angered by a broken promise over taxes, the voters took their revenge on a party which prefers to devote its energies to faction-fighting over Europe than to offering competent government. So the election saw tactical voting on a massive scale. In those areas where Labour had the best chance of defeating the Conservatives, people put their crosses against Mr John Smith's red rose. Where the electorate judged the Liberal Democrats could best deliver the requisite bloody nose, Mr Paddy Ashdown triumphed. The result, taken with last year's devastation in shire counties' elections, has been to wipe the Conservatives off the local government map. There were scattered crumbs of comfort. The voters of Wandsworth and Westminster kept faith. More importantly, Labour did far less well nationally than suggested by its high-profile successes in London's suburbs. Winning 42 per cent of the vote nationwide at this stage of the electoral cycle does not point to a resounding Labour victory in a general election. Mr Smith has been complacent. His strategy has rested on the premise that the Conservatives will do his job for him. But what the results demonstrated is that a Tory defeat does not translate automatically into a Labour victory. Labour needs to score 45 per cent or more of the vote in such mid-term elections if it wants to secure an overall majority in parliament. The Liberal Democrats, by contrast, could be forgiven their self-congratulation. Their 27 per cent share of the total was better than at any time since the halycon days of the old SDP/Alliance in the early 1980s. The party took swathes of seats off Labour as well as the Conservatives. If the Liberal Democrats still struggle to be heard on the national stage, their credentials as a party of local government can no longer be disputed. But for the next five weeks - perhaps the next five months until a formal leadership contest in November - politics will be overwhelmingly a story about the Conservatives. The elections to the European parliament threaten further catastrophe. So, too, does the Eastleigh by-election in which Mr Ashdown is now set fair for a spectacular victory. If Conservatives were prepared to rebel or stay at home in such numbers this week, how much easier it will be for them to exact further revenge on June 9. Some Tory voters demonstrated that they still care about who runs their local town hall; they are likely to be far less concerned about who represents them in the more remote Strasbourg assembly. The Conservative manifesto sidesteps the irreconcilable divide in the party over Europe. It manages to wave the Union Jack for the Eurosceptics while appeasing the pro-Europeans by sounding positive about Britain's agenda for the Union. But Mr Douglas Hurd's elegant prose provides the appearance rather than the substance of unity. After Mr Michael Portillo's ill-judged remarks this week about the dangers of a single currency, it is hard to imagine that the rift will not reopen during the European campaign. A few weeks ago senior Conservatives were encouraging speculation that the party might see its representation in the European parliament fall from the present 32 seats to fewer than a dozen. The actual outcome - perhaps 20 seats - would then be treated as a pleasant surprise. Now they have started to believe their direst predictions. Mr Major knows the European election will be treated as a more telling referendum on his premiership. His combative comments on the steps of 10 Downing Street were explicit confirmation that he expects a formal challenge to his leadership in the autumn. But his strongest enemies - a motley but daily more powerful bunch of right-wing malcontents, passionate anti-Europeans, and anonymous figures from marginal seats - want to precipitate the crisis well before then. If the European results are as bad as they fear, they want Mr Major out by the end of June. The prime minister still has cards to play. The pretenders in his cabinet - Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the youthful Mr Portillo - cannot precipitate a crisis without wrecking their own chances. A post-election cabinet reshuffle might buy him more time. For different reasons, all in the cabinet but Mr Heseltine, the near-certain winner in any leadership contest, may well judge that their personal political fortunes are best served by sustaining Mr Major rather than by removing him. The Eurosceptics are divided as to the wisdom of swapping Mr Major for Mr Heseltine. Some are naive enough to believe that Mr Heseltine's pro-European instincts can be reined in. Others will never forgive him for destroying Margaret Thatcher's premiership. The outcome may depend on Mr Major's pyschological make-up. His strongest card is the threat not to go quietly: to fight to the end whatever the consequences for the party. The calculation his enemies would then have to make would be whether removing him would be more damaging than keeping him. A close friend insisted that, if necessary, the prime minister would play that card. Mr Major was convinced that he had a better chance than any rival of holding together his party. He had grown more resilient than anybody realised. Another confidant took an entirely different view. If the anti-Tory tide had not receded by June 9, he judged, Mr Major would 'walk'. The unthinkable alternative would be a 'bloodbath'. It may be, though, that this week the Tories passed the point of no return.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> VOTE ON NEW POLICE STATION  </P> <P> The City Council voted Tuesday to schedule a special election Feb. 26, 1991,  for a vote on the proposed construction of an $8.85-million police station.  </P> <P> A special citywide election will cost the city about $18,000, City Clerk  Phyllis McCarville said.  </P> <P> Council members decided against placing the measure on the November ballot  because they said there was not enough time to campaign effectively for the new  building.  </P> <P> A citizens commission has recommended replacing the current police station,  built in 1961, because it is overcrowded and does not meet earthquake safety  standards. The new, 30,000-square-foot station would be built at Ivy and Lime  avenues and would be financed by an annual assessment of $49 from each  residence for 27 years.  </P></p>

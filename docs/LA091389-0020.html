			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> More than two years after his death, pop artist Andy Warhol is making waves in  London. Six Warhol exhibitions opened this month. Also taking place: a  retrospective of his avant-garde films and a two-day conference on his film  making at the National Film Theater; a six-week series of lectures at the  Chelsea School of Art and Design and, next month, a dance at Sadler's Wells  inspired by his helium-filled floating silver pillows. "I cannot remember such  a concentration on a single artist before, and it reflects Warhol's stature as  one of the great artists since the Second World War," said Andrew Dempsey,  assistant director of the Hayward Gallery, which is staging Britain's first  comprehensive retrospective Warhol exhibition.

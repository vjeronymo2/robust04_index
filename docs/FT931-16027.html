			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Major sets sights on new political agenda: A look at the formidable tasks facing the policymakers IN government, momentum is vital. But it is worthless without a clear sense of direction. The turmoil of the past few months has deprived Mr John Major's government of both. So when the prime minister sits down with policy advisers at his Chequers country mansion tomorrow for a two-day seminar to relaunch his domestic political agenda, he will face two formidable tasks. The first is to define with greater clarity the destination to which he intends to take the country over the next four years. The second is to regain the momentum needed to go in that direction. It will not be easy. His advisers from the Downing Street policy unit will arrive at Chequers with a bagful of ideas. Some of the ideas represent developments of existing policies - designed, for example, to give added impetus to the education and health reforms and to the establishment of higher public service standards under the Citizen's Charter. Others ideas are fresher. Ministers are promising to shrink the public sector to its core functions through a mixture of privatisation and commercialisation of much of central and local government. The move to allow private-sector participation in large-scale capital projects is seen by some as the thin end of a wedge allowing the state eventually to withdraw from many infrastructure schemes. The prospect that unemployment will soon reach 3m has given urgency to plans to dovetail an expansion of further education with enhanced training opportunities and vocational qualifications for those aged 16 to 19. There are proposals also for a temporary work scheme for the long-term unemployed, combined perhaps with a step in the direction of 'workfare'. Housing remains a central if sometimes muddled preoccupation. There are powerful advocates within Whitehall of new incentives - fiscal or otherwise  -to expand the rented housing sector. Others want a more rapid extension of home-ownership into inner-city council estates. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, plans to combine a shake-up of the police with tougher legislation to cope with the juvenile crime epidemic. Other issues impose themselves on the domestic agenda. The coal industry review is forcing the government to confront the distortions in the energy market. The Tomlinson report demands a policy to recast the National Health Service in London, and the British Rail privatisation bill will herald an intense debate about the future of public transport. The many initiatives promised by the policy unit and by individual departments have yet to be welded into a coherent strategy, and senior ministers acknowledge that the prime minister needs to be much more certain about his strategic ambitions. During the mid 1980s - the period that Mr Major regards as the heyday of the enterprise culture - the government was anchored by ideological certainties. Individual policies were often inconsistent with the ideology. But the long-term objectives of Baroness Thatcher as prime minister and Lord Lawson as chancellor - above all those of establishing the primacy of the market and of shrinking the state - were sufficiently firmly rooted for the occasional deviation to be overlooked. Mr Major has set out his guiding themes: a market-driven economy alongside social policies designed to extend choice, ownership and opportunity. Low taxation and low inflation are taken as a sine qua non. Those objectives are familiar to any right-of-centre Conservative government. What is missing is a distinctive and robust enough framework to illuminate the government's destination. Many in his own party remain unsure of the extent to which Mr Major will opt for the status quo rather than the risks of change. In part, the confusion is the result of the economic upheavals of the past two years. It is hard to re-establish tax cuts or sound public finances as lodestars when the recession has led to an explosion of public borrowing. The debacle surrounding sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism has left an important questionmark over the strength of the commitment to permanently low inflation. Ministers are conscious that the government lacks a coherent framework against which its economic strategy can be judged. Even those ministers implacably opposed to any return to the ERM agree that ad hoc monitoring of a handful of monetary indicators is no real substitute. There are other areas of confusion. The policy unit will this weekend be tabling proposals to give substance to the prime minister's promise of a new burst of deregulation to lift the burdens on business. But the Thatcherite rhetoric behind that pledge sits uneasily with Mr Major's new commitment to government help for manufacturing companies. The prime minister has been talking of a Budget for industry in March, but nobody is quite sure what that means. There is a growing realisation among ministers that the dozens of individual ideas being canvassed by Downing Street are a poor substitute for a handful of bold, radical projects to map out the government's direction. If Mr Major is to cut direct taxes during this parliament he will have to make a start on radical reform of the tax privileges offered on pension provisions and home ownership. He may also be obliged to change a political climate which has so far ensured that the government cannot escape its responsibility for a universal state pension or for unemployment and other social benefits. There are one or two straws in the wind. The size of the borrowing requirement has reopened debate about the logic and sustainability of mortgage-interest tax relief. The more radical members of the cabinet are floating the possibility of private insurance schemes to reduce gradually the state's responsibility for unemployment benefit. If he is to define his premiership, Mr Major needs to demonstrate that he can be bold as well as careful. An unspectacular economic recovery will not be enough.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MUST DO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Establish a coherent framework for economic strategy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Define with much greater clarity government ambitions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fashion core policies which will deliver those objectives.

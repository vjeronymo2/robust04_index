			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: International draft rules on capital delayed A PROPOSED international regime governing the capital adequacy of securities firms has been further delayed, in spite of indications earlier this year that regulators in the world's main financial centres had reached agreement. The regime, mirroring the Basle capital rules for banks, is intended to make sure investment firms have the financial resources to withstand losses, preventing a domino-like collapse in financial markets. Iosco, the grouping of international securities regulators, and the Basle committee of banking supervisors said, in January, draft rules would be published this summer. However, this has been delayed to October at the earliest after a recent Iosco meeting failed to endorse the proposals. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is believed to have been among the regulatory bodies which wanted more time to consider the proposals. The SEC was also responsible for delaying an earlier attempt to reach agreement, 18 months ago. SEC chairman Mr Richard Breeden has been concerned that the international rules would be weaker than those already imposed in the US. That would either force the SEC to water down its regulations, or leave US securities firms at a disadvantage. Issues still under discussion include the amount of subordinated debt securities firms can count as capital for regulatory purposes. Also, regulators have yet to decide on what should fall within a bank's 'trading book', which will be subjected to the less stringent securities rules rather than the Basle rules for bank capital. Part of the reason for the delay is the European Commission's draft rules on capital adequacy, which were adopted at the end of June, said Mr Roy Croft of the UK's Securities and Investments Board. Iosco members wanted more time to consider these before formalising their own plans.</p>

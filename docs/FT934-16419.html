			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Safeway third-quarter profit more than doubled SAFEWAY, the North American grocery retailer, yesterday said that its earnings had more than doubled in the third quarter in spite of persistent economic sluggishness in the western US and Canada, where most of its 1,100 stores are located. In the quarter to September 11, net income was Dollars 42.1m, or 34 cents a share, compared with Dollars 20m, or 17 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992. Revenues climbed 3 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, in spite of a declining exchange rate for the Canadian dollar and low price inflation throughout the food sector. On a same-store basis, Safeway sales increased 3.1 per cent, at a time when most of its west coast competitors were experiencing flat sales growth or small declines. Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the results, which exceeded analysts' consensus forecast of 29 cents a share. By midday, the stock reached a 52-week high of Dollars 19 1/4 , up Dollars 1. The earnings improvement reflects the company's continued success in controlling costs through staff reductions and improved purchasing procedures. Operating and administrative expenses in the quarter slipped to 23.8 per cent of sales, against 24.4 per cent last time. The California-based chain has staged an impressive turnround under the leadership of Mr Steve Burd, who assumed the job of chief executive in March. 'Mr Burd has changed the culture at Safeway,' said Mr Richard Church, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York. 'The company has not only cut costs, but has become more focused on its customers by passing the savings along through lower prices. That is reflected in the sales improvement.' Mr Gary Giblen, who follows the company for PaineWebber, expects Safeway to continue showing improvement as a reduced cost structure enables the chain to lower prices, offer better service and further improve sales. 'Mr Burd has entered the virtuous circle of retailing,' he said.</p>

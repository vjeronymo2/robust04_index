			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Naoya Tsuchiya] </F>   [Text] Since the beginning of the year, German long-term  interest rates have risen sharply as if to defy the lowering of  the official discount rate by the German Federal Bank. You might  say that the markets have rebeled against the German Federal  Bank, which is strongly independent and is referred to as the  "central bank among central banks."  <H5>  Loses "Characteristics of Federal Bank" </H5>   Growth in the money supply is also running high at about a  two-digit rate. The Federal Bank has been managing policy in a  manner that showed excessive sensitivity to the seeds of  inflation, losing its "characteristics as a Federal Bank," and  inviting the distrust of financial markets.    The rise in U.S. interest rates, induced by monetary  tightening in the United States in February, led to a hike in  interest rates in the European markets. Although the United  States is taking tightening measures and Germany is following an  opposite relaxation posture, market rates have assumed a  "coupling" phenomenon where they are rising in both regions.    Turbulence in U.S. financial markets can said to have spread  to European markets like those of Germany. Ever since both yen  and European currencies such as the Deutsche mark began to rise  against the dollar, the U.S. Treasury has displayed a noticeable  degree of alarm. One market source interpreted U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's public statements on two separate  occasions as being "tantamount to declaring a dollar crisis."    Officials at a leading city bank commented, "Cautionary  measures were taken out of fear that rising U.S. interest rates  because of a weak dollar would spread to Europe," as the reason  why European nations such as Germany joined in the Japan-U.S.  coordinated market intervention to buy dollars on 4 May. For the  time being, the modestly paced "coordinated actions" by the  United States and Germany are benefiting Japan. The reason is  that actions to support the value of the dollar against European  currencies has temporarily halted the rising trend of the yen.  Nevertheless, officials at the Bank of Japan [BOJ] remain  concerned.    Imbalances in international payments are not an issue  between  the United States and Germany, but the Japan-U.S. balance of  payments shows an annual $130 billion surplus for Japan. As  Germany lowers its official discount rate and the United States  hikes its official discount rate, the United States and Germany  are able to attain their common objective of stabilizing foreign  currency exchange rates. BOJ officials fear that "Japan will now  be asked to discharge its obligations."    The root cause of the weak dollar is the shortage in the  flow  of funds to the United States to compensate for deficits in the  U.S. balance of payments. In March, instead of investment funds  flowing out of Japan which is the nation recording the highest  surpluses against the United States, $11 billion in Japanese  institutional investor funds flowed back into Japan.  <H5>  Surpluses That Fail To Drop </H5>   A senior BOJ official remarks, "We are speaking of an  exercise in futility," in referring to the yen selling-dollar  buying intervention amidst a growing surplus of dollars within  the flow of funds. A BOJ policy committee member goes so far as  to joke, "Perhaps a more effective measure would be to select a  currency other than the dollar to use as a foreign exchange  reserve." The reason is that the several hundred millions of  dollars purchased since last year have dropped in value because  of the progressive strong yen-weak dollar relationship.    Even if the value of the yen rises, Japanese firms have no  choice but to seek their means of survival by exporting to  maintain optimum plant operating levels, which contributes to  the failure of surpluses to decline. Such "weaknesses" of the  Japanese economy lead to pressure for a strong yen and vitiate  intervention efforts.    Even Japan has resumed a policy to implement lower  short-term  interest rates to reinforce the coordinated intervention  actions. One BOJ director states, "There's nothing that says it  would be bad for short-term market rates to fall below the  official discount rate." Normally, the official discount rate,  currently at 1.75 percent, at which the BOJ lends to  private-sector banks serves as the lower limit for the interest  rate structure. This new approach varies decisively from  previous BOJ statements that "common sense dictates that the  official discount rate does not go above market rates," and  indicates that the goal is to drop market rates considerably  lower.    On 13 May the BOJ boosted the money supply and boosted  efforts to establish lower short-term interest rates, and  short-term interest rates are expected to fall further at the  beginning of next week. Market participants predict that,  "Interest on next-day unsecured call money might drop below 2  percent."  <H5>  Decline in Political Leadership </H5>   Although the outlook for the economy "Shows signs of  improvement," according to BOJ President Yasushi Mieno, the BOJ  was forced to reinforce moves towards lower short-term interest  rates for the sake of "coordination." As a minority coalition,  the Hata government could have difficulty even passing a budget  and it suffers from a decline in political leadership. The  United States seems to have toned down its demands on Japan, but  there is no guarantee that it will remain content only with the  interest-lowering actions of the BOJ.    The recent coordinated actions among Japan, the United  States, and Europe resulted in realizing the coordinated goals  of the group, but lurking in the background is the situation  that demands that preference be given to domestic political  affairs. Difficulties are being faced in implementing effective  policies such as hikes in U.S. official discount rates and  reductions in Japanese recurring surpluses, which means that it  would not be surprising to see a sudden disruption in the  "coordinated actions." If that should occur, market upheavals  may not be restricted to the rising of long-term interest rates.</p>

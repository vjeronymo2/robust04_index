			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Danish No voters start to wobble COMMUNITY leaders struggling to find a solution to the Danish problem must hope that not all Danes are as uncompromising as the middle-aged couple who run a flower shop in the Copenhagen suburb of Frederiksberg. 'We voted No last time and we'll vote No again. We don't want them deciding everything for us. We want to stay independent,' says Bodil, who runs the shop with his wife, Mogens. The flower shop hardliners underline the difficulties of trying to make revised Maastricht proposals palatable both to other EC governments and to a sceptical domestic electorate. Assuming Denmark can agree at Edinburgh a deal on its Maastricht reservations, the proposals will have to be passed by another referendum, probably next May or June, to allow the treaty to take effect. For the Danish sceptics, the priority is to prevent the bigger EC countries and the bureaucrats of Brussels from interfering in Danish life. Other Danes, however, are less trenchant. A sizeable number of people who said No in the June 2 referendum, when the treaty was rejected by 46,000 votes, are clearly thinking of voting Yes next time. But former Yes voters who plan to say No next time are very hard to find. Forecasts of dire problems for the Danish economy if the country again rejects Maastricht are undoubtedly helping to strengthen the tendency. The government believes that 100,000 Danish jobs may have been lost as the result of uncertainty since June. The Frederiksberg florists' young assistant, ear-ringed and with his hair knotted at the back, voices a typical waverer's view: 'I voted No in June,' he says. 'But with all this currency trouble and the unemployment, I'm worried about what happens to the economy if we vote No again.' European defence co-operation - a key area where Denmark is seeking a Maastricht exemption - is another topic of concern. Ms Heidi Petersen, a 21-year-old office assistant from Roskilde, near Copenhagen, voted No in June because she was afraid that when she has children they might one day have to serve in a European defence force. 'If they make it so that we don't have to join a European army, I'll vote Yes next time,' she says. However, some currents of opinion are running in the opposite direction. A pro-Maastricht Copenhagen doctor, who voted for the treaty in June, said he worried that there would be a second No. He cited signs of growing nationalism in Denmark, as well as the rest of Europe, and feared that the upsurge of racialist violence in Germany would cause many Danes to vote No. In October, when Denmark's political parties agreed on the special arrangements they several opinion polls pointed to a substantial majority in a second referendum. But a Yes vote would be in danger if this so-called 'national compromise' breaks down - as it has threatened to do this week after the presentation of Britain's Maastricht proposals. As the Danish government tries to balance objections to a tortuous series of amendments to a somewhat ethereal treaty, the plot at the palace of Holyrood House could easily start to look like a scene from Hamlet's Elsinore.</p>

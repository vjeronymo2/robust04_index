			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Schwab sees third-quarter improvement CHARLES SCHWAB, the largest discount brokerage company in the US, said it expected to post a sharp increase in third-quarter profits to between Dollars 18m and Dollars 21m when it releases its latest three-monthly earnings next month. In the same quarter a year ago, it earned just Dollars 7.8m, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The third quarter of 1992 was an unusually weak period for the firm. Its latest earnings, while up sharply from a year ago, will still be below the first and second quarters of this year, when the broker reported net income of Dollars 35.4m and Dollars 31.6m, respectively. This steady, if modest, decline in Schwab's earnings during 1993 suggests that, while stock markets have been reaching record highs and investor interest in equities has been booming, the overall level of trading activity may have peaked. Results for the full year, however, will still come in considerably higher than the Dollars 81.2m earned in 1992, which was itself a record.</p>

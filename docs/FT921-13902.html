			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Homework on house rental ARE THERE any publications which may guide me through the methods and pitfalls of letting a house on a short term lease until the property market improves? The consumers' Association Which? guide to Buying, Owning and Selling a Flat may be of assistance. The Law Society produces short guide leaflets. However, it would be wise to consult a solicitor if you are going to effect a lease of the property but need to ensure vacant possession at the end of the letting. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernyak article under the "Military Review" rubric: </F> "...And Then There Was This Big Bang"]    [Text] We Expect GI's    As reported by a high-ranking officer of the Russian General  Staff, the details of maneuvers involving Russian and U.S. units  are under active discussion in the military department.  According to preliminary information, these maneuvers could  take place in the Volga Military District in the summer. The  idea put forward by U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of holding maneuvers in Germany,  which was discussed during their recent meeting in the FRG, did  not, to put it mildly, find support among the Germans who,  according to the officer's account, are not at all keen on  having Russian and American tanks rumbling under the windows of  their homes as in 1945.    It is expected that the U.S. Army's 3d Mechanized Infantry  Division and the Russian Army's 27th Motorized Infantry will  take part in the maneuvers. However, according to the latest  information, each side will send only 500-700 servicemen to the  maneuvers. The very small number of participants in the  proposed exercises is due to the Russian military department's  difficult financial situation. "However, high-ranking military  officials are today discussing a compromise solution whereby the  Americans would assume the bulk of the cost," the officer stated.    At the same time, according to the officer's information,  General Staff analysts are seriously concerned that the top  Russian military leadership could face serious protests from the  population of the Volga region and find itself the focus of  unprecedenteed conflict in connection with the preparation of  the exercises. According to information being received by the  Russian General Staff, the idea of joint maneuvers in the United  States has had a mixed response.   <H5>    Off to the States in High Spirits </H5>   According to unofficial information, more than 200 Russian  generals and other officers visited the United States in 1993.  Short courses, seminars, symposiums, and conferences make up a  far from complete list of the aims of their visits. Even  according to the roughest estimates, it cost the U.S. Department  of Defense a considerable amount of money to look after the  Russians. Many Russian generals frequently visit the American  continent in circumvention of the law forbidding representatives  of leading state organs to travel abroad at the host side's  expense.    Staff in the appropriate agencies who had initially informed  the Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU] about secret Pentagon  plans to work with top Russian Armed Forces military staff  eventually gave up. It is impossible for ordinary operational  staff to fight against generals, even those violating the  Russian president's edict.   <H5>    The Sick Serve in the Army </H5>   As reported by a high-ranking officer from the defense  minister's immediate entourage, members of the Russian  Federation Security Council who attended the 19 January Security  Council session were misled when informed that Pavel Grachev was  absent because he was "carrying out a task for the president."  In actual fact, according to this officer's account, Grachev  was in a military hospital on the outskirts of Moscow. It is  noted that this is not the first time that the 46-year-old army  general, who always gives the appearance of being hale and  hearty, has had health problems. Subordinates recall in this  regard one of the minister's favorite phrases: "The sick don't  serve in the army." It is noteworthy that often Grachev's  indisposition is carefully covered up in the Defense Ministry  and coincides with his reporting to the top organs of state  power.    Russian Defense Ministry Press Secretary Yelena Agapova  denied the report of Pavel Grachev's illness.    At the same time the likelihood of Grachev's removal from  the  post of minister in the near future is remote, according to  information stemming from circles close to the Russian president.    Remember Afghanistan, Comrade?    As reported at the press service of the CIS Joint Armed  Forces High Command, Colonel Viktor Timofeyev, commander of the  201st Russian Motorized Infantry Division, which is stationed in  Tajikistan, was recently removed from his post. The reason for  this was not reported; however, sources in the military  department suggest that Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander  of the CIS Coalition Peacemaking Forces in Tajikistan, played a  considerable role here.    In the opinion of those sources, it was not difficult to  find  a formal reason for Timofeyev's removal from his post:  Discipline in the division has not been not brilliant, to put  it mildly, the vaunted contract personnel's actions are  unpredictable, and several serious incidents connected, among  other things, with drunkenness among the personnel have occurred  of late. However, it is thought that one of the main reasons  for the conflict lies in the differing approaches to the  peacemaking forces' actions in Tajikistan. Timofeyev, who comes  from Leninabad Oblast and has a pretty good knowledge of the  language and customs of the local population, advocated maximum  neutrality on the part of the division and noninterference in  the internal affairs of an independent state and was also  opposed to expansion of the Russian military presence there.  Pyankov, however, is regarded as a supporter of a tougher  approach, and his stance could be summed up by the phrase: "If  we have signed a treaty with the present government we should  stop any incursions by gummen." Such a standpoint was typical  of Soviet generals in Afghanistan.   <H5>    Announcement! </H5>   It is no secret that Russia has drastically cut back on its  arms sales in recent years, and as a result earns a lot less  hard currency -- $1.9 billion in 1992 as opposed to $21.2  billion in 1982. Perhaps there is not enough advertising? That  is why the first issue of VOYENNYY PARAD/MILITARY PARADE -- a  Russian military-industrial complex magazine -- appeared in  January. Printed in Italy, the magazine is as good as any of its  Western counterparts. Information about the latest Russian  weapons and their specifications and performance characteristics  is given in English and Russian. The first issue presents the  pride of the Russian military-industrial complex, ranging from  the Ka-50 "Black Shark" helicopter to the "Tor" air defense  missile system and the "MSTA-S" self-propelled howitzer. The  magazine has some pretty good writers -- the greetings message  to readers is penned by Viktor Chernomyrdin. We were pleased to  see that the publishers took a photograph of one of the latest  pieces of equipment from KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA.   <H5>    Anecdote? </H5>   The military carries out a nuclear explosion. The next day a  general holds a press conference. A Western journalist asks:  "General, why did you announce yesterday that the yield of the  explosion was 5 kilotonnes when it was actually ten times  greater?" The general scratches his head: "We ourselves  thought it was 5 kilotonnes, and then there was this big bang..."</p>

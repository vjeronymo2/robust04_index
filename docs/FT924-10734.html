			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities firmer after late trading Wall Street US share prices firmed yesterday afternoon in spite of some bad economic news and disappointing earnings reports, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 15.67 to close at 3,251.40, with most of the gains coming in the last minutes of trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also higher, up 1.64 at 420.13, while the Amex composite was up 2.35 at 379.00 and the Nasdaq composite 4.44 firmer at 601.39. Turnover on the NYSE was 203m shares as rises outpaced declines by 1012 to 713. The morning's economic releases were mostly negative: while consumer spending and personal income both rose 0.7 per cent last month, special factors, partly related to Hurricane Andrew, distorted the figures. Some analysts said that the overall picture was one of continued weakness. The 0.4 per cent fall in durable goods orders in September was also worrying as the market had been expecting a small rise. Some of the earnings reports were equally unsettling. Ford dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 38 1/8 in turnover of nearly 2m shares after announcing a loss of Dollars 159m, or 43 cents a share, in the third quarter. The figures were well below analysts' estimates of around 25 cents a share, and the company also warned that the losses could continue into the fourth quarter. Borden fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 after announcing a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 376.8m, a marked deterioration from the Dollars 98m profit earned a year earlier. The loss was incurred, however, after the company took a Dollars 450m restructuring charge that will help pay for the closure of some packaging plants in Europe and the withdrawal from some North American snacks operations. Better news was forthcoming from USF&amp;G, which rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 1/4 after the insurance group unveiled consolidated net income of Dollars 5m in the third quarter, an improvement on the Dollars 25m loss at the same stage in 1991. The company also reported a continued improvement in its core property/casualty operations. Tandem Computers climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in after Morgan Stanley, the securities house, responded to the recent good earnings figures by raising its profit forecast for Tandem's current fiscal year and upgrading its rating on the stock. Life Re enjoyed a strong debut. More than 10m shares of the reinsurer were floated at Dollars 22 each, and reached Dollars 24 7/8 at the end of the day. Airlines remained strong, in spite of further competitive price-cutting. AMR, parent of American, rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 64 1/4 and UAL held steady at Dollars 121 3/8 although Delta slid Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 58 3/8 , reversing its morning gains. Canada TORONTO stocks rallied to end sharply higher as uncertainty surrounding Canada's constitution fades and investors focus on the economy and potential declines in interest rates. Volume on the TSE index swelled to its highest level since December 15, 1988, ending up 48.3 points at 3,334.7 on turnover of 48.3m valued at CDollars 495.5m. Advancing issues led those declining 370 to 194 while 262 remained unchanged.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Bush plays Clinton draft issue to the full: Revised economic blueprint for second term being drawn up by James Baker PRESIDENT George Bush served warning yesterday he will not stop criticising Mr Bill Clinton for avoiding the draft and taking part in demonstrations against the Vietnam war 23 years ago. It was time, he said, for his Democratic opponent in the presidential election 'to level with the American people,' writes Jurek Martin. The second string to his arguments in the two remaining presidential debates, Mr Bush indicated, was that the economy was not in such bad shape. Mr James Baker, his chief of staff, was preparing a revised economic blueprint for a second term, to be implemented by a completely new administration team under Mr Baker's direction, at least initially. Mr Clinton was instantly dismissive of Mr Baker's new broom. 'They're on a losing streak and the coach wants to fire the team. In America, when you have a losing season the coach gets fired, not the team.' Appearing unannounced on a morning television programme commemorating the 200th anniversary of the building of the White House, Mr Bush said repeatedly that he was not impugning Mr Clinton's patriotism but his judgment and character in protesting against the war while Americans were held prisoner by the North Vietnamese. He directly addressed Mr Clinton's most effective intervention in Sunday's debate. 'He talked about my father. My father served his country and my father believed in duty, honour and country. And I, like my father, do not believe in McCarthyism and this isn't McCarthyism.' Mr Bush said Mr Clinton 'ought to come clean on the draft. I mean, a lot of kids ducked the draft, some of them went to Canada. But they didn't try to have it both ways; protect the political viability and then tell different stories about it.' He bristled when asked if he, too, should 'level' with the country about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair, saying he and his staff had answered thousands of questions on the subject. Mr Clinton responded by saying his draft record and Iran-Contra were not directly comparable because 'the meagre evidence we have supports my account while. . . the documentary evidence of the phone calls of two of (Mr Bush's) cabinet members, the record of the meeting he was in, all that stuff, contradicts his account.' The president's answers suggest a continuing conviction that Mr Clinton can be brought down by the issue and a certainty he will try to make the most of it in the next two debates. To Mr Bush's critics and to the Clinton campaign this smacks of desperation.</p>

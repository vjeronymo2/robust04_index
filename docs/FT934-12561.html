			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald buys Crabbie's MACDONALD Martin Distill-eries, the producer of Glenmorangie malt whisky, has bought Crabbie's Old Scottish Green Ginger Wine from United Distillers, the Guinness spirits division. The acquisition, for an undisclosed price, includes trade marks, stocks of maturing and cased wine, and a bottling line. It will be funded from existing bank borrowings. Macdonald said Crabbie's would not make a material contribution to profit in the early years but, with marketing support and increased volumes, was expected to generate 'worthwhile' longer-term earnings. Crabbie's is the leading brand in Scotland and number two in the UK to Stone's.</p>

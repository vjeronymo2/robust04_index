			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS WRANGLE OVER THE BUDGET  </P> <P> How's this for a solution to our budget crisis? Design budgets with two-year  life spans; have the people vote on them at congressional elections in  November, and give them three alternative budgets to choose from: one proposed  by Congress, one proposed by the White House and one proposed by non-elected  officials from the Treasury and OMB. What a great way to force a deadline on  our representatives and make them accountable!  </P> <P> PHIL RINEHART, Los Angeles  </P></p>

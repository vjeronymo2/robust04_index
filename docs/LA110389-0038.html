			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRESCENTA VALLEY'S SPIRITED DEFENSIVE EFFORT WASTED, 21-0  </P> <P> Despite an outstanding defensive effort, Crescenta Valley High failed in its  bid to guarantee itself a playoff berth Thursday night, falling, 21-0, to Muir  in a Pacific League game at Glendale High.  </P> <P> Muir, ranked fifth in Division II, capitalized on a long pass, a short drive  and a Crescenta Valley miscue to dispose of the undersized Falcons.  </P> <P> The Mustang defense also clamped down, intercepting four passes by Ryan Kadletz  and holding Crescenta Valley to 33 yards.  </P> <P> "Their defense was just too big and fast for our offense," said Falcon Coach  Jim Beckenhauer, whose team held Muir to 232 yards.  </P> <P> If Crescenta Valley (6-3, 2-2) loses to first-place Arcadia next week, the odds  of the Falcons making the postseason will be long.  </P> <P> With less than two minutes expired in the fourth quarter, Dustin Benedict  scooped up an errant lateral and ran for a 45-yard score. Sedric Thomas, who  led all rushers with 32 yards in six carries, hit Elic Mahone on a conversion  pass to widen the lead to 21-0.  </P> <P> Benedict, who barely had to break stride, was as stunned as anyone when the  ball bounced into his hands. "The back was gone so I just took off," he said.  "I just turned around and there was the ball. Just me and the ball."  </P> <P> Muir (7-1-1, 3-1), which had a 7-0 advantage at intermission, moved 38 yards on  its first possession of the second half and capped the seven-play drive with a  three-yard touchdown run by Carlton Greer. Eric Steinlight blocked the  extra-point attempt and Muir settled for a 13-0 edge.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley was unable to capitalize on four Muir fumbles in the first  half but the Falcons limited the ordinarily explosive Muir offense to 124 yards  -- 91 through the air.  </P> <P> While the Falcons' defense flourished, their offense floundered: Crescenta  Valley was held to just nine yards in the half.  </P> <P> Much of the Mustangs' passing yardage came with 9:33 to play in the half when  Thomas found Demetrius Martin wide open on a streak for a 50-yard touchdown.  Todd Elkins added the extra point to give Muir a 7-0 advantage.  </P> <P> On Muir's ensuing possession, Crescenta Valley linebacker Greg Thran stripped  the ball from Sam Williford and recovered the fumble at the Mustang 41.  </P> <P> The Falcons' opportunity to even the score fizzled on the following play,  however, when a screen pass was batted by running back Jason Schwaiger and  intercepted by Cassius Conway.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley's Mike Parker jumped on a fumble -- his second recovery of the  game -- midway through the first quarter at the Muir 19. The Mustang defense  did not budge and Damon Martin missed wide on a 31-yard field-goal try.  </P></p>

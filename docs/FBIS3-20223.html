			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  described statements made by the European Union [EU] foreign  ministers in Ioannina encouraging Skopje's [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] provocativeness as strange.  Venizelos called upon the EU foreign ministers to be more  careful when making statements so that [FYROM President Kiro]  Gligorov does not see them as an encouragement toward his  positions. The spokesman added: The Greek positions on Skopje  are well known, specific, firm, and clear.    Referring to the recent violations of national airspace by  Turkish aircraft, Venizelos said that the neighboring country  has circles of the political and military leadership who  cultivate a sense of tension.</p>

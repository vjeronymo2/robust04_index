			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / British Steel says more jobs may go BRITISH STEEL warned yesterday that it might have to make further job cuts unless the European Commission supported an orderly restructuring of the European steel industry and curbed allegedly unfair imports from eastern Europe. The warning came as the privatised steelmaker announced a Pounds 51m pre-tax loss for the six months to October 3, compared with a Pounds 19m profit a year ago. British Steel's shares fell 3p to equal an all-time low of 46 1/2 p, as the company became the first privatisation stock to omit its interim dividend. British Steel has already reduced its UK workforce by 20 per cent to 41,800 over the past two years, and the total will fall further to just over 40,000 by the end of the current financial year. But yesterday Mr Brian Moffat, chief executive, said that if the European Commission failed to uphold its principles of a 'level playing field' in the European market, efficient private sector companies such as British Steel would have 'no other course but to further retract'. British Steel is one of 15 big European steelmakers which last month urged the Commission to agree a programme of political, commercial and financial assistance for the recession-torn industry, which has seen prices fall by 30 per cent since 1989. British Steel says the over-riding requirements are to ensure that restructuring and capacity reductions are driven by market demand and not impeded by the introduction of state aids, and that the dumping of steel into Europe is avoided through 'robust and effective' anti-dumping mechanisms. 'Effective early action on these two issues is critical to the industry's future, and to that of British Steel,' said Sir Alistair Frame, chairman. The comments from British Steel's executives come a week before a meeting of EC industry ministers which will discuss the proposals, along with controversial plans by the state-controlled Spanish steel industry to replace a plant at Sestao in northern Spain with a minimill. Mr Moffat said this would still be less efficient than British Steel's former Ravenscraig plant in Scotland. British Steel has complained to the Department of Trade and Industry about imports of Czech steel, and wants similar action to that taken by France and Germany, which have pegged east European imports to about 20 per cent above 1991 levels.

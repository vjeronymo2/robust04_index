			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By Kim Chong-nae of CHOSON ILBO] </F>   [Text]  Incompatible Party Lines    Both the ruling and opposition camps are absorbed in  wrangles  over party lines. This phenomenon set in as soon as the  audit-and-inspection drive, carried on by new government since  its launching seemingly for the liquidation of the past,  somewhat slowed down. On the other hand, it is also true that  the disputes effectively put the brakes on the drive and the  reform movement in both their speed and width.    The party line disputes are likely to reach all the way up  to  the Kim Yong-sam government. They are something totally new to  the nation's political history which is run through with  confrontations between "power and relationship."    Needless to say, it is also a fact that the party line  dispute is a double-edged sword in that it is a very risky  experiment that can produce a fatal impact on the whole spectrum  of the political situation.    The dissensions within the ruling camp including the  Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] led to controversies over whether  to extend the current audit-and-inspection drive, and to a  government-opposition dialogue, a leadership-level dialogue, and  further to abortive National Assembly sessions. The disputes  centered on two factions in the DLP--the RDP [former  Reunification Democratic Party] faction dedicated to reforms and  its rival, the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] faction.    Although it was not open, the most serious of the disputes  within the ruling camp was over the method of reform. In late  March, when three lawmakers, including former National Assembly  speakers Pak Chun-kyu and Kim Chae-sun, were forced to retire  from politics and Reps. Chong Tong- ho and Yim Chun-won left the  DLP--all in the swirl from the public disclosure of  properties--the handwriting was on the wall. The former ruling  forces led by the DJP faction protested that the crackdown on  "the past" is outrageous. They unanimously insisted that  "reforms should be carried out in accordance with law and  system." "The audit-inspection drive against selected targets as  in the cases of `targeted investigation' and `individual  investigation,'" they charged, "points to a possible ulterior  motive." They contended that the crackdown was politically  motivated, that it targeted members of the DJP and NDRP [former  New Democratic Republican Party] factions and on ex-military  leaders.    However, under the pressure of the prevailing circumstances,  their voices faded before having any chances of stirring an open  debate. The reformists of the RDP faction brushed off the  charges as "a nonsense." The group argued that reforms are  inevitable and that the political purification under the  keep-the-upstream-water-clean slogan is one thing that has to be  done even if there are differences over the method. It also  argued that to say that the past should not be questioned is to  say that there should be no reform.    The factional difference continued and it came to the fore  at  every opportunity. The so-called "policy shift controversy" was  a variation of the party line dispute. Whenever President Kim  Yong-sam issued a new "declaration," it prompted different  interpretations between factions.    The first clash came over the president's policy speech to  the National Assembly on 22 October. The speech, focusing on  "the future," suggested the unity of the two forces--the "Han  River force" which performed the Han River economic miracle and  the "democratization force." Leaders of the former ruling  factions took it as a signal for a policy shift. They welcomed  it. "The abominable audit-and-inspection drive is nearly over,"  they said. Further, they saw the president's references to the  unity of the two forces as the show of an intent to form a new  ruling force unattached to the past. However, it was not the  case with the reformist group. "Shelving the reforms? No way.  ..." The reform program is the central, keynote policy of the  new government, they insisted, and therefore it will be firmly  kept in place through to the end of the President Kim's tenure.  They warned against "distorting the meaning" of the president's  speech. Chongwadae's response was even stronger. It usually  jumps to its feet whenever there is a talk about a policy shift.    Trends were even more obvious after the 8 November  Chongwadae  meeting held to push for a new economy, in which President Kim  called for the "building for the future." The former ruling  faction saw it as a "policy shift" but Chongwadae officials  explained the next day that "any interpretation suggesting a  policy shift is at variance with the fact."  At Feud Over Everything    The dispute between Reps. Yu Song-hwan and Kim Yun-hwan over  the latter's past record was a case typifying the difference  over "the past" between the RDP and DJP factions. At a 12  October National Assembly Education Committee hearing on the  administration of the Education Ministry, Yu questioned the past  record of Kim, the virtual leader of the DJP faction.    He dropped a bombshell by saying "How about inviting Rep.  Kim  Yun-hwan to this hearing? He was a member of the Yujonghoe in  the National Assembly [in the Pak Chong-hui era] and the head of  the Chongwadae staff in the Chon Tu-hwan government. In the No  Tae-u government, he served as the minister of state and the  floor leader of the ruling party. I propose that we ask him what  prompted him to do what he did in those days and what sort of  patriotism he has these days to justify what he is doing now."    The DJP faction flew into a rage when Yu's remarks were  reported. The faction was seized with group psychology,  contending that if that should be a sin, there would be no one  clean in the DJP faction. The RDP faction and even Chongwadae  worked feverishly to allay the fury. According to a widespread  observation, however, the episode eventually proved to be a  contributing factor to about 36 "rebellious" votes cast by DJP  faction members in a vote on a proposal for the release of Reps.  Kim Chong-in and Pak Chol-on.    Kim Yun-hwan made no open rebuttal of Yun's remarks. He only  expressed his feeling by saying that "the important thing is not  the position a person held in the past but what he did in that  position." In the RDP faction, while some accused Yu Song-hwan  of a "grandstand play," it was an undeniable fact that many  others basically shared the same feelings with Yu.    Similarly, the record of Chairman Kim Chong-pil became an  issue. Although there has been no formal debate inside or  outside the party, the RDP faction--the reformist group in  particular--openly discussed an image of incompatibility between  "reform" and Kim Chong-pil, a former "key leader of the 5.16 [l6  May, 1961, coup] force." Then came the controversy over the  qualification of former Secretary General Choe Hyong-u as member  of the party Supreme Committee, sparking dissensions within the  DLP. In the wake of that controversy, calls for changing the  party chairman are not about to subside. The squabbles over the  presidential decree that prohibited financial transactions using  false names or aliases and the follow-up measures, plus the  wrangles over the key economic policies and the government's  foreign and unification policies, have all added to the  political line disputes within the ruling camp.    The party line disputes, when viewed from a wider  perspective, extend all the way to the North Korea issue, the  nuclear issue in particular. Some DLP members of the National  Assembly Committee on Foreign and Unification Affairs would  assail cabinet members, particularly Foreign Minister Han  Wan-sang, at every party-government session, and even at the  committee's meetings in the National Assembly, for the  government's appeasement policy toward North Korea. Some even  accuse Han of espousing a peculiar ideology.    Meanwhile, other lawmakers criticize the government's  political lines, charging that some presidential secretaries  belong to the activist camp and have connections with  chaeya [reformist camp] groups. They would argue  loudly at private gatherings that no leftist or progressive  reform has ever succeeded. Those presidential secretaries, they  argue, have given the impression as if the government were being  pushed around by them and, as a result, business communities are  left unable to dispel their uneasiness. And the uneasiness is  making an economic recovery impossible, they add.  Political Line Dispute in the DP, Too    The Democratic Party [DP] under the Yi Ki-taek leadership is  also seized with a serious case of party line dispute. In the  configuration of its internal factions, however, the DP today is  markedly different from what it used to be. First of all,  factions became far more complicated and diverse. Groupings,  large and small, cropped up after the retirement of Kim  Tae-chung from politics, while many former chaeya  activists have raised their collective voices against  conservative cliques within the opposition camp. A more  important change since the launching of the Kim Yong-sam  government is the fact that diverse voices began to be heard on  the role of an opposition party and that polemics on the  political line thus started are heating up as days pass by.    Opposition parties in the past also had their shares of the  party line dispute. And such disputes proved to be a leading  factor drawing the line between the mainstream and the  nonmainstream. But in those days, the dispute was structurally  simple. It was over how to fight a seemingly formidable  dictatorial regime. Thus, it led to the polemic on a clear-cut  opposition party, which remains a legacy of the opposition camp.  This is not to say that there were no differences within the  opposition over economic and other policies. Such arguments,  however, were obscured by the absolute proposition--the  overthrow of the dictatorial regime.    Things have changed now. It is true that the various  policies  successively announced by the Kim Yong-sam government under the  banner of reform triggered numerous disputes over their contents  and speed and the method of implementation; however, they  reflected the "opposition's perspective" of the past to some  degrees. This drove the opposition into a new situation in which  it was compelled to tackle the question of how to deal with the  new government--more specifically, how to respond to the  policies of the new government. In this sense, the past 9 months  were an ordeal and experiment for the DP. Amid this ordeal and  experiment, wrangles over the party line in various areas came  to the fore in full details, without being obscured by an  overthrow-the- dictatorship slogan as was the case with the  opposition in the past.    The dissension is essentially different in nature from the  "clear-cut opposition party" debate in the past. In the past,  the question was who resists the dictatorial regime more  staunchly. The focus of internal struggle now shifted to who can  develop policies that can captivate the hearts of people and who  can cultivate the capabilities to take power. Anti-government  struggle is no longer the only task of an opposition party. The  opposition is confronted by the new task of self-help and  self-development. Unveiling itself to the full in the face of  the new task is the "difference in philosophy" which had been  dormant within the opposition and which could spawn a long-term  intraparty discord if not handled properly.    This is not to say that the DP is all through with the  obsolete "clear- cut opposition party" polemic. A typical  example in this respect is the joint session of party executives  and legislators of the DP held on 3 November in the National  Assembly. At the session, Kim Sang-hyon, leader of the  nonmainstreamers, who lost to Yi Ki-taek in a runoff vote in the  DP national convention in March, launched a frontal attack on  Chairman Yi Ki-taek's political line ("New Line"). He said:    "I do not think that the Kim Yong-sam government is a  civilian government. Have we ever defined it a civilian  government as a consensus of the party? It is a government  created by a collusion with the military government in the  three-party merger. Therefore, President Kim Yong-sam can be  called a civilian president but the Kim Yong-sam government  cannot be called a civilian government. Presently, the people  think that the opposition is missing and drifting. We should  take on the Kim Yong-sam government as an object of reform. We  must not cling to or be sucked into the reform program of the  Kim Yong-sam government. During the parliamentary inspection of  the administration, Chairman Yi said that the DP would shelve  the drive for the liquidation of the past and instead focus on  the economy. I do not mean to say that the economy can be put on  the back burner, but his speech contained no alternative plans  for a positive liquidation of the past nor an agenda of  opposition struggle.    "Most important is the liquidation of military culture.  Morality cannot be established without the liquidation of the  past. We are running the risk of playing bridesmaid to the Kim  Yong-sam government. The Kim Yong-sam reform is a deception as  long as an ex-leader of the 5.16 coup stays on as DLP chairman.  As long as the ex-leader of the 5.16 coup remains as DLP  chairman, it is necessary for us to cut off official contacts  with the DLP and maintain unofficial contacts, and to lead on  the public opinion."    Earlier, on 28 September, DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek told  reporters that he would "put greater emphasis on the economy of  the people than on the liquidation of the past." And in the  subsequent National Assembly speech, he declared the  future-oriented party New Line. Kim Sang Hyon was attacking the  announced party line. It is a "strategy running the risk of  reducing the opposition to a bridesmaid's role for the Kim  Yong-sam government," he charged.    At the joint session that day, Yi Pu-yong, member of the  Supreme Committee, spearheaded the attack. He is the leader of a  reform group in the DP led by former chaeya  activists. He said:    "There was a conflict in substance between Chairman Yi's  National Assembly speech and the interpellation by DP  legislators, causing confusion to considerable degrees. During  the parliamentary inspection of the administration, while  legislators requested the presence of many witnesses, the  chairman held that we should not bring in too many businessmen  as witnesses, causing a disarray among them. Furthermore, it is  a problem that the chairman declared that there would be no  linkage between the liquidation of the past and budget and  reform legislation."    More scathing criticisms were heard at a general meeting of  DP lawmakers held the next day. Chang Ki-uk, a member of the  reform group, referred to the "clear-cut opposition party  polemic," a vulnerable point of opposition leaders in general.  He cited the cases of Yi Chol-sung, former chairman of the New  Democratic Party, who proposed a middle-of-the-road merger but  had to give it up and resign as chairman, and Yi Min-u, former  president of the New Democratic Party, who, during the struggle  for direct presidential election system in the Fifth Republic  days, adopted a lukewarm attitude toward the ruling party's  offensive for cabinet system and was eventually ousted from  first-line politics by the two Kim's [Kim Yong-sam and Kim  Tae-chung]. "The lesson is that the opposition party should have  a clear-cut goal," he insisted.    The nonmainstreamers and ex-chaeya activists thus  attacked Chairman Yi. Never had their offensive been stronger.  Their focus was on parliamentary strategy. More basically,  however, their criticism unveiled the deep-rooted difference  over the Kim Yong-sam reform and the opposition's response to  it. Collectively, they demand that the DP leadership recognize  clearly the limitations of the Kim Yong-sam reform as a spinoff  of the three-party merger and launch a more clear-cut struggle  against the ruling party. They are questioning the attitude of  Chairman Yi Ki-taek in this respect.  Diverse Perspectives in the DP    Their mounting offensive against him took some of the starch  out of Chairman Yi Ki-taek. Earlier, he had shown a rejection of  the word "linkage" between pending political issues and a  National Assembly agenda, but he has modified his line a bit. He  now says that he is "prepared for a linkage." The National  Assembly proceedings are currently revolving along this line of  the opposition.    Then, how far can the nonmainstreamers go with their  political line offensive? The history of the opposition parties  shows that in a number of cases, forces that led the struggle  for the cause of "clear-cut opposition party" emerged triumphant  in the end. Then, does the latest party line dispute in the DP  after all belong to that category? It is difficult to find an  answer to that question. One thing is clear, however, and it is  that judging from the trends, it is not necessarily the same as  the cases in the past. There are signs everywhere that it is not.    First of all, the circumstances surrounding the opposition  have changed. How it should fight the government remains its  problem. But more importantly, the public demands that the  opposition transform itself in conformity to the change of the  times. The days are gone when people applauded the DP for its  uncompromising, hard-line struggles. The DP learned its lesson  from the results of its refusal to attend the inauguration of  the president and its controversial boycott of a by-election. On  the other hand, the public reaction to Chairman Yi's National  Assembly speech was relatively affirmative, unlike the uproar it  sparked among the nonmainstreamers and ex-chaeya  activists.    Moreover, the "clear-cut opposition party" polemic in the  past usually involved scandals of behind-the-scenes bargains  with the ruling camp. Whenever the opposition slackened the  reins of its anti-government struggle, rumors circulated had it  that there were briberies or that they struck a secret deal.  Morality of opposition figures, rather than their political  lines, were the issue. That has now changed. Today, the line  itself is literally the issue.    The fact that the political line, not morality, has become  the issue means that a total victory or defeat has become an  impossible thing in the political game. It means that one can  compromise but no one can force his or her plan on others.    A typical example is the new system outlawing the use of  false names and aliases in financial transactions. The DP has  formed an anti-DLP front under a single, umbrella  slogan--"Alternative legislation be enacted." The removal of the  umbrella would expose two conflicting currents, however,  including one demanding that the system be operated and  reinforced in a more reform-worthy direction. If it were the old  opposition party, and if the system should still be in the stage  of a hypothetical one, the demand could have surely been  applauded as an attitude befitting an opposition party. It was  not the case this time. Many insisted that "the government plan  should be eased up drastically in line with economic theories."  Some lawmakers openly charged that "YS [Kim Yong-sam] is  preoccupied with his popularity in disregard of the threat of an  economic collapse." They even appeared to be painting a picture  of "true courage" of themselves.    The controversy over the new financial system did not stop  at  it but escalated into a debate covering the whole spectrum of  the economy. Members of an Economic Justice faction led by  ex-chaeya activists argued that only when there is  economic justice can there be a long-term economic recovery.  They pay relatively greater concerns to the problems of workers,  farmers and the urban masses and to the justice of distribution.  On the other hand, realists on the economy contend that the  pressing task of our economy is to improve its competitiveness  at world markets and to revitalize itself. Chairman Yi's New  Line is an indication that the latter have become a major force  in the DP.    Chairman Yi's New Line is condensed in his 27 October  National Assembly speech. He said in it: "Our economy is  confronted by an overall crisis. It is bogged down in a serious,  long-term recession. At a time when we are in what may well be  called an unlimited economic war, we are growing increasingly  uncompetitive as days go by."    The key words in that speech were "the 21st century" and  "improvement in the nation's competitiveness." And to that end,  the speaker stressed the pressing need for internationalization  and the promotion of science. All these expressions and the  consciousness behind it were impossible to find in the  opposition party textbook in the past. Although the speech was  later criticized by the nonmainstreamers from their standpoint  of parliamentary strategy, it was positively received by far  more people in the party on the day it was delivered. Many of  them found the speech fresh because it was the first attempt to  push the opposition's perspective to the horizon of the future  and an alternative plan.    In fact, that the opposition leader focused on the future  rather than the past, on alternative plans as well as on  criticisms, was not the only important thing about the speech.  It offered a confirmation that the New Line transcends the old  framework of the opposition in its awareness of the economy and  the future course of the nation.    Therefore, the party line dispute over Chairman Yi's New  Line  essentially takes on the appearance of a confrontation over the  "difference in perspective." So, it can be said that the dispute  is, in its nature, difficult to resolve.    In addition, the factional interests inside the DP are  complicated. When former Chairman Kim Tae-chung led the  opposition, he could manage the diverse forces in the party,  ranging from the conservative to the progressive, and keep them  together. He could do so in part thanks to his charisma, but it  is also true that the circumstances at the time were in his  favor. First of all, it was then imperative that the opposition  should be united if it was to take power. The reverse is the  case now. The DP today has neither a powerful, established  leadership nor a target clear enough to rally against.  Especially, the present factions in the DP are still in the  phase of internal struggle and, consequently, preoccupied with  gaining the control of the party. Thus, the wrangles over the  political lines both in the DLP and the DP have emerged as a  major factor making the whole picture of the political situation  instable.    With regard to future political developments, the political  line disputes currently going on in the ruling and opposition  camps are of extremely important significance and nature.    First, in view of the inherent nature of the "political  line," results of the disputes are likely to become a key factor  determining future political territories.    Moreover, they will seriously influence the political  positions and careers of everyone, be it the primary parties in  the disputes (or political factions) or the onlookers. The  disputes will extend into the upcoming series of major political  agendas, beginning with the DLP national convention scheduled  for May next year.    Second, the political line dispute is different in its  nature  from the competition for a position which is temporary and  limited in scope. Inasmuch as it is a confrontation over  principle and theory involving both the outlook on the present  political situation and the blueprint for the future, the former  takes on far more complicated and serious features than the  latter. Although the disputes at the moment appear to be limited  in scale, it is highly possible that they will further expand  and intensify--depending on developments in the situation.    Third, in consequence of these possibilities, the political  line disputes are working as an element of political  instability, at the moment at least.    Based on these points, it should be noted that the current  disputes in the political circles have an element in that could  possibly lead to a political realignment by their "internal"  energy for the first time in the nation's political history.  Every transformation made by the political circles in this  country to date were by the "force from outside."    But the current developments in the disputes are different  in  that they are of internal origins in every aspect. Especially,  it should be noted that unlike his predecessors, President Kim  has few effective means at his disposal to control the political  forces. In addition, considering the local autonomy elections  scheduled for 1995, the 15th general election to be held in  1996, and the 1997 presidential election, the president has,  strictly speaking, only one year before the first of these  things begins. In that sense, too, politics under the Kim  government will revolve around the political line disputes as  its main axis, rather than factional strife. It seems that it  cannot be otherwise.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts After a good run, the gilts market was looking for an excuse to consolidate yesterday. The public sector borrowing requirement figures held no horrors and the announcement that this month's gilts auction will be Pounds 2.5bn hardly came as a shock, given that the Bank of England is giving November a miss. Yet the morning's sharp correction could not be explained entirely by renewed dollar weakness and profit-taking in German bunds. Instead the finger was pointed at the Confederation of British Industry's September retail sales survey and the much stronger than expected figures for volume growth. Even analysts sceptical about the CBI survey's accuracy were tempted to push up their forecasts for today's official numbers, some dramatically so, and those looking for a reason to sell gilts could claim they detected the whiff of returning inflation. But the cries of wolf are increasingly falling on deaf ears and prices ended well off their lows. Even if retail sales have picked up as the CBI figures imply, the anecdotal evidence suggests the volume growth has not made it any easier for retailers to push up their prices. Many City economists have now come round to the Bank of England's more relaxed view on inflation. Yet despite the recent rally, yields are still telling the old story and gilts promise much if the governor is right.</p>

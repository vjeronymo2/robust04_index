			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Hit a jackpot in Las Vegas. Tried the new limousine service from Los Angeles  that was announced in Travel Tips June 4. It's a package deal ($179) that  includes round-trip transportation plus three days/two nights at the new San  Remo Hotel Casino &amp; Resort on Tropicana Avenue. Guests are picked up in  stretch limousines that are equipped with TV sets, videos, bars. (They move  like a cloud on the road to Nevada.) Winning Tours' limousines leave Los  Angeles/Orange County daily (both morning and evening). Return trips at 1 p.m.  or midnight. Night owls doze en route, reaching Los Angeles in time to go to  work. The 332-room San Remo Hotel (next door to the Tropicana) features a  lounge show, gourmet restaurant, casino, swimming pool. For value, this is a  hard act to follow.  </P> <P> Contact Winning Tours, 6125 W. Sahara Ave., Suite 2B, Las Vegas 89102, or  telephone toll-free (800) 657-5334.  </P> <P> Budget Ideas  </P> <P> If you're going to Las Vegas, get a copy of the Las Vegas Advisor. Publishes  monthly. Tells where to get the best values for dining, entertainment (49-cent  breakfasts, dinners for $2, shows for as little as $9.95). Readers are also  told how to locate the hard-to-find penny slots. For a copy of the Las Vegas  Advisor, send $1 to Huntington Press, Box 28041, Las Vegas, Nev. 89126.  </P> <P> Idyllic New Zealand  </P> <P> Idyll, the company that arranges for American travelers to stay in private  chalets/apartments in Europe, has turned its attention to New Zealand. You can  spend three weeks for as little as $11 a day per guest (based on four persons  to an apartment) on either (or both) North Island or South Island. The price  includes the assistance of a representative in New Zealand. All accommodations  feature modern kitchens, living room, bedroom, bath. Linens/towels included.  For brochures, write to Idyll Untours, P.O. Box 405, Media, Pa. 19063, or  telephone (215) 565-5242.  </P> <P> Kiwi Skiing  </P> <P> While the United States swelters, New Zealanders are enjoying the best ski  season in several years. Heavy snow began falling in the Southern Alps in May.  As a result, a number of ski areas opened early this year. Lots of action at  Queenstown's Coronet Peak. Eight-to-15-day ski packages are being offered by a  company called Skiing Kiwis in the Queenstown-Wanaka region. Beginners,  intermediates, advanced. The Southern Alps takes in a territory bigger than the  French, Italian and Swiss Alps combined. Heli-skiing on Tasman Glacier is high  on the operator's priority list. For details, contact the New Zealand Tourist  and Publicity Office, 10960 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1530, Los Angeles 90024,  (213) 477-8241.  </P> <P> Caribbean Hideaway  </P> <P> Drake's Anchorage Resort Inn in the Caribbean is a hideaway for all reasons:  It's secluded (on a private island of only 126 acres), and the waters are  picture post-card perfect for snorkelers. Drake's is in the British Virgins. A  speck on the map. Totally divorced from civilization, with a restaurant that  serves West Indian/continental cuisine. If you can afford to splurge, you can  rent the entire island. For a day, a week, a month. Four beaches, a dozen  ocean-front accommodations. The operator says Drake's is "where live  entertainment is watching a humming bird sip nectar from a hibiscus or a  pelican plunge into the sea." To get to Drake's you fly from San Juan, Puerto  Rico, or St. Thomas to the island of Virgin Gorda. From there you take a short  boat ride to Drake's. Rates: $155 a day single, $205 double, including  breakfast, lunch, dinner. A seven-night honeymoon package figures out to $999,  including the use of snorkeling, windsurfer and other water sports equipment.  </P> <P> Contact Drake's Anchorage, 209 Harvard St., Suite 207, Brookline, Mass. 02146,  or call toll-free (800) 624-6651.  </P> <P> Pacific Northwest  </P> <P> In the Pacific Northwest, Harry Ellis operates mini-tours.

Eight miles of private angling on the 4 UR's own Goose Creek, as well  as three Rocky Mountain lakes. This is the one-time ranch of Gen. William J.  Palmer, the founder of Alamosa, Durango and Colorado Springs. Palmer used the  ranch as a haven for friends, delivering them by private train through the San  Juans to the headwaters of the Rio Grande. Besides fishing, guests of the 4 UR  soak in hot springs on the ranch, raft on the Rio Grande, ride, hike, play  tennis. But fishing is the big attraction. The owners have spent 15 years  guiding guests to waters containing browns, rainbows and native cutthroats.  They promise "some of the best private fishing in Colorado." For the  adventurous, guides lead guests to lakes in the wilderness. Rates: $130 per day  (single), $240 double. (Children four to 12 years, $95.)

He created a warm and secure environment. Gardien is no longer at Big  Sur Inn. He now operates a little inn on Kauai where he touches each person  with that same magic care that made him so well-known at Big Sur Inn. I'm sure  former guests at Big Sur would love to know where Ed Gardien has landed. Write  to Gardien c/o Hanalei Bay Inn, P.O.

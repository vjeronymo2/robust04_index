			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters supported the designation of School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area based on specific safety concerns they face. Three commenters, for example, expressed concern over recent increases in the number of incidents involving misbehavior and violence on school buses, and one commenter expressed concern about crashes involving buses and heavy trucks. While these problems may be of concern in particular communities, the comments did not reveal and our data do not indicate that these are problems of great magnitude throughout the nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The section 402 program provides States with a mechanism for funding programs that address State or local concerns, by providing justification that includes information on the identified problem and the activities or projects that are planned. Accordingly, these States and communities have the ability, if they so choose and can provide the justification, to develop programs to address the problems identified in their comments. Moreover, the existence of these local problems does not support a decision to designate School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area for the entire nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters supported the agencies' view. The Massachusetts Governor's Highway Safety Bureau, for example, stated, ``School bus safety deserves a place within the 402 program, however each state should identify the need for funding, within the framework of the existing 402 guidelines.'' The Michigan Department of State Police commented, ``[school bus safety] is an important element of any state's highway safety program but should be based upon the identified need in a particular state.'' The Arizona Governor's Office of Highway Safety reported that it was able to support a school bus driver/instructor training and certification program using section 402 dollars using the current funding procedures. Arizona commented, ``There was no program priority for school bus safety at that time, and we were still able to address the issue by utilizing the current U.S. Department of Transportation 402 program management procedures already in place.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments of the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives (NAGHSR) were most comprehensive, and represented the views expressed by many of the other commenters. NAGHSR stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We *&blank;*&blank;* concur that school bus safety should not be designated a National Program Priority. NAGHSR is very supportive of the need for protecting the safety of school children. However, state crash statistics indicate that the problem is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant a priority designation. Furthermore, we are concerned that the designation of school bus safety will divert scarce 402 resources away from critical highway safety areas such as impaired driving, occupant protection, and speed control. States currently have the flexibility to spend 402 funds on school bus safety if the needs exist and can be documented. This flexibility is sufficient to address whatever school bus safety needs may exist.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters that urged the agencies to designate School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area did so not based on a perceived current safety problem or concern, but rather based on a need for continued funding to maintain their positive safety record. As explained previously, however, this is not a valid criterion for designating a program to be a National Priority area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies are not attempting, as suggested by the National School Transportation Association, to ``[p]enaliz[e] the industry for doing a good job.'' In fact, we applaud the industry for its dedication and continued excellent record of service and safety. Rather, we are simply making our best efforts to ensure that scarce 402 resources are used where they can have the greatest positive effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the commenters agreed with this approach. The North Carolina Department of Transportation, for example, stated, ``By not including school bus safety as a priority program NHTSA and FHWA will allow limited resources to be utilized where they can be most effective.'' New Mexico commented that it supports the agencies' decision to ``leav[e] school bus safety in its current status as an important area of state efforts to protect children, but without elevating it to a higher status as a national priority program area.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies understand the concern of many of the commenters who are fearful that funds currently available may be discontinued. The agencies do not intend for the decision not to include School Bus Safety as a National Priority program to create an implication that resources currently devoted to School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

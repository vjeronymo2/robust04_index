			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Technology: Putting people before machines - A new report looks at why 'good' IT systems fail Many 'good' information technology systems fail because technical issues are put first and human and organisational issues second. This is one of the findings of a report* to be published this month by London consultants Pagoda. Other common causes of failure, according to the report, include projects where: The hoped-for benefits are too narrow and insufficiently tied to business strategy; The benefits are not communicated to staff so they try to adapt new systems to old ways of working; The benefits are too broad, insufficiently prioritised and may even conflict. Pagoda's conclusions are based on reviewing the experience of 100 organisations and on 30 in-depth interviews with big users of IT. Judith Wainwright, a director of Pagoda, argues that the critical success factor in implementing systems is the way the human and organisational issues are planned; the technology is secondary. She gives several reasons. First, IT systems are now so central to an organisation's function that their effect is felt by most employees and, increasingly, by customers. Second, there are fewer technical constraints than there used to be. Third, more managers are using computers than before. They cannot be coerced into using them, so unless they are convinced of the benefits of a system they will not use it. However, linking human and technical goals is not easy. The report suggests that companies introducing new systems should at the same time consider all other aspects of the business that are likely to be affected by the change. This could include technology, business processes, organisational structures, job design, staff attitudes and skills. All should be treated within a single project plan because decisions taken in one area will inevitably affect other areas. Wainwright believes large projects involving change should be run by a line manager with a senior member of staff, such as a director, backing them up. Commitment and input to the project among the staff can be gained by involving them in the choice and definition of the system. Users should also work closely with prototype systems - partly-built versions that staff can experiment on - helping to shape them. This approach works better than basing systems on early, detailed specifications because non-technical staff are often not good at visualising what the promised system will look like. Then, when it arrives, they find it is not what they wanted. Getting users to participate in systems design takes longer but is more likely to yield benefits in the long term. But 'even when planning and design have been good, poor implementation can still make a system fail', warns Wainwright. 'Implementation budgets and timescales are usually the first to be cut. Operational and systems managers often give in to political pressure to bring forward implementation because they feel that by then the real work has been done,' she says. 'This reflects the common view that with IT change projects, you plug in the system and the benefits flow - whereas wider changes are usually involved.' The study advises companies introducing IT to keep their staff involved and to communicate with them at all stages. Training afterwards is also important. According to the report, users like to discuss projects with their managers and any staff who have experienced similar change. Wainwright believes that a participative approach reduces the risk of start-up problems and of project failure because human and organisational factors are the greatest source of risk. Participative approaches to systems change are most commonly found in factory automation projects, according to the study, where IT makes a small but important contribution. *Why 'Good' Systems Fail, available from Pagoda.

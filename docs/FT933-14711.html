			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Producers strive to hold down prices as costs rise BRITISH manufacturers are holding down prices in an effort to rebuild sales, in spite of paying more for materials and fuel. Prices of factory-made goods for domestic sale rose 0.1 per cent during June, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. In the year to last month prices rose 4 per cent, the same as in the year to May. Materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers increased in price 7.8 per cent in the 12 months to June, compared with 7.5 per cent in the year to May. Seasonally adjusted, these prices rose 0.3 per cent during June. The figures confirm that the fall in sterling since last September's devaluation has yet to show up significantly in the prices that manufacturers are charging at the wholesale level. Manufactured goods excluding food, drink and tobacco - prices of which are thought to show underlying inflationary pressures - also showed little upward price movement in the past month. These goods rose in price 0.1 per cent during June. The year-on-rise of 2.6 per cent was the same as in the year to May. While the year-on-year increase in prices of all manufactured goods has edged up from the 3.5 per cent recorded in December, the measure for underlying inflation at the wholesale level has been fairly stable. It registered 2.4 per cent in December and has stayed at 2.6 per cent since February. In the year to last month, prices of petroleum products purchased by manufacturers increased 8.5 per cent. Prices of home-produced food rose 12.9 per cent and imported food 10.5 per cent. However these substantial increases were offset by subdued rises in prices of metals and other imported goods. Following the devaluation, the year on year rise in prices of materials and fuels bought by manufacturers reached a high of 8.4 per cent in March. Since then, however, inflationary pressures on the input side have been relatively muted. In April the year-on-year increase in these prices was 7.2 per cent.

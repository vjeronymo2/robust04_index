			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (12): Standards are rising - Doing business in Portugal 'PORTUGAL,' quipped a Mozambican friend, 'is an African country with a European vocation.' The remark, neatly turning round a popular saying about Portugal's historic links with Africa, has more than a grain of truth in it. Life in Portugal, especially in the southern half of the country, is tempered by a distinctly non-European nonchalance; spontaneity, a tendency to leave decisions to the last minute and a desire to please, all mixed with a strong streak of fatalism, seem designed to test the patience of visitors. If you are in a hurry, Portugal is not the place for you. If you add to that problems that result from an as yet under-developed infrastructure, poor though improving telecommunications, and the dead weight of a massive state bureaucracy with its over-abundant 'red tape,' it is easy to see why business people occasionally despair they will ever get anything done. Portugal's ties with its former colonies in Asia, with Portuguese-speaking Brazil and more especially with Africa, are still much in evidence. Immigrants from Cape Verde, Angola and Mozambique make up a good proportion of workers on building sites in and around Lisbon. In late afternoons, the northern side of the Rossio, the capital's main square, is animated with groups of immigrants who have made it a meeting point to exchange gossip or simply while away the hours. But for all these vivid reminders of Portugal's colonial past, Lisbon has been rediscovering Europe with an official enthusiasm matched only by generous helpings of European Community funds. EC membership is assisting Portugal to overcome decades of neglect and changing attitudes. Foreign investment has poured into the country helping to modernise industries and infrastructures. The pressure of EC integration is forcing the pace of change. The range and quality of goods and services is improving, new businesses are bringing more ideas and promoting the cause of efficiency. Standards of living have risen, though wide disparities of wealth are still noticeable. Wages are the lowest in Europe, and this has been an important attraction for foreign investors. While the public sector is plagued with poor industrial relations and strikes from government bureaucrats to policemen, teachers, doctors, and museum attendants, the private sector is practically free of strife. Managers of multinational companies say that while local workers generally have lower initial skills, they respond well to training and can achieve levels of proficiency that can compete with levels elsewhere. Housing is often sub-standard with poor safety and hygiene. There is a serious housing shortage, but foreign executives can find better quality accommodation in Lisbon or Oporto though at prices closer to those in other European cities. Office space is a problem and prices are high though after 1992 they should stabilise as more commercial property comes on the market. Bureaucracy and red tape are infuriating, though the right connections will usually help speed matters, but not always. Brush a local government official the wrong way, and the water link that you so desperately need will be dammed at source by forms and unanswered letters. Construction work is slow and requires constant supervision; delays are common. Appointments will often be changed, sometimes at the very last minute, and few will actually start on time playing havoc with business schedules. Minor officials can be wrong-headed and infused with an exaggerated sense of their own importance. Service, especially in the state sector, is bad - reflecting the fact that many state employees are poorly paid and trained. Taxi drivers are probably among the rudest in the world and you will be lucky to get a grunt back as an acknowledgement after you mention your destination. Finding a garage to park your car is difficult and expensive, but it could save having to pay for broken windows and stolen car radios if you leave your car in the street, even if you live in a smart part of town. If you are planning to live outside Lisbon and drive in, travel before or after the rush hour to avoid long jams. And always drive defensively  - Portuguese drivers are among the worst and probably the most dangerous in Europe, giving Portugal the highest proportion of fatal road accidents in the Community. Insurance premiums are high. But for all these drawbacks, there are big compensations. Apart from four months between December and April when it can rain torrentially for days and temperatures are low, the climate is mild, the summers long and hot, and the beach is never very far away. At the height of the tourist season, it is best to avoid the main resorts along the Algarve, but there are still many places left to visit along the coast and in the interior. From the green hills of the Minho where vinho verde (red and white) is produced in the north, along the Douro river and valley that runs downhill from Spain in the east through stunning landscape to Oporto, through the Serra da Estrela mountains in the centre, and south, across the Alentejo, with its miles of practically-deserted beaches and torrid interior landscape, there is plenty to delight and discover. Portugal has much to offer those who like to live outdoors. There is a wide choice of sea food and some good wines, and once off-duty a temporary resident can enjoy a pleasant and relaxed lifestyle.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / MI5 'dirty tricks' report is denied SCOTLAND YARD last night denied reports that it believed MI5, the security service, was behind a 'dirty tricks' campaign over the leak at the weekend of the appointment of Commander David Tucker as the new head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch. The appointment was planned months ago as part of a reorganisation of the security operations against IRA units active on the mainland, spearheaded by Ms Stella Rimington, the MI5 chief, according to police sources. It was not, Scotland Yard said, a way of hastening the retirement of Commander George Churchill-Coleman. 'There is no MI5 dirty tricks behind this,' it said. The move came amid fears that any public escalation of a row between Scotland Yard and MI5 might be exploited by the IRA. However, anger at Scotland Yard continued to be widespread yesterday at the way the leaking had in effect fore-stalled any chance of an uncontroversial succession, due to take place in November. According to one Scotland Yard official, the Home Office was under pressure to identify those responsible for the leak, while Mr Churchill-Coleman was said to be 'furious'.</p>

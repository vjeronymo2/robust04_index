			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> SCREENINGS PRESENT PACIFIC RIM CULTURES  </P> <P> Sunday  </P> <P> Mana Waka  </P> <P> New Zealand  </P> <P>  Sunday, 8 p.m., Warner Grand, 478 W. 6th St., San Pedro; Tuesday, 8 p.m.,  Melnitz Theater, UCLA  </P> <P> In this fascinating documentary, two filmmakers and a Maori princess  collaborate across half a century on a poetic celebration of Zealand tribal  culture. The subject is the waka taua building project: the 1938 construction,  by Princess Te Puea Herangi's tribe, of a sacred boat.  </P> <P> The footage of this painstaking job, the felling of huge trees, the laborious  shoreward trek, intricate ceremonial carvings and final glorious launch -- was  shot by Jim Manley in 1938; ever since, it has rested in the New Zealand Film  Archive. Director Merata Mita has expertly edited Manley's work, sweetening it  with an evocative soundtrack. The result has a bit of the monochrome lyricism  of "Tabu" or "White Shadows in the South Seas," and a unique historical  perspective. It's a one-of-a-kind experience. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

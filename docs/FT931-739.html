			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Eurobond issuance sets record in first quarter NEW issues in the international bond market reached a record high in the first quarter of this year, reflecting a favourable environment of falling interest rates and an increase in funding requirements, especially from sovereign borrowers. According to provisional figures from Euromoney Bondware, new Eurobond issuance for the first quarter to March 26 stood at Dollars 115.2bn, well above the previous record high of Dollars 84.5bn achieved in the same quarter last year. New issuance in the first three months of this year represented 42 per cent of the record Dollars 274.4bn raised in the whole of 1992. Syndicate managers do not believe that new issuance will continue at the same pace in the second quarter, unless there is another currency crisis in Europe. That would prompt European central banks to borrow in foreign currencies to fill up their reserves once again. Many of the larger borrowers, especially the sovereign names, are believed to have achieved between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of their 1993 funding requirements already in the first quarter. 'The new issuance calendar is likely to be much more opportunistic in the second quarter,' one syndicate manager said. Syndicate managers said that the high volume in the first quarter is closely linked to the rally seen in bond markets across the world, fuelled by expectations of lower interest rates, especially in Europe. These hopes have been fulfilled by the Bundesbank's decision in recent weeks to lower its interest rates, which has in turn eased the tension between member currencies of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Falling interest rates have coincided with a large rise in borrowing needs among European countries, either to fund ever-growing public deficits or to replenish foreign exchange reserves depleted by heavy intervention in the currency market to shore up their respective currencies. The Eurodollar sector of the international bond market continued to be the most active in the first quarter, accounting for 33.8 per cent of the total volume compared with 28.2 per cent in the first quarter of last year. The volume figures partly reflect the growing popularity of global bond issues, a concept pioneered by the World Bank in 1989. The process of offering bonds simultaneously in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific allows borrowers to raise larger sums and to place the paper at the best possible price. So far this year, dollar-denominated global bond issues amounting to Dollars 8.75bn have been launched by the World Bank, the Province of Ontario, the Republic of Finland, Ford Motor Credit Company, and the Kingdom of Sweden. Eurobond volume in D-Marks rose to second place or 20.2 per cent of total issuance in the first quarter, from fourth place or 10.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1992. This reflects the marked increase in demand for D-Mark paper from investors seeking a safe haven during the period of ERM currency volatility. At the same time, the collapse of the Ecu market meant that the D-Mark sector was one of the few areas of the Eurobond market which offered sufficient liquidity to borrowers needing to raise large amounts. The volume of new Ecu bonds remained low at the equivalent of just Dollars 1.9bn, compared with Dollars 14.6bn in the first quarter of 1992, in spite of efforts by the French government and some of the European Community agencies to revive investor interest in Ecu-denominated paper. Favourable arbitrage opportunities, as borrowers moved to reduce their funding costs by borrowing in one currency and swapping into another, were the main reason for the big increase in Canadian dollar Eurobonds this quarter. Syndicate managers estimate that a large part of the equivalent of Dollars 12.9bn worth of Canadian dollar Eurobonds raised so far this year - up from Dollars 4.4bn at the same stage last year - has been swapped into other currencies. The Eurosterling sector of the international bond market rose up the volume table, as an increasing number of domestic and international borrowers decided to lock into the lowest interest rates that the UK has seen since the 1970s. New issuance in sterling jumped to 10.9 per cent of the total volume in the first three months of this year from 6.7 per cent in the same period last year. The sector saw a record for a single transaction, as Abbey National raised Pounds 650m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds, beating the previous record of Pounds 600m held by the Kingdom of Sweden. Apart from the Ecu sector, the other main loser in the first quarter has been the Euroyen area of the international bond market, as issuers were discouraged from borrowing in yen due to its appreciation against other currencies. New issuance in yen dropped to the equivalent of Dollars 10.9bn from Dollars 12.2bn in the year-ago period, while its share of the total volume fell to 9.5 per cent from 14.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Plan to ban smoking The US House of Representatives has voted to ban smoking on all international flights to and from the US, but the measure may fail one it reaches the Senate. Smoking was outlawed four years ago on all US domestic flights except those lasting six hours or more. The House bill would extend the ban to those flights. It now goes to the Senate, but an aide said no action was expected this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- It was officially  reported in Buenos Aires today that an Argentine Coast Guard  [PNA] patrol boat that was patrolling the Uruguay River was the  target of shots fired from the Brazilian coast, after it had  seized fishing nets unlawfully set in the river.    The incident occurred yesterday 763 km downstream on the  Uruguay River, 12 km from the city of Santo Tome in Corrientes  Province, when the PNA "BA-3608" patrol boat became the target  of many shots fired from a suburban district in the city of Sao  Borja in Brazil.    In a communique the PNA reported today that the shots hit  the  water a few meters from the patrol boat's hull, and that in view  of the attack the PNA personnel carried out "zigzagging"  maneuvers to escape the shots, without repelling the attack  because it came from foreign territory.    The incident occurred a few minutes after the PNA personnel  had seized fishing nets unlawfully set on the Argentine side of  the river, and while they were investigating the suspicious  movements of a boat that was crossing from the Argentine coast  to the Brazilian coast.    During the routine PNA river operations and patrols, 28  1,228-meter long fishing lines and 27 1,197-meter long fishing  nets unlawfully set were seized, and four Brazilian citizens  detained.    Court proceedings, labeled "Attack Against River Patrol,"  were filed on the incident. The federal judge of the city of  Paso de los Libres will handle the case.</p>

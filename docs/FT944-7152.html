			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: De Beers advances 3% as Namibia takes stake in diamond operations Equities finished firmer, although trade was cautious in the absence of a lead from the US. Brokers said most of the overseas buying had come from the UK. The overall index rose 67.4 to 5,866.8 after a 109-point decline on Wednesday; industrials put on 83 at 6,949.9; and the golds index was 20.4 higher at 2,067.7 after a static afternoon performance. De Beers advanced R2.75 to R95.75 as the group announced that the Namibian government had taken a 50 per cent stake in its diamond mining operations there. Anglos was unchanged at R234 and Minorco moved ahead R1.65 to R98.15. SAB recovered some of Wednesday's loss, improving R2 to R99, while Barlows appreciated R1 to R34.25.</p>

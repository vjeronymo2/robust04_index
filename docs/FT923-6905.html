			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Arabs will go to Washington peace talks ARAB participants in Middle East peace talks will go to Washington on Monday for the scheduled resumption of negotiations, despite their criticism of what they regard as US bias towards Israel. Meeting in Damascus yesterday, officials representing Israel's neighbours and the Palestinians expressed their 'readiness' to attend the Washington talks. However, Arab officials also voiced strong misgivings about the US decision to provide Israel with billions of dollars of loan guarantees without securing Israeli agreement to a complete settlement freeze in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syria's foreign minister, charged that Washington had damaged its credibility as an honest broker. Arabs believe President Bush's decision to approve the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees was hasty and dictated by his desire to make peace with the American Jewish community before November's presidential election. 'The US gave the loan guarantees to Israel without getting a pledge ensuring a total halt of Israeli settlement activities in the occupied territories,' Mr Shara said. The Damascus meeting also called Washington's pledge to maintain Israel's military edge over the Arabs 'contrary to peace'. The Palestinians had threatened to postpone their participation in the Washington talks in protest at what they regarded as a softening in the US position on settlements. The Washington talks will be the sixth round since the latest US-sponsored Middle East process was launched in Madrid last October. Negotiations had made scant progress but the election of a new and apparently more flexible government in Israel has raised hopes of progress. Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Egypt were represented in Damascus yesterday by their foreign ministers. Also participating was Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, the veteran PLO official.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Deutsche Telekom closer to sell-off: Ariane Genillard on the bill that provides for the privatisation of posts and telecommunications The German government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the national telecoms operator, the postal services and the Postbank. A bill providing for privatisation of the three companies is due for a first reading today in the lower chamber of the parliament. It is not expected to meet resistance in the German legislature as all parties gave their basic approval to it on Tuesday night. This follows two years of negotiations between the coalition government and the opposition Social Democrats, whose support is needed to change the constitution which defines telecoms and the postal services as state-owned activities. The bill is aimed at allowing all three companies to prepare for privatisation and intensified international competition, recently highlighted by the European Union's decision to liberalise basic voice telephony in 1998. 'The law sets the prerequisites for Deutsche Telekom to position itself in the global telecoms market . . . and strike alliances with foreign partners,' Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German post and telecommunications minister, said yesterday after the cabinetapproved the final text. The law, which is expected to come into force at the beginning of 1995, will turn the three into joint-stock companies. Deutsche Telekom is expected to sell on the stock market, starting in 1996, an initial tranche of shares representing 25 per cent of the company's equity and worth between DM10bn-DM15bn. However, as a result of demands made by the SPD, a state-owned holding company will be created to keep some of the shares of the three companies temporarily. In the case of Deutsche Telekom, the holding company will retain a majority ownership in the five years after the bill becomes law, that is until 2000. The state is expected to remain the sole shareholder of the postal services as long as they continue to report losses. The holding company will also retain 12.5 per cent of the Postbank with another 12.5 per cent of the bank held by the postal services. Mr Gunter Schneider, Postbank's chief executive, recently said the bank would immediately seek equity partners, starting with German savings and loans institutions with whom it already has co-operation agreements. Deutsche Telekom, which has conducted an intensive two-year campaign for its privatisation, has eased concerns that the holding company might have had too much power over its activities. Officials at Deutsche Telekom now say the holding company will not significantly hamper their managerial freedom - a point also stressed by government officials. Deutsche Telekom urgently needs to raise cash to reduce its DM100bn (Pounds 38bn) debt and continue its DM60bn investment programme in eastern Germany. Under an agreement between the post and finance ministries, the company will have to pay, by 1996, DM6.5bn to the postal services and Postbank, whose losses it is legally required to cover before privatisation. Officials at the post ministry say Deutsche Telekom will probably have to use a portion of its privatisation proceeds to do this. It will also have to accept the creation of an 'infrastructure committee' made of officials from the federal government and the states. This follows demands by the SPD for some continued state supervision. The party wants to ensure that the private companies will not neglect infrastructure investments in less-populated areas of Germany. Mr Botsch yesterday said the committee would only be able to suggest new infrastructure investments and not order them. Moreover, the federal government would be able to override decisions taken by the states in the committee. The government has also had to reckon with the refusal of the SPD to accept a law which would put a deadline on the monopolies enjoyed by Deutsche Telekom and the postal services. As a compromise, the law prolonging the monopolies will end on December 31 1997. 'We call on the legislators to tackle this question by then,' Mr Botsch said yesterday. The date coincides with the EU voice telephony liberalisation. However, the formula also allows German parliamentarians to keep the monopoly of Deutsche Telekom on its telephone infrastructure and of the postal services after 1997, depending on whether liberalisation has been decided at the European level. Mr Botsch said again yesterday that this concerned only the monopoly of the postal services over regular letter mail. Talks are to be conducted in the coming weeks between the postal services, the government and mail-order companies who want mass mailings to be opened to competition. Officials at the German industry federation, the BDI, said yesterday that the final bill was satisfactory, especially in light of the difficult negotiations between the government parties and the SPD. The package continues to be rejected by the Post trade union which fears for the jobs of its members and had hoped to persuade the SPD to refuse to agree to privatisation. Lex, Page 16</p>

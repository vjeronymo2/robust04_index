The suit, brought by the New  Beckley Mining Corp. of Beckley, W. Va., under the federal Racketeer-Influenced  Corrupt Organizations statute, claims the union and its members have engaged in  nationwide racketeering involving attempted murder, arson and extortion. The  company announced also that it will close its mine at Glen Daniel, W. Va.,  where 130 men have been out on strike since January. It blamed what it called  union violence for the closing.  </P></p>

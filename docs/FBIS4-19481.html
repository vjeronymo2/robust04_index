			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with former Burundian President Pierre </F> Buyoya and former Burundian Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi by Rik  De Gendt in Brussels; date not given: "Burundi Still Counting  on Belgian Aid"]    [Text] "Developments in Rwanda are going to partly  determine the future of Burundi and of the whole region. The  last thing we needed was this upsurge of ethnic hatred and  violence. I can fully understand the painful experiences of the  past week, but Belgium must not abandon its responsibilities.  In our country, Belgium certainly has a contribution to make in  creating the political dialogue that is so necessary in order to  achieve a lasting peace." These are the words of former  Burundian President Pierre Buyoya in an interview with DE  STANDAARD. Shortly before, he had met with State Secretary for  Development Erik Derycke.    "Ethnic extremism is like a drug," Buyoya stated. "It causes  people to do things which they no longer control and which, in  the long run, are against their own interests. There are many  examples of this. Both in Burundi and Rwanda, the killers of  Presidents Melchior Ndadaye and Juvenal Habyarimana believed  they could strengthen or secure their position. They achieved  the exact opposite. In both countries, the attacks resulted in  complete disintegration."    The former Burundian president believes it is of the utmost  importance for the warring factions to quickly achieve a  cease-fire and that, above all, the country needs a balanced  government.    "The plan is there: The protocol for power sharing as  included in the Arusha peace agreement. If, on the other hand,  Rwanda gets an extremist government of any kind, the whole  region will quickly go up in flames."    The same calls for power sharing apply just as much to  Burundi. With his policy of reconciliation and national unity  during his period in power (1987-1993), Pierre Buyoya drew much  applause from friend and foe, at home and abroad. Some people  would like to see him return to playing a more active political  role.  <H5>  Elections </H5>   "Last June, Ndadaye won a convincing election victory,"  Buyoya openly states. "I would find it dishonest to now take  back through the back door that which I then lost in an open  contest. When Ndadaye succeeded me, I decided to withdraw from  political life for the time being. I am still a member of the  UPRONA [Unity for National Progress] party, but have no leading  role. I did not want to be tainted with the image as opposition  leader. I can do much more good through discreet contacts. I  was proved right by events, although I could not avoid certain  mishaps. Psychological elements are also involved. Our country  needs a period of, let us say, 10 years with a Hutu president in  order to do away with all ethnic taboos once and for all."    Pierre Buyoya discussed with State Secretary Derycke on  Wednesday the question of possible Belgian aid in further  supporting the rebuilding of democracy in his country.    "Belgium can play an important role," Buyoya believes. "The  Belgians know our countries and people very well, and there is  still a considerable Belgian presence in Burundi. In addition  to sustained opposition in principle to any form of ethnic  cleansing and violence, I hope that Belgium will continue to  help to bring about and maintain political dialogue between all  elements in our society. There is no other way for us."  <H5>  Training </H5>   Former Burundian Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi was also in  Brussels on Wednesday. To everyone's surprise the first  democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, chose this  economist to head his government in July last year. She feels  that she must continue to play a part in the political life of  her country.    "The fact that I am still alive is probably because I am a  woman," she says. "A male prime minister would never have  survived last October's coup d'etat. Women politicians have a  very particular contribution to make to a country's development,  because by their very nature they look to the future and the  well-being of their children."    The assistance she expects from foreign partners is  principally in the field of training and development.    "The problems facing our country are not so much rooted in  ethnic questions as in poverty, underdevelopment and, above all,  a disturbed or absence of balance in the structures. The latter  is most seriously evident in the Army. But if you do not  believe that things can change, then things will never change."    "Our Western partners and Belgium above all, can be of  tremendous assistance to us in training political leaders who  are able to make objective analyses and manage the mechanisms of  democracy and who are primarily concerned by the real needs of  their people. I see support for this training as a priority  form of development aid," Sylvie Kinigi concluded.</p>

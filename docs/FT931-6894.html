			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (5): If you Pep them, watch the charges - Dividends MANY PEOPLE make the mistake of thinking that owning shares is all about capital gains. In fact, dividends are vitally important. Broadly speaking, share prices do no more than keep up with inflation over the long term. In real (after inflation) terms, BZW figures show that share prices were no higher at the end of 1992 than they were at the end of 1968. The real return to investors thus comes in the form of dividend income. BZW's calculations show that the real return to investors from shares since 1919 has been a gross 7.3 per cent per annum. If you assume that dividends will grow in line (over the long term) with GDP, then a rough and ready calculation is to say this real return from equities consists of the average dividend yield of 5 per cent, plus dividend growth of 2 per cent. The compounding effect of such growth rates can be remarkable. The BZW figures show that someone with a gross dividend income of Pounds 1,000 in 1978 would have seen it grow to Pounds 4,687 by 1992. But the 1980s were a remarkable period. The UK was emerging from a decade when corporate profits were depressed, dividend growth was restricted and inflation was high. Dividends actually fell by 25 per cent in real terms between 1970 and 1978. So the 1980s may have represented a 'catch-up' period. As so often happens, the 1990s has seen yet another change in mood. According to BZW, dividends actually fell in nominal terms in 1992 - for the first time since 1973. The long economic boom of the 1980s made companies confident about their ability to pay out dividends. The 'cover' ratio - the extent to which current profits are sufficient to pay dividends - has dropped below 2, well below the historical average. Many were caught out by the depth of the current recession and have been forced to cut dividends, or not pay them at all; a move which normally causes unpopularity among investors. This suggests that any recovery in profits in the 1990s will be used to rebuild dividend cover rather than to increase payouts substantially. Nevertheless, now that UK interest rates have fallen to such low levels, investors are starting to see dividend yields as a source of immediate income. At the start of February, the dividend yield on the FT-A All-Share Index was 4.3 per cent, compared with base rates of 6 per cent. If held within a personal equity plan, dividends are tax-free. So the net income return from a Pep for a top-rate taxpayer could easily beat the return from a building society account as well. Add in the possibility of capital growth as well and it is easy to see why Peps could prove popular. Much depends on the Pep charges, however. If the annual charge is 1 per cent plus VAT (1.175 per cent), then a Pep will have to yield 4.7 per cent for the tax savings of a basic-rate payer to outweigh the charge. For a top-rate taxpayer, the break-even yield is around 2.94 per cent. The market is becoming ever more competitive, however, and managers are showing willingness to be flexible in their charging structures. By creating hybrid products, with part of the portfolio invested in bonds and the bulk in equities, managers can offer Peps with attractive yields and reasonable levels of security. Cazenove launched a Pep in early February, for example, which invested in utility stocks (such as water and electricity) and in bonds. With a yield of 7 per cent (after allowing for the annual management charge of 0.5 per cent), the initial charge of 0.2 per cent plus Pounds 35 makes little dent on the tax attractions to those who can invest the full Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance. But investors need to be cautious of too high a dividend yield. This normally signals a high risk investment, and what investors gain in income, they can lose in capital. Furthermore, the fact that an individual share is on an above-average yield often signals that the market expects the dividend not to grow, or to be cut, in the near future. Sometimes capital loss can be built into the structure of the investment, as with some of the income shares of split-capital trusts. In some cases, these income shares will have no value at all when the trust is wound up; and so the shares closely resemble an annuity. In other cases, the repayment value of the income shares is dependent on the trust receiving high investment returns, making the shares highly speculative. So when choosing a Pep to take advantage of dividend returns, investors should look very carefully at both charges and the nature of the underlying investments. The good news is that there are attractive packages around, and that history has shown that dividends are a reliable source of income growth.</p>

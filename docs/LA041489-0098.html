			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TOKYO FIRM NOW RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB'S SOLE OWNER  </P> <P> A Japanese real estate company that emerged last summer as the mystery investor  in the Riviera Country Club completed purchase Thursday of the landmark  168-acre golf and tennis resort in Pacific Palisades amid reports that club  members' uneasiness over the firm's secretiveness has abated.  </P> <P> Marukin Shoji Ltd. of Tokyo said it will pay slightly more than $55 million in  cash for the remaining 51% interest in the country club. Last August, Marukin  paid $52.9 million for a 49% interest in the country club partnership -- which  consists of Laaco Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Riviera Country Club  Inc.  </P> <P> "We value and respect the current club members and have assured them of our  intention to operate these clubs as first-class facilities," Kaneo Watanabe,  the 70-year-old president of Marukin, said in a statement released Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Public Comment  </P> <P> Kaneo Watanabe and his son, Noburo Watanabe, 44, established Marukin in 1969.  The family originally operated a textile business in the Yamanashi area near  Mt. Fuji before developing its Tokyo-based real estate, construction and  engineering company, which has assets of more than $1 billion.  </P> <P> The country club purchase is the first American business venture for the  Watanabes, who are avid golfers. But, according to sources close to the talks,  the transaction was handled in the more formal business style of Tokyo rather  than in the more laid-back style of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Marukin officials, for example, allegedly spent weeks searching stores for just  the right items to fulfill the Japanese business tradition of giving small  gifts to thank business associates. They huddled for weeks over the precise  wording of the public statement they would make about the sale and then closely  supervised the Japanese-to-English translation when they sent the statement to  Los Angeles. And Marukin and Laaco agreed that officials from neither company  would talk publicly about the sale after it was announced Thursday.  </P> <P> This kind of business approach initially ignited concern among club members a  year ago when Laaco announced that it sold the entire 62-year-old club for $108  million to an unidentified Japanese firm. Laaco refused to give any details,  causing an uproar among the club's 635 members, which include some of Southern  California's prominent business executives.  </P> <P> Club members, who pay a $25,000 initiation fee and at least $3,870 in annual  dues, said they feared that the club would be made into a commercial  development, that some members would be forced out or that dues would be  raised.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerns Have Eased  </P> <P> But Joseph R. Rosenberg, chairman of Riviera's Board of Governors, said  members' concerns have since subsided.  </P> <P> "I've had conversations and private meetings with (club) officials and there is  every indication that (the sale) will sit well with the membership," said  Rosenberg, noting that Marukin has indicated that it plans to upgrade  facilities and restrict membership because of concerns that there was too much  wear and tear on the golf course.  </P> <P> "The members support those types of moves," Rosenberg said. "I'd be very  surprised if the members of the club did not hold them (Marukin) in high  regard."  </P> <P> Frank Hathaway, general partner of Laaco, declined to comment on the sale. But  in an interview with The Times in December he said members had become more  comfortable with the club's new owner.  </P> <P> "We think that the members who have had an opportunity to meet with them  (Marukin) are quite pleased," Hathaway said. "They've discovered that these  people love golf. What is happening is that when people get to know these  folks, they're becoming quite friendly to them."  </P> <P> Laaco Ltd. is a limited partnership that owns the Los Angeles Athletic Club and  the California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey.  </P></p>

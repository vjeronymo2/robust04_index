In our Governments the real power lies in the majority of the  Community, and the invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended, not  from acts of Government contrary to the sense of its constituents, but from  acts in which the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of the  constituents . . . It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally  exposed to danger whether the Government have too much or too little power; and  that the line which divides these extremes should be so inaccurately defined by  experience."  </P> <P> For 200 years, Americans have sought that line, and it was on the wisdom gained  in the search that the U.S. Supreme Court relied on Monday, when it again  struck down a law prohibiting vandalism of the American flag.  </P> <P> Writing for the court majority, Justice William Brennan argued that "while flag  desecration . . . is deeply offensive to many, the government may not prohibit  the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself  offensive or disagreeable . . . . Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the  very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering."  </P> <P> Many Americans do not agree and, as Madison anticipated, their elected  representatives are eager to act on their behalf. Yet flag burning, though a  very noxious form of expressive speech, does not threaten the country's basic  well-being. Any attempt to end it by adding unneeded amendments to the  Constitution or rewriting the Bill of Rights would.  </P> <P> A future without the First Amendment's absolute guarantees can be glimpsed  right now in Miami, where anti-pornography crusaders are embarked on a campaign  against the rap music group 2 Live Crew. Rap is an art form whose aesthetic  derives from the concerns, rhythms and linguistic distinctiveness of  African-American street culture. It often deals explicitly with violence and  sexuality. This has outraged Florida authorities, who convinced a federal judge  to declare some of the group's song lyrics obscene. Armed with that ruling,  they have arrested (in addition to a record store owner for selling a 2 Live  Crew album) members of the band who performed material from the recording in a  night club. In other words, American artists have been jailed for singing a  song.  </P> <P> The two centuries that have passed since a weary Madison unburdened himself to  his great friend have taught us many lessons about self government. One of them  is that liberty of thought and conscience -- and the freedom to express the  ideas to which they give rise -- are the foundations upon which the edifice of  American democracy rests.  </P></p>

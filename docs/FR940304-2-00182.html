O'Connell, Director, Office of Tariff and Trade Affairs, Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement), room 4004, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220. Tel.: (202) 622&hyph;0220. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> I hereby determine pursuant to 5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d) and Treasury Order No. 101&hyph;05 that the premature disclosure of the pending study and any proposals regarding the Customs Service's reorganization, would be likely to significantly frustrate the implementation of a proposed plan to reorganize the Customs Service. Therefore, it is in the public's interest that specific portions of the Committee's next meetings regarding the study and any proposals be closed as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Customs Reorganization Team has been soliciting and analyzing ideas for reorganizing the Customs Service to improve its efficiency and the quality of its service. These ideas are highly inchoate and have not received the endorsement of the Commissioner of Customs or the Treasury Department. The premature disclosure of this information would likely initiate speculation about site closings or site reductions resulting in precipitous actions by Customs Service employees and contractors as well as local residents and businesses. The premature disclosure of a proposal to close a site may cause site employees to relocate or resign and local contractors to eliminate services, thus frustrating the Customs Service's ability to later keep a site open when a reorganization plan is implemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preliminary agenda to be considered during the meetings on April 7 and 8, 1994 is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> April 7, 1994: 3:30 p.m.: Customs Reorganization Team Findings (Closed Session). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.

North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Customs Modernization Act Implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Briefing and Discussion of U.S. Textile Program after the Uruguay Round with Ms. Rita Hayes, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Textiles, Apparel and Consumer Goods Industries, U.S. Department of Commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of the closed portion indicated, the April 8 meeting is open to the public. However, it is necessary for any person other than an Advisory Committee member who wishes to attend the meeting to give advance notice. In order to be admitted to the meeting, contact Ms. Theresa Manning at (202) 622&hyph;0220 no later than April 1, 1994.

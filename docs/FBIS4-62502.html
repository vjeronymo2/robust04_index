			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Colonel-General Valeriy Patrikeyev,  commander of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan,  the situation in the Republic is gradually returning to normal.  In the words of the new commander, he has come to this  conclusion after a two-week acquaintance with the situation in  the country and meetings with the Republic's residents and  leadership. Incidentally, the Russian general described as  expedient the decision on extending the mandate of the  collective peacekeeping forces until 31 December 1994. In his  words, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains complex.</p>

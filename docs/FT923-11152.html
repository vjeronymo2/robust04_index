			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Barcelona - a city transformed / A look at Catalonia and its radically altered infrastructure stemming from the staging of the Games I SPENT most of last week watching and worrying about the grass. Other visitors to Barcelona may have had other preoccupations. Newly arrived athletes from around the world unpacked their Reeboks and frolicked in the Olympic village. VIPs jetted in from distant corporate HQs and wined and dined the nights away aboard luxury liners. Crowds of foreign press and hordes of Japanese cameramen swamped the streets looking for copy and filming anything that moved. As the Games' extravagant Saturday opening ceremony at Montjuic - the hilltop Olympic site in the middle of the city - approached, Olympic fever, a spreading virus, struck everywhere. All Barcelona ate, drank, danced and dreamed Olympics. I did not dream Olympics. Through the airless wee hours of the night I lay sleepless, listening to the sounds of adolescent motorcycle hooligans buzzing around the periphery of the Press village - and worrying about the grass. It was not growing fast enough. Throughout the week, Spanish contractors had been working at breakneck pace to complete the city's vast and grandiose Olympic plans on time. On Montjuic, mobile cranes lifted ornamental stone pediments into place. Excavating machines dug trenches for power and communication cables. Scaffolding was thrown up to put the finishing touches to building facades. Hammers rang, drills whined, trucks ground in low gear. In their frantic haste, no one seemed concerned about the decorative lawns they were bashing, bruising and ripping up in the process. From the Placa d'Espana, the imposing entry point into the Olympic area, to the great stadium showcase at the top of Montjuic, everything looked magnificent - the broad processional avenue festooned with fluttering Olympic banners; the tiered fountains and cascading watercourses on the hillside; the art nouveau lamp standards; statues of nudes and buildings of baroque ornateness. Everything was perfect, but for the grass. Wide swathes of ground lay bare, fallow and ugly. To me, the entire Olympic project and all it involves - 11,000 athletes from 172 countries, 15,000 journalists, 10,000 paramilitary security men, six years of preparation, Dollars 4.6bn worth of investment, the hopes, dreams and financial prospects of sprinters, politicians and advertising agencies - seemed threatened. How could the opening ceremony, I wondered, be shot against a background of bare, black dirt? Forget about the 60,000 punters paying Dollars 400 a ticket to attend the opening ceremony personally. But what about NBC paying huge sums to broadcast it publicly? What about 3.5bn TV viewers around the globe. No amount of banners and bunting could hide the eyesore. 'We have fertilised, we have seeded, we have watered,' a city gardener told me with a wave of his hand. 'It will grow. Manana.' But with a week to go, broad expanses of ground around Montjuic, Barcelona's pride and joy, were as naked as an ancient Greek Olympian. Life, however, works mysteriously under the Spanish sun. What began eight days ago as tiny tendrils poking out of the soil had become a faint blush seven days ago. By Tuesday, the blush had become a pale, electric green. The days went by. The young grass strengthened and grew by centimetres. By Saturday morning, when I rose early to check it one last time, it had become, if not a fully fledged English-style bowling green, an acceptable backdrop to the promised five-ringed spectacle. I was astounded. City gardeners, on the other hand, seemed to take it for granted. Perhaps, like most Catalans, they have become entirely used to rapid growth and startling results. For most of us, the Barcelona Olympics are a two-week entertainment, a spectacle of youthful athleticism. For Catalans the event is something far more besides. As Lluis Arnet, municipal councillor in charge of city planning, has put it, the Olympics 'have provided us with an extraordinary pretext for mobilising resources with which to transform the city.' And transformed it they have. For Barcelona this is an unequalled opportunity to present an image of a city and a region that is modern, dynamic and ready to take on the coming challenges of the single European market. In a sustained burst of energy and spending, Barcelona has not only rebuilt Montjuic but constructed more than 40 other Olympic venues. A redesigned port, a vast new waterfront suburb, rejuvenated suburban peripheries, a new airport, an extensive new highway system, new hotels, skyscrapers, communications towers and 150 new parks and urban spaces have all radically altered Barcelona's infrastructure. The city's growth reflects Catalonia's growth. Catalonia has always been Spain's most industrialised, richest area. While Spain can claim only 72 per cent of average EC national per capita income, in the last five years Catalonia's income has risen slightly above the EC average; it is now richer than Britain. But economics are not the only factor that have made the Olympics vital to Catalonia's future. No equation in Catalonia - economic, cultural, political  -can be complete without taking into account the region's fiery nationalism. A people with a separate language, history and outlook on life - they were primarily urban and industrialised when the rest of Spain was still rural and agricultural - the Catalans have always been at odds with Castillian Spain. What was seen as imperial invasion and oppression in earlier centuries gave way to even harsher and more discriminatory treatment under Franco's fascist rule. The result has been the growth, through the post-Franco period, of various strains of Catalan nationalism ranging from the modestly cultural to the stridently separatist. These days, Catalonia's semi-autonomous government hands out tracts to visiting Olympic journalists which call the region 'a nation without a state of its own,' but its leaders have ruled out the declaration of an independent state. Other political organisations call for more radical steps. The Olympics, however, have had a miraculous effect on the volatile world of Catalan politics. Catalonia's great hope for a leap into the future, they have moderated and drawn together all strains of political sentiment. For the sake of the Olympics, industrialists, socialists, Spanish federalists and hard-core Catalan nationalists have all, so far, made consensus and pragmatism the order of the day. When 60,000 spectators made their way up the Montjuic hillside to watch Saturday's spectacular opening ceremony, the first national anthem they heard in the Olympic stadium was not Spain's, but Catalonia's. Els Segadors is its battle hymn and rallying cry. 'Triumphant, Catalonia will once again be rich and full]' run the words. 'Let us swing the sickle] Let us swing the sickle, defenders of our land]' By the time these Games are over, Catalonia may well be triumphant, rich and full. Certainly the grass lawns around Montjuic will be ready for a good swing of that sickle.</p>

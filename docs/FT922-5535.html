			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: A marketing ploy not enjoyed by business Sir, Jane Fuller is quite correct in her article 'Paying more than a pony' (May 26) to highlight the concern of many small companies regarding the high cost of everyday banking transactions. I, too, have recently queried with Barclays the charges made for routine banking activities of a small company. The following facts emerged: The cost of a debit entry rose by 17.8 per cent in 1991 from 45p to 53p with a further increase of more than 10 per cent likely next month. Prices of other standard transactions have been increased similarly. The notional allowance on credit balances which reduces the cost of everyday transactions has been withdrawn on most business accounts and will be withdrawn for the remainder on June 1 1992. If a corporate account is held in a City or West End branch of Barclays, the per-transaction cost is 10 per cent higher than if the branch were elsewhere in London. The end result is a gross discrepancy between the charges made for corporate as opposed to personal accounts. Had our account been a personal one, we would have been paid by the bank rather than charged, even though the bank would have done exactly the same amount of work. When I raised this point with Barclays the reply was: 'The major difference of course is the fact that if a personal account is maintained in credit during any one quarter, then bank charges are not applied at all. This is a marketing tool forced upon not only Barclays but the other clearers a few years ago due to competition from building societies, etc.' I trust that if this is the case, other organisations will begin active competition for small corporate accounts.

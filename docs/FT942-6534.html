			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / People: No longer shooting for the moon - Daniel Goldin tells Guy de Jonquieres how Nasa is taking several steps for America Daniel Goldin, administrator of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, enters the room rather the worse for wear. The head of the organisation which sent a man to the moon is nursing multiple fractures after an accident on his preferred mode of transport - a racing bicycle. Yet despite refusing to take pain-killers, he is in fighting form. Within minutes, he is punching away at a favourite theme: the ills of modern society, in which a search for self-gratification has cramped horizons and sapped the urge for adventure and discovery. 'Our society demands instant results. We eat instant food. We have instant entertainment and we demand instant financial results. When you demand instant financial results, there is no room for risk or failure. That's the fundamental problem I see today. Where is new wealth going to be generated if we don't take risks? 'The key thing is not to be afraid of risk. There are so many prophets who sit in the wings waiting for someone to fail. And you know what they do? If there's a failure, they come in and say: 'By God, let's punish that failure'. And guess what happens - you get mediocrity in society.' That is where Nasa comes in. Its willingness to embrace risk by advancing the frontiers of technology and backing projects with a long-term economic pay-off, he says, is one of the few ways in which American society can invest in its collective future. Recently, however, this uplifting vision has encountered obstacles. Not only has enthusiasm for space missions continued to wane in the US, but two years of fiscal austerity have reduced Nasa's annual budget by 30 per cent in real terms to Dollars 14.5bn. 'We can't get any closer to the bone,' Goldin says. Still, a lot of fat needed to be cut. Since the 53-year-old Goldin was recruited two years ago from TRW, a leading US defence and engineering company, he has been widely praised for shaking up the management of Nasa's flabby bureaucracy and controlling costs more tightly. He is also shifting expenditure from showpiece space missions into projects promising greater commercial spin-off. That is in tune with President Clinton's drive to increase government support for industrial high-technology research and helps explain why Goldin is one of only two federal agency heads to have survived from the Bush administration. Though Nasa has generated many valuable spin-offs - such as 'error-free' computer software - they have until now been largely chance by-products of its larger space programmes. In future, the agency will focus more on specific three-to-five-year research projects, often in partnership with industry. The aim is to develop generic 'break-through' technologies, which could spawn a string of specific industrial innovations. They include work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and environmental technology. One of the most promising is satellite remote sensing - using satellites to capture vast amounts of data about the earth's surface which could be used in everything from agriculture to environmental planning. 'The whole remote-sensing industry is worth about Dollars 1bn a year today. We think we could activate that to be worth perhaps Dollars 10bn a year,' says Goldin. His biggest - and most controversial - move has been to commit substantial resources to supporting the civil aircraft industry. Such support has not been an explicit goal of federal policy since Congress vetoed research funds for a Supersonic Transport aeroplane in 1971, its planned response to Concorde. 'When that decision was taken, I was despondent about what my country did and excited by the Europeans' boldness in taking risks on Concorde,' he says. 'Yes, Concorde cost money, but what a feat] It defined Europe as a society. I salute the Europeans.' Getting the US back in the race involved interminable, and often heated, negotiations with industry and government, and a grass-roots lobbying campaign which took Goldin to public meetings around the country. The results are joint research programmes with US manufacturers into a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT), a supersonic passenger jet, and an Advanced Subsonic aircraft, both expected to enter service early next century. Nasa's contribution of about Dollars 2.5bn over five years will cover a third of the total cost. The rest will be paid for by industry, much of it in the form of services to the agency. The research includes cleaner, less thirsty and quieter engines, more efficient aerodynamic designs, new materials and improved safety systems. Goldin hopes that by the end of the decade, the technologies will have been proved in the laboratory and will be ready for industry to turn into products. Building the HSCT will, he says, require an international consortium of manufacturers because the market is not big enough to support two rival supersonic aircraft. The issue is how it will be controlled and led. 'Will it be from Europe or America? Generally, the way the world works is that the corporation or country with the superior capability and technology can provide the leadership.' The recent scale of US efforts to ensure that it calls the shots has unsettled Europe's aircraft manufacturers, which have launched their own feasibility study into a supersonic aircraft to succeed Concorde. They and EU trade negotiators are also pressing, against strong US opposition, for stricter international curbs on civil aircraft subsidies in which would be included Nasa support, on the grounds that it threatens to distort competition. Goldin rejects the charge. He condemns European subsidies to Airbus, and insists Nasa funding of the US aircraft industry is different because it stops short of production. 'This is not ugly, unfair competition. This is wonderful stuff,' he growls. 'I compete with everyone, including myself.' Nonetheless, the risks Nasa is taking are paid for with taxpayers' money. 'So what? Look at the mediocrity in the world. Look at the state of industry . . . if we don't make bold moves, where are the new jobs coming from? You tell me.' But would it not be more efficient to pool transatlantic HSCT research by, for example, inviting European manufacturers to participate in Nasa's programmes? No chance, says Goldin: 'I am fiercely competitive in defence of America. It's written in my genetic code.' He recalls that one of the first questions he asked after moving to Nasa was who its customers were. 'I sat down with our staff and we did an analysis. Clearly, our customers were the American people. 'They own this programme, but they had been separated from it for a long time because Nasa was focusing on beating the Russians. But in the new world order, after the Berlin wall came down, it was clear that we had to serve the American public.'</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UN attacks Serbs on aid THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako Ogata, yesterday vehemently condemned the Bosnian Serbs for again blocking relief convoys to the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica and called on world leaders to send in aid 'by all possible means'. Mrs Ogata's statement, made in Geneva, followed the abandonment of the latest attempt by a UN convoy to reach the stricken town, where thousands of people are facing starvation and require urgent medical treatment, when its route was blocked by Serb forces. UN officials believe that the Serb authorities were holding up the convoy to allow the Bosnian Serb army, which was only 5km from Srebrenica and rapidly closing in on the town, to pursue its offensive. General Lars-Erik Wahlgren, the overall commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, went to the Bosnian Serb army headquarters at Lukavica, outside Sarajevo, to try to persuade the Serbs to stop the offensive. Referring to 'the unacceptable attitude' of the Bosnian Serb military, Mrs Ogata said they were preventing access of humanitarian aid to the people of eastern Bosnia 'despite all their verbal and written commitments'. The statement said that at least four other convoys were attempting yesterday to reach other Bosnian enclaves, but were reported to have been halted either by fighting or at Serb checkpoints. UNHCR officials reported up to 30 deaths a day in Srebrenica and said that starving inhabitants and refugees from neighbouring townships were fighting over food supplies dropped by US aircraft. 'The drop zone is crowded with starving people. Gun and knife fights are all too common,' one official said. Michael Littlejohns adds: A new round of Balkans peace talks finally was under way in New York yesterday as Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, met all of the main parties, including Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic. However, these were bilateral negotiations. There was still no indication if or when there would be a plenary session involving Mr Izetbegovic, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, and Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Belgrade's foreign minister. Mr Izetbegovic's said his meeting with Mr Vance and Lord Owen was very short because of the 'bad news' of continued fighting in Bosnia. But he added: 'That doesn't mean we interrupt the negotiations.'</p>

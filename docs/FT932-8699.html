			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs question EC aid to industry EUROPEAN COMMUNITY governments should be more strictly controlled in their use of aid for industry, the Commons trade and industry committee said yesterday. In a report on trade with Europe, the committee attacked the slowness of European Commission investigations into alleged illegal state aid, calling for aid to be frozen during any such inquiry. The report highlights concern that UK companies may be disadvantaged in competition against companies elsewhere in Europe. Trade with Europe, Second Report of the Trade and Industry Committee. HMSO, Pounds 12.50.</p>

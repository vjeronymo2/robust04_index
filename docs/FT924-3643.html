			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Venezuela rulers faltering in poll VENEZUELANS, who have seen two military uprisings against their government this year, went to the polls yesterday in nationwide elections for state governors, mayors, city councils and parish councils. Early projections of the results by a private television station suggested the ruling Accion Democratica lost three of the 11 states it had held. But politicians are concerned that disaffection with Venezuela's democracy will mean low voter turnout. The projection said the party won governors' seats in eight of 22 states, while the opposition Copei won 11 seats, the leftist MAS party garnered two seats and the more radical Causa R took the last seat. The ruling party previously held 11 of 20 states, and two new districts were added for these polls. Only 10.39m Venezuelans, about half the country's population, are registered as voters. This would suggest most voters do not believe that their ballots will change anything.</p>

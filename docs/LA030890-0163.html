			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH FACES A REPRIMAND ONLY IN HOUSE ETHICS INQUIRY  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee Wednesday cleared House Republican Whip Newt  Gingrich of Georgia of major charges but decided to admonish him for two  relatively minor infractions, an informed source said.  </P> <P> After sending a letter of reprimand, the committee will drop its investigation  of Gingrich, the second-ranking GOP member of the House, who filed the original  charges that led to the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright last year.  </P> <P> The panel agreed to admonish Gingrich for failing to report purchasing a home  with his daughter on his required annual financial disclosure form, the source  said, and to chide him for allowing a senior citizens' group to make use of his  congressional mailing privileges.  </P> <P> The complaint said Gingrich should have listed the home as an asset and the  $77,800 mortgage as a liability.  </P> <P> On the main allegations involving a $105,000 fund to promote a book written by  Gingrich and two others, however, the panel absolved the Georgia lawmaker, the  source added.  </P> <P> Gingrich, a firebrand conservative before he won his leadership post by a  single vote last spring, could not be reached for comment on the decision.  </P> <P> Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who filed the charges against Gingrich, told a  reporter the Ethics Committee has decided to drop its investigation but  criticize him for not disclosing the home sale.  </P> <P> Alexander said it was a "practical resolution" of the case, although the  outcome effectively dismissed the heart of his charges against the GOP leader.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. John T. Myers  (R-Ind.), the ranking GOP member of the panel, were expected to announce the  findings today.  </P> <P> The committee met behind closed doors for several hours Wednesday but did not  announce any decision in the Gingrich case.  </P> <P> Alexander began the inquiry last April by charging that Gingrich violated House  rules and federal campaign financing laws by operating a limited partnership in  1984 to promote his book, entitled "Window of Opportunity."  </P> <P> Twenty-one persons -- including some of Gingrich's political backers and others  with an interest in legislation -- put up $5,000 apiece for book advertisements  and Gingrich's travel on behalf of the book.  </P> <P> Gingrich's wife, one of two other co-authors, was paid $10,000 to run the  project.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PACIFIC RIM SHOT;  </P> <P> U.S. OFFICIAL'S JOKE RILES TRADE SUMMIT DELEGATES  </P> <P> A senior U.S. official embarrassed those attending a Pacific Rim trade summit  and offended Soviet and Chinese delegates by attacking Marxism and using a  mocking Chinese accent to tell a joke about Soviet women.  </P> <P> Fred M. Zeder II, head of the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp.,  made the comments Tuesday in a speech that left organizers red-faced and many  foreign delegates shaking their heads in embarrassment.  </P> <P> Zeder, 68, was the first speaker on the second and last day of the $1-million  Pacific Summit, the centerpiece of Washington state's centennial celebration.  He was appointed to head OPIC by President Bush earlier this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began With Joke  </P> <P> Zeder began his address with a joke in which China's late Chairman Mao Zedong  is asked by a foreign journalist what "might have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald  had assassinated Khrushchev rather than President Kennedy."  </P> <P> Mimicking a Chinese accent, Zeder said Mao replied: "Only one thing certain.  Aristotle Onassis would not have married Mrs. Khrushchev."  </P> <P> Few listeners were amused, delegates said.  </P> <P> "It was only a joke, but I don't like the joke," said Lu Zu-wen, commercial  consul for the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco. "He's a joker. I don't know  what his purpose was."  </P> <P> Zeder accused the Soviets of "marching into Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia," of  "bringing Castro's Cuban mercenaries into Nicaragua, Angola and Ethiopia" and  of spreading Marxism "every place in the world."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Dismal Failure'  </P> <P> "Everyone who has tried that Marxist-Leninist form of economy and ideology are  now openly admitting that their system was a dismal failure," Zeder said.  </P> <P> Zeder described how shortly after World War II a German businessman introduced  himself and then said, "I never was a Nazi" while giving a Nazi-style salute.  </P> <P> "Now every place I go in the world, people say, 'I never was a socialist.' You  know, they all want to get on the privatization bandwagon."  </P> <P> Soviet delegate Vyacheslav Zilanov drew applause from other participants at a  later forum when he criticized Zeder's remarks, particularly his harsh attack  on Marxism.  </P> <P> "I don't agree with some of the opinions put forward by Zeder in his morning  speech," Zilanov said. "I don't feel this Pacific Summit is the right place to  discuss Marxist-Leninist theory and its position right now."  </P></p>

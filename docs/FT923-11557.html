			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Building societies are 'stronger than thought' THE BUILDING Societies Commission said yesterday that the societies are in a much stronger financial position than is generally realised in spite of the crisis in the housing market, David Barchard writes. In its annual report, the commission, which regulates the industry, said the capital strength of societies had risen since 1990. The average risk/asset ratio for the industry was 11.8 per cent against 11.2 per cent in 1990 - well above the international minimum of 8 per cent. The commission said societies had shown sense and resolve in confronting the problems in the housing market. At the end of the first quarter of 1992, 7.06 per cent of loans were in arrears of over six months and 1.75 per cent of loans had become repossession cases. Provisions against mortgage losses rose from Pounds 450m in 1990 to Pounds 1.22bn in 1991.</p>

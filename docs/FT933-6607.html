			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: KOP offers Dollars 100m in notes as part of recapitalisation KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankke, the leading Finnish bank, said yesterday it was issuing perpetual subordinated notes worth Dollars 100m in international markets as part of its bid to recapitalise following a period of heavy losses without falling back on direct government aid. KOP said the issue, the latest move in a programme to raise about FM4bn from share and bond issues, was being made without recourse to government guarantees which the Helsinki authorities last week agreed in principle to make available to KOP and Unitas, Finland's second-largest bank. The new KOP notes have a maturity of 50 years and carry a coupon of two points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor) until the fifth year, when the coupon will rise to Libor plus 3.5 points. The issue is being lead managed by Salomon Brothers International. KOP is, in effect, paying a premium for the notes by not making use of the government guarantee. But the bank said the price was reasonable given the guarantee fees it avoided and the importance to KOP of remaining independent. The bank last week announced an international share issue of up to FM1bn to add to the FM1bn already raised from a share issue earlier this year. It has also raised FM250m in an earlier bond issue and intends to raise a total of FM2bn in bonds. KOP, which last year took up a FM1.7bn injection from the state in preference capital, believes it can maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 10 or 11 per cent - above the 8 per cent international minimum - without further recourse to government aid despite not anticipating a return to profit until 1995.</p>

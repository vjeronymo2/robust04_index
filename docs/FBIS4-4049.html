			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XINHUA correspondent Zou Qingli (6760 3237 </F> 7787): "Can Anti-forgery Identification Prevent Counterfeiting?"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- The results of a survey  recently conducted by a concerned department show that about  half of consumers look for anti-forgery identification when they  purchase commodities, believing those with anti-forgery  identification are positively genuine.    However, can anti-forgery identification really prevent the  counterfeiting of products?    A few years back when markets were inundated with forgeries  of famous-brand goods and shoddy products, the concerned  department and victimized enterprises backed products designed  with anti-forgery identification as an effective way of checking  counterfeiting activities. Around 1990, Qingdao's Meiqi Laser  Holographic Image Company and other enterprises were the first  to import laser holographic image production lines from abroad.  Since then, packages of famous-brand products such as  "Zhangguang 101" hair tonic, "Sun" rice crust, and "Sanjiu"  gastric medicine have been treated with laser holographic  anti-forgery identification to prevent counterfeiting. The  initial results of anti-forgery identification were great. In  1991, the State Bureau of Technology Supervision issued a  document popularizing anti-forgery technology on famous-brand  products.    Nonetheless, counterfeit manufacturers did not disappear.  They have used anti-forgery identification as "certificates of  identity" on forged products. As a result, the use of  anti-forgery identification has entered a weird cycle: On the  one hand, in order to prevent counterfeiting, more and more  enterprises manufacturing famous-brand products have started to  use, or have continually changed, their anti-forgery  identification. On the other, counterfeit manufacturers have  closely followed famous-brand manufacturers in using or changing  anti-forgery identification. Thus, the demand for anti-forgery  identification has grown abnormally.    It is understood that so far there are nearly 1,000  enterprises engaged in research and development of anti-forgery  technologies or in the production of goods with anti-forgery  identification, as well as a dozen anti-forgery technologies  including laser holographic imagery, fluorescent ink, magnetic  ink, alteration-proof ink, temperature-changing ink, and special  plate printing. Of these, some 70 enterprises are engaged in  the production of laser holographic anti-forgery goods, with a  production capacity far exceeding demand. These enterprises,  which are scattered all over the country, are run by collective,  private, or individual sectors as well as by joint ventures. In  the absence of a strict and unified management, the scope of  supplying some products is arbitrarily decided by enterprises,  thus defeating the purpose of using anti-forgery identification.  Meanwhile, due to the lack of unified national standards, some  anti-forgery ink products are technology-deficient. As their  chemical composition can be easily deciphered, they have become  the targets of counterfeiters.    According to a briefing by an official of the State Bureau  of  Technology Supervision, of the forgery and shoddy products  seized by technology supervision departments in various  localities, a considerable portion were forged "famous-brand  products" using anti- forgery identification. In addition to  fraud against consumers, these forged and shoddy products have  caused grave economic losses to famous-brand manufacturers and  damaged their credibility. The manufacturer of "Sun" rice crust  has spent nearly 10 million yuan changing anti-forgery  identification on four occasions, but still has failed to thwart  harassment by counterfeiters. The sales volume of "Sun" rice  crust has recently dropped to less than a quarter of that three  years ago.    In view of the fairly large production scale of anti-forgery  products in China, concerned government departments should  establish a special administrative organization, and should  formulate national standards and administrative measures and  rules related to anti- forgery technology and products. They  should exercise strict supervision and management by  implementing a system of fixed locations for the development and  production of anti-forgery technologies. While issuing  production licenses and quality certificates, it is necessary to  examine the qualifications of users of anti-forgery technologies.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler's Golden Handshake: Chrysler Corp. is offering a buyout to its  union-covered employees with as little as one year seniority to try to avoid  layoffs.  </P> <P> Spokesman Lee Sechler said 400 to 450 of about 60,000 Chrysler employees  covered by a contract with the United Auto Workers union have signed up for the  program. He declined to say how much it has cost or to give details of the  formula used to arrive at the amount of an individual's buyout. Sechler said  the computation would be based mainly on an employee's seniority with Chrysler.  </P></p>

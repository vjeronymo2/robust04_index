			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Council spending to increase 3.5% LOCAL government spending will be allowed to rise by 3.5 per cent next year, according to a ministerial letter leaked to the Local Government Chronicle. The letter was sent in May by Mr Michael Howard - then environment secretary  -to Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. In the letter Mr Howard says that councils need an extra Pounds 2.14bn 'to protect local authority services', according to the Department of the Environment's calculations. However, he says he is prepared 'to live with' Pounds 1.44bn. Local authority associations have requested an extra Pounds 5.14bn. The 3.5 per cent rise would affect councils' standard spending assessments, which determine how much grant they receive from central government, and cover all council-controlled services. Standard spending assessments are also used to determine the level at which council budgets may be 'capped' by government. Mr Howard suggests that the savings could be achieved either through pay restraint, or through forcing councils to find greater efficiency savings. However, he says: 'It requires an act of faith to suppose that authorities will look for savings rather than making cuts; their recent track record is not impressive.' The letter also recommends a 'rapid phasing out' of transitional relief for the council tax by the end of next year. He says: 'A sudden increase in council tax levels in the second year could all too easily swing the public against the tax.' Local authorities are to meet Mr John Gummer, Mr Howard's successor as environment secretary, next Thursday to discuss spending plans.</p>

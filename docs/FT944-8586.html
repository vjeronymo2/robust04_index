			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Tietmeyer warning on Emu Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, warned strongly yesterday against rushing towards European monetary union before a joint monetary policy had been worked out and full central banking independence achieved. He was speaking the day after Mr Giovanni Ravasio, the European Commission's director-general for economic and monetary affairs, had held out the possibility of Emu as early as 1997. Mr Tietmeyer said: 'I am convinced that monetary policy integration in Europe can only be the outcome of a lengthy process.' The struggle to devise the best monetary policy strategy and the right instruments to implement this 'could prove to be even more difficult and time-consuming than the preparations for issuing banknotes and coins,' he warned in a speech to a Frankfurt banking congress. He said satisfactory monetary results could not be obtained without proper independence for the future European central bank - it was indispensable to have 'not only theoretical but also a far-reaching degree of actual independence'. The Maastricht treaty does not call for central banking independence until stage three of Emu. However, Mr Tietmeyer said it was 'crucial to enhance the independence of national central banks at an early stage.' The Bundesbank and the central banks of France and Spain are independent, while the Bank of England is subject to government control. Others are under varying degrees of government influence. The European central bank's independence could not be achieved at short notice, he said. On monetary policy, he criticised suggestions that an all-European, or transnational, monetary target should be set now, in stage two of Emu. The technical and institutional pre-conditions did not yet exist for an early switch to a common monetary policy. Opinions on future policy also differed widely. Mr Tietmeyer was speaking in the week of the first council meeting of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) at its new Frankfurt headquarters. One of its tasks is to recommend by the end of 1996 what type of inflation or money supply targets should be pursued by the future central bank to achieve price stability. The EMI's goal is to produce a 'turnkey' European central bank that could begin operating as soon as Emu receives the political go-ahead. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday supported the objective of European economic and monetary union, but said the timetable laid down by the Maastricht treaty for a single currency was invalid, while Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, claimed the question of a single currency did not arise at the moment.</p>

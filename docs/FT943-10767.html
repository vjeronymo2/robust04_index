			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: BP Companies only announce targets they know they can meet, claim those who downplay the scale of BP's achievement over the past two years. At the time though, there were many who doubted the targets could be hit at all, let alone a year early. Yesterday Mr David Simon, chief executive, declared the recovery programme virtually complete as the company announced second-quarter figures well ahead of City expectations. The exploration and production numbers were particularly impressive with second-quarter profits matching those a year earlier in spite of a Dollars 3 a barrel fall in the oil price. The 27 per cent increase over the previous quarter, on the back of a Dollars 1.50 price rise to Dollars 15.41, shows what might be in store if the Nigerian strike escalates. Yet the shares rose only in line with the market. The sharp downturn in US refining was certainly unsettling as were cautious comments about margin recovery in chemicals, though shares in Shell, which is more dependent on downstream business, did not flinch. A more fundamental question now is quite where BP goes from here. With healthy cash flow and debt about to fall to Dollars 10bn, the company can alter the balance between debt-reduction, investment and dividends. It says it is in no hurry to crank up investment and can accommodate current plans, including expansion in central Europe, Indonesia and China, within a Dollars 4bn a year budget. That leaves ample scope to rebuild the dividend, while the shares still look attractive in terms of earnings. Those who question BP's ability to find another Dollars 1bn of profit should remember what happened to the doubters last time.</p>

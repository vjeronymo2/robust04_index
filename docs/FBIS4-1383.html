			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Nairobi, 28 Apr (AFP) -- The headquarters of the  rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in the capital came under  intermittent heavy weapons fire on Thursday [28 April], UN  Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) spokesman Abdul Kabia said in  Kigali. Contacted by telephone, Kabia said UNAMIR personnel were  in the building, which is normally the seat of the National  Development Council (Parliament), "and we had to ask the  government forces to stop firing to let them out." It appeared  that the rebels did not return the fire, which broke out early  in the morning and lasted for more than an hour, Kabia said. He  noted that the previous night had been very calm.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The city of Lichuan recently inflicted public  punishments on a batch of leading cadres at and above the  district deputy director level. These cadres were found to have  accepted gifts and cash in violation of party and government  discipline.    Over the past few years, some of Lichuan's party members and  cadres fell into the habit of throwing banquets on such  occasions as weddings, funerals, birthdays, housewarmings, and  so on, at which they procured gifts and cash from guests.    Investigations show that by 10 March 1994, a total of 27  leading cadres at and above the deputy district director level  had been involved in such activities, including four cadres at  the county deputy magistrate level, 16 cadres at the district  director level, and seven cadres at the district deputy director  level. While five cadres had each accepted more than 10,000  yuan in cash from others, fifteen cadres, including four at the  county magistrate level, had violated party and government  discipline in these activities.    In view of this situation, the Lichuan City CPC Committee  and  Lichuan City People's Government recently decided to strictly  enforce party and government discipline by meting out two  inner-party disciplinary warnings and two administrative  warnings to four cadres at the district director level and the  district deputy director level, respectively; issuing a circular  criticizing seven cadres at the district director level and the  district deputy director level; and reporting the cases of four  corrupt cadres at the county magistrate level to the relevant  autonomous prefectural party committees and discipline  inspection commissions for punishment in accordance with the  relevant personnel management regulations.</p>

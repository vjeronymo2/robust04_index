			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Partners, And Peace"] </F>   [Text] To Moscow from Brussels via Prague, President  Clinton is busily saying the right things. The NATO summit  sighs with relief at the message that the Atlantic Alliance is  still vital to the security of the US. The Czechs and their  neighbours are invited to come right in and join the new  Partnership for Peace. The comforting word for the Russians  (those of them who want to hear) is that they are wanted inside,  not outside, Europe: there will be no new lines on the map to  exclude them. None of this is startling news, but it is just  what European leaders, rattled by Washington's intermittent  attention, need to be told. Never mind the passionless monotone  in which Mr Clinton delivered his new European manifesto under  the tapestries in Brussels's City Hall. At least he actually  said it.    Behind the flourishes of verbal intent the reality is rather  harder to detect, though that is nothing new in the diplomatic  business where symbolism weighs more than substance. The truth  is that, in Europe's uncertain state of transition, the  organisation can hardly pretend to offer any greater certainty.  The US forces in Europe can no longer have the clear role  assigned to them by its previous division. Mr Clinton, unlike  his predecessors, is only too happy to endorse military  co-operation, such as the proposed NATO joint task forces,  between the European allies. It is a sign of changed times that  Chancellor Kohl should express his gratitude for an attitude  which really highlights the US's growing strategic detachment  from Europe. Strengthening the European pillar of the alliance  through the Western European Union, as promised in yesterday's  communique, is now less rhetoric than the best way forward to a  new autonomous identity. The suggestion of an expanded NATO  peacekeeping role under the UN is positive too, although it will  have to play a more convincing role than it has so far in  Bosnia. The last-minute threat of air strikes to reopen Tuzla  and ensure the rotation of troops to Srebrenica bears all the  mark of diplomatic improvisation--and Britain's conversion to an  idea it has steadfastly opposed is distinctly odd.    The show moves to Moscow where Mr Clinton's difficulties are  considerably greater than they were in Brussels. His encounter  with Mr Yeltsin can hardly be termed a "summit"--and not just  because of the loss or erosion of superpower status. Such  meetings are no longer a vantage point from which to survey the  world, but just another mundane encounter. The only tangible  achievement to tie up is the agreement on removing Ukraine's  nuclear weapons, yet that is still subject to the parliament in  Kiev. No longer adversaries, neither leader would however be  wise to embrace the other too warmly. The US cannot remake  Russia in its own image as West Germany has done -- at a high  price -- with the East. A reasonable understanding between the  two countries will no doubt help reassure the rest of Europe;  but it is best secured on the basis of modest expectations.</p>

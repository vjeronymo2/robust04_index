			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / EC seeks US troops for 'safe areas' in Bosnia THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday called on the US and Russia to send troops to bolster an expanding United Nations-led effort to create 'safe areas' for refugees in eastern Bosnia. The call represents a stiffening of European opposition to the Clinton administration's plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems and a determination to press ahead with economic sanctions to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen peace plan. During a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels, the Europeans played down differences with the US over the Bosnian conflict. Ministers declared that all options, including military, remained open; but their desire to seize the diplomatic initiative from Washington soon became evident. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, won support for his view that the recent split within Serbian ranks over the Vance-Owen plan represented a significant development which reflected the impact of sanctions on the Serbian regime headed by President Slobodan Milosevic. Ministers agreed it was necessary to test Mr Milosevic's pledge to seal the border with Bosnia, possibly by sending EC civilian observers as part of an international group to see if economic supplies such as fuel and spare parts were filtering through to the Bosnian Serbs. Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday accused their former Belgrade patrons of stopping them from leaving their self-styled state, saying Serbian police had refused to allow them to cross the frontier. But the EC proposal which is likely to draw most attention is the French idea to renew invitations to the US - along with Russia and other large powers - to join the UN-led international peacekeeping effort in Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said he welcomed the French plan which aims to put teeth into the latest UN resolution to protect Moslem refugee enclaves encircled by Serbian artillery. French officials said the plan was to use US, British, French and Russian forces to enter safe areas for the Moslems, raising the stakes for Bosnian Serbs. Mr Juppe commented: 'They will think twice before attacking (these areas).' The Clinton administration has remained wary of agreeing to send US ground forces until the warring parties commit themselves to the Vance-Owen plan and a ceasefire is in place. Yesterday Washington signalled that it would not move closer to military action in Bosnia before a weekend referendum by Bosnian Serbs on the peace plan. 'Bosnia is in a holding period at this time,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary. During a diplomatic mission to Europe last week, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, made no secret that the US favoured arming the Bosnian Moslems rather than the riskier course of direct US military intervention. The latest EC initiative may therefore be seen as an attempt to sidetrack the military options. A senior UK official, noting that the Europeans, particularly the British and French, have already put troops in place to assist in humanitarian operations, said: 'There is always a different view among those people who are on the ground and those who are spectators.' During the Brussels talks, EC foreign ministers dismissed the Bosnian Serb referendum as a stalling device. Lord Owen, the EC mediator, said it did not have 'an ounce of credibility'.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Observer: Gnomic Zurich Sir Alan Walters, erstwhile hardline monetarist adviser to Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister, pops up in the most surprising places. His latest venture is to take on a directorship at a newish, high-powered Zurich consultancy, Leutwiler und Partners, which has also recruited Arthur Dunkel, the former Gatt secretary-general, as an associate. The consultancy was set up a little over a year ago by Fritz Leutwiler, retired president of the Swiss National Bank. Another tough monetarist, Leutwiler is also a big Thatcher fan, having once betrayed the rather un-Swiss emotion that 'remembering that I am a married man, I love her'. 'Strategic advice at a very senior level' is the idea behind the outfit, according to vice-chairman Claude Hankes-Drielsma, so Walters has already been involved, sitting on an economic policy advisory committee set up by Leutwiler for the Kingdom of Jordan. Hankes-Drielsma, a former management committee chairman of Price Waterhouse, says it was 'a natural progression' for him to become a director. Could Leutwiler und Partners be hoping to land a contract with Her Majesty's Government, via Walters? 'Not that I am aware of,' Hankes-Drielsma responds drily. Whatever, transport economists clearly travel well.</p>

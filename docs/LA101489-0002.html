			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD ZACHARIAS; MADE THE DOVE BAR INTO HOUSEHOLD NAME  </P> <P> Richard Zacharias, a businessman who fell in love with the Dove ice cream bar  when one was served to him at his country club years ago and in 1984 acquired a  half interest in the firm and brought it to national attention, died Wednesday  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> His daughter, Nancy Freedman, at whose home he died, said her father had been  battling cancer for two years. He was 75.  </P> <P> Owner of hospitals and manufacturing and clothing firms in the Chicago area,  Zacharias brought his business and production acumen to the Dove bar after  buying 50% of the firm from the Stefanos family. The family had concocted the  ice cream bar in 1939 to keep their own children from chasing after the  neighborhood ice cream truck.  </P> <P> Zacharias stepped in and transformed the company in less than a year from a  back-room operation that hand-dipped 500 bars a day in a pot of warm chocolate  into a $2-million ice cream plant with a capacity of 72,000 bars a day.  </P> <P> A year later the company was sold to the M&amp;M Mars candy company with  Zacharias remaining as a consultant.  </P> <P> His success was written about in publications ranging from the New York Times  to People magazine.  </P> <P> Owner of Precision Plating Co. of Chicago, he became a president of the  National Assn. of Metal Finishers. His philanthropies included the Chicago  Hearing Society.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Beverly, his daughter, sons Steven and Daniel and  six grandchildren.  </P> <P> Memorial services will be held in Glencoe, Ill.  </P></p>

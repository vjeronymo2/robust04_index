			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Rescheduling Woes: Long Beach Opera's "Pelleas et Melisande," originally  planned for April 28-May 6, then rescheduled for April, 1991, because baritone  Kurt Ollmann had a schedule conflict with another opera in Rome, has been hit  with yet another schedule problem.  </P> <P> Ollmann, who was announced to sing the role of Pelleas, now must cancel because  the Rome production of "Ariadne" was moved to the same time in 1991. LBO  general director Michael Milenski unsuccessfully tried to recruit two other  baritones, including Malcolm Walker, who withdrew after he told Milenski he  didn't want to do it in English. "It's the most incredible casting problem I've  ever had," he said. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

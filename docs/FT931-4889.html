			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Japan The irony of the government fiddling the stock market following the arrest of a senior politician for financial irregularities seems to have escaped the Japanese authorities. There was, however, a little more to yesterday's sharp rally in Tokyo than simple manipulation. NTT's shares have rallied by nearly 30 per cent in the last week on the hope that the phone company would be allowed to increase its tariffs. But the most important influence is probably a fear that institutions will be left behind in a liquidity-driven rally. Short term rates are now at a record low and bond yields have fallen to 4 per cent. Those who bought high-yield foreign bonds in an effort to boost returns have had their fingers burned by the yen's strength. However much they hate the idea, investors are being dragged back to equities as one of the few assets which offers even the faint prospect of capital gains. Of course, it is easy to construct a negative case. The economy is still in decline and the government's Keynesian packages will only offset a fall in private sector output this year. The moth-eaten balance sheets of corporate Japan will take years to repair. Operational restructuring has barely begun. With earnings depressed, share ratings are again sky high. Yet, as in London and New York, the weight of money could prove too much. And with such strong forces pulling on the market, Tokyo's recent stability looks like a very unstable equilibrium.</p>

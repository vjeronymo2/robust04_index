			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENDER  </P> <P> I appreciated the article "Lady Marine Takes Charge of Few Good Recruits" (Part  A, Nov. 25). It showed that women can be just as tough as men and just as  successful as men, without sacrificing their womanhood.  </P> <P> However, I regret the fact that the writer put such effort into emphasizing the  staff sergeant's gender. I think we should look at Ann Marie Wells'  accomplishments as successes of a person, not of a female. If men and women are  ever going to be treated as equals, we must stop concentrating on  distinguishing between the sexes.  </P> <P> AMANDA L. WENDT  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / BT unveils plans to sell BSkyB satellite TV dishes BRITISH Telecom plans to make its first move into the fast-growing home entertainment market later this year, by selling dishes to receive BSkyB broadcasts from the Astra television satellite. Entertainment is potentially the biggest avenue of diversification for BT, under increasing pressure from competitors such as cable TV companies, in its traditional telephone and business communication markets. However, the terms of its licence bar BT from providing entertainment channels on its network. BT is in the final stages of negotiation with two electronics companies to manufacture satellite dishes and associated equipment in the UK. They will go on sale in BT's shops and 'selected high street outlets' this autumn. The move will throw BT's marketing muscle behind BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. BT and BSkyB are believed to be discussing a deal that would give each access to the other's customers. The move would also provide powerful new competition for Amstrad, Mr Alan Sugar's company, which so far has been the largest UK supplier of satellite dishes and receivers. BT is unlikely to undercut Amstrad's prices significantly but it is expected to compete on what it believes is a superior record for product and service reliability. According to the FT Satellite Monitor about 3.2m homes in the UK can now receive satellite TV - at least 2m through their own dish and the remainder by cable or community aerial. UK sales of dishes and associated equipment are worth about Pounds 120m a year, not a large target for a company of BT's size. But BT wants to use it as a way into the huge new market emerging through the three-way 'convergence' of entertainment, telecommunications and computing. Other signs of BT's ambitions are its home videophone, launched last month, and recent agreements with US and European electronics companies to develop personal computers with 'multimedia' facilities. The experience gained from selling and servicing satellite dishes and any associated marketing agreement with BSkyB would be useful preparation for the time when BT is permitted to use its fast-expanding fibre optic network for television. Recent discoveries in optical electronics make it possible to send millions of telephone calls down a single glass strand as a thin as a hair. As a result, the network is likely to have a vast excess capacity  - and some BT executives would like to use it for new forms of entertainment.</p>

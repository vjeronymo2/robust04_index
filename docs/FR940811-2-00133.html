Comments received in response to an earlier notice suggested uses for this symbol that were not considered when these guidelines were first developed. These amendments are intended to provide additional flexibility to the States within the purposes for which the blue Star of Life was originally registered as a certification mark.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Susan D.

On February 1, 1977, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks issued to NHTSA a certificate of registration for the blue ``Star of Life'' symbol as a certification mark.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This registration gives NHTSA exclusive legal authority to control the use of the mark throughout the United States, and remains in effect for 20 years. It may be renewed for an additional 10 years in accordance with 15 U.S.C. section 1059.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Current Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with its registration as a certification mark, the blue ``Star of Life'' may be used on emergency medical care vehicles to certify that they meet DOT standards, by emergency medical care personnel to certify that they are trained to meet DOT standards, and on road maps and highway signs to indicate the location of or access to qualified emergency medical care services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a memorandum dated September 14, 1977, NHTSA authorized States and Federal agencies that are involved with emergency medical services to permit use of the blue ``Star of Life'' certification mark in accordance with criteria and specifications outlined in the memorandum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Request for Modification of Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In July 1992, a State requested an advisory opinion from NHTSA on the use of the blue ``Star of Life'' symbol in the State's Emergency Medical Services-Do Not Resuscitate (EMS&hyph;DNR) program. The State proposed to use the mark to alert State certified prehospital emergency medical care providers that a person wearing a bracelet which displays the ``Star of Life'' and the letters ``EMS&hyph;DNR'' does not wish to be resuscitated. NHTSA determined that this use does not meet the criteria outlined in the memorandum dated September 14, 1977. Accordingly, NHTSA denied the State's request to use the ``Star of Life'' in connection with the EMS&hyph;DNR program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to NHTSA's decision to deny the State's request, the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP), the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Directors (NASEMSD), and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) contacted NHTSA to express their support for use of the blue ``Star of Life'' by the State's EMS&hyph;DNR program. These organizations made four primary arguments in support of the proposed use of the ``Star of Life'' for EMS&hyph;DNR purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, they contended that the proposed use would provide EMS personnel with a consistent location where they could look for EMS orders on terminally ill persons who desire not to undergo resuscitation. The organizations indicated that they consider the proposed use appropriate because the DNR bracelet would alert EMS personnel of a medical condition or appropriate medical treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the organizations asserted that the ``Star of Life'' is a unique symbol widely recognized by EMS personnel, which has come to symbolize the entire EMS system rather than the limited criteria in the September 1977 NHTSA memorandum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the organizations contended that since NHTSA has ``historically'' granted State EMS offices some discretionary authority regarding use of the ``Star of Life,'' NHTSA should allow State EMS offices to determine the use of the ``Star of Life'' on EMS&hyph;DNR bracelets within their respective States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, at the time the guidelines were developed, the possibilities for the use of the ``Star of Life'' on a DNR bracelet were not considered. The organizations urged NHTSA to reexamine the appropriate use of the symbol and either rescind or reissue the guidelines to permit such use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Federal Register Notice Requesting Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> NHTSA continued to have concerns about expanding the authorized uses of the blue ``Star of Life.'' However, it also recognized that the current guidelines for the authorized use of the blue ``Star of Life'' certification mark had not been revised since their publication in September 1977.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the agency decided that it was appropriate to reevaluate the guidelines in view of the current trends and possible uses for the symbol and to examinate the symbol's purpose and whether it should be expanded at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

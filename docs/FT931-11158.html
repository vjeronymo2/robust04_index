			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Israeli PM defiant over right to deport: Peace talks still in doubt MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, insisted yesterday that Israel retained the right to carry out future mass expulsions of Palestinians and implied that the US had condoned the deportation in December of 400 alleged Islamic militants to Lebanon. His remarks, during a defiant speech to an angry parliament, seemed certain to deepen Palestinian rejection of an earlier compromise offer by Israel on the expulsions and further complicate prospects of resuming Middle East peace talks which the US wants to reconvene within weeks. His offer to bring home around 100 of the 400 Palestinian deportees stranded in Lebanon has already been rejected by Palestinians who insist they will not return to the negotiating table until every deportee is brought back. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is to visit the region later this month to try to achieve an early resumption of the peace talks, Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said in Cairo yesterday. Responding to criticism of his compromise on the expulsions from right-wing opposition MPs, Mr Rabin said: 'The principle remains of our ability to remove for a limited time hundreds of inciters, leaders, organisers. You never succeeded in doing that.' Washington's acceptance of the compromise offer 'created a groundwork of understanding for a subject that America in principle opposed and opposes. But it accepted this reality - and in unprecedented dimensions,' he said. The Clinton administration says Monday's offer by Israel to repatriate a quarter of the deportees immediately and shorten to no more than one year the exile of the remainder removed the need for any further action by the United Nations Security Council to enforce resolution 799 calling for the immediate return of them all. But Mr Rabin's remarks are certain to stiffen the Palestine Liberation Organisation's insistence that only full compliance with resolution 799 will suffice to restart peace talks. One of the key concerns of both the PLO and Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist organisation to which most deportees allegedly belong, is to ensure that the expulsions do not create a precedent for future mass deportations, perhaps the most sensitive political issue in the occupied territories. Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem yesterday summoned western diplomats to warn that they would not accept any early call to resume peace negotiations. 'We told them that if they issue invitations to the talks, they know our participation is suspended. We cannot continue the peace process before all the Palestinians return,' said Mr Saeb Erekat, a senior delegate to the talks. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, acknowledged that continuing the talks with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan without the Palestinians was unrealistic. Reuter adds from Washington: Diplomats said yesterday the US had been forced to call off Middle East peace talks on regional issues scheduled for next week because of the dispute over Palestinians deported by Israel. Two sessions were due to convene on February 9, one in Rome on regional economic issues and the second in Washington on arms control. A session on refugees was scheduled the following week in Oslo.</p>

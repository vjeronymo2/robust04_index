			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Top civil servants set to back deal TOP civil servants are today expected to accept a radical extension of performance-related pay which will give managers much greater discretion over what they pay staff. Under the agreement proposed by the Treasury, which will apply to the 25,000 senior four grades of civil servant, the automatic progression up a 'pay spine' will be removed and replaced by pay bands. Performance will be measured against an agreed standard. If individuals perform less well than the standard they will receive no pay increase. In addition there will be a further budget for individual merit awards for those who have done better than the standard. The precise arrangements and criteria for the merit awards have yet to be agreed between the Treasury and the three unions involved - the Association of First Division Civil Servants, the IPMS and the NUCPS. The actual pay offer this year to these higher-grade civil servants remains confidential. Other civil servants have been offered and have accepted a 4.1 per cent pay offer which also included an element of performance-related pay but did not abolish the traditional pay spines. The Union of Communication Workers is recommending acceptance of a 3.99 per cent increase on basic pay for staff at Parcelforce, the parcels arm of the Post Office whose privatisation was announced last week. The union represents 10,000 of the 12,500 workers in Parcelforce.</p>

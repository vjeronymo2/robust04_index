			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Mersey Docks buys Kent port: Medway sold for Pounds 104m - nearly three times the buy-out price MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company yesterday clinched its purchase of Medway Ports for Pounds 103.7m, only 18 months after Medway was bought for Pounds 37m by management and employees. The acquisition, which gives it a deepwater port in south-eastern England to complement its Liverpool docks, will be funded in part by a two-for-five rights issue to raise Pounds 76.6m. It is offering 24m shares at 330p against a closing price last night of 376p, up 1p. The near tripling in value of Medway, a trust port until its privatisation in March 1992, reflects large cost savings achieved by the management. It has halved the workforce from 600 at privatisation and introduced new working practices. Some 270 of its 300 dockers took redundancy late last year. Medway now employs 100 dockers, bringing in contractors employed by other stevedoring companies for specialist work when required. The cut in costs contributed to a leap in operating profits to Pounds 4.5m for the first six months of this year on turnover of Pounds 17.2m, compared with Pounds 3.5m for Medway's first 10 months last year as a private company. The agreed offer values Medway's ordinary shares at Pounds 32.82 each for a total of Pounds 65.8m. Shareholders will also receive Pounds 4.43 a share in dividends for a total of Pounds 37.25. Management and employees were granted shares and bought more at Pounds 1 each to help fund their buyout. Mersey Docks is also buying Pounds 15m of preference shares and taking on Medway's net indebtedness of Pounds 22.9m. Sheerness is Medway's main port, specialising in cars, fruit, timber and paper. Mersey Docks specialises in containers, forest products, grain, scrap metal and oil, so the two can have complementary marketing strategies. Medway, which is forecasting minimum operating profits of Pounds 10.1m this year, had a net asset value of Pounds 20.4m in June. It said yesterday it intended to exercise a Pounds 2.25m option before September 30 to acquire the freehold interest in the former Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham. The property has considerable development potential. Mersey Docks, which says the takeover should enhance earnings next year, is forecasting pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 19m this year, compared with Pounds 15.2m, and a final dividend of 6.15p to give a total of 9p - a 20 per cent increase. Through a tough policy on labour practices, management at Mersey Docks, like its counterparts at Medway Ports, has revitalised the company. Freight volumes through Liverpool now match the peak volumes of the 1950s and 1960s. The UK government - Mersey Docks' biggest shareholder with 20 per cent  - will not be taking up its rights. The government announced several years ago it would sell its holding when market conditions were right, but not this year. The Pounds 37m privatisation of Medway Ports was financed by Pounds 20m of loans, Pounds 15m of preference shares and Pounds 2m of equity at Pounds 1 a share, giving employees and management a 51 per cent stake. The company then had Pounds 17m debt. The management bid, the only one left after two others dropped out, was just below the formula set by the government for the privatisation process, attracting criticism. The leaders of the buy-out will benefit most from the takeover, with Mr Peter Vincent, Medway's chief executive, making Pounds 12m and four other directors Pounds 8m each. They are taking a third of their benefits in Mersey Docks shares. Mr Trevor Furlong, Mersey chief executive, will become Medway's chairman. Mr Vincent will become a Mersey Docks director. The rights issue is fully underwritten by Robert Fleming.</p>

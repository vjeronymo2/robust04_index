			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Calculating risks to the peacekeepers The first challenge for Nato tacticians in implementing a threat of air strikes in Bosnia will be to find and destroy gun emplacements. The emplacements, which are small and mobile, can be found through analysing the trajectory of an incoming shell, or by 'forward control teams' - 40 of which Nato has working covertly in Bosnia, according to Mr Edward Foster of the Royal United Services Institute in London. These teams can pick out targets for attacking aircraft. Those aircraft are likely to be F-16 fighters based in Aviano and Villafranca, northern Italy and possibly Jaguar aircraft based in Gioia Del Colle, southern Italy. To deal with tanks, Nato may also bring in A-10 'Warthog' anti-tank aircraft, and possibly AC-130 Spectre aircraft, based at Brindisi. On the Serbian side, a number of defences might be employed. They could mount an air defence, although Nato could deploy Tornado F-3 aircraft in convoy with F-16s and A-10s to deter this - Tornados F-3s can spot incoming aircraft early and fire long-range missiles at them. They could also fire anti-aircraft guns. These have already been used in Bosnia as heavy machine guns, says Mr Foster. Nato forces would deal with these in the same way as artillery and mortars. More difficult could be surface-to-air missiles. According to the Military Balance, published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Serbian side could have as many as 60 radar-guided SA6 missiles. The radar can be jammed, or radar-homing missiles, which follow the radar signal to its source, can be used. The US aircraft carrier Saratoga in the Adriatic sea is carrying this equipment. Finally, Serbian forces could respond to air attacks by retaliating against the 11,000 UN troops on the ground. Some, like the British, have Warrior armoured vehicles, which are proof against all but heavy weapons, but others, including the French and Ukrainian forces in Sarajevo and Canadians in Srebrenica have only vehicles that will protect them against small arms. The most vulnerable of all, will be the troops' support units and the UNHCR relief workers.</p>

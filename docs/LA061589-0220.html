			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FLORIDA RACE TRACK MAY BE SOLD  </P> <P> Three families owning 90% of Gulfstream Park have entered into a non-binding  letter of intent to sell their shares, the track has announced.  </P> <P> The potential buyer was not named, but newspaper reports today named Calder  Race Course owner Bertram R. Firestone as the suitor.  </P> <P> If the sale is consummated, Gulfstream would continue as a thoroughbred track,  said Douglas Donn, president and chief executive officer. There would be no  operational or personnel changes, and plans for the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream  on Nov. 4 would be unaffected, Donn said.  </P> <P> Selling their shares would be members of the Donn family, the Fred Flipse  family of Miami and the Arthur Appleton family of Ocala.  </P></p>

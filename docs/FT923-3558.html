			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Italy signals a break with the past: The government has chosen speed over caution for the privatisation of Credito Italiano Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, is a methodical man. 'I like to have figures next to the facts; only then can I make up my mind,' he says. But in deciding to kick-start the country's privatisation programme with the surprise sale of Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth biggest bank, where Mr Barucci was joint managing director until his appointment to the treasury two months ago, the government has chosen speed over caution. Rather than waiting until mid-October, when the team of six prominent economists and bankers appointed to advise the treasury on privatisation was due to present its findings, the government has shifted gear in advance. The announcement that IRI, the state holding group which owns 67 per cent of Credito Italiano's ordinary shares, is to sell part, or all, of its stake, comes in spite of Mr Barucci's caution and signs that the Bank of Italy would have preferred the restructuring of the country's financial institutions to take place before, rather than after, big privatisations. Circumstances have dictated otherwise. Pressure on the lira has forced ministers to send a further signal of their determination to confront the country's structural economic problems, notably the huge budget deficit. 'It's mainly marketing,' says one analyst. 'The sale will demonstrate that Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, is intent on change.' Selling a bank, rather than one of the dozens of other companies controlled by IRI, will reinforce that image. Public-sector banks, which dominate Italy's financial system, have long been used by politicians for patronage. In spite of Bank of Italy supervision, gaining influence over a state or municipally owned bank has been a target for political parties. Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the two most prestigious public-sector banks based in Milan, have partly resisted such influences. However, disposing of the state's majority stake in either is one of the most powerful instruments for signalling a break with the past. Privatising a bank should also appeal to the bourse. This year, share prices have tumbled almost 27 per cent; trading volumes have dwindled; and costs have risen sharply owing to tighter regulations and new technology. Brokers have already indicated their appetite for a bank privatisation. Last month, BCI's shares leapt 7 per cent in a matter of hours on rumours that Mediobanca, the big Milan merchant bank, was studying its privatisation. Suggestions this week that Credito Italiano would be sold triggered a 14 per cent jump in its shares on Wednesday, when they were suspended at L1,390. The choice of Credito Italiano, rather than the better-known BCI, is less clear. Credito Italiano has always been the less prominent of the two. Its clientele, though predominantly corporate like BCI's, does not comprise the same range of blue-chip companies. Nor is it as international as its slightly bigger sister. Politics may have played a part. Mr Amato, a Socialist, may have been swayed by his party's aim of merging BCI with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Rome-based bank identified closely with the Socialists. Alternatively, Mr Barucci may have wanted to start the privatisation ball rolling with his former company. Whatever the reasons, Credito Italiano, founded in Genoa in 1870 and still rooted in northern Italy, has no reason to be bashful. Its market capitalisation is around L2,000bn (Pounds 850m) and its role as one of the main bankers to northern Italy's industrialists was underlined by the recent presence of Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, on its board. Moreover, analysts have tended to prefer Credito to BCI. While corporate business remains its keynote it has developed other activities such as leasing. The branch network, now more than 700 units, has been expanded to develop retail banking. Group total assets were L94,347bn (Pounds 44bn) at end-December. Earnings for 1991 were disappointing, largely because of a L155bn jump in the tax bill at group level to L266.4bn and a L15bn fall in extraordinary items. As a result, net group profits after minorities fell to L297bn from L337.6bn in 1990. However, analysts were relieved to see an increase of more than 18 per cent in operating profits to L640.4bn. This year promises much worse. Interim results, will be published later this month, and it is likely the bank will have to make higher provisions because of Italy's economic slowdown and reduced earnings on bonds. Potential investors are more concerned with the terms for the share sale. Last year, IRI disposed of most of its Credito Italiano non-voting savings shares via an international placement led by Goldman Sachs, reducing its holding of savings stock to just 17 per cent. Some details of the latest transaction may emerge following an IRI board meeting today and a domestic and international placement via top merchant banks seems likely. Two other factors look certain. IRI will dispose of the remaining savings stock, and cut its portion of ordinary shares below 50 per cent. That implies selling an initial tranche of 20 per cent of the ordinary shares, which may be sold in 'units' along with some savings stock. When share prices recover, more - possibly all - is likely to go. For while 'privatisation' in Italy often used to signify raising cash from the market while retaining control, under Messrs Amato and Barucci, it is set to take on a new meaning.

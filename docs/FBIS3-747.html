The commander of the SADF [South African Defense  Force] in the homeland, Brigadier Johan Coetzee, said in  Mmabatho that it happened last night while the defense force was  escorting right-wingers out of Bophuthatswana. They were  ambushed, and shots were fired at the right-wingers and the  defense force. Four right-wingers were wounded by the  attackers, and one of them died later. There were no casualties  among the defense force troops.    Our Durban staff reports that one for three right-wingers  shot dead by a member of the Bophuthatswana security forces  yesterday was the AWB commander in Natal, General Nick Fourie.  The other two were apparently also senior AWB members.</p>

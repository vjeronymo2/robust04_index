			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Geest It seems there is a surplus of skins as well as bananas. Not only has Geest been hit by a severe outbreak of black siratoga fungus in its Costa Rican plantations, it is also suffering grievously from another pest in the form of those seemingly well-meaning people in the European Commission. These not only arranged last year's European banana market liberalisation in such a way as to cause a glut of bananas in the final quarter, undermining the profitability of Geest's cosy arrangements with the Windward Islands. They also had the temerity to compound the over-supply by offering to increase the quotas of Latin American countries in order to secure a Gatt deal in December. Sadly, Geest cannot count on the kind of public furore which has French farmers burning English lamb carcasses. Liberalisation of banana imports is generally good for UK consumers anyway. But yesterday's profits warning raises the question of whether Geest could have handled an admittedly difficult situation better. Its large investment in Costa Rica reduces its flexibility compared with Fyffes, which is importing from both Guatemala and Honduras. Fyffes' risk from black siratoga is relatively smaller and it can shop around more easily for export licences if these are required under the Gatt deal. It does not help Geest's case that this is its third profits warning in 18 months.</p>

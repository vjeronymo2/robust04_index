			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends mildly firmer Shares in Johannesburg registered mild gains, with trading seen to improve late in the day after a lethargic morning session. Brokers remarked that turnover had been slow before rising towards the close, although individual share price movements had been restricted by the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting. One of the features was a rise in the price of bullion, which lifted the golds index a modest 4 points to 2,168, a gain matched by the overall index, which closed at 5,865 after trading in a narrow 10-point range throughout the session. Industrials showed the best performance, advancing 14 to 6,808. Among the most heavily traded stocks yesterday, De Beers recovered from a softer start to finish unchanged at R99.75 and Anglos was 50 cents better at R243.50. Elsewhere, Gencor put on 5 cents at R15.20, Minorco relinquished 50 cents to R107.50 and Richemont softened 25 cents to R38.50. CG Smith, the industrial group, lost 50 cents at R18.25 in spite of the release of year-end figures showing earnings up by 13 per cent to 106 cents.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Investigative Police have captured seven members  of a terrorist Lautaro commando cell that is responsible for  some of the latest violent incidents, including a double bank  robbery in La Providencia Commune and the attack on the Nueva  Espana Carabineros building in La Cisterna Commune. This  information was confirmed to Radio Cooperativa this afternoon by  Investigative Police General Director Nelson Mery.    This cell is believed to be responsible for a series of  attacks. Many weapons were found in their possession.    [Begin recording] [Mery] They are responsible for the  attack....    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Is it true some  arrests  have been made?    [Mery] We have arrested eight individuals, all members of  the  Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front....    [Reporter, interrupting] Do we know any of them?    [Mery] Some are important within their criminal  organization.    [Reporter] How many of them participated in the latest  attacks?    [Mery] They have admitted participating in terrorist  activities during the past few months, particularly the  Carabineros premises.    [Reporter] How many participated in that attack?    [Mery] They were arrested yesterday. We raided their safe  houses and their alternative hideouts. The police seized M-16  riffles, submachine guns, explosives, documents describing the  group's participation in various acts, and materials used to  forge documents. [end recording]    The police seized five M-16 riffles, two UZI submachine  guns,  a large quantity of explosives, dynamite, and banners used by  the Investigative Police. Let us recall that some of these  individuals used Investigative Police documents and shot at  Carabineros premises.    The Investigative Police has thus dealt a new blow to this  extremist group. We have been asked to keep the names of the  terrorists secret, at least for this afternoon. We reiterate,  five men and two women were arrested; they are responsible for  the most recent terrorist attacks, particularly the double bank  robbery in Providencia and the attack on the Carabineros Nueva  Espana Building.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 7 March (MTI) -- A heated debate came  about during the Monday [7 March] session of Hungarian  Parliament:    Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ], the largest opposition party, asked to take the floor  prior to the agenda. Peto qualified Friday's dismissal of 129  radio program makers as a politically motivated "cleansing"  maneuver. "The action announced on Friday by the deputy chairman  of Hungarian Radio (who is vested with full powers of chairman)  surpasses in dimensions even the dismissals following the 1956  uprising," Peto said.    The SZDSZ chairman placed the responsibility on the  government, as the cabinet provided 105 million forints to  Hungarian Radio to cover severance pay for those dismissed.  Peto said the Radio deputy chairman took the unlawful step in  the knowledge that legal remedy will only be possible following  the elections.    The leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party's parliamentary  group, Zoltan Gal, said the government wants to transform the  electronic public service institutions into a mouth-piece for  the values of one single political order.    Tamas Deutsch of the Federation of Young Democrats pointed  to  the fact that his party had always opposed the appointment of  the deputy chairmen of Hungarian Radio and Television, and  consistently held out for Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar, the  chairmen of the organizations. "The current decision of Radio  Deputy Chairman Laszlo Csucs has annulled the hope of a clean  election campaign. The government is now striving to divert the  public's attention from other inglorious details of its final  certificate," Deutsch said.    Istvan Csurka of the extreme-right Hungarian Justice and  Life  Party said he did not write the scenario for the events that  have taken place in Hungarian Radio, but he did propose similar  measures back in 1990.    Zoltan Kiraly, an independent deputy who is now the chairman  of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, called on Laszlo  Csucs and Television Deputy Chairman Gabor Nahlik to return to  their original professions (Csucs formerly worked in the Finance  Ministry and Nahlik was an engineer).    The parliamentary group leader of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum, Ferenc Kulin, said the events do not favor the governing  coalition, which he claimed indicates that there was no hidden  governmental agenda behind the measure.    He blamed the opposition for the hopeless situation of the  entire media affair. In his view, the opposition has tried to  turn the wrangling surrounding the media bill to its own  advantage. He recalled that a consensus was nearly reached on  the media bill, as well as on the leaders of radio and  television holding regular consultations with opposition  representatives. This agreement in the making was, according to  Kulin, upset by the opposition's representatives because they  felt they would be better off if they shifted all responsibility  in media matters on the government.    Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross called the supposition  that the government and the prime minister played a role in the  selection of persons to be dismissed ungrounded and false. He  said the government has no political relations with Istvan  Csurka, in other words, it does not pass measures based on  Csurka's scenarios. In conclusion, Boross promised that the  government would take a stand in all issues which genuinely  endanger a clean election.    The chairmen of Hungarian Television and Hungarian Radio,  Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar -- both sociologists -- were  appointed with the approval of the parliamentary parties by the  president of the republic, on August 1, 1990, at the proposal of  the prime minister. Barely one year later, the representatives  of the governing coalition parties qualified both as unsuited to  fulfil their posts.    In March 1992, at the request of the prime minister, the  president of the republic appointed deputy chairmen to head both  institutions. In May 1992, the two chairmen were summoned for  hearings by Parliament's Cultural Committee, to re-examine their  suitability. The government-party majority in the committee,  citing unsuitability, proposed that the presidents be relieved.    The prime minister forwarded the committee's proposal to the  president of the republic, who refused to relieve the Radio and  Television chairmen from their posts. Five months later, the  government initiated disciplinary action against the chairman of  Hungarian Television. The disciplinary committee, led by the  minister of justice, duly suspended Television Chairman Elemer  Hankiss in December of 1992. Hankiss argues with the legality  of the proceedings and has since been trying to prove his case  through legal channels.    The president of the republic became the target of attacks  by  the ruling parties and by right-wing political forces not  represented in Parliament because he would not relieve the two  media chairmen.    In January 1993, the two media chairmen asked the president  of the republic to relieve them of their posts, but the  president has not fulfilled their requests to this day.    Under the terms of a government decree from 1974, the public  service media are under the supervision of the government, thus  the prime minister relieved the two media chairmen on the basis  of this decree and invested the two deputy chairmen with full  authority of chairmen.    At Hungarian Television, the deputy chairman exercising the  rights of chairman took the alternative news program off the  air, and has dismissed the news crew accused of being  sympathetic to the opposition.    Hungarian Radio has now dismissed 129 staff members who were  mainly known to have prepared programs of a critical tone.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN ELOQUENT DEFENSE FOR THE STUDY OF HISTORY  </P> <P> Historical Literacy: The Case for History in American Education, edited by Paul  Gagnon and the Bradley Commission on History in Schools (Macmillan: $22.50, 320  pages.)  </P> <P> A 1986 survey of 17-year-olds in America revealed that two-thirds did not know  that the Civil War took place in the last half of the 19th Century. Seventy  percent did not know that "Jim Crow" laws were intended to enforce racial  segregation. And 30% could not find Great Britain on a map of Europe. The sad  conclusion is that Americans are mostly ignorant about their own history.  </P> <P> Historical ignorance is the problem that caught the attention of the Bradley  Commission on History in American Schools, one of those worthy blue-ribbon  commissions that deliver themselves of voluminous but mostly unread tomes.  </P> <P> But "Historical Literacy," the official report of the Bradley Commission,  deserves a better fate. In 17 essays by about 25 American educators and  historians, "Historical Literacy" offers an eloquent argument in favor of the  study of history as a discipline that serves democracy and civilization.  </P> <P> As contributors Kenneth T. Jackson and Barbara B. Jackson point out, the  history curriculum in the American classroom was one of the early victims of  the educational turmoil of the '60s and '70s -- they bemoan the "  'Balkanization' of the history curriculum" and the resulting "do-your-own-thing  formlessness of social studies."  </P> <P> And, according to the late Hazel W. Hertzberg, the failures of public education  have been reinforced by American television, the "omnipresent educator" that is  specifically anti-historical: "Television is, I believe, destructive not only  of our sense of history but of the democratic process itself."  </P> <P> A centerpiece essay by Diane Ravitch, professor of history and education at  Columbia, calls our attention to the academic torpor that currently afflicts  the study of history in American schools, where the substance of history is  sacrificed for a kind of earnest but soft-headed game-playing.  </P> <P> For instance, she reports on one exercise in an American studies class where  the students broke up into groups of 10 to deliberate on the Dred Scott case  for themselves.  </P> <P> "Ten minutes later, no surprise, each little Supreme Court recommended that  Dred Scott should be a free man, and the class ended," Ravitch writes. "They  did not learn why Chief Justice Roger B. Taney decided otherwise, nor did they  learn the significance of the Dred Scott decision in the antislavery agitation,  nor its importance as a precursor to the Civil War."  </P> <P> According to the Bradley Commission, the task is to restore history to its  proper place in the education of American children. Each of the contributors to  "Historical Literacy" argues for the beauty, the utility and the transcendent  social and political importance of history.  </P> <P> For example, Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA, cites the  successes of a pilot program that introduces young schoolchildren to the  Odyssey and the Aeneid, and calls for "a curriculum that returns to classrooms  the pleasures of stories worth telling, of ideas worth pursuing, of adventures  that capture and hold children's attention and lead them into the historical  perspectives that help each find his or her place in the long sweep of human  history."  </P> <P> Why study history at all? At its heart, "Historical Literacy" is a magnificent  attempt to answer that question, in all its complexity.  </P> <P> And the most readable and memorable essays -- including, notably, a short  memoir by Stanford historian Gordon A. Craig on "History as a Humanistic  Disciple" -- transcend the workaday business of the Bradley Commission. They  are elegant testimonials to the uses of history as a source of inspiration and  enlightenment, democratic values and social progress.  </P> <P> But I came back to Diane Ravitch's essay, where I found the most stirring reply  to the rhetorical question. Indeed, her words are a credo for every student and  teacher of history and deserve to be chiseled in stone (or, more to the point,  painted on stucco) in every school and university in America:  </P> <P> "Properly taught, history teaches the pursuit of truth and understanding; it  establishes a context of human life in a particular time and place, relating  art, literature, philosophy, law, architecture, language, government, economics  and social life; it portrays the great achievements and terrible disasters of  the human race; it awakens youngsters to the universality of the human  experience as well as to the particularities that distinguish cultures and  societies from one another; it encourages the development of intelligence,  civility, and a sense of perspective," Ravitch reminds us.  </P> <P> "These are values and virtues that are gained through the study of history,  values and virtues essential to the free individual exercising freedom of mind.  Beyond these, history needs no further justification."  </P></p>

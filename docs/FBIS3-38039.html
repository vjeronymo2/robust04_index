			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>   [Text] Washington February 25 TASS -- American and Russian  officials these days are holding consultations via different  channels concerning the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich Ames and  his wife on charges of spying for Moscow. ITAR-TASS has learned  from reliable sources that U.S. State Department officials are  due to meet with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov  in Washington to discuss various diplomatic aspects of  American-Russian relations as scheduled before the arrest of the  Ames on Monday. The arrest will certainly add a new aspect to  consultations.    U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno said on Thursday it had  raised the question about the espionage case at a meeting with  representatives of the Russian law enforcement agencies on the  same day.    The local press confirmed on Thursday a report circulated by  ITAR-TASS earlier about the U.S. Administration's decision to  send CIA officials to Moscow for consultations on the Ames  affair. Judging by reports in the American mass media, the  delegation will also include FBI and State Department officials.    On the whole the passions are flaring around the espionage  speculations. At first, American journalists said two Soviet  citizens who were spying for the United States were exposed and  executed at the end of the 1980's on a tip from Ames, now they  say that the number of such people is at least ten. A CIA  official, who spoke to ITAR-TASS on condition of anonymity on  Wednesday, said he could neither confirm nor deny the fact of  the death of two American spies. On Thursday, CIA spokesman  David French refused to reply to any questions from ITAR-TASS.  He explained his refusal by saying that the Central  Intelligence Agency was maintaining contacts only with the  American press.    Another interesting news reached ITAR-TASS from the Justice  Ministry's official John Russell on Thursday. According to him,  the judge has decided to postpone hearings in the case of the  Ames couple from Friday to next Tuesday. French told ITAR-TASS  he did not know the exact reason for the postponement but  surmised that the hearings were adjourned on request of the  defence attorney.</p>

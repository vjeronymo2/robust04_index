			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION OF MAYOR BRADLEY  </P> <P> So Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley is not a crook. And I suppose the report by  City Atty. James K. Hahn (Part I, Sept. 14) is not a whitewash. Hahn's  "unprecedented investigation" of the mayor's finances (which Bradley claims he  insisted upon) lasted six months, ended with a day's conversation with the  mayor as the final witness in which Bradley told him he had done nothing wrong,  and concluded that "by George, no crimes had been committed."  </P> <P> If the $18,000 paid by Far East National Bank was not a bribe to get the $2  million in taxpayer funds, which were deposited under highly irregular  circumstances after Bradley called the city treasurer about it, then why did  Bradley give the money back? And why did personnel in the treasurer's office  falsify documents to conceal Bradley's role? Does anyone really believe Bradley  did not have control of those public servants!  </P> <P> Far East Bank must think this is a joke. Bank officials got what they paid the  $18,000 for and then they got their money back!  </P> <P> Talk about sleaze! Comparing Hahn's report with the mayor's claims of  vindication, one can only conclude that the mayor has forgotten what honor and  integrity mean. If he had any shred left of the integrity with which he claims  he has served the public for 47 years, he would leave office voluntarily,  immediately.  </P> <P> HENRY M. BISSELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> VON HAPSBURG GETS ROYAL BOOT  </P> <P> Princess Michaela von Hapsburg, a granddaughter of the last emperor of  Austria-Hungary, and her family have been evicted from their posh Manhattan  penthouse.  </P> <P> The eviction became public Thursday when a city marshal announced an auction of  the furnishings in the apartment.  </P> <P> The princess's lawyers are trying to save the family's possessions, which  reportedly include the seal of the Hapsburg dynasty.  </P> <P> Thursday was the anniversary of the 1914 assassination of Von Hapsburg's  grandfather's great-nephew, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, whose  deaths signaled the beginning of World War I.  </P> <P> A leaking roof started the dispute, according to a New York Daily News report  Saturday. Von Hapsburg and her husband, Duke Eric d'Antin, complained to the  landlord about the leak, which later was fixed, said Arthur Birnbaum, lawyer  for the landlord, Blair Tower Associates.  </P> <P> But Birnbaum said the family did not make a March deadline for paying $108,000  in back rent after the roof was fixed. They were given several more chances to  pay before the landlord took over the apartment by changing the locks, he said.  </P> <P> The royal couple and their three children moved from the 5,000-square-foot  penthouse with panoramic city views to a hotel.  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Volksbank takes 20% stake in Banque Odier Bungener SWISS Volksbank, Switzer-land's fourth largest commercial bank, has taken a 20 per cent stake in Banque Odier Bungener Courvoisier (BOBC), a Paris-based institution active in commercial, merchant and private banking, writes Ian Rodger in Bern. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Volksbank said BOBC had total assets of FFr6.5bn (Dollars 1.22m) and net earnings of FFr47m in 1990, representing a 15 per cent return on equity. BOBC has been controlled by the family of Mr Francois Propper, its chief executive, except for the period from 1982 to 1987, when it was nationalised. Mr Walter Ruegg, chief executive of Swiss Volksbank, said he expected an improvement in the bank's profits this year, despite the weakness of the Swiss economy. The bank reported a 38.3 per cent drop in net income last year to SFr68.4m (Dollars 49.2m) because of a huge increase in provisions to SFr393.8m.</p>

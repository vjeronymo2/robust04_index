Security Council adopted a resolution  denouncing the massacre in Hebron and providing for a set of  measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians in the  occupied territories.    "Russia, from the very beginning of the discussion of the  resolution in the Security Council, had been calling for its  soonest possible adoption, considering it as a crucial step for  normalising the situation in the Middle East and resuming  Arab-Israeli talks.    "The initiating steps taken by the Russian cosponsor --  personal address by President Boris Yeltsin to the leaders of  Israel and the PLO, a trip by the foreign minister to Israel and  Tunisia, a series of contacts by Russian special representatives  in the region and energetic efforts in the Security Council --  not only facilitated the adoption of an effective resolution,  but also laid the foundation for further progress in the Middle  East peace process.    "Russia, together and parallelly with the American  cosponsor,  intends to continue the active political line in the Middle  East, including in accordance with the provisions of the adopted  resolution and is ready to do its best to implement the U.N.  Security Council resolution on Hebron, as well as promote the  soonest possible agreement between Israel and Palestinians and  its fulfillment. This would provide opportunities in other  directions of the Arab-Israeli dialogue and near the time of  establishing a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle  East."</p>

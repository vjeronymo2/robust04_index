			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Ukraine-Russia tensions hinder oil deal REPRESENTATIVES from all of the former Soviet republics yesterday began a two-day meeting in the western Siberian oil city of Surgut, in an effort to revive Russia's collapsing oil industry through co-operation. However, the increasingly tough line being taken by Russia and Ukraine, the two most powerful republics, could make a lasting deal elusive. Further evidence of tension between the two emerged yesterday, with Ukraine rejecting the call by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, for Russia to be given a free hand by the international community, especially the United Nations, to 'guarantee peace and stability' throughout the former territory of the Soviet Union. Mr Mikola Mikhailchenko, chief political adviser to Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, said: 'Ukraine will never recognise that Ukrainian territory is a sphere of special Russian interest . . . we want relations of equality.' In addition, Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian premier, accused Russia of imposing an economic blockade on Ukraine. He saw no alternative but to shift trade between the neighbours to world prices. 'No matter how much we try to negotiate with Russia over prices, we have realised that we cannot escape world prices. But we, in turn, will insist on world prices,' the prime minister said. Ukraine has threatened to charge transit fees at international rates for exporting the Russian gas which goes through Ukraine's pipelines. This amounts to 93 per cent of Russia's total foreign sales. This was in response to Russia's threat to cut off all gas supplies over Ukraine's gas debt to Russia. Moscow told Ukraine earlier this year that it would charge world prices for gas from February 1. By contrast, republics such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, which have retained close political links with Russia, appear confident in restoring economic ties as well. However, political rebels such as Georgia said they were in the same position as Ukraine. 'We must speak of an economic blockade,' said Mr Tengiz Sigua, the Georgian premier. 'Russia is not supplying us with anything at all.' The comments of the leaders of the former Soviet states appear to indicate that Russia, in the grip of continuing economic crisis, is now determined overtly to reward its friends and punish those with which it has strained relations. Russia expects to produce between 340m-347m tonnes of oil this year, down from 395m tonnes in 1992. The Surgut meeting represents an effort to re-establish these links in the oil and gas sector by creating a 'mini-Opec' to co-ordinate investment and production. Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian fuel and energy minister, warned that unless the republics co-operated, oil production might be insufficient by 1995 to meet even Russia's own requirements. Mr Shafranik hoped the non-Russia republics would contribute up to Rbs700bn to the Siberian oil industry in exchange for a guaranteed supply of cheap fuel.</p>

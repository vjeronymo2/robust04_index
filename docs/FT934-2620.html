			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Leading Article: How to build Euro-networks Jacques Delors' plan for big investments in trans-European networks provoked controversy at the weekend summit. Britain and Germany, in particular, do not like the idea of so-called Union bonds to finance infrastructure when member states are trying to curb budget deficits. It is certainly possible to pick holes in Mr Delors' suggestions. The section of the Commission's white paper on this subject is poorly argued, repetitive and full of jargon. The bonds plan also suggests an effort by the Commission to outflank the European Investment Bank, which was asked by European leaders only a year ago to back infrastructure investment through increased lending. But it would be wrong to dismiss ideas to develop trans-European networks, which are vital to the success of the union. European businesses and individuals pay a large price for the fragmentation of transport, telecommunications and energy systems. No European can feel pleased at the delays in air travel caused by incompatible and inadequate air traffic control systems. Nor is it acceptable that it costs three times more to make a phone call across national boundaries than it does inside them. Equally, British ministers should be ashamed that trains will creep to London when the Channel tunnel opens next year because a high-speed link on the British side has not been built. Sharp perception Mr Delors' sharp perception of sickness in the European body is not, however, matched by his remedies. The white paper rightly states that the bulk of funding for information networks will come from private sources. It points out, too, that in the transport and energy field - where public sector involvement will necessarily be greater - private investor interest needs to be encouraged. Yet it fails to resist the temptation to place exaggerated emphasis on a central role for the Commission and Council of Ministers in channelling Euro-cash to worthy projects. Mr Delors also seems, at times, to think trans-European networks are inherently desirable, rather than proceeding from an analysis of identified needs. Too much faith in vague concepts such as 'mulimodal strategy' could, combined with centralised planning, land Europe with a herd of white elephants. The main reason for the fragmentation of Europe's networks is that the telecommunications, transport and energy industries are still mostly national public sector monopolies. Because they are national, they rarely look beyond their frontiers. Because they are public sector, they are strapped for cash when state bud gets are tight. Because they are monopolies, more efficient private enterprises are discouraged from providing the missing links. The priority is to open up the provision of infrastructure to competition. This would provide extra sources of finance, while ensuring that investment responds to commercial needs rather than political fancies. The Commission acknowledges this, but its plans are too timid. Cost-benefit analysis It would, however, be naive to think that liberalisation can solve all the problems, especially in transport. Many rail and road projects, which are justified on a wider cost-benefit basis, are insufficiently profitable to attract private sector support. Since national budgets are under strain, innovative ways of marrying public and private finance are needed. Possible methods include franchising services, electronic road tolls and earmarked taxes (or even bond issues) for specific projects. Trans-national coordination is sensible where the benefits of investment spill over from one country to another. It is, for example, hard to see how a single private enterprise could address Europe's air traffic problem. Modernisation of transport links between the European Union and the countries of central and eastern Europe will also require co-ordination. The white paper pays lip-service to the need to combat monopolisation and harness private finance, but it fails to state clearly that liberalisation and privatisation are being held up by powerful vested interests. Unless these can be overcome, with the aid of a vigorous campaign from the top, the plan for improved networks is unlikely to travel far from the drawing board.</p>

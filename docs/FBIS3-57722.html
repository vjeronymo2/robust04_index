It quotes Podkolzin's words that "not a single air-borne  division or brigade commander sent his officers to this or other  meetings".    Referring to an unidentified Russian intelligence officer,  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS wrote in the report published on Thursday  that the LDPR leader held the meeting at a secret country house  of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.    The report noted that the meeting was spearheaded "against  the president and that Zhirinovskiy called on army officers to  cooperate and pointed to the need for rapprochement between some  parliamentary groups and commanders of combat units".</p>

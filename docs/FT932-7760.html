			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: News Corp Dollars 3bn credit facility complete MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation announced yesterday that it had completed arrangements for a revolving credit facility amounting to Dollars 3bn. The facility is being provided by a 27-member banking group, and will permit borrowings in US dollars, Australian dollars and sterling. It has a final maturity date of June 1999 and, according to News Corporation, the facility will cut the company's bank borrowing rates by 75 basis points. The proceeds from the new facility will be used to repay News Corp's outstanding borrowings under a Dollars 2bn 'override' facility - set up in early 1991, with 146 lending banks - and a Dollars 901m stand-alone facility for HarperCollins The Dollars 3bn refinancing represents a further big step in the restructuring of News Corp's debt. In late 1990, it was facing severe financial problems with debts of more than Dollars 7.6bn. The company held lengthy negotiations with international banks and after months of talks, it was agreed that about Dollars 7.6bn of debt would be restructured over three years.</p>

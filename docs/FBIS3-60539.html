			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kirsten Sorrig: ``Revolution at National </F> Hospital'']    [Text] Health: The National Hospital will be divided into  nine centers. Of these, seven will function as minihospitals.  The doctors are worried that specialties will be split up. And  that everything is happening too quickly.    The National Hospital is standing before its greatest change  ever.    Today the hospital administration is calling all section  heads together to orient them on the thorough structural change  that will be carried out during 1994. The main elements of the  plan will be made public next week.    The National Hospital's 40 divisions will be put together in  nine centers. Of these, seven will function as minihospitals,  some with over 500 employees. The last two centers will, among  other things, contain laboratories, pathology, and X ray.    The new plan is based on an analysis done in close  cooperation with the consultant firm of McKinsey &amp; Co. The  National Hospital's director, Christian Nissen, counts on having  centers with new structures and new leadership established  during 1994. One of the nine centers is already under way. This  is the Heart Center, which was opened on a trial basis a year  ago, and which will run completely according to the new method  of operation by 1 January.    ``The patients will have a shorter waiting time, and the  hospitalization procedure will go more smoothly,'' Nissen said.  ``They will meet fewer doctors and nurses, and the atmosphere  will become that of a smaller hospital.''  <H5>  Divided Specialties </H5>   Among the doctors there is worry that the thorough change  will destroy the specialties. And that everything is being done  too quickly. In the Specialist Division, where the doctors'  further training is supervised, the developments are being  watched closely.    ``We are not negative about the new organizational forms,''  the division chairman, senior Dr. Hans Karle of Herlev Hospital  said. ``On the other hand we think that it would be wisest to  analyze things thoroughly before entering into big changes.    ``The process that has been set in motion is motivated by  desires for efficiency in administrative, operational, and  service tasks. It is for research, development, and training.  Here there are goals and intentions, but nothing concrete to  hang them on yet.''    In doctors' circles there is also doubt about how logical it  is to redo the whole National Hospital according to the new  model and whether in the end some segments will not benefit from  the changes.    ``It is not wrong to start with the Heart Center, ''Hans  Karle said.`` But I would have been hesitant to carry out the  change completely before getting a lot of experience and having  thoroughly analyzed whether one can both rationalize and at the  same time assure the quality of training and research.''</p>

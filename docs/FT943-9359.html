			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium pact success More evidence came yesterday that the unprecedented international trade agreement encouraging aluminium producers to cut output is having an increasing impact on the huge surplus that depressed prices for so long. The International Primary Aluminium Institute said producer stocks fell for the fourth consecutive month in June, by 12,000 tonnes to 1.993m tonnes. Since February, when delegates from six big aluminium producing areas signed a 'memorandum of understanding' about production cuts, producer stocks have fallen by 141,000 tonnes or 6.6 per cent. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, said London Metal Exchange stocks also fell in June - the first time in nearly four years that both stocks had fallen. He suggested: 'The memorandum of understanding clearly is working. But the industry still has a big task ahead.' Stocks were still equivalent to 16 weeks of consumption and they needed to be 6 1/2 weeks before producers could relax. So another 2.85m tonnes - or 40 per cent - had to be cut from combined IPAI and LME stocks of 4.8m tonnes.</p>

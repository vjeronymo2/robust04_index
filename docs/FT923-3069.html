			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Other countries follow Germany THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut its lending rates yesterday was swiftly followed by rate cuts in some other European countries. Reductions were mainly confined to countries whose currencies form the hard core of the European exchange rate mechanism, while others, wary that the German move was too small to allow much room for manoeuvre, chose to wait at least until after the French referendum on Maastricht before easing monetary conditions. The Bank of Belgium said it would cut its discount rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Its emergency lending rate - equivalent to Germany's Lombard rate - was cut to 11 per cent from 11.5 per cent. In the Netherlands, the central bank followed the German move by lowering its three key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. In Austria, whose Schilling is informally linked to the D-Mark although not part of the ERM, the central bank cut its lending rates to the same level as in Germany. The Swiss, whose currency is also informally associated with the D-Mark, cut the discount rate to 6.5 per cent. Mr Werner Abegg, of the Swiss National Bank, said the Swiss franc's recent stability had made the central bank's move possible. Denmark, which usually follows German rates closely, had not decided yesterday how to react. The central bank said it was waiting to see how the currency markets developed. The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.60 per cent. In Norway, analysts reckoned the central bank was unlikely to cut interest rates soon, partly because the German move was too small to influence Norway and partly because of economic turbulence in Scandinavia and doubts over the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht. Sweden, which last week raised its marginal rate to 75 per cent, yesterday cut it to 20 per cent.</p>

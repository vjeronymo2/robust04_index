			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Michelsen: "`Without the European Union, </F> the U.S. Is the Alternative'"]    [Text] What security policy can Sweden have if the Swedish  people votes no on the European Union [EU]? If they do, we must  rely on the United States. That is the only alternative, writes  Associate Professor Bengt Sundelius in a debate piece on our  future security policy.    Together with Iceland, Norway, and perhaps Finland, Sweden  could develop into a U.S. stronghold on the edge of what in  security policy terms is an increasingly independent Europe,  Sundelius believes. He himself believes that the safest thing  for Sweden is joining the EU. But what if that does not happen?  What do we do then?    This is an issue that has so far been advanced in the EU  debate. Bengt Sundelius, a political scientist living in  Stockholm, is the first one to construct a detailed argument  about this alternative. It is an exciting piece in the booklet  "Sveriges sakerhetspolitiska vagval" ["Sweden's Security Policy  Choice"] published by FOLK OCH FORSVAR.    Sweden has become smaller and weaker in relation to its  neighbors, Sundelius points out. Even during the 1960's, Sweden  was one of the major states in Europe. We had a big, strong  economy and a powerful defense force that acted as a stabilizer  in northern Europe. Since then we have turned from a North  European superpower into one small state among [many] others. It  is just as well for us to acknowledge that. Our economy looks  the way it acts. Nor, for that reason, is it likely that we will  be able to pay for a defense force that can deter the rest of  the world.  <H5>  Border State </H5>   If we end up outside the EU, we will become a border state,  EU supporters contend. No, quite the opposite, we will become a  happy island, say those who say no to the EU in the debate. But  both sides are conducting too superficial a debate, Sundelius  says. In fact, Swedish isolation in the future is completely  unrealistic. But who can we really cooperate with in our  security policy?    Perhaps with a newly democratic Russia? No, that is not  likely. The Russian mess is too great. And above all, we lack a  basic community of values with Russia's leader and people,  Sundelius says.    If we say no to cooperation with Europe, the only thing  remaining is to link up with our old connection across the North  Atlantic. And if Sweden says no to the EU, Finland will do the  same. We should be able to achieve something similar to the  Scandinavian defense union that Sweden tried to implement during  1948-49. And this union, which, in addition to Sweden, consists  of Finland, Norway, and Iceland, would serve as a link to NATO.    Sundelius believes it is conceivable that the United States  as well could see the benefits of such a North European security  arrangement. No least owing to fears of an ever more independent  EU.  <H5>  Few Alternatives </H5>   Many Swedes would prefer security policy cooperation with  the  United States, which has proven to be a tested ally in difficult  situations, Sundelius believes. On the other hand, he does not  believe that opponents of the EU within the Social Democratic  and Left Parties and the environmental movement will like a  linkage with the remaining superpower, the United States. But  what else is there if going into the year 2000 we are sitting  outside the EU and have a Russia that might pose a threat and is  revanchist as a neighbor?    Ranged against Sundelus in the brochure are all of our most  familiar security debaters. And the ingenuity [applied] was  great when it came to finding terms of abuse for the old Swedish  policy of neutrality. There is talk of a neutrality liturgy,  long-term hysteria, and hidebound neutralists. There are jokes  about Sweden as a once moral superpower.    A title that would have fit the contents might also have  been  "After Neutrality" had it not been for Par Granstedt (Center  Party) and Anders Ferm (Social Democratic Party), who both warn  against too rapid a revision of Swedish policy. Ferm's essay  accomplishes its purpose very well. In the haze, you decrease  your speed and navigate slowly and cautiously. The security  policy milieu is hazy and uncertain, and the government is not  navigating with sufficient caution, his thesis runs.  <H5>  An Obvious Asset </H5>   Generally speaking, all of the contributors believe that  Swedish EU membership is an obvious asset for Swedish security.  But several of them criticize the mumbling of politicians on  this point. Where security policy is concerned, there is a  democratic deficit. The biggest change in our policy in modern  times has been initiated without reports and debate, Wilhelm  Agrell, for example, believes. And together with him, many in  the brochure call for clear answers in such processes.    So the stage is set for continued debate -- unless the  politicians persevere in the "conspiracy of silence" of which  they have been accused.</p>

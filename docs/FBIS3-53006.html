He stressed that al-Kikhya's disappearance is a  riddle, noting that Libya will not sacrifice its relations with  Egypt for the sake of a Libyan opponent. He denied that his  country is involved in kidnapping al-Kikhya, stressing that  there are relations of friendship between the former Libyan  minister and the Libyan regime's leaders. He pointed out that  al-Kikhya did not constitute the least danger for Libya, making  it sacrifice its relations and interests with Egypt. He said  al-Kikyha is a man of high standing and the revolution honored  him and appointed him a minister. When he reached retirement  age, brother Colonel al-Qadhdhafi asked him to go to Algeria as  part of the visiting Libyan delegation when Ben Bella returned  to Algeria.    Al-Bishari pointed out that the culprit in the disappearance  of al-Kikhya has interests in continuing the embargo against  Libya, starving the Libyan people, maintaining the threat of the  Lockerbie case against Libya, and harming Libyan-Egyptian  relations.    Discussing the Lockerbie crisis, al-Bishari stressed that it  could have been settled peacefully in November 1991 had it  followed a legal course and had the Western nations cooperated  with the Libyan Judiciary. He said Libya was surprised when the  Western nations brought the case out of its framework and  imposed it on the UN Security Council and passed resolutions to  impose the embargo on the Libyan people. He pointed out that  his country suggested every possible proposal to solve the issue  peacefully without harming its sovereignty, independence, or  supreme interests. And Libya, he said, expressed readiness to  cooperate with every party and implement the UN Charter, which  calls for maintaining security and peace. We also offered to  compensate the families of the victims.    Al-Bishari did not rule out a peaceful solution to the  Lockerbie crisis, noting the mediation efforts by heads of state  and countries including President Mubarak. He stressed that  Libya seeks to establish good ties with Washington as a  superpower and has interests in Libya. He noted that Egypt and  Tunisia are trying hard to reach this goal. He said his country  seeks no confrontation with Washington but will not relinquish  its national interests or the Arab nation's right to exist and  have unity.    Al-Bishari stressed that the retreat of the main witness in  the Lockerbie case, which will greatly help his country, is  considered to be an important development in the case that might  influence public opinion and the attitude of the nonpermanent  members of the Security Council, which were pressured to vote  against Libya.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xin Hua (6580 5478): "Flourishing Financial </F> Markets -- A Sign of Initial Growth"]    [Text] China's financial market system has gradually taken  shape since 1984. In general, it started from handling check  discounts and later expanded its businesses to inter-bank loans  and buying and selling of foreign exchange. The securities  market emerged at a later date. Recently the satellite  telecommunications network for the financial circles has been  established. Right now, a total of 138 ground stations have been  built. Each day, transactions exceeding 1.1 billion yuan in  total have been handled by the network. A preliminary  operational system for the financial market is composed of "two  stock exchanges and one network" (The Shanghai Stock Exchange  and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the nationwide information  network for stock price quotations) and the money market, the  securities market and the foreign exchange regulation market.  <H8>  I. Money Market </H8>   On the basis of different business scopes and various forms  of financial assets, China's money market may be divided into  the market of inter-bank loans, the market of short-term  financing to various enterprises and the market of transferable  certificates of deposit of large denomination. Right now, the  market of inter-bank short-term loans is fairly active.    The main task of the market of inter-bank loans is to help  banking institutions obtain short-term loans from each other to  mainly make up the insufficient reserve funds for the deposits  and the differences in check clearing and to meet the needs for  fund circulation of a temporary nature. Since the reform of  credit control in 1984, markets of different forms and scales  have been set up in various localities throughout the country  for inter-bank loans, preliminarily forming an inter-regional  and inter-departmental financing network with the major cities  as its bases. Meanwhile 120 money markets have been set up in  Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xian and Wuhan to handle  national and regional inter-bank short-term loans. In recent  years, the amount of inter-bank short-term loans was about 300  billion yuan each year.    The market of short-term fund-raising bonds was officially  open to the public in March 1989 after experiments were carried  out in this connection at the end of 1987. Banks and other  financial institutions often sell such bonds on a commission  basis for the various bond-issuing enterprises. A few of them  have exclusive rights to sell certain bonds. At the end of 1992,  the total value of such bonds had reached 17 billion yuan.  According to the regulation, short-term fund-raising bonds  issued by various enterprises are transferable right after they  are floated. However, only a small amount of them are actually  being transferred.    The issuance of transferable fixed-term certificates of  deposits is limited to various specialized and multipurpose  banks. Prospective buyers of the certificates are usually  individuals and enterprises and institutions in urban and rural  areas. Such certificates should be purchased with people's own  money or the enterprises' or institutions' own funds. They are  transferable on the market as soon as they are issued.   <H5>    II. Securities Market </H5>   Since China issued its treasury bonds in 1981, the  securities market has rapidly grown with the continuous  development of the economic system and particularly at a time  when the enterprise system is changing from an unitary economic  system to a share-holding one and the financial system is  changing its practice of making up its deficits by taking out  overdraft or borrowing from the banks to one of directly raising  funds from the society.    The current situation shows: (1) There are many kinds of  securities on the market. Right now, there are more than ten  types of bonds including the treasury bonds, financial bonds,  bonds for the state major construction projects, state  construction bonds, special-purpose bonds, value-protected  bonds, enterprise bonds and stocks. (2) The market of securities  has begun to take shape. The total value of securities floated  by the state totalled 50 billion yuan in 1988, more than  doubling the value of securities issued in 1987. The total value  of securities floated by the state totalled 115 billion yuan in  1991, once again doubling the value of securities issued in  1988. The total value of bonds and stocks of various kinds in  China was close to 400 billion yuan Renminbi in 1992. In 1993,  the state planned to issue bonds and stocks at a value  equivalent to approximately half of the amount of annual savings  of all the rural and urban residents in the country. (3)  Securities are being issued in different forms. Some of the  financial institutions do sales promotion themselves to sell the  bonds they have issued, while some enterprises entrust other  financial institutions to sell their bonds. Other enterprises  adopted the method of free subscription while promoting the sale  of bonds with administrative measures. The practice of  apportioning people to buy state bonds has been abolished. (4)  The issuance of securities has been made a regular system. The  issuance of bonds and stocks has been carefully screened and  approved each year and a tranche policy adopted to control the  issuance of such bonds and stocks.    The situation of the stock trading market is as follows:  (1) Right now, there are more than 1,200 securities trading  departments in the country. There are markets for the transfer  of securities in over 100 cities and secondary markets for  selling and buying state treasury bonds in more than 60 cities.  (2) The amount of trading on the securities market is sharply  rising. The total amount of all types of securities on the  market in 1990 was valued at 13.7 billion yuan, that in 1991 at  15 billion yuan and that in 1992 at 200 billion yuan, of which  the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen play the most  important role. In addition, the Nanfang Securities Company in  Shenzhen works in concert with the Huaxia Securities Company in  Beijing and the Guotai Securities Company in Shanghai. They  stand like the three legs of a tripod, quickening the pace in  forming a unified nationwide market for the selling and buying  of securities.   <H5>    III. Foreign Exchange Regulation Market </H5>   Right now, the foreign exchange regulation market is  rapidly expanding. According to statistics, the volume of  business on China's foreign exchange regulation market in 1987  totalled US$4.7 billion. This figure rose US$6.25 billion in  1988 and US$13.1 billion in 1990. It reached as high as US$25.1  billion in 1992, about half of the total amount of foreign  exchange used to pay for China's imports in that year. This  indicates that China has paid attention to using the market  mechanism to regulate the supply and demand of foreign exchange.</p>

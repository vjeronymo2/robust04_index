			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / China's MFN status under renewed threat A consensus has begun to emerge in Congress and in the Clinton Administration that the president will be forced to revoke China's Most Favoured Nation trade status unless Beijing makes further attempts to improve human rights. With six weeks left before President Clinton must make that determination, House and Senate leaders this week were summoned to the White House to give advice. Senator George Mitchell, majority leader and a longtime advocate of the MFN/human rights linkage, said there had not yet been sufficient moves by Beijing. Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, has been trying to forge a consensus in favour of delinking trade and human rights, but even he said the president would be unable to avoid revoking China's MFN, if it refuses to take modest steps. These include: grants of medical parole for political prisoners with serious health problems; clearing up remaining cases of Chinese citizens denied the right of emigration; make progress towards a pact to give the International Red Cross access to Chinese prisons; enforce the bilateral agreement prohibiting exports of goods produced with forced labour; and end jamming of Voice of America. Fearing even these moves will not be met, some Democrats are searching for tools other than MFN to display their displeasure. One possibility, mentioned by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi of California, is a partial revocation, affecting goods from the state sector. Republicans, however, might insist the president lacks the statutory authority to lower some tariffs but not others. Even if Congress would agree, determining the source of many products come could become a bureaucratic nightmare. There is talk too of renewing MFN but at the same time targeting China for Super 301 action, when the president lists the nations with the most egregious trade barriers in October. Beijing still has shown no sign of co-operation. Ms Wu Yi, Chinese trade minister who has been travelling around the country making deals, has been delivering a tough message. 'China is not so frightened of revocation of MFN. China's sky will not collapse,' she said. In Los Angeles last week, US companies signed 11 contracts for Chinese projects worth Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 870m) and another 134 letters of intent worth billions more. Ms Wu said a MFN withdrawal would cost the US 300,000 jobs and the 'huge potential loss of the Chinese market.'</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Customs officers arrest 23 in raids on alleged 'squat' shops CUSTOMS and Excise officers have arrested 23 people alleged to have been running a ring of illegal shops in towns around the UK in a crackdown on evasion of value added tax thought to be worth Pounds 2m. Mr Brian McCaffrey and Mr Collin Miller, directors of a company called Prizebuys, were charged last night with fraudulent evasion of VAT. Eight other people were released on police bail and 13 were released after giving statements. The arrests follow raids under the code name Operation Volume by 100 officers on 20 addresses in 14 towns and cities in England and Scotland over the past two days. A man believed to have run the network from a warehouse in Battersea, south London, is among those arrested. The shops sold mainly clothing. 'Squat' shops have only recently come to the attention of customs investigators as a way of evading all forms of regulation. Operators break into vacant premises, set up stalls and refuse to move. Retailers that have premises occupied by squatters can often face lengthy battles to remove them because of the rate at which cases are dealt with by the civil courts. They can also face substantial additional costs in legal fees, lost business and repair work. Gap, the US clothing group, last year had difficulty removing squatters from a site it bought in High Street, Kensington. The squatters occupied the shop within an hour of the previous tenants' vacating it and refused to leave. Established retailers have long complained about 'squat' shops, arguing that they often sell sub-standard goods and offer no redress for dissatisfied shoppers. Mr James May, director of the Retail Consortium which represents many UK retailers, welcomed the crackdown. 'It is a widespread problem and one that has grown substantially over the last few years,' he said. The 'squat' shop raids this week follow several months of planning and detailed observations of the shops by about six Customs investigators based in London after tip-offs from legitimate retailers. The two men charged are expected to appear at South-Western Magistrates Court, Balham, London, today.</p>

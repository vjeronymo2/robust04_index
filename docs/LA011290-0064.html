			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> There's no one home inside the twisting overcoats that scud through many of Ed  Nunnery's phantasmagoric paintings. Fires burn, night closes in, ragged  buildings loom, empty streets suggest immanent menace and pending catastrophe.  </P> <P> Nunnery knits together borrowings from Bosch, film noir, sci-fi thrillers and  the zombie aspects of late 20th-Century life. Yet black humor -- or even a dash  of genuine hope -- percolates through the swirling chaos and gloomy  surroundings. In "It Could Be Worse," the passengers on a train all wear gas  masks and a broken shark's head is visible through the windows. But one man  reaches out for the hand of a fellow traveler, a sign of fellow-feeling even  among the damned.  </P> <P> "The Studio" surveys nocturnal spookiness on a huge, rambling scale. Small  irritations inside the studio (a smoking phone, a fallen coffeepot) rise to a  crescendo of weirdness in the city outside, with gloved fingers rising from the  water, a burning church, a cowering blue ghost, a skeleton on the loose. Even  when certain images seem rather cliche, the crazed intensity that animates his  dream visions keeps the work vital. But in "Paper Airplane," he finds a strong,  fresh image of civilization in decay: brilliant white paper airplanes landing  in the gloom near a barbed wire fence, a hulking tank and a mirage-like Greek  temple.  </P> <P> Nunnery, who carves his painting frames into frenetic zig-zags, also makes  goofily apocalyptic sculpture. A heraldic black "Bat" carved from cardboard has  a vast wingspread, forked tongue and devilish tail. A cardboard "Tank" has the  simple lines of a child's pull toy and the dark, pockmarked bulk of an  instrument of doom. (Ovsey Gallery, 126 N. La Brea Ave., to Feb. 3.) -- C.C.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Quick, witty and very New York - Malcolm Rutherford reviews 'Six Degrees of Separation' IT IS good that American theatre should make forays into mainstream London for it teaches us that the British still have some tricks to learn. Tony Kushner's Angels in America, which has been playing at the National Theatre for most of this year, is one example. John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation, which opened at the Royal Court this week, is another. The plays are serious, witty and, above all, fast, a technique that must have been learned from the best of American cinema. They rely heavily on texts, acting and good direction, and otherwise can be remarkably spare in their requirements. The set for Six Degrees consists of a simple background of colourful American abstract art. The only props are a few equally colourful chairs and the odd glass. Yet in this minimalist setting, there is a style, a flair and self-confidence that you would not normally associate with the Royal Court nor even with the National Theatre. The best of contemporary American theatre depends on talking fast, and talking well. Six Degrees is very New York. It assumes several degrees of knowledge in the audience. Within a few minutes we have been through the psychology of Catcher in the Rye and how the book may have contributed to the killing of John Lennon and the attempted killing of Ronald Reagan. Since this is New York, the subjects of race and money are never far away. South Africa comes in at the start because it combines the two. South African money can finance the purchase of a Cezanne by an upmarket New York art dealer, who can sell it on to Japan, although even to mention South Africa requires the right tone of voice. The nuances of political and social correctness can produce very good theatre. The dialogue in Six Degrees is superior to the plot, but even the latter is way above average and is based, for what it matters, on a true story. A young man called Paul claims to be the son of Sidney Poitier, the movie star. He inveigles his way into Fifth Avenue apartments and charms the occupants by offering them walk-on parts in his father's screen version of Cats. This is a hard choice, for they tend to regard the musical as the lowest of the low. Nevertheless, they are delighted to accept. Paul, played by Adrian Lester, is a homosexual who has been trained into con-manship by one of the cleverest of the Fifth Avenue children, now at MIT. The homosexual scenes are not nearly as explicit nor as central as in Angels in America and, against the trend, Paul does not have AIDS. This is, after all, a comedy. Yet the homosexuality is still handled better and more openly than I have seen in any British play. It is accepted as a fact of life, neither to sniggered at nor to be paraded as a cause. Six Degrees has its pretentions, not least in the title. For the rest, it is simply a witty play almost entirely devoid of the besetting fault of American theatre: sentimentality. Where it scores apart from in the writing is in sheer zest. When the kids come home from Harvard, they do it in explosive fashion, demonstrating all the intellectual arrogance of youth. There are some little gems of dialogue all along, like the question about the people on Fifth Avenue: 'Are they rich?' and the answer 'No, hand to mouth on a higher plateau.' Low jokes as well: the Harvard course on the holocaust and ethics has been retitled 'Krauts and doubts'. Conventionally one should single out Stockard Channing as Ouisa, the female lead, and she is magnificent, but plainly she knows that this is a team performance. The play is directed by Phyllida Lloyd, who is British. London should rise to it.</p>

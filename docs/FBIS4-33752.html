			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, D.C., 6 Jun (PL) -- Cuban-American  organizations, headed by the Cuban-American Peace Committee,  will meet with U.S. congressmen on 9 June to decry the U.S.  blockade against Cuba.    Committee President Raymundo Del Toro has said this meeting  will be the appropriate venue to support the Free Trade With  Cuba Bill, sponsored by Democrat Charles Rangel, a New York  representative.    Del Toro has said the time has arrived for the Clinton  administration to change U.S. policies toward Cuba now that the  United States has renewed the most-favored-nation status to the  PRC and lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam.    According to the committee president, President Clinton is  associating with the reactionary minority of the Cuban exiles,  making, he believes, the economic blockade against Cuba a  lucrative business.    Del Toro has said the U.S. head of state lost the 1992  elections in Florida and will lose again in 1996 if he insists  on associating with this minority group of the Cuban exile  community.    Delegates of the Cuban-American Committee in Miami, New  Jersey, Ohio, North Carolina, Chicago, and Philadelphia will  attend this meeting.    These demonstrators will be joined by such groups as the  Cuban Change, the Cuban-American Education Committee, the  Antonio Maceo Brigade, and the Cuban-American Organization for  the Dignity of Miami.    The president of the Cuban-American Peace Committee said  that  religious and public health organizations, such as the American  Public Health Association, the Free Trade With Cuba Association,  the General Council of Churches in Society, the United Methodist  Church, the Global Exchange, and the Pastors for Peace, among  others, will be represented at the demonstrations to support the  lifting of the blockade.</p>

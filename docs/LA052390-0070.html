			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DROPS CURBS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS AMMUNITION;  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL: HE HAD SOUGHT A 15-ROUND LIMIT ON CLIPS. NOW WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS  SAY THEY WILL SUPPORT STIFF PENALTIES FOR CRIMES RELATED TO FIREARMS.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration on Tuesday quietly backed away from its earlier  proposal to curtail the ammunition capacity of semiautomatic assault weapons,  as the Senate cast a preliminary vote against banning the military-style guns.  </P> <P> Under mounting pressure for federal action to take the weapons out of the hands  of drug dealers and other criminals, the White House reluctantly announced a  year ago that it would back a 15-round limit on the ammunition clips sold with  the guns.  </P> <P> But White House officials are acknowledging that the Administration has shifted  its approach, and is now supporting an alternative by Sen. Strom Thurmond  (R-S.C.) that would toughen penalties for gun-related crimes rather than slap  new controls on firearms.  </P> <P> The limit on clips "didn't meet with a lot of enthusiasm. It wasn't pushed  intensely," said one White House official.  </P> <P> News of the shift came as the Senate rejected, 82 to 17, a proposal by Sen.  Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) to ban 27 semiautomatic pistols and rifles that  he claimed had become the "weapons of choice" of drug dealers and other  criminals. The measure also would have imposed a 15-bullet limit on ammunition  magazines.  </P> <P> Both California senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson,  supported the Metzenbaum measure. Last year, the state of California and 27  cities and counties across the country enacted bans on the weapons. Last week,  the New Jersey Legislature approved the nation's toughest ban, including a  provision that would require most people who legally bought the weapons to give  them up.  </P> <P> The Metzenbaum measure was offered as an amendment to an omnibus crime bill  heavily charged with election-year politics. The legislation would make  extensive changes in the federal death penalty and rules of evidence and  appeals process. It would also vastly expand aid to law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> The Senate was expected to vote today on a narrower proposal by Sen. Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz.) to ban 14 semiautomatic firearms, which are designed to  resemble fully automatic assault weapons used by the military.  </P> <P> Both the Metzenbaum and DeConcini proposals were aimed primarily at U.S.-made  guns not covered by an import ban imposed last July by Bush on 43 foreign-made  assault weapons. The President has opposed extending the ban to domestically  manufactured assault weapons, which account for about 75% of such guns in  circulation.  </P> <P> Metzenbaum noted widespread support for an expanded assault weapons ban in  public opinion polls and by many law enforcement leaders, including Los Angeles  Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. But he said that numerous Senate colleagues had  told him they feared voter resentment that could be stirred up by the National  Rifle Assn.'s harsh rhetoric and organizing efforts.  </P> <P> "Don't be afraid of the NRA," Metzenbaum pleaded during contentious debate,  noting that he had survived an attack at the polls in 1988. "The NRA is a paper  tiger. Its bark is louder than its bite."  </P> <P> And Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said, "Vote for the NRA or vote for your  local police," who, he said, are "outgunned by these types of weapons."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) protested that such a ban would  not harm criminals, who could get the guns anyway, but law-abiding hunters and  target shooters who "wouldn't hurt a flea."  </P> <P> What is needed to curb crime, Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) said, is not more  gun control but an enforceable death penalty for 30 federal crimes ranging from  assassination of the President to murder of egg product inspectors.  </P> <P> "Let's try 'em and fry 'em -- that'll get things going," Simpson said with  characteristic irreverence.  </P> <P> Bush's original suggestion to limit ammunition clips was part of an anti-crime  package he proposed last May. At that point, pressure had been building to  restrict assault weapons since the previous January, following a schoolyard  massacre in Stockton, Calif. Rapidly firing a Chinese-made AK-47 with a huge  ammunition clip, a drifter named Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded  30 others.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Bush's comments on crime have focused on calls for greater use  of the death penalty, particularly in cases involving drugs and the murders of  law enforcement officers. He has criticized the Democrats' crime package as a  "weak imitation" of the Republican alternative, complaining that it would  effectively nullify the death penalty and limit the use of evidence seized by  police.  </P></p>

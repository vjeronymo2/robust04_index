			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (12): Beware the artful dodgers - Michael Holman's guide to Nigerian confidence tricks LOOK OUT for Nigerian conmen: they are of 'world class quality,' warns a western diplomat in Lagos, alarmed by scams which have raked in millions of pounds from victims in Europe, north America and elsewhere. He might have added:'. . . and they've found some world-class suckers.' Anyone taken in by the offer of a 25 per cent cut if they would allow Dollars 10m or more to be transferred from Nigeria via their bank account - a common scam - would seem to be as gullible as they are greedy. Yet one man lost nearly Dollars 500,000 this way, convinced by his Nigerian partner that just one more bribe would release the funds. The government is trying to crack down on what, in Nigeria, is known as '419', the section in the criminal code which deals with obtaining money by deception. At the same time, Nigeria's trading partners, and the four inspection agencies which monitor on behalf of the government the price and quality of imports, are stressing the importance of following the procedure for exports to Nigeria to the letter. Be on the look-out for the following confidence tricks: THE VISA SCAM Most business inquiries from Nigeria are bona fide. Some are bogus - an attempt to get a visa under false pretences, by persuading the overseas company to send a letter of invitation to support the visa application. Advice: the commercial sections of the main embassies in Lagos will help check the local firm's credentials. AIRPORT SCAM The conman copies the name of a passenger from the board held up in the arrivals hall by the company driver meeting the flight. A fake driver, board aloft, greets the passenger inside the customs hall, and offers help with customs and immigration formalities. The visitor surrenders passport and traveller's cheques, and the driver disappears. COMMERCIAL SAMPLES After establishing credibility through a succession of inquiries, the conman asks for samples, either free or paid-for, when the main consignment arrives. Advice: ship samples only after receipt of payment; and point out that the price and quality of orders are checked by the independent inspection agencies. EXPORT-IMPORT SCAM An exporter is persuaded to send goods to Nigeria before payment. Alternatively, an importer agrees to pre-shipment payment, but asks the exporter to pay a special 'import tax' imposed by government. There are no such taxes. Advice: ship only under irrevocable letters of credit, confirmed by a bank known to the exporter. FINANCIAL DOCUMENT SCAM A firm or individual receives a letter seeking help in transferring funds from Nigeria, in return for 20 per cent or more of the amount involved. The letter explains that the funds, Dollars 10m or more, are in a special account designated by an earlier regime. The account has been overlooked in the confusion surrounding the coup that brought the present government to power. The letter sometimes suggests that some of the 'discovered' money will be spent on the firm's products. It usually asks for blank headed letter paper, and the company's address stamp on blank pro forma invoices from the Nigerian company, all signed; and the company's bank account. Advice: tear it up. THE STING There are two variants. One is based on a supposedly legitimate business deal; the other proposes defrauding the Nigerian government. It may involve an oil lease, or a share in oil shipment, often backed by convincing documentation. The victim is persuaded to pay phoney fees or taxes before the deal can be completed. In both cases, the con may establish his credibility by flying to Europe or the US to meet the victim or 'mark', or paying for a ticket to Lagos. Once the victim is in Lagos, the trap starts to close, but the same becomes more plausible. The con arranges VIP treatment at the airport, puts him up at a hotel, and arranges meetings with fake or real officials, sometimes in the ministry supposedly involved. 'Now the con closes the trap,' explains a western embassy official who spends much of his time dealing with fraud. 'A problem will arise with the inside man who wants an upfront bribe for his risk, or an unforeseen government fee or tax is needed, or something else happens that requires the payment of a large amount of money or the deal will fall through.' The con usually claims that he can pay most, but not all, of the money needed. 'The mark sees this deal of a lifetime slipping through his fingers and pays up . . . the sting has succeeded.' Until recently, the conmen relied on their guile. This is changing, warn embassy officials, and there are an increasing number of cases involving physical intimidation.</p>

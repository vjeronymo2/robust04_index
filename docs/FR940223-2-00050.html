Pursuant to this consent agreement, the Commission issued an order on [Date] that prohibits ASI, including its chapters, committees, or organizational subdivisions, from: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Creating, distributing, authorizing, or endorsing any list or schedule of fees or other charges for interpretation, translation, or other language services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Entering into, or maintaining any agreement, plan, or program, to construct, fix, stabilize, raise, maintain, or otherwise interfere with the fees or other charges for interpretation, translation, or other language services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Suggesting, recommending, or encouraging, in any way, interpreters, translators, or other language specialists that charge, adhere to, or refrain from charging any existing or proposed fee; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For a period of ten (10) years after the date this order becomes final, continuing a meeting after (a) Any person makes a statement to the body of the meeting, concerning the fees charged or proposed to be charged for interpretation, translation, or any other language service and ASI fails to declare such statement to be out of order, (b) any person makes two such statements and ASI fails to eject him or her from the meeting, or (c) two people make such statements; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Prohibiting, restricting, regulating, or advising against any form of price competition among its members or other interpreters, translators, or other language specialists, including undercutting a competitor's actual fee or a customer's announced fee, advertising discounted rates or accepting any particular lodging or travel arrangements; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Discouraging, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from accepting hourly fees, weekly fees, or fees calculated on other than a full-day basis; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Discouraging, restricting, or prohibiting interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from performing services free of charge or from paying their own travel, lodging, meals, or other expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the order prohibits ASI from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Limit, restrict, or mandate the length of time that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists hired for a job or type of job. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the order, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation for interpretation, translation or other language services, including but not limited to, lodging, meals, subsistence and travel allowances, reimbursements for expenses, cancellation fees, and compensation for time not worked, travel time or briefing time. ``Language specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined to refer to any services that involve the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any services incident to or related to interpretation and translation. Consequently, when the order mentions ``language specialists,'' it includes anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or pr&eacute;cis writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, under the order, ASI must amend its Code of Professional Standards, Professional Guidelines, and Yearbook Professional Guidelines to conform to the requirements of Paragraphs II and IV of the attached order, which are summarized above. ASI must also amend its bylaws to require each member, chapter, and organizational subdivision to observe the requirements of the order. In addition, the order requires ASI to provide to its members and affiliates and to the Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to the ASI Bylaws, the ASI Code of Professional Standards, and all ASI Professional Guidelines, including those found in the ASI Membership Lists, and the texts of any new rules, regulations or guidelines. The order also requires that, within thirty days after obtaining them, ASI must provide to the Federal Trade Commission copies of all lists of fees that have been produced by any associations and come into ASI's possession. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note, however, that ASI will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information concerning past fees that were actually charged no earlier than three years after this order becomes final, if presented in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions underlying such reports. Similarly, the order does not prohibit ASI from collecting and publishing accurate publicly available information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies if such publication states the qualifications and requirements for such fees. With any publication of fees permitted by the order, ASI must include a statement that it is prohibited from recommending fees and that interpreters must independently determine their own fees. In addition, the order states that it does not prohibit ASI from providing information or its nonbinding and non-coercive views concerning the hours of work or preparation or the number of language specialists used for a type of job. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For more specific information, members should refer to the FTC order itself, which is enclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Counsel, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> American Society of Interpreters. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

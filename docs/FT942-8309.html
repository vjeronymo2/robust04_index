			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (10): Entrepreneurs move in - Venture capital investment in the region Considering the gaping holes in the region's investment framework, not to mention its political instability, the Euromerchant Balkan Fund, a venture capital fund to be based in Bulgaria, has attracted strong backing. The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have agreed to cover 50 per cent of the fund's Dollars 25m capital. The rest comes from Euromerchant Bank, a private Greek bank belonging to the Latsis shipping organisation, the fund's sponsor, and from a group of international and Greek investors. Several are Greek businessmen already investing in the Balkans. 'We think we can become the most successful venture capitalists in the area because many of our shareholders are active entrepreneurs. This will help overcome the problem faced by others - generating high quality deal flow,' says Mr Angelos Plakopittas, managing director of Global Finance, the Athens-based venture capital company which will manage the fund. Mr Plakopittas sees the relative absence of German and US investment in the Balkans, in comparison with the rest of eastern Europe, as an opportunity. The fund, he says, will enable local companies to grow to the point where they can be acquired by foreign investors entering the market, providing an exit for his investors. The minimum investment for participants in the fund is Dollars 1m, to be invested over three to five years. Scheduled to start operating later this year, the fund will give priority to acquiring minority stakes in ventures by European companies setting up in Bulgaria. Later, as privatisation there gathers pace, the fund will help finance acquisitions of state-owned companies. 'We expect to back companies in food production, retailing and construction at first. But there's potential both in companies that export to the former Soviet Union, and ones that provide added value at lower cost, such as textiles and software.' Global Finance pioneered venture capital and private equity investment in Greece. It already manages two funds with equity totalling about Dr3bn (Dollars 12m). Baring Venture Partners, the British bank's venture capital arm, participates in one fund and acts as management adviser to the company. Three years after Global opened its doors, two of the six Greek companies in its portfolio are poised to join the Athens Stock Exchange and another is expected to go public later this year. The company considered over 200 investment proposals in selecting its portfolio. It currently has Dr1.2bn committed in funds, taking equity stakes of between 5 and 30 per cent in fast-growing companies offering products and services new to Greece. Iatron, in which Global has a 30 per cent stake, offers wholesale diagnostic services through a network of affiliations with diagnostic centres. It manages check-up services offered by leading insurance companies and plans to enter the retail diagnostic market. Epifaneia, of which Global has 20 per cent, is involved with specialised publishing and printed corporate communications. It expects to increase turnover by 50 per cent to Dr900m this year, while profits should double to Dr175m. It is preparing to join the small board on the Athens bourse. Mr Plakopittas says that Global is now well placed to move into the Balkans. Three companies already in its portfolio, a restaurant chain, a snack manufacturer and an optical goods chain, are planning to move into Bulgaria, 'and we've identified other opportunities in furniture production, advertising and pharmaceuticals distribution'. 'We need to be based in the region we're operating in, so we're setting up in Sofia. Providing professional hands-on management will be crucial.' Bulgaria has attracted only a small amount of investment compared with other eastern European countries, with a large percentage coming from Greece. Greek companies are estimated to have invested Dollars 46m there in the past three years. Obstacles such as the lack of a bankruptcy law in Bulgaria, a primitive banking system, high inflation and foreign exchange risk and opaque accounting methods are among the challenges awaiting the fund's management team. From Sofia, the fund hopes to expand into Romania, Albania and the former Yugoslav republics as Bulgarian-based companies in its portfolio enter other Balkan markets. However, no more than 30 per cent of its capital can be placed outside Bulgaria, a reflection of the relatively higher financial and political risk elsewhere. 'If economic growth in the region picks up during the fund's 10-year life span, the exit for investors may come through flotations on the local capital market,' Mr Plakopittas says.</p>

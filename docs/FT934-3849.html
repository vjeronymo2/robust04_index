			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Whitecroft in black with Pounds 1.8m Whitecroft, the Cheshire-based textiles, lighting, building products and medical cotton fibre group, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.82m in the six months to September 30, a sharp turnround from interim losses of Pounds 29.3m last time, which increased to Pounds 41.8m for the full year. The directors are, nevertheless, not declaring an interim dividend, preferring to wait for the year-end to ensure improvement is sustained. The shares closed at 77p, up 5p. The turnround was largely the result of nearly Pounds 40m of property write-downs and other provisions distorting the 1992-93 figures, compared with only Pounds 600,000 this time for closure of a lossmaking subsidiary. However, operating profits trebled to Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 870,000) and were nearly double the full year's Pounds 1.36m. This was in spite of a 5 per cent drop in turnover to Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 64m) for the half-year. Earnings per share of 3.6p compared with losses of 68.2p last time and 94.5p for the year. Net tangible assets per share were 52.4p, a drop from 81.9p a year ago, but an improvement on the last full year's 48.6p. Whitecroft is now run by Mr Mike Derbyshire, chief executive, formerly of Norcros, and Mr Martyn Ellis, who joined as finance director from Inchcape this year. The non-executive chairman is Mr David Kendall, chairman of Bunzl. He succeeded Mr Peter Goold, who resigned as executive chairman last March. Whitecroft appears now to have scraped through the recession by disengaging from property, housebuilding and building materials. Core products include lighting systems, book-cloth for passports, fire doors and cotton wool. A third of output is exported, with demand growing in eastern Europe for street lighting, passports, tampons and better safety equipment. Mr Derbyshire said yesterday: 'All our property is beginning to move and can be viewed as pile of cash waiting to be released.' Gearing at the end of October was 119 per cent, with borrowings down to Pounds 26m against Pounds 43m in January.</p>

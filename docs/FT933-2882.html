			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Inishtech hit by exchange translation Inishtech, the Irish hygiene products and printing and packaging group controlled by James Crean, announced pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 virtually unchanged at IPounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.37m) compared with IPounds 3.55m, on sales up from IPounds 24.24m to IPounds 27.03m. The directors said the result was adversely affected to the extent of IPounds 325,000 by the translation effect of a weak sterling/punt exchange rate. Expressed in sterling, profits were up 10 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share were 17.9p (18.3p). There is a maiden interim of 2.5p. Last year a single dividend of 6.05p was paid.</p>

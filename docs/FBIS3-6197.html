			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong: </F> "The U.S. Congressional Report on `Reassessment of Military  Cooperation'"]    [Text] The report entitled "North Korea's Nuclear  Development Plan," which was made public by the U.S.  Congressional Investigation Bureau last month, pointed out that  the Kim Yong-sam Government is approaching the North Korean  nuclear issue based on a short-term standpoint as to what  influence the nuclear issue will exert on North-South relations.  The congressional report also observed that the ROK is concerned  with the possibility of being estranged from active diplomacy  and of suffering a blow therefrom. Thus, the ROK is opposed to  comprehensive negotiations between the United States and North  Korea unless the North Korean side responds to North-South  dialogue.    The U.S. Congressional report also noted that differences  have been revealed in the method of dealing with the North  Korean nuclear issue between the United States and the ROK, and  such differences worked as a stumbling block in the United  States' formulation of its policy toward the North Korean  nuclear issue. The report said that unlike the assurance of the  governments of the ROK and the United States on the satisfactory  cooperative system maintained between the two countries, they  failed to attain practical cooperation. The ROK asked the United  States to "resolutely but tenderly deal with" North Korea so  that it does not get angry, thus making an inconsistent and  contradictory demand. As a result, the United States suffered a  blow in understanding the true intention of the ROK side. THE  NEW YORK TIMES wrote that the ROK is attempting to cautiously  approach the North Korean nuclear issue on the precondition that  a war against North Korea must be avoided while the United  States regards it necessary to approach the North Korean nuclear  issue firmly and in a decisive manner based on firm unity  between the ROK and the United States. The WALL STREET JOURNAL  on 7 March also pointed out that because of the inconsistent,  double-dealing, hardline and moderate nature of countermeasures  by the ROK government and of anti-U.S. sentiment, confusion has  been caused to the U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear  issue. It was learned on 11 March that the attitude of the ROK  Government, which is running about in confusion, was seriously  discussed during a closed-door session of the hearing in the  U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on 2 March. Gordon  Sullivan, U.S. Army chief of staff; Barry R. McCaffrey,  commander of the U.S. Southern Command; Charles Larson,  commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet; Gary Luck, commander of  U.S. Forces Korea; and the vice chief of naval operations,  attended the hearing. After a public session, the senators held  a closed-door meeting and raised the issue on the new assessment  of relations between the two countries from the standpoint of  ROK-U.S. military cooperation.    General Luck stated in the hearing that the United States  is fully ready to deploy Patriot missiles for the U.S. Forces in  the ROK at any time but that the decision for the deployment was  still pending because the ROK Government was worried that the  deployment of Patriot missiles might provoke North Korea.    U.S. Senator Richard Lugar who was in the ROK with Senator  Sam Nunn in mid-January said on his return from the trip that  the ROK people's view of North Korea has changed capaciously  compared with that in the past. He added, "We noted that the  ROK might have altered its military objective in such a way as  to take into consideration a broader political situation than  the problem of North Korea." He called attention to the fact  that the United States has made cautious efforts to reestablish  its cooperative security relations with the ROK.    The United States, particularly the U.S. Congress, has had  doubt about the feasibility of the appeasement policy toward  North Korea. Some said that North Korea may already have a  nuclear bomb, and the plan for the deployment of Patriot  missiles and offensive Apache helicopters in the ROK was  materialized. A U.S. national intelligence assistance team was  recently deployed to the ROK, and a plan was announced that an  aircraft carrier would be deployed on the sea near the ROK.  These moves show the U.S. mood that it cannot accede  indefinitely to the ROK insistence that the ROK and the United  States endeavor for peaceful settlement through dialogue to the  end rather than resorting to a hasty stick.    Some Washington military critics criticized the ROK  position,  saying that the United States has had its self-respect hurt much  in its tug-of-war with North Korea over the nuclear issue and  that the ineffective policies put forth by the ROK policymakers  elated North Korea so much that they led the North Korean  nuclear issue to the war of pride between the United States and  North Korea. Some U.S. circles came to think that while the  United States and North Korea were dealing with the critical  issue with the tough stance of not hesitating to use sanctions  and taking military countermeasures, the ROK took an indecisive  attitude without concrete logic between the United States and  North Korea. This may be one of the reasons why in some circles  in the United States, such as the U.S. Congress, ROK-U.S.  military cooperation became an issue for discussion.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A blue-ribbon panel recommended it. President Bush and former President Ronald  Reagan gave it their blessing. But the vast majority of Americans feel members  of Congress do not deserve a $45,500 pay raise, according to the Gallup Poll.  Boosting congressional salaries from $89,500 to $135,000 a year, as proposed by  a nonpartisan commission, is favored by 15% of the public and opposed by 82%,  even when tied to a ban on speaking fees, or honorariums. Only 20% knew what  congressmen are paid, while 12% believed legislators earn more than what they  actually do and another 12% believed the lawmakers earned less. More than half  (56%) were unable to specify any figure at all. The raise affects U.S. senators  and representatives, as well as other top federal officials, judges and Cabinet  members.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Carter Arrives in Pyongyang, Korean Situation Shows Sign of  Improvement"]    [Text]De Facto "Presidential Envoy"    Just as the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the Security  Council was deliberating on economic sanctions, Jimmy Carter,  former U.S. Democratic president, arrived in Pyongyang yesterday  through Panmunjom. He will stay in Pyongyang for three days and  will meet and hold talks with President Kim Il-song. Although  foreign media described the situation on the Korean Peninsula as  "very tense" following the DPRK withdrawal from IAEA, in fact  there is still much room for relaxation in the situation.  Carter's visit to the DPRK is probably a turning point.    Although former President Carter has gone to the DPRK in an  unofficial capacity, he is actually a "special envoy" of  President Clinton and the importance of this visit is  self-evident. The DPRK also attaches great importance to  Carter's visit has given him a red carpet reception. All this  shows that the current U.S.-DPRK talks on the nuclear issue are  an important struggle.    When withdrawing from the IAEA, Pyongyang issued a toughly  worded statement warning the Security Council that the adoption  of economic sanctions would be tantamount to a "declaration of  war" against Pyongyang and would meet strong resistance.    The U.S. reaction is that, if the DPRK officially withdraws  from the international nuclear body, it shows that the situation  is serious and that it is necessary to step up sanctions.  Japan, Canada, and other countries have also indicated their  support for sanctions. We should now see how the Security  Council will deal with this issue. The Security Council is  expected to meet on 15 June. Generally speaking, a draft  resolution should first be discussed among the five permanent  members (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China)  and the United States should explain to the 10 nonpermanent  members the contents of the draft sanctions resolution.  However, before the result of the Carter-Kim Il-song talks is  known, all posturing by the United States and the DPRK can only  be regarded as "preparing the ground."  <H5>  Recriminations By the United States and DPRK Are Only Aimed </H5> At "Preparing the Ground"    The DPRK has indicated its readiness to go to war and  sounded  very serious. However, the situation will change if senior U.S.  and DPRK officials resume talks. When meeting with Harrison,  senior researcher at the U.S. Institute for International Peace,  Kim Il-song said: If the United States provides DPRK with a  light water reactor [qing shui lu 6536 3055 3619] or decides to  grant the relevant credits, the latter is ready to suspend the  construction of a 50 mw graphite moderated atomic reactor.    Kang Sok-chu, DPRK's first deputy foreign minister and chief  representative at the senior U.S.-DPRK official talks, told  Harrison that the light water reactor would be imported from  Russia rather than the United States and that the money could be  paid from U.S. loans to Russia. Provided that the supply of a  light water reactor is resolved, DPRK is ready to freeze its  current nuclear program.    Harrison considered this plan as feasible. He said the  United States will welcome the DPRK proposal on freezing the  construction of an atomic reactor and its processing facilities.  He hoped that the two countries will open talks in this respect.  <H5>  The DPRK Is Incapable of Producing Nuclear Bombs </H5>   In fact, the DPRK wants to normalize relations with the  United States and has proposed the resumption of talks by senior  government officials. Secondly, it hopes the United States will  provide it with the money to buy a light water reactor for which  it is ready to freeze its current nuclear program.    Seen against this background, how can we say that the DPRK  wants to make atom bombs to threaten other countries? It wants  to raise funds from the United States and Japan even when buying  a light water reactor. Does not this precisely show that the  DPRK has no plan and is incapable of developing nuclear armament?    It is believed that Carter will be able to obtain a new and  direct message in Pyongyang and understand the DPRK's  intentions. First of all, the United States should not press  forward steadily and threaten to impose sanctions against the  other side at every turn. Although the DPRK claims to withdraw  from the IAEA, it has not withdrawn from the International  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. If the United States applies  steady pressure, it will force the DPRK to withdraw from the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty as well. Conversely, if the  talks run smoothly, Pyongyang may cancel its withdrawal from  IAEA.    It is impossible to compel a country to submit by applying  strong pressure. The actual situation in the Korean issue is  not as serious as reported outside; the crucial issues are U.S.  policy and Clinton's attitude.</p>

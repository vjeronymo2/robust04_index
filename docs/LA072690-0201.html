			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS INVITED TO TOWN HALL MEETING  </P> <P> Residents will have the chance to tell the City Council just what they think  about traffic, schools, development and any other topic at a Town Hall meeting  tonight.  </P> <P> The meeting starts at 7 and will be in the council chambers at the civic center  on Birch Street.  </P> <P> The redevelopment project is one topic likely to be discussed. From street  widenings to new hotels and office buildings to rezoning of neighborhoods, the  ambitious project has had a widespread effect on the city.  </P> <P> "City staff and politicians get caught up in pet projects that they are  concerned about," said Mike Maxfield, spokesman for the city. "Citizens will  point out different concerns you don't realize they have."  </P> <P> All five council members will attend the meeting, Maxfield said, and city  manager Frank Benest will serve as moderator. After a resident has spoken,  Benest will ask a council member to respond. City staff also will be hand.  DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE  </P></p>

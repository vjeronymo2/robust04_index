			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Mexican stand-off raises fears of prices decline MEXICO'S determination to raise funds as cheaply as possible has raised fears that investors could lose confidence temporarily in the emerging markets sector of the international bond market. Three years ago, Mexican borrowers led the way for other Latin American countries into the international capital markets for the first time since the debt crisis of the 1980s. So far, even the most cynical investor would have difficulty playing down the success of their return. The most important gauge of this success has been the dramatic improvement in the pricing of Latin American Eurobond issues relatively quickly. Furthermore, their offerings now appeal to a much wider range of investors as the market becomes more liquid. However bankers are worried a lot of this progress could come undone if Mexico attempts to force what they perceive to be aggressive funding targets on unwilling investors. Currently, Mexican state-owned borrowers have to pay a premium, or 'spread', of just over 200 basis points above the yield on US Treasuries, widely seen to be the threshold for borrowers without an investment grade rating. The only Latin American countries to have achieved an investment grade rating so far are Chile and Colombia, assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. Mexico has a credit rating of BB+ from S&amp;P and Ba2 from Moody's, the other leading US rating agency. Although the country is thought to be close to gaining an investment grade rating, bankers do not believe this will be assigned until the North American Free Trade Agreement comes into force at the start of next year. And bankers are confident that Mexico will be assigned an investment grade rating shortly afterwards. However, it appears that the Hacienda, Mexico's finance ministry, is unwilling to wait that long and has been trying to force the issue with the investment community. To reach its objective, the Hacienda appears to be preventing government agencies from borrowing funds at a spread of more than 200 basis points above US Treasuries. By law, any transaction by a Mexican agency has to be approved by the finance ministry. There have been reports that this was why some weeks ago an international bond offering for the state-owned Comision Federal de Electricidad was postponed at the last minute. Bankers say the Hacienda has been encouraged to take this stance since Mexico has been able to raise short-dated funds under its Euro-commercial programme at a spread of just 125 basis points above US Treasuries. But they add there is only limited investor appeal for Mexican paper at this level of pricing, partly because of the short maturity of three or six months. In their view, it would be difficult to bring a large bond issue with a longer maturity at a similar spread over US Treasuries. Bankers fear that what has become known as the 'Mexican stand-off' could lead to a fall in prices of Latin American bonds. 'It is a big step to push through this level,' says one banker, adding that a badly-timed deal could prompt heavy profit-taking in Latin American bonds. Bankers believe Mexico will get close to its funding target over the coming months, but they reckon it would be against its long-term interest to try it at all costs. The country would find itself competing against sovereign borrowers with better credit ratings and its impatience could end up alienating investors, they warn. 'Mexico is no longer the only game in town,' says one banker. Indeed, investors can now choose from a much wider range of Latin American issuers. In 1990, Mexican issuers accounted for more than 75 per cent of all Latin American Eurobonds. However, this proportion has dropped below 50 per cent. Argentine and Brazilian borrowers now make regular appearances in the international bond market. Over the past year, the first deals were launched for Uruguay, Colombia, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Chile. Last week, Anacafe, Guatemala's national coffee association, raised Dollars 60m through a three-year issue of amortising notes. In addition, Peruvian borrowers are expected to make their debut on the market in the fourth quarter, kicking off with a three-year issue by a state-owned bank. Bankers are confident any fall-out from the Mexican pricing issue will not damage the emerging market sector of the Euromarket in the long term. 'The spread on best credits should continue to tighten,' one banker says. They note that the increasing number of large and comparable bond issues have established valuable benchmarks from which issuers and investors alike are able to get a good sense of pricing.</p>

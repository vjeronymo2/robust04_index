			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat EGM adjourned An extraordinary general meeting of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, was adjourned yesterday, without a word from a shareholder, to be resumed after next Monday's annual meeting, writes Maggie Urry. The meeting was told by Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman, that he would make a statement next week about the company's position. He said it would be unfair on absent shareholders to say anything before then. The adjournment motion was passed on a show of hands. The recently-formed shareholder action group was not represented. It is plans to advocate voting against the acceptance of the annual report. See Observer</p>

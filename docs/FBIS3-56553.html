			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis views as  provocative, an order issued by the command of the Northwestern  Group of Russian Forces last week. The order allows the use of  arms in case of attacks on, or other illegal actions toward  Russian military personnel or military facilities. Ulmanis told  a news conference this today, adding that such an action by the  Russian side is not acceptable for him as president. Ulmanis  believes that this step on the part of the command of the  Northwestern Group of Forces is not a very correct reply to  Ulmanis' correct action during the provocation of 10 January  [when two Russian generals were detained by Latvians in Riga].    As Igor Golin, the head of the press center of the  Northwestern Group of Forces told the Baltic News Agency, the  above-mentioned order will not be applicable in cases when  Latvian border guards detain Russian military personnel who try  to enter Latvia without the necessary documents. According to  Golin, the order allows a person who guards a Russian military  facility located in Latvia to use arms in case of an attack  after a verbal warning or warning shot in the air, as it is  provided by the Russian military rules.</p>

In an article carried in the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" today, Xie  said  the province's gross domestic product last year increased by  12.8 percent over the previous year, its industrial output value  by 20.9 percent, and its agricultural output value by 1.5  percent, despite natural disasters.    "However, we must be clear about the fact that the  development of Sichuan is still behind that of the coastal  provinces," Xie noted.    According to Xie, 1994 is a key year for China to develop  its  socialist market economy, and Sichuan has pledged to increase  its gross domestic product by 9.6 percent and industrial and  agricultural output value by 12.8 percent.    "To accomplish the objective," the secretary said, "Sichuan,  with a territory of 570,000 sq [square] km and a population of  more than 100 million, must rely on itself."    The secretary encouraged localities to open wider to the  outside world in order to boost its economy.    Last year saw the province succeed in holding a number of  trade seminars in Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand and the Republic of  Korea.    It imported investment totalling more than two billion U.S.  dollars and set up 1,900 foreign-funded enterprises.    More and more international financial groups are showing  interest in tapping the province's energy resources and  improving its transportation facilities.    In addition, Sichuan has made progress in exports, overseas  labor service, opening enterprises abroad and tourism, Xie  revealed.</p>

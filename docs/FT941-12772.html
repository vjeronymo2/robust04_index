			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Courting corporations: Princess Anne tells Michael Cassell why giving is important The Princess Royal readily admits it is hard to get the press excited about a modest ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of one of her favourite charities. The task becomes Herculean when, on the other side of the world, someone chooses the same morning to take a pot-shot at her older brother. She has already been assured Prince Charles is unharmed and, while her security officers chat in the corridor about the drama 'down under', she deftly fends off questions on personal safety. It is business as usual at Church House, Westminster, where she has come to mark the start of celebrations for Save the Children, the worldwide charity of which she has been president for nearly 25 years. The organisation fights not only for the rights of children from Bangladesh to Belfast but also for badly needed funds in the increasingly competitive marketplace for humanitarian aid. It is 'entirely feasible', she says, that there are now too many charities tugging at people's pockets, though one which has been around since 1919 can hardly be accused of jumping in on the act. 'The British in particular are ferociously individualistic about the way they approach problems. There is always an inclination to set up another fund. As it is, there is enough money locked up and untouchable in charitable trusts, never mind the new ones appearing all the time.' The princess scoffs at this week's findings by an international study suggesting that the proportion of Britons giving to charity is among the highest of any country but that the individual amounts are stingy. 'The Spanish emerge as the biggest contributors but that's because of their lottery, a fairly dubious definition of charitable giving.' But isn't it shameful that an organisation which last year stretched its Pounds 100m aid budget across 50 countries had to earmark Pounds 15m of it for the UK? 'In any kind of welfare system there are still going to be gaps. You have to draw boundaries around state help; there are problems enough already. 'There will always be elements of our community more at risk than others and areas which confront discrimination and need help. Look at gypsies and the families of prisoners.' So has any progress really been made, or does the world stagger from one disaster to the next, learning nothing? 'There have been big, incremental improvements. The point of the exercise is that, when aid workers move on, people have acquired the skills to look after themselves. But helping people to help themselves is very hard work.' The quality of help, she insists, is now high: 'Today, if you are not careful, standards in the camps are higher than in surrounding areas. That can cause big problems.' In recognising the uphill struggle to get companies and individuals to play their part in 'championing children' around the world, she quotes Eglantyne Jebb, the forgotten founder of Save the Children: 'The world is not ungenerous but unimaginative and very busy.' The princess sees Jebb as an 'unsung heroine' whose anger at the plight of children laid the foundations for the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. She says the woman deserves a place in the hall of fame alongside names like Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry. The princess's four-year-old English bull terrier is even named Eglantyne. The Queen's daughter is used to being portrayed as ice cool, doing her bit for disadvantaged children, but not the child-hugging, motherly type. She responds with characteristic directness: 'I don't believe holding children is going to make much difference to their long-term happiness. Jebb didn't make a habit of it either.' She is not averse, however, to embracing a few more big British companies to help fund the organisation's work. Its corporate membership scheme, under which big players undertake to raise Pounds 100,000 a year for at least three years, still has room for others to join the likes of Tesco, British Airways and Unilever. It may be a big commitment but, as the princess points out, 'some at least have found it a very useful weapon in resisting the countless letters which pour in asking for help'. But she says it is as much about contributing ideas and making time and there can be big commercial benefits given an effective charity strategy. So what would the old campaigner think of Save the Children 65 years after her death and of the job left unfinished? 'I expect she would have been even more cross than she was in 1919. There is still so much to be done.'</p>

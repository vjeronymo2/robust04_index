			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hooked on Silence"] </F>   [Text] Pathetically underinformed Congress members are not  the only victims of the government's "ask me not" attitude over  the effects of a concluded Uruguay round on India. Serious  public misconception is another. And in no case is the  information gap more severe and the reaction more spontaneous  than in pharmaceuticals. The popular horror story is of product  patents in the pharmaceutical sector engendering monopolies and,  thus, higher prices. Such an outcome, if possible, is obviously  undesirable for a country as poor as India. The story, however,  is rather fanciful. Roughly eight drugs are relevant in this  context--Rifampicin, Bromhexine, Captropril, Salbutamol,  Norfloxacin, Mebendazole, Ranitidine and Naproxen. Patents for  only three, Captropril, Ranitidine and Norfloxacin, have not  expired yet. The other five, due to expiry of their patents, are  now classified as generic products. The three drugs for which  patents are still valid will become generic products before the  ten year adjustment period in the Dunkel draft for changing  patent legislation is over. Of course, this does not cover the  new products that will inevitably make their appearance. Product  patents will apply to them. But to automatically conclude this  would lead to higher prices is erroneous. Substitutes for the  therapeutic equivalents of the eight drugs are available,  without any great difficulty and not at extraordinary prices.  These drugs presently constitute the essentials in  pharmaceutical markets. It is extremely unlikely that this  position will be radically changed. In that case new products,  being new therapeutic equivalents of the eight drugs will be  patented no doubt, but by virtue of the existence of substitutes  will not be produced as monopolistic commodities. The spectre of  unaffordable prices, foreign companies making hay while the  majority of Indians suffer under the new patent regime is thus  at best overimaginative.    And of course the government is to be blamed squarely for  not  making that clear. This is not merely a public relations  disaster. It is unpardonable callousness given the multilateral  trade treaty impinges on several fronts. That Parliament and the  people were so ill informed about the nation's most important  international economic agreement is however not surprising. A  similar combination of ignorance of the norms of public debate  in a democracy and inability or unwillingness to put forward its  case when it has an excellent one is evident in the case of  economic reforms. India's brave attempt to change its economic  course is being conducted amidst ridiculous official  taciturnity. Parliamentary debate as a result, as in the case of  the Dunkel draft discussions, has rarely risen above partisan  rhetoric. And even in that, the Congress members have been  uncomfortable cheerleaders for reform, all the talk about  ushering in change lacking the solidity that comes from a  forthcoming and confidently articulate government. The  Opposition, naturally, has had considerable success in tarring  reform with virtually any brush it has chosen to--anti-poor,  pro-exploitative international capital, means to selling the  nation's economic sovereignty. Part of the problem is in the  fact the Congress lacks a "great communicator." The prime  minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, has comfortably proved his  disadvantage in this field, and other senior party leaders are,  when economically literate, not charismatic and when charismatic  not capable of explaining "the new economic policies." But  governments can get messages across even without persuasive  communicators. The vast propaganda machine at their command  doing the job. A number of Latin American nations have done  exactly that. That India has not simply reflects how shoddy its  standards and visions of governance are.</p>

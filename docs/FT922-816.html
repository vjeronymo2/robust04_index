			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Regulator concerned about futureof LBC THE RADIO Authority is closely monitoring the state of Crown Communications, the lossmaking company which owns LBC, London's speech-based commercial radio station. On Monday Crown reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m for the six months to March 31 against losses of Pounds 4.68m last time and Pounds 6.79m in the year to September. The main concern of the Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, is with the future of LBC, which has been increasing its share of the audience and trading profitably. It is believed the Authority has had preliminary discussions with potential investors. The aim would be to try to safeguard LBC's position if the financial position of Crown were to deteriorate. Two years ago Crown shares were trading at 250p, but by this week had fallen to 8p. The company has been hit by the recession, exacerbated by losses from an investment in RFM, a radio network with 89 stations in France. Mr Christopher Chataway, Crown's chairman, said that the company would be reducing its stake in French radio. Partners were also being sought for other Crown businesses such as IRS, the commercial radio sales house. Mr Chataway has assured shareholders that the company still has the support of its banks. Last month Price Waterhouse, Crown's auditors, said they believed there were adequate financial resources for the foreseeable future but some aspects of the accounts relating to the RFM investment had been qualified. LBC's licence comes up for renewal in March 1993. Meanwhile, Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, told the Association of Commercial Radio Companies they were getting a bit too agitated about the re-franchising round starting in the autumn.</p>

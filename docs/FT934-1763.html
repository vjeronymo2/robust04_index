			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Pension clients fall victim to suspect advice: A report commissioned by SIB on transfer business reveals an almost uniform flouting of guidance rules The picture that inexorably emerges from a pilot study of the pensions transfer business is of sales agents routinely failing to seek enough information to give good advice, customers commonly given suspect advice and only a small minority of cases handled in accordance with regulations. The study by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick was commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. It covered 735 case files of those transferring out of occupational schemes over 2 1/2 years from the beginning of 1991. It showed an almost uniform failure to comply satisfactorily with regulatory requirements before the self-regulating organisations issued their members with guidance. Four-fifths failed to meet proper standards even after guidance was issued. Members of three regulators were covered in the research - Fimbra, which regulates independent financial advisers, Lautro, which regulates sales agents directly employed by or exclusively contracted to life insurance companies, and Imro, which regulates independent sales agents employed by fund-management companies. Examples were taken both from before and after each of the regulators issued their guidance. They covered issues such as taking proper account of the particulars of the pension scheme the customer might transfer out of (the 'ceding' scheme); ensuring that the client had enough information and understood it; and looking at the range of options available to the customer. Following earlier concerns about standards, Fimbra and Lautro issued guidance in July last year, Imro followed in March. For all three areas, between two-thirds and four-fifths of the samples were taken from the period before the guidance was given. KPMG divided the case files into four categories: Unsatisfactory: where there was not enough written information to support the advice the adviser had given. Suspect: where, at first sight, the adviser seemed to have acted suspiciously or misleadingly - for example by giving apparently perverse advice. Unsatisfactory and suspect: where a file was both of the above. Pass: where there was evidence that the adviser had sought enough information to give good advice, and that advice appeared to have been understood by the customer. More than 400 ceding schemes were represented in the sample, with the most common scheme accounting for 31 cases. About a quarter of transfers came from public-sector, nationalised-industry and former nationalised-industry schemes. Across the whole 2 1/2 -year period, 89 per cent of cases involving Fimbra members failed to meet compliance standards. The figure for Lautro was 95 per cent, and for Imro 89 per cent. After the action by the regulators, the number of cases properly handled rose from one in 20 to one in five. This was true across sales agents and advisers covered by all three regulators. For Fimbra members, the pass rate rose from 6 per cent to 21 per cent; for Lautro members it rose from 1 per cent to 19 per cent; and for Imro members it rose from 9 per cent to 18 per cent. The most noticeable change seems to have been in providing information rather than in the quality of advice. The total proportion of cases where not enough information was on file fell from 88 per cent to 69 per cent. But the proportion where suspect advice was given fell only from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. The proportion where there was doubt about the advice given but the file contained enough information to make a judgment - thus reducing the prospect that it would longer seem suspect if all the relevant information was there  -stood at 11 per cent before the regulators took action, and remained at 7 per cent. The method of selling seems to have been less important in determining whether the sales agent acted in accordance with regulation than other factors such as the sort of analysis of transfer value used and the value of the lump sum being transferred. Where a computerised transfer analysis was used, 24 per cent of files were passed compared with a 5 per cent pass rate where this analysis was not employed. Where the transfer value was more than Pounds 30,000 the overall pass rate was, at 17 per cent, almost twice as high as the overall pass rate of 9 per cent. KPMG also examined the areas of information which were most often omitted from the sales agents' 'know your customer' checklists. These included details of the ceding scheme's early retirement options and the discretionary increases in benefits it might offer. In only two-fifths of cases was the client's attitude to risk recorded. The overall average age of an investor at the time of transfer was 41, and the average transfer value was Pounds 19,372. Fimbra, Lautro and imro are all self-regulating organisations for the retail financial services idustry: Fimbra regulates independent financial advisors Lautro regulates sale agents directly employed or exlusively contracted to life insurance companies Imro regulates the independent sales agents employed by fund management companies  ----------------------------------------            SRO PERFORMANCE*  ---------------------------------------- Pre-guidance  ---------------------------------------- Fimbra                      6 percent Lautro                      1 percent Imro                        9 percent  ---------------------------------------- Post-guidance  ---------------------------------------- Fimbra                     21 percent Lautro                     19 percent Imro                       18 percent  ---------------------------------------- *Pass rates for cases  ---------------------------------------- Source: KPMG  ----------------------------------------</p>

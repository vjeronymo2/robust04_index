They issued a manifesto saying the democrats sustained a  crushing defeat in last month's general elections.    For the past two years, it says, pro-democracy groups have  supported the new establishment and the president though being  aware of their weakness and mistakes. "But we were also aware of  something even worse than that -- the establishment's growing  indifference to the electorate," says the manifesto.    The authors of the manifesto speak of a dramatic change with  "alienation between the government and the people reaching any  acceptable limits."    "Amid continuing hardships caused by economic crisis, this  is  fraught with social upheavals," it says.    The authors called for an alternative policy of reforms to  the benefit of the people.    The manifesto says the country still has a chance to build a  civilian society peacefully, create a robust middle class,  redress the plight of hired workers, and give each honest man an  opportunity to ensure a decent standard of living for himself  and his family.</p>

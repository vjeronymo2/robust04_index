			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Portnikov] </F>   [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk finally managed  to persuade the Supreme Council to ratify the Strategic  Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty without any stipulations.  Ukraine thus became a nonnuclear state, and the president's  signing of the trilateral American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement  has been confirmed. Kravchuk is in a sense demonstrating the  strength of his own positions to his partners at the Moscow  summit, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. However, this  demonstration is almost a Pyrrhic victory.    Opting for foreign political concessions, parliamentarians  decided to "recoup their losses" at the expense of presidential  power, scheduling elections of the new head of state in June and  rescinding the power of presidential representative in the  regions, in which authority is to be returned to the local  councils. In contrast to representatives of the Russian  president, who perform only representative functions,  representatives of the Ukrainian president directly exercise all  power in the republic's oblasts and cities. And the Ukrainian  parliament's attempt to deprive Leonid Kravchuk of his needed  chain of command right at the eve of parliamentary and  presidential elections distinctly reveals the true measure of  sympathy the parliamentary corps hold for the head of state.    It stands to reason that only the "party of power" can count  on any serious success in the forthcoming parliamentary  elections, and that only in the event of this party's victory  can Leonid Kravchuk hope to have the new parliament call off the  presidential elections. Or to win such elections. However, there  is hardly any logical basis for these plans: Voters in  post-Soviet states have been known to vote the opposition. And  the last elections in Ukraine (in Crimea) gave the Ukrainian  leader a good idea of how fickle the sympathies of voters are,  and how they "love" centrists today. By the way, Leonid Kravchuk  has been taxed by yet another ordeal--a meeting with the new  Crimean president, Yuriy Meshkov.</p>

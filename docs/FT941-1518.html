			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Gloom on jobs in Gloucestershire Gloucestershire has suffered the sharpest fall in overall employment in Britain, a report on the county's economy by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, shows. It said the recession and cuts in the defence industry, on which the county relies, meant unemployment nearly tripled between 1990 and 1993. Industries which have grown rapidly in the 1980s, such as financial services, have stalled. 'Almost all of the 20,000 net jobs gained in the eight years between 1981 and 1989 were lost in the subsequent two years,' the report says. Coopers &amp; Lybrand did not expect the growth in the county's population and labour force to be matched by employment growth. Although unemployment is still below the national average, it forecasts that, while the UK rate falls, there could be a further rise of 25 per cent in Gloucestershire by 2002.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Europe and the United States have  respectively the same views regarding the solution of the Kosova  issue, though the United States is more committed to a  preventive action in Kosova. That was what President of the  Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova precisely declared to  reporters at his news conference held today. For further  details, let us follow a report from Prishtina by reporter  Mehmet Haziri:    [Haziri] President Rugova highly assessed his meeting with  U.S. President Bill Clinton and other U.S. high-level officials.  Rugova said that President Clinton expressed his deep concern  over the situation in Kosova and gave his support to a political  and peaceful solution to this problem.    President Rugova considered his visit to the United States  important also for the fact that all his interlocutors in the  U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Congress highly assessed  the peaceful policy followed by the parties and the Albanian  people in Kosova to achieve independence.    Confronted with a reality of violence and apartheid in  Kosova, which has recently intensified with raids and massive  arrests of Albanians, draconian punishments in trials, and  threats to destroy the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the  Republic of Kosova as the only scientific institution that had  so far worked in its own halls, President Rugova asked the  international community to undertake a preventive action to stop  the Serbian violence that has swept all segments of life in  Kosova.    Despite the NATO ultimatum to interrupt the destructive  operations of the parties in Bosnia, the international community  does not dare to divert its attention away from Kosova, Rugova  pointed out. He considered the trials held in Kosova as  trumped-up political charges, now obsolete even in the former  communist countries, which aim to discredit the peaceful policy  followed by the political leadership and the Albanian people of  Kosova.    Asked by Serbian reporters how he assesses the newest  Russian  initiative to unblock Sarajevo, Rugova answered that the Russian  initiative is good as long as this will be supported by the  Serbian party.    Asked to comment on several articles in the Serbian press on  the alleged cracks in inter-Albanian relations, based on the  results of the last congress of the Party of Democratic  Prosperity, President Rugova was categorical that no  discrepancies exist between Tirana and Prishtina and him and  Chairman Berisha. We hope that even the problems within the  Party of Democratic Prosperity will be expeditiously overcome  through a pure cooperation and reciprocal tolerance.    President Rugova also answered other questions by reporters.</p>

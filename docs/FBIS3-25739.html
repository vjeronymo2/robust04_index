			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Jose Eduardo dos </F> Santos with unidentified correspondents in Paris on 25 February]    [Text] At a news conference in Paris yesterday, Angolan  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said his visit to France had  had a positive outcome.    [Begin Santos recording] I would like to express my  gratitude  for the warm reception my team and I have been given. Our visit  is in keeping with the excellent relations of friendship and  cooperation our countries enjoy. This time, we have taken  advantage of our stay in France to discuss bilateral relations  and certain specific issues, notably those pertaining to the  Angolan peace talks and economic relations. This means that we  are leaving France quite happy with the positive results we have  achieved. (?It is natural) that journalists should try to learn  whether the arms embargo issue was raised and whether Angola  asked for French military support. I shall tell you immediately  that we did not do so. We came here principally to discuss  bilateral relations, issues relating to economic cooperation,  and how France could intervene indirectly in southern and  central Africa to help create a climate that will favor  negotiation and permit the successful implementation of an  eventual accord between the government and the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, in Lusaka.    I was also privileged to receive distinguished French  figures  -- notably businessmen -- in my apartment. I am talking about  the chairmen of Total, Elf Aquitaine, and Aerospatiale  companies, all of which have special relations with Angola,  because they have mutually advantageous relations with Angolan  companies. In general terms, I can say that the representatives  of those companies have felt comfortable in our country and have  enjoyed our hospitality, which has allowed them to live and  operate in relative stability despite the war. I took advantage  of my contacts with French Government officials and with the  chairmen of commercial companies to explain the guidelines of  the Economic Stabilization Program that the Angolan Government  now plans to implement. They saw that it is the Angolan  Government's desire to create the necessary macroeconomic and  security conditions that will permit stabler economic activity,  thereby allowing French cooperation in developing the Angolan  economy.    The Angolan foreign debt issue also received particular  attention during our visit. We discussed it with the French  authorities, but not so much in terms of rescheduling or paying  it. Rather, we asked France to use its influence with  international organizations in general, and with the IMF in  particular, to [words indistinct] such an agreement would allow  our country and its creditors in the Paris Club to analyze and  discuss a plan to have Angola's foreign debt rescheduled.    I am aware that you, the journalists, tried to report on the  situation in Angola, the work being done by my government, and  bilateral relations during my stay in France. I must tell you  that we were disappointed to see that reporting on my country  and on my government's work was, in many instances, quite  distorted. Be that as it may, we have not come here to issue  any formal denial. We want to satisfy the curiosity of the  reporters present here. Nonetheless, I must tell you that many  of the reports were unfounded. [end recording]</p>

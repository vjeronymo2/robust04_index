			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shandwick slightly above expectations with Pounds 2m SHANDWICK, the public relations agency, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m, slightly better than anticipated, for the 12 months to October 31, against a loss of Pounds 1.4m for the previous 15 months. Turnover was Pounds 157m (Pounds 198m) for operating profits of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 14.4m) before exceptional costs of Pounds 3.85m, of which Pounds 3.1m related to refinancing and Pounds 750,000 to the employee share ownership plan. There was also an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.5m covering the sale of three non-core businesses. At October 31, net debt was Pounds 62.1m, in line with expectations. Last December Shandwick's bankers agreed to extend facilities of Pounds 69m until the end of January 1994. Shandwick grew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s. Last year it made acquisition-related payments of Pounds 8.8m and estimated that further payments totalling Pounds 15.2m would be made over the next four years with Pounds 5.9m falling due this year. Mr Peter Gummer, chairman and chief executive, said last year had been very difficult but some 'encouraging signs in major markets served by the group give us increased confidence in the current year.' Operating margins of the US companies, where Shandwick generates 53 per cent of its business, were above 20 per cent. Earnings per share were 0.7p (8.9p losses). No final dividend will be paid.</p>

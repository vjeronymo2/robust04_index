			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Cambridge to establish management institute CAMBRIDGE University is to launch a management institute and its own MBA, after a donation of Pounds 5m by Mr Simon Sainsbury of the retailing family. The institute will open this September and expects to admit more than 150 students within three years. Mr Sainsbury said yesterday: 'Management education and research is vital. It is a subject which has been strangely neglected by our great universities.' His donation follows gifts of Pounds 8m by Mr Paul Judge, former chairman of Premier Brands, a food operation of Hillsdown Holdings, and Pounds 1.5m by Guinness. Peat Marwick has also established a chair. Mr John Hendry, the course director, hailed the new MBA as 'a major innovation in management education'. It will be a three-year course, with three terms spent in Cambridge and the remainder in the student's workplace. The university has earmarked a central Cambridge site for the institute. Oxford University also intends to establish an MBA programme and to expand Templeton College, its existing management institute. Schools that have opted out of local-authority control will no longer have to wait five years before changing their status, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Education Secretary, announced yesterday. He said he would consider each application on its merits.</p>

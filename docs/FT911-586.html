			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK INDEX futures led the share market higher, although prices remained locked in the broad range established over the past two weeks. The June FT-SE 100 index contract began firmly, moving to a premium of more than 20 points to the spot index, which pulled the stock market up. Later in the session, the futures market moved higher once again as speculation grew about a bid for a FT-SE stock. An old suggestion that Hanson may bid for British Gas was mentioned in the market, although most traders doubted this. By the close, June was up 21 points at 2,540, while its premium to the spot index was at 21, against 15 in the previous session. According to brokers' calculations, June should trade 15 Footsie points above the spot index for fair value. In traded options, there was busy dealing in Sears following lower than expected final results. A total of 4,189 contracts were traded. Some investors were buying to close positions in June 90 calls. There was also selling of December 100 calls and 80 puts. An investor rolled a position in British Telecom options forward from May 330 to August 360 calls. Elsewhere, James Capel was a buyer of 500 National Power June 110 calls. Land Securities was lifted by a sale of 1,000 October 550 calls.</p>

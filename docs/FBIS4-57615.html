			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday  said his government will subsidize the increase in the electric  power rate, whenever it goes into effect following the  recommendations of the Multi Sector Commission.    The report on the electricity sector recommended a new rate  per kilowatt hour that the INDE [National Electricity Institute]  sells to the EEGSA [Empresa Electrica de Guatemala, S.A. --  Guatemalan Electric Power Company]. This will lead to an  increase when the new rates take effect. De Leon Carpio  indicated that "I already have the report," adding that the  Guatemalan people can be certain that he will analyze the report  carefully with his advisers.    Nevertheless, he said "we will continue with the subsidy, as  recommended." He said his government has a policy of  subsidizing the direct customer and that "this policy will have  to continue until it no longer can be maintaisned."    He said he is very aware of the country's situation so he  does not want to economically harm the poorest people.</p>

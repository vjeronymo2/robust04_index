			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Suva, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Fiji's mercurial prime minister  Sitiveni Rabuka appears to have reversed his opposition to any  future political alliance with ethnic Indians, announcing here  that he now wants to work closely with them. Launching his  Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party campaign in English  before an audience of about 40 people late Wednesday, he said he  wanted to promote national unity. Observers said this could mean  bringing Indians into his cabinet if he emerged the winner in  the upcoming election.    "On the promotion of national unity, we will build on the  very successful start we have made on inviting the participation  of the Parliamentary Opposition in the work of the Cabinet  sub-committee on the review of the constitution," he said.    He promised a future Rabuka government would extend this to  the Agriculture Land and Tenant Act (ALTA) which makes decisions  about Fijian-owned land leased to predominantly Indian  canegrowers.    One of the demands of the Indian opposition groups is for  scrapping the racially-based 1990 constitution which gives  indigenous Fijians a permanent majority of 37 in the 70-seat  House of Representatives. Rabuka told an SVT political rally  here Monday that he would not form a coalition with an Indian  party if the SVT won a majority the Fijian seats. However, he  reportedly told local reporters Tuesday he would keep the door  open to alliances with other political parties to keep alive his  concept of a government of national unity proposed in November  1992.    The ALTA, established in 1966, is a sensitive issue here.  Fijians want it abolished so they can get their land back when  leases expires, but Indians favour it because it protects their  rights to the land. The land issue has become a political  football because Indian cane farmers do not own their own land  but have to lease it from indigenous Fijians who own 83 percent  of the land. Sugar is the backbone of the economy earning about  260 million Fijian dollars (170 million US) annually in foreign  exchange. It is exceeded only by tourism which brings in more  than 328 million Fijian dollars.    Rabuka said he would work with the opposition to establish  parliamentary select committees to look into problems faced by  the Indians, outlining an eight-point plan which he said a  Rabuka government would implement.    Among other measures, cabinet ministers would not be  appointed on a provincial basis but on merit, the government  would proceed with a promised review of valued added tax (VAT).    It would also weigh the relative advantages of deregulation  to consumers of free and open importation with the need to  protect local producers and manufacturers.</p>

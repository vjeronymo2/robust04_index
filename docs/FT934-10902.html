			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Daimler says it may cut dividend DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial group, has warned that it may reduce its dividend for 1993, apparently in response to mounting discontent among the workforce. Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, said in a radio interview that while the company would try to avoid 'bitter disappointments' for shareholders, employees could not be expected to be the only people to make sacrifices. The prospect of a dividend cut was raised despite the company's claims for most of this year that it would try to hold the pay-out at last year's DM13  -drawing on reserves if necessary. Daimler, embracing Mercedes-Benz, AEG electrical engineering and Deutsche Aerospace, has recently provoked anger among its workers with plans to extend an already heavy job cutting programme. The proposed closure of six Deutsche Aerospace factories, service and logistics centres led to widespread labour unrest, including demonstrations and warning stoppages. All operating divisions are expected to incur heavy losses this year, and the final result will be worsened by a DM1.5bn (Pounds 600m) charge for rationalisation. Daimler, reporting for the first time according to US accounting rules, incurred a net loss of DM949m in the first half of this year compared with a net profit of DM965m in the same period last year. The group has ample reserves, including more than DM8bn in appropriated retained earnings revealed in connection with its recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Markets had been led to believe these would be used to maintain the dividend, bolstering the group's attractions in advance of a rights issue planned for next year. It appears the board has now decided an unchanged payout would be inappropriate while 44,000 jobs were being cut. Analysts suggested a DM3 reduction to DM10 would be 'psychologically' suitable while anything less would be cosmetic. Daimler shares closed DM4.5 higher at DM752. Even so their progress lagged well behind the blue-chip Dax index which closed at a record of 2,095.58, and the gain was eroded in after-hours trading. Lex, Page 20</p>

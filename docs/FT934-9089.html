			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Savile Row tailors go in pursuit of gentlemen GENTLEMEN need no longer go to London's Savile Row to buy a Pounds 2,000 suit. Savile Row will go to them. Britain's top gentlemen's outfitters are travelling the world to find customers. Sales by Savile Row tailors on trips overseas account for about 70 per cent of turnover - two years ago they were less than half, according to the Federation of Merchant Tailors. The itinerants have been trying to shake off the fall in the number of international aircraft passengers after the Gulf war and the recession. 'I used to spend six weeks a year overseas. Now it is more like three months,' said Mr Peter Ferguson-Smith, the federation's president and managing director of tailors Kilgour, French and Stanbury. He flies between Abu Dhabi, Frankfurt and Beverley Hills in the struggle to drum up sales of suits. Prices start at Pounds 1,490 and options include a special cut to disguise the bulge of a revolver. Mr Angus Cundey of tailor Henry Poole said: 'On Monday I am piling my cloth samples into the Volvo and driving to Paris. I'll be seeing Mr Balladur (the French prime minister) and about 60 other people next week.' If the trip is too far for his car, Mr Cundey will have a trunk of samples delivered to his hotel room, which becomes a shop for the duration of his stay. The phenomenon of the travelling Savile Row tailor is not new. In 1851, Henry Poole went to Paris to measure Napoleon III for a suit. Until 1940 the company had branches in Vienna and Berlin and the post-war years saw the popularity of Savile Row grow among rich Americans. All that has changed. 'Fewer businessmen are coming to London,' Mr Cundey said. 'French businessmen are coming far less frequently. That goes for all the Europeans. They fly in and fly out and they don't have time to see their tailor.' Fortunately for Mr Cundey and his neighbours in Savile Row, the slimline 'British look' is almost fashionable for the first time in more than a decade. Even so, it may be tricky to spot the man in the Savile Row suit by the cut of his cloth. 'An American will not want too much padding in the shoulders,' said Mr Ferguson-Smith. 'A Frenchman or an Italian might want something more closely fitted, while the Germans still want the big-shoulder look.'</p>

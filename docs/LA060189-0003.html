			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTONOVICH TO SEEK AUDIT OF AQMD  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, citing a 184% increase in the  Air Quality Management District's budget over the last five years, said  Wednesday he will ask for an independent audit of the agency.  </P> <P> At a news conference where he was joined by members of the business community,  Antonovich charged that the AQMD's proposed $80.2-million 1989-90 budget  unfairly assesses businesses through across-the-board 19.5% increases in annual  fees, permit application fees and emission fees.  </P> <P> Antonovich, a member of the AQMD's board of directors, complained that industry  is responsible for 30% of the air pollution in the basin, compared to 70% for  motor vehicles, but is being asked to finance 85% of AQMD's budget.  </P> <P> AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly, while acknowledging that Antonovich's statistics  were "essentially accurate," said industry is indirectly responsible for a  greater share of pollution as a result of emissions from vehicles used by  employees during their commute and on the job.  </P></p>

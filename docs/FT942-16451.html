			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Halifax increases its fixed rates Halifax, the UK's largest building society, yesterday lifted its fixed-rate mortgages by up to 0.75 of a percentage point. Its benchmark five-year fixed rate for new borrowers and existing customers who are moving home is now 8.49 per cent, up from 7.75 per cent, while for existing customers who are remortgaging, the five-year rate is 8.85 per cent, up from 8.1 per cent. The variable rate has been 7.64 per cent since December. Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, said the range of discounts offered by the society on its variable rate meant customers had a wide choice of options 'at a time when fixed rates are hardening'.</p>

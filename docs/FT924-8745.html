			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US fires new salvo in Gatt propaganda war  -Report says deal would give sharp boost to processed French farm exports SUCCESSFUL completion of the Uruguay Round would create an export boom for French farmers in the high-value processed products that account for 70 per cent of current farm exports, according to a report by US farm economists in Europe. Independent farm experts said the report exaggerated potential gains, but agreed that as Europe's most efficient agriculture producers, French farmers could on balance see gains. They said some of the gains would come at the expense of less efficient farmers in other parts of Europe - such as Germany or Spain - rather than through boosted sales to markets outside Europe. The report comes at a time when French farmers are campaigning fiercely to prevent further dilution of the Common Agriculture Policy's farm subsidy regime. The collapse last week of ill-tempered US-EC negotiations on reform of Europe's agriculture subsidy system has triggered fears of a tit-for-tat trade war. It is clearly intended to fuel the propaganda war between France, backed by other smaller farm exporters such as Spain and Ireland, and leading industrial exporters who fear the farm trade dispute will scuttle the ambitious Uruguay Round reform package, which embraces trade in a wide range of services, in textiles, improved settlement of international trade disputes, and cuts in tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade. The report predicts an export boom for French beverages, processed and fresh fruits and vegetables, and livestock products. These together accounted for exports worth FFr130bn (Pounds 15.5bn) last year - about 70 per cent of total farm exports. 'Potential gains for this already huge sector are staggering, and far outweigh even the most pessimistic French estimates of potential losses in the cereals and oilseeds sectors,' the report says. It says an extra 35,000 jobs would be created for every FFr5bn increase in exports. Mr Jean-Marie Demange, agriculture counsellor at France's London embassy, said yesterday he was puzzled by projections of more farm jobs: the country's farming population is expected to fall from 1m at present to less than 700,000 within seven years, he said. Dynamic regions such as Brittany could be expected to gain, as could the country's efficient poultry sector, he added - but this was only a small part of the farm sector. He insisted that while France was a strong producer of processed farm products, it could not be expected to perform well in marketing these outside Europe, since most farmers were small operators, with poor links to large groups with any international trading network. France at present imports more processed food products than it exports, he said. The report also claims that CAP reforms will lead to higher demand inside the EC for cereals. It quotes EC studies predicting a 10m tonne increase in annual demand for cereals due to livestock feeding alone. This would more than offset the US demand for cuts in subsidised exports of cereals. 'Things are not going to be as bad as the French say, but nor are they going to be as good as the Americans say,' Mr Jim Rollo, a farm trade expert at the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London, said. 'France will do well out of the realignment of EC agriculture, and is likely to gain a lot in Europe's internal market, perhaps at the expense of German, British or Italian farmers. But there is quite a lot of adjustment to go through.'</p>

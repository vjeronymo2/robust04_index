			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks hit Weakness in the US dollar, which fell to a 50-year low against the Japanese yen, hit companies with a big US presence. Among the main victims were leading oil issues, which are big dollar earners and consequently failed to benefit from the rising price of Brent crude. Near-month Brent prices hung just below Dollars 18 a barrel, but Shell Transport, which is hosting a meeting for analysts in the US this week, ticked back 13 1/2 to 682 1/2 , while BP dipped 5 1/2 to 398 1/2 p. Bowater, the printing and packaging group, shed 15 to 435p ahead of a visit by analysts to one of its US plants. Elsewhere, internationally traded stocks RTZ and Reuter International moved back 18 to 832p and 10 1/2 to 446 1/2 p and Carlton Communications fell 11 to 830p. And BAT Industries lost the benefit of a recommendation from one leading securities house, turning round from an early 10p rise to close 9 1/2 off at 391 1/2 p. Barclays was one of the big casualties in the FT-SE 100 as marketmakers chopped prices in disappointment that the bank had finally lost its tax battle with the state of California. Although the news is not expected to make a material difference to the bank's profits the shares fell 14 1/2 to 531 1/2 p. TSB shed 2 1/2 to 222 1/2 p ahead of tomorrow's first-half figures as Lehman Brothers reiterated its cautious stance on profits from the pick-up in the housing market. Lehman forecasts profits of Pounds 215m, against a wide range of between Pounds 195m and Pounds 235m. It acknowledges that there is mortgage volume growth but says this has been undermined by increased competition from companies such as Direct Line, subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, which outperformed its rivals with a fall of only 3 1/2 to 428 1/2 p. Lehman adds that Abbey National, which fell 9 1/2 to 405 1/2p, and Bank of Scotland, down 3 at 183p, also face tighter margins. Food manufacturer Hazlewood Foods lost ground after warning that trading in the first months of this year was 'significantly below' expectations. The shares closed 21 weaker at 122p with a hefty 4.7m shares traded. Profits came in at the lower end of market forecasts at Pounds 48.1m - a fall of 7 per cent from the previous year - mostly due to a Pounds 3m exceptional charge. Sales rose 5 per cent to Pounds 800m. The dividend also rose 5 per cent, to 6.7p. Shares in building group Tarmac closed at 144p, a rise of 7, which dealers put down to a technical bounce after recent weakness. There was also talk of one broker, believed to be NatWest Securities, moving the stock from a sell to a hold. Thorn EMI held relatively steady in a waek leisure sector. The shares fell only 5 to 1034p following the defeat of rock star George Michael in his legal battle with Sony. There were fears that if Michael was able to break his contract with Sony, other record companies would suffer a musical brain drain. Manweb continued the regional electricity companies' (recs) results season, delivering a 16 per cent rise in the dividend to 24.35p, while profits were increased from Pounds 111.2m to Pounds 126.3m. The shares firmed 2 to 681p. In a brighter day for the recs, East Midlands put on 11 at 579p and Yorkshire added 8 1/2 at 559p. Some cautious comment on British Steel's figures released on Monday, together with general profit-taking, left the shares trailing 3 to 136p after trade of 7.2m. New FT-SE 100 constituent GKN relinquished 13 to 581p as Monday's buying by index funds faded. 'Lively demand' is how one trader described the day's business in engineering group FKI. The shares improved 2 to 170p, with turnover standing at 4m by the close. Shares in freight group NFC shrugged off recent weakness to close 5 ahead at 187p after James Capel published a buy recommendation. The agency broker said the decline in the shares implied that the recent concerns over the pension credits 'are discounted and we are beginning to see signs of the new management strategy producing results'. Dealers in Eurotunnel continued to suggest that the take-up of the Channel tunnel Pounds 858m rights issue, which closes today, would be poor. The shares eased a further 7 to 276p. A big seller and news that Rentokil had made five acquisitions worth Pounds 4.3m saw the shares fall 7 1/2 to 199 1/2 p. Bank note manufacturer De La Rue stood out against the trend as a shortage of stock saw the share price squeezed 14 higher to 882p. Buying was prompted by talk of a recommendation and forecast upgrade from agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite, as well as encouraging news over the growth of 'smart' cards, manufactured by De La Rue.</p>

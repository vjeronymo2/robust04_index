			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pre-finals raid hits Rank RECENT anxiety over Rank Organisation erupted after rumours swept the market that the company would announce a rights issue with its results on Thursday. The speculation triggered a heavy fall during late trading and the shares dropped to 598p at one stage before rallying to close a net 16 off at 607p. Turnover reached an above-average 782,000 shares. An analyst said the heavy debt that Rank carries led dealers to suggest a Pounds 500m one-for-three cash call. However, he added that 'it is an easy one for bear raids', and most observers tended towards that view. There was also concern that the dividend might not be maintained. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett put the fall down to market jitters prior to the results. 'We think the dividend is safe, although we remain negative on the stock,' he said. Ms Jane Anscombe, at BZW, is a buyer of Rank and cites key fundamentals which have yet to make themselves felt on the balance sheet, such as the Mecca purchase. Utilities wanted Waters surged forward on the back of opinion polls favourable towards the Conservatives. Some brokers also recommended the stocks following the sector's recent poor showing, which put it at its lowest rating since the flotation. Panmure Gordon has changed its stance on the sector from 'neutral' to 'overweight'. Analyst Mr Alex Buck said: 'Water shares are good value at the moment. Although they continue to be governed by political factors, we are recommending them whichever party wins the election.' He is particularly keen on Wessex Water, 9 ahead at 381p, and Thames Water, up 13 at 359p. Fisons strong An early gain in Fisons was clipped back as speculation faded that Medeva might bid for the group. However, Fisons shares turned sharply higher in the afternoon to close 14 1/2 up at 349p. The stock was supported in early trading by a report in a Sunday newspaper that Medeva had lined up Fisons for a Pounds 2.5bn takeover bid. Medeva denied the talk and ended the day 7 better at 255p. The pharmaceuticals sector was strong amid a feeling that many of the stocks have been oversold recently. Glaxo rose 17 to 859p and SmithKline Beecham picked up 20 to 908p. Wellcome was helped by a statement that it had reached agreement to sell its environmental health business to Roussel Uclaf, of France, for Pounds 43m. The price was less than some analysts had hoped for but the shares, which were firm earlier, advanced on the statement to finish 22 up at 1094p. An emergency statement was put out yesterday by Racal Electronics after press reports suggested that the company was facing problems reaching the profits forecasts it made during its recent successful defence against Hillsdown Holdings. The shares tumbled in heavy trading of 20m, but rallied after the company announced that its profits 'will not be less than Pounds 50m'. They finished a penny off at 48 1/2 p. One leading electronics specialist supported the company view. 'This will blow over quite quickly. I see no reason why Racal will not make those kind of profits,' he said. Body Shop forged ahead 39 to 362p on good turnover of 1.2m, receiving a boost from a positive article in Barron's, the US business weekly. It also gained from a general rebound in the sector and a feeling that Body Shop was oversold after recent profits downgrades by various brokers. Clinton Cards jumped 14 to 79p on press speculation that WH Smith was about to launch a bid in spite of a denial by the latter yesterday. Clinton said earlier it had not received an approach and was not aware of any impending offer. WH Smith shares ended 3 higher at 461p. A downgrade on P &amp; O left the shipping group's shares 7 lower at 440p. Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, cut its 1992 profits forecast by Pounds 37m to Pounds 248m ,taking a more cautious overview of the shipping sector. Charterhouse recommended that their clients switch from P &amp; O to Eurotunnel, which gained 25 to 457p. Profit-taking and the recent 'topslice' recommendation issued by Kleinwort Benson pushed British Airways down 6 to 244p. Television issues were in good form, gaining support from a hefty note on the sector by SG Warburg Securities. Scottish Television, which the house has as a soft buy, strengthened 13 to 728p. Pre-press and printing group Wace fell sharply on market speculation following weekend press reports on IRA links with the stock market. The company took the unusual step of issuing a denial yesterday. The statement helped the shares to rally and they ended a net 11 down at 166p, after being 22 off earlier. Argos firmed 3 to 271p, but on a day when the stores sector was strong the shares underperformed the market in keen trading. The retail team at BZW has changed its recommendation on the stock from hold to sell, pointing out that Argos shares now stand at a 50 per cent prospective premium to the market. According to BZW the share price has underperformed the market by 9 per cent since the middle of last year and this trend will continue, as Argos loses its competitive edge. Among life assurance companies, Legal &amp; General touched 380p and finished 7 ahead at 375p. It announced that, in order to reduce the effect of volatile general insurance business on mainstream life and pensions profits, the company had reinsured 40 per cent of its household property structure and contents accounts. L &amp; G lost Pounds 38.3m at the half-year stage on Pounds 121.4m premium income on its UK property account, according to a spokesman. He dismissed speculation that the insurer had resorted to a reinsurance programme to avoid breaching capital ratio requirements. Textiles were ignored by a strong market as UK investment bank SG Warburg stepped back from its bullish stance. Mr Lawrence Rubin, Warburg's textile analyst, turned short-term bear on the whole sector, arguing that: 'There will be a lull in the sector's outperformance until later in 1992.' Lonrho was unable to rebound significantly from the 30 per cent fall in its shares sustained last Friday after reporting a lowered dividend and sharply reduced profits. The shares also went ex a 5p final dividend yesterday and closed 2 better at 117p. Johnson Matthey had lost ground in the wake of Lonrho's results but bounced back yesterday as investors refocused on the prospects for its contribution to the catalytic converter market. The shares rose 20 to 355p. ICI, which often tends to reflect the perceptions about the UK economy, jumped 24 to 1269p. Airtours rose 11 to 244p after the scrip issue. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, raised its profits forecast for Airtours following the news from the company last week that bookings were up by 95 per cent. Hoare is looking for Pounds 38m, up Pounds 1 1/2 m, for this year, and an extra Pounds 1m in 1993 at Pounds 43m. Granada Group rose on weekend reports that BSkyB would move into profit by March. The shares gained 7 to 225p. BT fully-paid added 6 at 324 1/2 p ahead of Thursday's finals and expected Oftel document. Analyst Mr Marshall Whiting at stockbroker Gilbert Eliot is positive on the stock, believing the cash flow to remain strong and the regulatory outlook as fair, with a service sector downturn the main cloud on the horizon. Lucas was strong on the back of a recommendation from Strauss Turnbull. It is aggressively bullish on the prospects for the year ending July 1993, and believes the company will make around Pounds 100m, compared with the market's present average forecast of Pounds 70m. Lucas moved ahead 6 to 120p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (83).

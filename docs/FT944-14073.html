			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: IMF code of economic conduct required Sir, Despite a tendency, outside as well as within the European exchange rate mechanism, for exchange rate fluctuations to lessen in recent years, Peter Norman (Economics Notebook: 'Problems with exchange rates', October 17) noted a strong desire for greater exchange rate stability at the recent IMF annual meeting - which, since few positively desire the reverse, is hardly surprising. However, such stability, which requires two or more countries to move in step with each other, has to grow from the grassroots up and cannot be imposed from above. So the IMF would be best employed using its unrivalled experience, as well as all available publicity resources, in helping to frame and to monitor an agreed international code of economic (fiscal as well as monetary) conduct. Observance of this would be a passport to sound economic management, and hence stable exchange rates, across the globe. Given this accent on the maintenance of economic law and order at national and later regional level, the rest, including the hitherto elusive goal of currency stability, will follow almost automatically. Meanwhile, the IMF, though arguably the best world central bank we have yet had with the possible exception of the Bank of England in its heyday, still has some way to go before it grows fully into that role.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (2): Firm ideas on the Duchy's EU role / Political profile of Jean-Claude Juncker When Jacques Santer takes over as president of the European Commission in January, his successor as prime minister of Luxembourg will be Jean-Claude Juncker, a politician of calibre and intellect with firm ideas on Luxembourg and Europe, and on the Grand Duchy's place in the evolving Union. Mr Juncker, currently wearing the two hats of finance and employment minister, will bring a change of style and, aged 39, an infusion of energy to the job. More private, tougher, and less of a glad-hander than the emollient Mr Santer, his main challenges will be to consolidate and develop Luxembourg's niche economy, and defend its unique position within the EU. The news that Mr Juncker would succeed Mr Santer - still to be formally confirmed, as indeed is Mr Santer's endorsement by the European Parliament in December - has been welcomed in Luxembourg. In the June general elections, the young finance minister, who is also chairman of the Christian Social People's Party (CSV), the dominant partner in the Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition which has governed the Grand Duchy since 1984, out-polled all other candidates. This, moreover, was achieved in his native south, traditionally a Socialist stronghold. He comes from the left of the CSV, and freely acknowledges that 'I could be a Socialist in the Luxembourg context.' One of the seven children of a steelworker and trade union militant, Mr Juncker trained as a lawyer at Strasbourg university, although his father had expected him to be a priest. He only practised law for five months, however, before being hand-picked by Mr Pierre Werner, the then Luxembourg leader and pioneer of European monetary union, as secretary of the CSV parliamentary group, a sort of whip's job formerly held by Mr Santer. In 1982 he became a junior minister, joining the cabinet in 1984 aged 29. The one setback in this seemingly effortless advance was a 1989 car crash which nearly killed him, but, in the judgment of one colleague, strengthened his personality and (lightly worn) religious faith. Politicians from across the spectrum, bankers and businessmen unfailingly allude to Mr Juncker's intelligence, integrity and broad mind, although some see him as 'a bit arrogant', as one foreign banker put it. Another leading banker says Mr Juncker's gift is 'the ability to grasp very practical detail as well as conceptual problems.' This makes him rather like Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission president to whom he was close, and who two years ago tried to persuade Mr Juncker to go to Brussels to a 'super-commissioner' job in charge of economic and social policy. He has also shown himself capable of taking tough decisions, including recent reforms to Luxembourg's health insurance and tax systems, and his 1991 attempt, as chairman of the 12 finance ministers under the Luxembourg Euro-presidency, to cajole a compromise on the delicate question of indirect tax harmonisation. In the EU, where he sits in two councils, he has a wealth of contacts and widespread respect. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a fellow Christian Democrat whose peer he will now be, refers to him affectionately as 'Junior'. He is forthright and sometimes heterodox. He is also a close observer of developments in partner states, especially in the Big Three of France, Germany and the UK and, according to colleagues, is not infrequently the forger of compromises between them. 'There is no other way for Luxembourg but to have a good relationship with France and Germany and our other partners,' he says. In 1996, the EU will review the Maastricht treaty and its constitutional arrangements, looking to reform decision-making and tighten intra-Union links before expanding further into east and central Europe. The apparent anomaly of a mini-state such as Luxembourg having almost equal rights with big nations, with a veto and a commissioner in Brussels, will be open to debate, along with the feasibility of a 'multi-speed' path to EU integration. Before then, pressure will grow on Luxembourg to impose a withholding tax on investment income. Powerful neighbours such as Germany believe the lack of such a tax for foreigners gives Luxembourg's finance centre an unfair advantage, attracting walls of 'their' money. The fear is that opponents of the Grand Duchy's fiscal regime will link the withholding tax issue to Luxembourg's rights within the Union. 'One of the founding principles of post-war Europe,' Mr Juncker argues as a leader of one of the founding nations of the Euro-club, 'is that we have the same rights.' He acknowledges, however, that as a small state, 'we can't make full use of those rights. We could use the veto maybe once every 10 years; everyone knows that Britain, France and Germany will always have greater rights.' But while relaxed about a dilution of blocking powers, Mr Juncker is adamant that 'we can't accept a system in which Luxembourg didn't have a commissioner.' That danger has for the moment receded, with Mr Santer at the helm in Brussels, and his successor is more worried about the 'multi-speed' Europe debate sparked off last month by the German Christian Democrats. He reasons that political union must be deepened in 1996, and that the opt-outs from Maastricht on monetary union (Emu) and social policy given to the UK have set a damaging multi-speed precedent. He believes 'our social ambition is too low in comparison to our other ambitions', for Emu and a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and eventual common defence. He does not want to see the existing 16 members - assuming Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway join in January - split up, with a so-called hard-core going ahead faster. Luxembourg, the only EU member now within the Maastricht debt, deficit and inflation criteria for Emu, would certainly be in the first wave towards a single currency. 'It would be easier for seven or eight members to go on together as a hard-core,' he says, 'but not in the really hard (policy) fields, such as defence,' Mr Juncker argues. Moreover, he does not want to see the UK, or the southern states, falling out of the Euro-convoy. A hard-core 'would make it very difficult to bring the British back to the centre of Europe,' he says, adding: 'For all the differences we have with the UK, it is a part of Europe, and it brings a dimension to Europe which I'm not prepared to lose.' On the tax issue, Mr Juncker says: 'We are no longer in the blocking field but in the proposing field.' Luxembourg has argued that a withholding tax harmonisation should extend to other OECD countries such as Switzerland and Austria, in order to prevent a capital outflow from the Union. But it is widely assumed that Luxembourg's new prime minister will start preparing for the time when the finance centre will no longer have the tax advantage, through policies which exploit other skills and advantages. 'Juncker is the man to shake Luxembourgers out of their complacency,' judges a local journalist. The prime minister-in-waiting himself says: 'We have to concentrate on the objective advantages we can offer. It's not wise to concentrate on the tax difference.'</p>

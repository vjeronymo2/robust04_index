Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OMB Circular A&hyph;110 was published in final form on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992) with the direction to Federal agencies that they were to implement the Circular by regulation. For DOE that implementation is taking place through this rulemaking. Subpart B of the Financial Assistance Rules (10 CFR Part 600) is DOE's implementation of the previous version of Circular A&hyph;110. In this rulemaking, Subpart B will be revised as a modified version of the published text of Circular A&hyph;110, as explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of this rulemaking, DOE is restructuring the Financial Assistance Rules. Current Subpart E, which is DOE's implementation of the Common Rule on Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments, is being moved to Subpart C. It contains the general administrative rules for awards to governmental entities and is being moved forward for more prominence. Current Subpart C is being moved to Subpart D. Current Subpart D is being moved to Subpart E. There are no substantive changes made by this rule in the text of these three Subparts except for changing the references due to the restructuring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Changes to 10 CFR Part 600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 600.2, 600.4, 600.5, 600.7, 600.9, 600.10, 600.14, 600.15, 600.20, 600.25, 600.26, 600.28, 600.29, 600.31, 600.32, and 600.33 of Subpart A are amended to correct the references resulting from this implementation of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and to make some minor technical changes to revise cross-references, update citations, and reflect DOE organizational changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current text of Subpart B is being revised as a modified version of OMB Circular A&hyph;110, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). A discussion of the modifications that were made to A&hyph;110 for this implementation is contained below in the section entitled ``Incorporation of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 Into the Financial Assistance Rules.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 600.200, 600.202, 600.203, 600.206 and 600.207 of Subpart C are amended to correct the references resulting from this implementation of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and to correct some existing minor errors in citations and grammar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 600.302, 600.303, 600.306 and 600.314 of Subpart D are amended to correct the references resulting from this implementation of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and to correct some existing typographical errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.441 of Subpart E is amended to correct a reference resulting from this implementation of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and to correct an existing error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Incorporation of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 Into the Financial Assistance Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the process of incorporating Circular A&hyph;110 into the Financial Assistance Rules, several types of changes have been made to the text of the Circular as it was published by OMB. Those changes are categorized and discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Provisions Involving Change From Circular to Regulatory Language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 is a directive to all Federal agencies. Consequently, specific agency terms are not used and some of the text is phrased as OMB speaking to Federal agencies. Therefore, portions of this rulemaking have been rewritten to be phrased as the DOE speaking to affected recipients. For example, the fourth sentence of the definition of ``program income'' in A&hyph;110 begins: ``Except as otherwise provided in Federal awarding agency regulations *&blank;*&blank;*.'' In this rulemaking it begins: ``Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, Program regulations, or the *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those sections of the rulemaking in which changes were made from the text of A&hyph;110 to be more appropriately phrased as a rulemaking by DOE directed at affected recipients rather than as a circular by OMB directed at Federal agencies are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

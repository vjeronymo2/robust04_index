			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Israel's interior minister resigns MR ARYEH DERI, Israel's interior minister and head of the ultra-religious Shas party - one of three partners in the Labour-led coalition of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin - yesterday submitted his resignation to the cabinet. While the move threatens the fragile coalition, it is unlikely to bring about the collapse of the government. The coalition crisis was triggered when Mrs Shulamit Aloni, the secular education minister and head of the left-wing Meretz party, refused to accept an ultimatum issued by Shas that she resign. The ultimatum was announced several days ago after remarks by Mrs Aloni which Shas claimed were offensive to the religious. Mr Deri's decision to leave the government has caused considerable anxiety among Mr Rabin and his party colleagues, who are eager to have as broad a coalition as possible behind them if Israel is asked to make tough decisions on the peace process. Mr Deri is the only member of Shas who sits in the cabinet. With Shas out of the government, Mr Rabin's coalition will rest on a minority of 56 members of parliament. An additional five MPs representing Arab parties are, however, likely to support him outside the government on peace issues, thereby ensuring that the government does not fall in any no-confidence vote. But Mr Rabin has in the past ruled out the possibility of undertaking important moves on the sensitive issue of territorial compromise while relying on the Arab parties for his majority vote in parliament. It is therefore expected that in the next two days, until Mr Deri's resignation takes effect, there will be intensive negotiations among the coalition partners to ensure the government continues in its present composition. A likely solution to the crisis is a portfolio exchange, under which Mrs Aloni would be removed from the Education Ministry and appointed to another ministry, thereby enabling Shas to remain in the coalition. Mr Rabin has said that if Meretz is seriously interested in promoting the peace process, it will give up the education portfolio. Meretz insists, however, it would be wrong to set a precedent of bowing to ultimatums issued by the ultra-religious parties. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Georgia edges closer to renewed civil conflict GEORGIA edged towards renewed civil conflict yesterday as ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia was reported to be gathering his forces in the western city of Zugdidi and opposition troops occupied Kutaisi, only 80km to the east. Reports from Tbilisi and Kutaisi of thousands of unarmed demonstrators being dispersed with overhead gunfire were unconfirmed. In Moscow, Mr Georgy Chanturia, leader of Georgia's National Democratic party and the figurehead of the opposition to the Georgian president before being imprisoned last September, said he was deeply concerned about the consequences of Mr Gamsakhurdia's return. Mr Chanturia said he did not believe Mr Gamsakhurdia would succeed in re-establishing power, and thought he would be defeated in a maximum of two weeks. 'But the tragedy is that there may be more bloodshed among innocent people,' he added. He said Kutaisi had been occupied by opposition troops commanded by Mr Jaba Ioseliani, one of the leaders of the military council currently running the country, in order to block any march on Tbilisi by Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces. The opposition leader said he did not believe that Mr Gamsakhurdia enjoyed widespread popularity even among his own Mingrel people, but was supported mainly by the 'Gamsakhurdia establishment' - local officials who risked losing their jobs following the ousting of the president. Local reports, however, said that Mr Gamsakhurdia had arrived in Zugdidi with more than 5,000 supporters in 26 buses. The situation in Georgia was further complicated yesterday by the announcement that South Ossetia, formerly an autonomous region in the north of the republic, planned to hold a referendum tomorrow on possible unification with Northern Ossetia, part of the Russian Federation. Sporadic fighting has raged between Ossetians and Georgians for more than a year.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc The French government's plan to sell 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc doubtless looked clever when it was hatched. A profits warning from the company and a looming recession in Europe now make the timing seem less than impeccable. By sending the shares lower once the sale was announced, the market was hoping to pick up new stock on the cheap. All credit to the government, then, for refusing to be hurried. With the non-voting shares back above FFr500 this week, though, it must be tempted to take what it can get. September's surprise profits warning did nothing to inspire confidence in Rhone-Poulenc's forecasting ability. Weakness in the chemicals side should hardly have come as a surprise. More worrying, though, around one-third of recent profits growth from US pharmaceuticals has come from price increases. That leaves Rhone-Poulenc exposed to President-elect Clinton's tough stance on healthcare. True, less than 25 per cent of pharmaceuticals profits come from the US. But conditions in Europe are, if anything, tougher. Even allowing for some residual benefit from restructuring, the outlook turns on Rhone-Poulenc's untested pipeline of new drugs and agrochemicals. Nor are looser ties with government likely to bring much benefit. The chairman will be elected by the board of directors rather than appointed by decree. But with the public sector still holding a comfortable majority of the votes after the sale, the scope for public sector interference is barely diminished.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets on April 20 staged an air war  exercise against the North simulating a surprise bombing on  targets with the mobilisation of more than 300 fighter-bombers,  assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes  after creating an electronic jamming in the skies above Chungju,  Yongwol, Wonju, Kanghwa Island, Pochon and Yonchon of South  Korea, according to military sources.    This exercise staged under the command of an E-3 early  warning plane was a very dangerous war gamble aimed at a  surprise strike at the northern half of Korea.    This vividly shows that the U.S. imperialists are racing  headlong along the road of confrontation and war on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

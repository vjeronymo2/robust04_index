			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: Sun downers - Health The sun may be the best tonic for the blues. But it can also cause long-term damage to those who worship it too much, in the form of premature ageing and skin cancer. 'Prevention is always better than cure,' says Dr Mike McKiernan, director of health, safety and environment at Lucas Industries in Birmingham. Dr McKiernan, who learnt of the severe damage sun can do while working in Australia, believes a current health promotion campaign from Down Under, which advises sunbathers to 'slip, slop, slap' (slip on a T-shirt, slop on some sun cream and slap on a hat) is the best pre-emptive measure for those who want to play outside when the winter gloom lifts. Using a protective sun cream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) is vital. For those with light skins, Dr John Hawk, consultant dermatologist for sun related skin diseases at the St John's Institute, recommends creams with an SPF factor of 15 to 20. People with darker skins may opt for weaker protection, though a high SPF can never hurt. Summer frolickers may choose between sun blocks based on chemical or physical protection. Those with chemical components absorb the sun's dangerous ultraviolet rays, while physical blocks contain a reflective barrier. For cosmetic reasons, most people may prefer chemically based creams, because those with reflective blocks tend to leave an opaque sheen on the skin. But for those with sensitive skin, chemically based creams may cause uncomfortable rashes. In the early days of summer, unprotected sun exposure should be limited to no more than half hour stretches, especially during the peak hours of sunlight, around noon to 2 pm in the UK. If holidaying in hotter areas like the Mediterranean, Dr McKiernan advises: 'Add an extra hour on either side. Take that siesta from 11am to 3pm.' Even one bad burn could lead to serious problems later in life. 'The skin never forgets,' says Dr McKiernan. If warts, moles or other such lesions do appear on the body, or if existing ones change shape, colour or start to itch, seek medical advice immediately.</p>

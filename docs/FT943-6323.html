			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Building societies Lloyds bank shareholders, eagerly awaiting next week's interim figures from Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, should get further pointers from today's Alliance &amp; Leicester numbers. Recent sector results have not been particularly encouraging. Coventry, the 15th largest building society, last week reported a fall in operating profits while Bristol &amp; West suffered a dip in income which was barely offset by reduced administrative expenses. Societies are under intense pressure in both the savings and mortgage markets. After seeing a net outflow of savings in the first half the sector had a better July helped by higher rates on longer term investments. But competition from unit trusts and Peps remains fierce. On the other side of the business, societies appear to have picked up market share from the banks in July but net new commitments were down on the previous month and even the optimists see only a slow and faltering recovery in mortgage demand. The resulting squeeze in margins can only accelerate consolidation in the sector. But the pressures are far from unbearable. As margins rose along with bad debts in the recession, it is only to be expected that they should fall in tandem now. With provisions tumbling, return on capital is healthy and societies remain financially strong. C&amp;G, in particular, is prepared for tough markets and, though its deposits are particularly footloose, that is because it has already proved it can compete on price. As for its growth prospects, they are still better than Lloyds', though that is not saying much.</p>

In his speech, Wang Shuangxi confirmed the province's  achievements in foreign economic and trade relations over the  last few years. On foreign economic and trade structural  reform, Wang Shuangxi stressed: First, we should seize the  opportunity to promote the province's foreign economic and trade  relations to a new height. Second, we should rationalize  relations, delegate powers to the lower levels, and exercise  graded management. Third, we should speed up foreign economic  and trade structural reform in cities and prefectures; city and  prefectural foreign trade organizations should be put under city  and prefectural management and their revenues should be  separated from the provincial-level foreign trade revenue.  Fourth, great efforts should be made to transform the foreign  trade operational mechanism and gradually to form a modern  enterprise system.    Wang Shuangxi also set demands for strengthening leadership  and transforming functions, saying: The foreign trade tasks set  by the provincial government are to ensure $1.05 billion in  foreign exchange earnings through exports this year and to  strive for $1.1 billion; to increase the number of three-capital  enterprises to 2,000 by the end of this year; to top $400  million in foreign capital actually used; to ensure $96 million  in three-capital enterprises' foreign exchange earnings  throughout exports; to ensure $40 million in the amount of  contracts for overseas projects and labor services; to obtain  three or four international aid projects; and to ensure $20  million in the amount of contracts for technology exports.    Governor Bai Qingcai and Vice Governor Xu Shanlin also  attended and addressed the meeting. The director of the  provincial foreign economic relations and trade department made  a work report at the meeting. Governor Bai Qingcai; Vice  Governor Wang Shuangxi; Ren Guoyi, vice chairman of the  provincial people's congress standing committee; and Liang Qi,  vice chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference; attended the closing  ceremony on 21 February and presented prizes to units that had  won the glorious title of best enterprise in creating foreign  exchange earnings in 1993.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (2): Plans to make city a centre of culture - Its role as an international metropolis is being resumed 1993 IS the Year of Istanbul, according to Mr Fikri Caglar, Turkey's Minister of Culture. He wants to make it an international centre of culture. Yet without government help the city is already resuming the role, as an international metropolis, which it lost after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the transfer of the Turkish capital to Ankara in 1923. A 104-year-old Englishwoman, Leila Duran, can remember arriving in Istanbul as a young bride in 1912: 'It was all French] Everyone spoke French]' Now 'everyone' speaks English: for the first time since the 1920s the city is part of the world economy, with a fully convertible currency. It contains half Turkey's manufacturing industry, and its inhabitants have incomes of Dollars 10,000 a year, five times the national average. The fall of the Soviet empire has helped the rise of Istanbul as an international economic and diplomatic centre. Istanbul businessmen commute regularly to the new Turkish- speaking capitals of Baku and Tashkent. Selling more blue jeans and leather jackets than carpets and kelims, the Grand Bazaar has become the Oxford Street of the Balkans. In certain districts, such as Nisantasi, Ortakoy and Atakoy, the stigmata of wealth have appeared: picture framers, espresso bars and Japanese restaurants. Night clubs such as Club 29, Andromeda and Fly-Inn Bar (with an aeroplane in its ceiling) are as modern as any in the west. Clothes, hair styles and music are exactly the same as in Covent Garden or Les Halles. As one young advertising executive told me, reflecting the wishes of most of his generation: 'We want everything to be standard'. Even a shop selling shirts with personalised monograms has opened near Istiklal Caddesi, the main shopping street of Istanbul. Banned to cars, the street may become as elegant as it was in the 19th century, when it was the cosmopolitan, French-speaking Grande Rue de Pera. The new wealth and confidence of Istanbul are being translated into art and culture. The annual Istanbul Book Fair, which started in 1981, now has 250 publishers' stands. Bizim Sehir (Our City - an Istanbul magazine forbidden to use its original name, Kostantiniye, because of the Greek connotation) calls it 'a tempest, a cultural outburst'. Although the 1992 fair was marred by confiscation of pro-Kurdish items, the public was so eager for books that there were queues around the block. At times, there were so many book-lovers inside that you could not see the books. As in the 19th century, there are now Istanbul publishers, and writers, working in English and French as well as Turkish. 1515, for example, specialises in works restoring Ottoman history to its proper place at the heart of Europe. They are written in French by Turkish and foreign historians such as Selim Diringil and Ethem Eldem. Eren Books has produced an excellent illustrated work by Bahettin Oztuncay, in English, on James Robertson, the Scot who in the early 1850s was one of the first photographers of Istanbul, as well as chief engraver of the Imperial Ottoman Mint. The quality of photographic reproduction is now as high as in the west. Another sign of the transformation of Istanbul is the slow emergence of an art market. There are more than 30 commercial art galleries, and many more antique shops. The annual Istanbul Antique and Decorative Arts Fair, the largest between Italy and the south-east Asia, was started eight years ago by Kusav, the Foundation for Turkish Art. It is held every autumn in the silahhane or arsenal of Yildiz, the secluded art nouveau palace complex of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, in the north of Istanbul, which is gradually being restored and opened to the public. Below frescoes of Ottoman battleships, in the scented ambience of a fashion parade, to the sound of piped Beethoven, dealers sell Ottoman turban-holders and silver snuff-boxes; spoons made in equal parts of tortoise shell, ivory and coral; or a painted wooden wall from a late 17th century ablution-room. For the first time, as in a western metropolis, collecting has become a fashionable pastime. There is a new passion for Islamic and Ottoman art. Most wealthy Istanbulus prefer fabrics from London and Paris. However, traditional Turkish colours and patterns are beginning to be used, to remarkable effect, in the tiles made by Gorbon or the fabrics of Aykut Hamzagil. Even Istanbul's gleaming modern fast food outlets sell as much Turkish as American food. Love of Istanbul is helping to transform its millionaires into cultural entrepreneurs. Mrs Cigdem Simavi, wife of a prominent former newspaper proprietor, is director of Kusav, the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts started by Dr Nejat Eczacibasi, owner of Turkey's largest pharmaceutical company. She has helped to organise the Istanbul International Festival of Music for the past 20 years. Recently, Kusav founded the Istanbul International Biennial of modern art, in the Fezhane, a long low red building trapped between the roar of the traffic on the Ataturk bridge and the stench of the refuse in the Golden Horn. Where once fezes were manufactured for the citizens of Constantinople, such wonders as a row of blue baths from Belgium, mini-priapuses from Turkey and trolleys of dirty linen from Bulgaria were installed. Will they really help the declared aim of the government and the foundation to make Istanbul 'a capital of world culture'? Strangely, there were no exhibits from countries in Istanbul's historic hinterland of the Middle East. Up the Bosporus, in a wooden mansion in Buyukdere, is the Sadberk Hanim Museum, established with the help of Koc Holding, the largest company in Turkey. Named after the wife of the head of the family, Vehbi Koc, it is run by their daughter, Sevgi Gonul. Its splendid collection of antiquities ranges from neolithic goddesses to Byzantine ear-rings, from Hellenistic and Roman gold diadems (I counted at least 10) to Iznik tiles as good as those in Topkapi Palace itself. This privately owned and funded museum provides a better view of daily life, and domestic rituals in Ottoman Istanbul than any other museum. On display at the Sadberk Hanim are examples of the embroidered silk envelopes in which letters were sent, the round tasselled velvet coverlet which a coffee-pourer wore over the left shoulder, and a bed on which the son of a wealthy family was circumcised. For good luck the bed was festooned with embroidered towels shaped into butterflies and roses. The restyling of Istanbul, its growing resemblance to a modern European city, are accompanied, simultaneously, by its destruction. Both effects have the same cause: prosperity. As the Turkish proverb goes: 'He who holds the honey-pot is bound to lick his fingers' and, despite public protests, planning restrictions are regularly flouted. Skyscrapers and housing estates are closing in on the Bosporus and the Golden Horn. As if playing a game of architectural grandmother's footsteps, every summer the visitor returns, they have moved nearer. One of the great architectural crimes of the last five years has been the construction of a glass and concrete hotel, sprawling insolently above, and dwarfing, the 19th-century grandeur of Dolmabahce Palace. Some bedrooms have been especially decorated to make Japanese businessmen feel at home. Behind Istanbul's smart modern facade, the city is torn by an economic and demographic explosion without parallel since its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Owing to immigration from Anatolia, the population has doubled in the past seven years, from 5m to more than 10m; and still the Anatolians come. The 50,000 or so Istanbulus whose families have lived there for many generation and who speak with a traditional Istanbul accent feel like a hunted minority. The pollution caused by traffic and industry is so bad that, in most districts, people need air filters in their apartments. Some 2m inhabitants are said to have no running water. Can the city survive its own growth rate? Professor Nurettin Sozen, mayor of Greater Istanbul, has plans for a metro, an improved sewage system and the cleaning of the Sea of Marmara. Realists urge an entrance tax, or a programme to relocate industry to the east. In the mayhem of modern Istanbul, it is not surprising that some turn to fundamentalist Islam. In November 1992, the religious Welfare Party won four mayoral seats in Istanbul. The victory was immediately dismissed by members of Istanbul's modern elite as of no significance. But Mr Cuneyt Ayral, devotee of the old and a businessman in the new Istanbul, says: 'As long as Istanbul appears paved with gold, the city's fate is sealed.' Philip Mansel is the author of Sultans in Splendour: the Last Years of the Ottoman World, Andre Deutsch, 1988, Pounds 17.95. He is currently working on a history of Istanbul under the Ottoman sultans.</p>

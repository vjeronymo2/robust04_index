			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Police say the killing of 28-year-old Yosi  Zandani in Bene 'Ayish near Gedera was apparently a terrorist  attack. Zandani was found strangled and stabbed to death early  yesterday morning. A police spokesman said a letter in Arabic  claimed the murder had been carried out to avenge the death of a  Gaza Arab.    Yitzhaq Rottenberg, who died after being wounded in a  terrorist attack on Tuesday, will be laid to rest this  afternoon. [passage omitted]    A German tourist has been seriously injured in the head in a  stone-throwing attack in Qalqilyah. The 43-year-old woman and  her daughter, who was slightly hurt, mistakenly drove into the  town yesterday, and her car was pelted with rocks. She was  taken unconscious to Beilinson Hospital's neurological unit.</p>

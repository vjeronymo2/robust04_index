			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Volvo board to consider cuts plan next month VOLVO, the Swedish auto-motive group, is losing SKr2bn (Dollars 368m) annually and is preparing a crisis package to cut production capacity, Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said. The package incudes closing two of Volvo's three Swedish car assembly plants and reducing costs by matching supply more closely with demand. The board will consider the contraction programme next month. Mr Gyll also says Volvo cannot afford to increase wages next year. The company's finances deteriorated this autumn, although had not been affected by the turbulence on the international exchanges. In August, Volvo reported an operating losses of Skr835m for the first six months. Mr Gyll told local business leaders in Gothenburg that even if the whole of Volvo's car assembly production in Sweden were concentrated at its Gothenburg plant, it would still suffer over-capacity. This was because demand for its models in the domestic market had fallen by two-thirds. 'The good times at the end of the 1980's will not return,' he said. MODO, the Swedish forestry group, suffered a SKr811m loss (after financial items) for the first eight months of the year. This contrasts with a SKr311m profit in the same period of 1991. In the second four months of the year, the loss increased to SKr476m from the SKr335m deficit made in the January to April period. In a forecast for the rest of 1992, Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive, said unsettling market conditions would continue and this would mean a continuing large deficit for MoDo. TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, made a small profit (after financial items) of SKr11m for the first eight months of the year, compared with a SKr680m profit for the same period in 1991. Sales rose slightly to SKr14.96bn from SKr14.11bn, but this was due to the consolidation of its acquisition of Munksjo at the end of last year. UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second-largest banking group, said it would issue a statement to the stock exchange today following a television report claiming it plans to dismiss 15 per cent of its staff, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The bank expects to incur losses of about DKr2bn (Dollars 357m) this year.</p>

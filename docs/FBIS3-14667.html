This is due to the fact  that the lives of the Israeli occupiers in the Strip turned has  into a nightmare as a result of extensive and effective  Palestinian resistance operations, and the Palestinian people's  confrontation of the occupation troops as one rank.    All of a sudden, the situation changed completely, for the  secret Oslo talks have produced an agreement called the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. Then, as a result of the Palestinian  side's commitment to halting struggle, the Palestinian people  found themselves chased by the same Israeli troops they used to  pursue. Thus, the number of Palestinians either killed or  wounded begun to increase rapidly.    Israel has declared openly that its troops have the right to  end terrorism and destroy terrorists. By this, it means the  intifadah and its people. It implemented this on the ground by  having its regular forces and the underground units began to  fire indiscriminately on everyone.    In fact, Israel claimed that it was helping the Palestinian  side, which was involved in signing the Oslo agreement, to  restore security and stability to the occupied territories. The  settlers also moved and conducted patrols. The killings  escalated in a manner that raised the concern of the Palestinian  people both inside and outside the occupied territories. Later,  Israel perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that shook  the world. It repeated this action by perpetrating the Jabaliya  camp massacre in the Gaza Strip yesterday when the underground  units, or the death squads, fired at a number of intifadah  youths, killing six and wounding many others. Even the Fatah  Hawks themselves have not escaped the Israeli escalation, for  several of them were either killed or wounded.    It is clear to every Palestinian and Arab citizens, as well  as to any international observer, that Israel used the Oslo  agreement as a pretext to settle accounts with the Palestinian  people. It has exploited the grave imbalance this agreement has  created in the Palestinian and Arab arenas as a result of the  Palestinian side's deviation from Arab consensus and the bases  of the peace process, and its involvement in a distorted partial  settlement. This has opened an endless labyrinth of darkness.  The Gaza-Jericho accord has not led to Israel's withdrawal from  Gaza or from Jericho, but to the tightening of the Zionist grip  around the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. Moreover, the  negotiations stumbled and the Israeli withdrawal seemed to be a  very complicated and difficult process.    After Gaza and Jericho, where the situation is becoming  intensely volatile and the suffering is growing, the Israelis  dragged the Palestinian side into discussions on the security of  the city of Hebron. The security of Ramallah, Tulkarm, Janin,  or Nabulus will also rise in the future. Amid these divided  talks, which are very far from the crux of the peace process and  its bases and objectives, the Israelis have succeeded in  distracting the world's attention from the true nature and  contents of the conflict. The issue has changed from one of a  people whose land was occupied and rights were usurped, into an  issue of security, which Israel proposes to tackle by conducting  patrols, of course under its officers command, by the Israeli  Army and the proposed Palestinian police.    UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which  were  adopted as a basis for the peace process, are clear and call for  Israel's full withdrawal, and not for the establishment of a  limited autonomy. The Madrid conference was held on clear bases  and on the land-for-peace formula in order to achieve a just and  comprehensive settlement on all the fronts of the conflict.  Syria, supported by the Arabs, has always abided by the demand  of a just and comprehensive solution and a full Israeli  withdrawal. However, the Palestinian side's deviation from the  bases of the meetings of Damascus, Beirut, and Amman, and from  the agreed conditions of peace, has not only weakened the Arab  position, but it has also brought catastrophes to the  Palestinian people, increased Israeli intransigence, and  involved the Palestine question in endless labyrinths.  Certainly, Israel's massacres will not end with the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre or yesterday's massacre in the Gaza  Strip. The Palestinian people will be exposed to further  catastrophes and setbacks under the cover of futile negotiations  that will bring nothing to the Palestinians, regardless of the  names they take, other than entrenching occupation and  usurpation.    Getting rid of this Israeli labyrinth cannot take place by  going deeper into it, but by returning to the pillars of the  just and comprehensive Arab peace, Arab unanimity, and to full  coordination with the brothers, by abiding by the UN Security  Council resolutions and the agreed-upon bases of the peace  process, and by uniting the Palestinian people inside and  outside the occupied territories.</p>

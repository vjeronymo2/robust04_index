			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW BREAKS 6-DAY RALLY, ENDING OFF 4.11  </P> <P> Wall Street's Dow Jones industrials snapped a six-session winning streak  Wednesday, pulling back from their post-crash highs on a lower dollar, surging  oil prices and weak bond prices for much the day.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index, which had advanced in every session since last  Tuesday, finished down 4.11 points at 2,338.21.  </P> <P> Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New  York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 753 up, 718 down and 518 unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 215.64 million shares, up from  194.05 million Tuesday.  </P> <P> "This is a dollar-caused decline," said Edward Shopkorn, general partner in  charge of institutional equities at Mabon Nugent. "But then, nothing goes  straight up forever. The market could stand to give some back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> January Gains  </P> <P> Treasury bond prices also were weak much of the day as the bond market waited  for the government to outline its quarterly refunding plan. But the benchmark  30-year bond ended slightly higher, lowering its yield to 8.81% from 8.82%,  after the Treasury unveiled plans that were much as expected.  </P> <P> A 48-cent jump in U.S. crude oil futures, buoyed by higher heating oil prices,  also burdened the equities market. Higher oil prices tend to lift costs  throughout the economy.  </P> <P> The Dow blue chip index has gained more than 100 points since last Tuesday as  institutional investors returned to the equities market in force.  </P> <P> For all of January, the Dow rose 173.57 points. That marked one of the most  dramatic gains for January in recent years, surpassed only by a 262.09-point  jump at the start of 1987.  </P> <P> The rally was due in large part to the dollar's strength and firmer bond  prices. But "the dollar has been hitting resistance on the chart and that made  bonds pause and the stock market pause," explained Morry Markovitz, president  of Mercury Management Associates.  </P> <P> Markovitz said he believed that the recent stock market rally was no  flash-in-the-pan. "We're in the early stages of the next bull market and blue  chips at some point will pass the leadership to the smaller stocks."  </P> <P> Share prices ended generally higher on both the American Stock Exchange and in  the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> However, Andrew McVeigh, director of research at Rodman &amp; Renshaw, said  that he was worried by the unevenness of the market's advance. "This rally has  been very segmented in that some of the over-the-counter stocks have moved, the  Dow stocks have moved, but most in the middle tier have not."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compaq Climbs  </P> <P> He added that he was bothered by the lack of retail participation. "If we're  going to take any shots at the highs, you need the retail investors," McVeigh  said.  </P> <P> Brokers also noted caution over recent evidence of continued strength in the  economy.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported in the morning that the index of leading  economic indicators rose 0.6% in December, outpacing many advance estimates.  </P> <P> On Friday, monthly statistics from the Labor Department are expected to show a  good-sized gain in payroll employment for January.  </P> <P> Compaq Computer climbed 3 1/2 to 73 1/4. The company reported fourth-quarter  earnings of $2.18 a share, against $1.25 in the like period a year earlier.  </P> <P> West Point-Pepperell gained 2 1/2 to 53 1/4. Farley Inc. increased its offer  for the company from $48 a share to $52 a share.  </P> <P> Circle K, which said it retained a merchant banking firm to study ways to  increase the return to its shareholders, rose 2 1/4 to 14 3/4.  </P> <P> Ryder System gained 1 1/8 to 28 1/8. The company said it plans to buy back as  much as 15% of its stock and may sell four divisions, including its insurance  management services operation.  </P> <P> Among actively traded blue chip and technology issues, Digital Equipment rose 1  1/8 to 119 3/4; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained 5/8 to 32 1/8, and  Ford Motor was up 1/2 at 55 1/8.  </P> <P> But International Business Machines dropped 1 to 129 5/8 and General Electric  was off 1/8 at 48 1/4.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </P> <P> MCI Communications added 1/2 to 25 5/8 as the most active issue in the  over-the-counter market. MCI posted substantially higher fourth-quarter  operating earnings.  </P> <P> The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities ended the day at 2,916.890, down 0.371,  from Tuesday's close.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped 0.16 to  166.47.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.33 to 343.87, and S&amp;P's  500-stock composite index was down 0.38 at 297.09.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 1.93 to  403.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at  323.24, up 0.22.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stock prices closed sharply lower Wednesday on worries that a  declining yen would result in inflation and higher domestic interest rates. The  Nikkei 225-share index fell 220.62 points, or 0.70%, to 31,360.68.  </P> <P> A brief surge on Wall Street picked the London stock market up off the floor on  Wednesday, but the market still closed lower, breaking a string of four  straight rises. London shares were hit early in the session by investors taking  profits from the surge in prices in recent days. But the Financial Times  100-share index bounced off the day's lows to end 12.1 points down at 2,039.7.  </P></p>

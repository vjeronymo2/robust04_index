			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / MGN in talks with founder of Independent newspaper Detailed negotiations are under way between Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Andreas Whittam-Smith, principal founder of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, is interested in taking a significant minority stake in Newspaper Publishing, which publishes The Independent, but no agreement has been reached on how large the stake should be or the precise terms. Although the popular newspaper group has developed a good working relationship with El Pais and La Repubblica, the main shareholders in Newspaper Publishing, it is unlikely that a formal consortium can be put together before next week. MGN, whose share price has been rising and yesterday closed at 199p, is looking for a long-term relationship with a trade investor. For MGN, which does not want to get directly involved in running the broadsheet titles, a condition of a deal would be that Mr Whittam-Smith, who is seen to represent both the spirit and philosophy of the paper, should remain as editor-in-chief. Newspaper Publishing had pre-tax losses of around Pounds 486,000 on turnover of Pounds 81m in the year to September, although losses are rising because of promotional spending. This year losses are heading for Pounds 8m, according to some estimates, and even that assumes a cash injection of at least Pounds 15m. It was being suggested last night that if the consortium did put a deal together, it would amount to acting in concert and a bid might have to be made for the entire company. Meanwhile Mr Tony O'Reilly, chief executive of Heinz and chairman of Independent Newspapers in Ireland, is still seriously interested in a large minority stake. An indicative offer has been received by Mr Ian Hay Davison, the Newspaper Publishing chairman, from Mr O'Reilly. The preliminary offer is in the region of Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m for between 25 and 29.9 per cent of the company. It is believed that Mr O'Reilly, who would prefer a minority stake, is prepared in certain circumstances to bid for the whole company. He has long wanted the Independent group in Ireland to expand into the national newspaper market in the UK.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 Apr (PL) -- The resources that Cuba needs  to secure to implement many economic activities and that it  needs for the next sugar harvest will depend on the fulfillment  of the sugar plan, Carlos Lage, secretary of the Council of  Ministers, has said.    During an analysis of the current harvest in three eastern  provinces, Lage, who is also member of the Politburo of the  Communist Party of Cuba, said that the final stage of this  harvest (extended until June in certain regions of the island)  demands great determination and strength from all workers,  according to GRANMA.    "As never before, we need to meet our sugar production  target  [comprometida]," said Lage, who referred to the serious and  costly limitations imposed by a lack of certain basic inputs,  including spare parts for sugar harvest machinery, such as cane  harvester-loaders [combinadas caneras y alzadoras].    After explaining the causes for the reduction in electricity  production in the country, he urged technicians, specialists,  and leaders of the sector to seek local alternatives and  solutions to maintain, even under the worst of conditions, an  acceptable supply of sugar cane for the industry.    Cuba last year registered low sugar production (4.2 million  tons) due to weather conditions and other problems, and is  intent on increasing production to market and barter it abroad  for multiple material resources that are indispensable to  improving the economy.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusaf forges ahead with giant smelter ALUSAF is rushing to bring the biggest aluminium smelter in the western world into production ahead of schedule, even though the South African group is forecasting market conditions will remain severely depressed until 1997 or 1998. Mr Fred Roux, chairman, said in London yesterday that the feasibility study on the 466,000-tonnes-a-year smelter had assumed that supply and demand in the world aluminium market would return to balance in 1995-96, at which time London Metal Exchange prices would return to Dollars 1,650 a tonne (in 1993 prices). 'We still believe those prices are attainable but the recovery may have been deferred for two years,' he added. Nevertheless, Alusaf hopes to start up the smelter, now called Hillside, five months ahead of schedule in June 1995 and hit full-capacity working 12 months after that. The group would save R2m (Dollars 437,000) a day on interest payments during the construction phase, Mr Roux pointed out. He also revealed that Alusaf would save at least R700m (Dollars 153m) on the original R6.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn) cost. Equipment suppliers were quoting prices 20 to 30 per cent below those they supplied 18 months ago for the feasibility study. At that time three new aluminium smelters, all using the same technology supplied by Pechiney of France, were being constructed. Today only Alusaf is building a new plant and virtually every other project in the world has been either cancelled or shelved. Mr Roux said he suspected many suppliers were quoting below cost. 'It is a question of survival for many of them.' He said savings would be used to cut the debt being raised for the smelter and consequently lower its production costs so that it would break even at prices below Dollars 800 a tonne. At Dollars 1,050 a tonne the smelter would generate surplus cash. Last night aluminium for delivery in three months closed on the LME at Dollars 1,062 and analysts suggested that most smelters were not even covering their cash production costs at that level. Alusaf is 48 per cent owned by Gencor and 34 per cent by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa. South African financial institutions own the rest. The company will be floated on the Johannesburg stock exchange when aluminium market conditions improve. Mr Roux said Alusaf had signed a 10-year supply contract for alumina, the essential raw material for aluminium smelting, with Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, and a 15-year contract with Alcoa of Australia (owned by Western Mining of Australia and Alcoa of the US). In return the two organisations would take about half the new smelter's aluminium output. Alusaf had also signed a five-year contract, starting in 1994, with Alussuise to supply alumina to the existing 170,000-tonnes-a-year smelter at Richards Bay. This would replace complex arrangements made when trade with South Africa was subject to sanctions. Mr Roux said Alusaf was also negotiating a management contract with Pechiney to replace the simple technology agreement.</p>

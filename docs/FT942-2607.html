			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consumers should benefit more on electricity prices Sir, Michael Smith's well-informed article, 'Don't shoot, I'm only the regulator' (June 15), pointed out the importance of Professor Stephen Littlechild's Distribution Price Review to electricity users. This is the opportunity to ensure a more equitable balance of financial benefits between shareholders and consumers. While there has been a marked improvement in the standard of service and supply reliability, non-investing consumers have enjoyed comparatively limited financial benefit. The regional electricity companies have clung to the upper limits of thc price formula rather than pass on some of their cost savings to the consumer. Consumer groups realise there is scope for a fall in prices of 15 per cent or more. Privatisation is improving the consumer's lot but, as the RECs with their newly found independence have chosen not to act, the regulator is capable of putting matters right - with the full support of consumers, and very likely the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

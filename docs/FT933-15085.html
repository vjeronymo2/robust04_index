			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Agusta losses widen to L858bn AGUSTA, the Italian helicopters group which is part of the Efim state holding company in liquidation, saw losses increase sharply to L858bn (Dollars 579m) last year, up from L182bn in 1991. It lost almost one lira for every lira received in sales which amounted to L937bn, up 39 per cent on 1991. Agusta's losses lend weight to the view that it represents the most serious of Efim's problems. The company is being run by Finmeccanica, the state-controlled engineering and aerospace concern, pending a final decision on its fate. Agusta, which collaborates with Westland of the UK on the EH101 helicopter project, said its order book was worth L4,800bn. Gross operating profits were L41bn last year. However, earnings had been affected by heavy debts, high interest rates and currency movements. Agusta's net indebtedness amounted to about L280bn last year. The company lost about L180bn because of currency factors linked to the fall in the lira's value. About L50bn was written off to cover early retirements, with the workforce falling by more than 1,500 people to 6,826, while other unspecified losses amounted to L260bn. Merloni, the Italian white goods group best known for its Ariston brand, has taken majority control of two Turkish white goods producers owned by the Vestel group. The acquisition follows the purchase in June 1992 of an opening 25 per cent stake in the companies, along with options to buy at least 26 per cent more within two years. Merloni is paying Dollars 8.5m for a further 29 per cent of Pekel Teknik and Pekel Pazarlama and is investing Dollars 14m in a Pekel Teknik rights issue.</p>

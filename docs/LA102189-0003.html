			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART AND AIDS EDUCATION  </P> <P> Art potentially educates. Art has played an invaluable role in the ongoing  battle to fight AIDS. Now the National Endowment for the Arts "will be forced  to establish internal standards to red-flag those grant applications whose  contents may be controversial" ("Paranoia, Confusion Left in Wake of Arts  Debate," Oct. 10).  </P> <P> This red-flagging will undoubtedly encompass all artistic endeavors that  explore the drama of AIDS. Once again, opportunities to educate the American  public about AIDS have been squelched because of insidious homophobia.  </P> <P> Art potentially saves lives. Censorship is a killer.  </P> <P> MICHAEL KEARNS, Artists Confronting AIDS, Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pledge on Scottish Gas and Telecom THE Liberal Democrats would create a Scottish Telecom and Scottish Gas by breaking up the privatised monopolies if they were elected. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the move would be part of a pledge to stimulate competition included in the manifesto launched yesterday. The new Scottish utility companies would not involve re-nationalisation. Shareholders had been given adequate warning. 'The prospectus made it quite clear the Liberal Democrats were committed to breaking up British Gas,' Mr Bruce declared. Parts of British Steel would be transferred to Scottish ownership. The manifesto mentions development of a site at Hunterston, which it says has the potential to be a centre for an integrated Scottish steel industry. Home rule for Scotland is a central issue in the manifesto, though Mr Bruce stressed Scottish voters would be paying attention to questions affecting the whole UK. The Liberal Democrat proposals for home rule were part of a thorough reform of the political system, and so would guarantee fair representation for Scotland. Other proposals include a Scottish ministry of justice and a Scottish environmental protection agency.</p>

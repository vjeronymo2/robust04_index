			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (5): Newcomer with a strong base - Profile, AssiDoman is Sweden's fourth largest forestry group AssiDoman has just joined the branks of Europe's top ten forestry groups, and Lennart Ahlgren, its president, is clearly relishing every minute of the experience. Not only does he display an ebullient confidence in wood as a raw material - 'I firmly believe this is a product for the future' - but he has a clear strategic vision of the group's development. 'Our objective is to be Europe's leading company in the fields of packaging paper, paper-based packaging and sawn timber,' he states. Lest anyone should doubt him, Mr Ahlgren has been busy even in the few weeks since AssiDoman emerged in its current form, following a state-orchestrated merger and privatisation. It has made a successful bid for Ncb, a partially state-owned forestry group, and acquired a Swedish saw-milling operation. Further acquisitions would seem only to be a question of time, not least because the company wants to make good use of its financial strength to back its strategic ambitions. A lot has happened in a short time. A few months ago, AssiDoman did not even exist. It was formed at the start of the year from the merger of two wholly state-owned forestry groups, Assi and Doman. In March it gained new 590,000 shareholders when the state sold out 49 per cent of its holding, garnering SKr7.6bn in Sweden's largest ever privatisation. When shares in the group began trading last month, its market capitalisation amounted to SKr16bn. With 1993 sales of SKr14.6bn, AssiDoman is Sweden's fourth largest forestry group after Stora, SCA and MoDo. It claims to be the world's largest private forest owner, with 3.4m hectares of productive forest land. It also ranks as Europe's fourth largest producer of sawn goods, with annual output of 950,000 cubic metres, and one of Europe's five biggest producers of corrugated board. Operations span nine European countries, with 5,000 of the group's 12,000 employees based outside Sweden. Mr Ahlgren says the emphasis on packaging and large forest holdings provide the group with considerable resilience in an industry notorious for its cyclical peaks and troughs. But this is just one aspect of a strategy based on high-quality products, added value, and greater material processing. The starting point for the strategy is virgin fibre, which is hardly surprising given the company's extensive forestry reserves. 'We will concentrate on virgin fibre and will invest in existing mills in Sweden to upgrade production,' says Mr Ahlgren. In fact, the Ahlgren philosophy can be summarised by the word 'concentration' - concentration on virgin fibre, concentration on sawn goods, concentration on packaging and packaging material. 'We won't get involved in printing and writing papers or tissue,' he stresses. The other priority is financial stability. The group has a healthy cash flow, and an equity-to-assets ratio which, at around 50 per cent, is surpassed by few forestry groups worldwide. Results are on rising trend, with a profit of between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.5bn expected for this year, after last year's SKr876m. Without the strong financial base, it is unlikely that the group would be emphasising its expansion strategy so forcefully. The programme can be summarised as follows: In Sweden, the company will continue to build up its saw-mill operations, both by investment and acquisitions, aiming to reach an annual production level of 1.1m to 1.2m cubic metres in the next two years. In Europe, where many of the packaging operations are based, the group wants to be close to its markets and is looking to bolster its position in segments like corrugated board. Although it has a relatively strong market position in the UK, Danish and Swedish markets, its share in countries like France and Germany is low. The acquisition of Ncb - a packaging company - will not leave much of a dent in AssiDoman's finances, as the bid only valued the company at some SKr1.4bn. But most analysts believe Mr Ahlgren is hatching something bigger, including, possibly, a strike at his former company, Korsnas, where he was managing director for seven years. Though coy on the subject, Mr Ahlgren admits there would be a 'natural overlap' with Korsnas, which is also strong in packaging and sawn timber. There have also been suggestions that the group might be interested in buying MoDo Packaging from MoDo.</p>

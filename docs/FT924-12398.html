			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / A business sings the blues: IBM must sharpen its marketing edge if it is to recover Once upon a time, long before the invention of computers, the eager salesmen of fast-growing International Business Machines would gather of a morning to sing uplifting company songs before they hit the road. If the tradition still existed today, they might be chanting laments. For IBM has just unveiled a dismal set of third-quarter earnings which has shocked Wall Street, sent its share price plunging, and raised new questions over the speed and toughness of the cultural revolution supposedly shaking up the world's largest computer company. IBM made profits of a mere Dollars 86m, or 15 cents a share, from normal operations in the three months from July to September, on revenues of Dollars 14.7bn. And after taking special charges for plant closures and early retirement programmes it reported a net loss of Dollars 2.78bn. The figures were below the most pessimistic forecasts of Wall Street analysts who immediately scrambled to reduce their estimates of IBM's future profits. They now expect it to report operating earnings of Dollars 4.00-Dollars 4.50 a share in 1992, compared to previous forecasts of Dollars 5-Dollars 6, while 1993 has been lowered from Dollars 7-Dollars 8 to Dollars 6-Dollars 7. Even more embarrassing for the company has been the performance of its share price, which has fallen some 12 per cent since last Thursday's earnings announcement to the level of a decade ago. So great is the market's distrust that once-mighty IBM, the bluest of blue chip companies, is having to deny that it plans to cut its Dollars 4.84 a share annual dividend. Because of the share price drop, the dividend now yields a hefty and very attractive 7 per cent - by far the highest pay-out of any of the companies which make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average and only a little short of the yield on the safest of investments, long-term US government bonds. The dividend seems secure - at least for now. The company says its free cash flow - cash available for distribution to shareholders - will be higher than last year's Dollars 2.1bn and is expected to cover the dividend, though that is before the cost of an employee buy-out programme and funding for its growing finance business. Even if conditions deteriorated over coming months the company's 14.4 per cent debt-to-equity ratio on the non-finance side of its business at the end 1991 means it could easily borrow to sustain the dividend. That, however, might not help its credit rating, which at present retains the top, triple-A bill of health from the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's. IBM would surely pull out all the stops to maintain the dividend. For one thing, the size of the pay-out is helping prop up the company's share price. For another, its public commitment to maintaining the dividend means it could not reverse its position without provoking an even greater loss of investor confidence. Yet IBM has had a nasty habit of dashing investors' hopes since the mid-1980s with a series of much-trumpeted reorganisations which have failed to improve its financial performance. 'The market is simply fatigued with the company,' says one observer. The crucial question for investors now is whether IBM's latest shake-up  - its most dramatic yet - can finally produce a sustained improvement in earnings, boosting both the share price and the group's return on equity. The latter has languished in recent years at 15 per cent or less, but the company aims to raise it to 18 per cent by 1994. In short, is IBM an attractive recovery stock, seriously undervalued, or a flailing bureaucracy, with the wrong product mix, doomed to underperform the market? The answer depends partly on a factor beyond the company's control: the state of the world economy. The US is growing extremely weakly, while Europe and Asia, which produce more than half the group's revenues, are slowing down. IBM has blamed part of its third-quarter difficulties on the general downturn in Europe and, more specifically, on the wild gyrations in the region's currencies at the end of September, which should not be a recurrent event. 'People just stopped buying things,' says Mr Frank Metz, chief financial officer. Yet IBM's fate depends largely on the long-term impact of the radical shake-up unveiled last December by Mr John Akers, the chairman, and designed to overcome the structural weaknesses revealed by the computer revolution of the 1980s. IBM, which has always dominated the market for large, mainframe computers (it still accounts for over 60 per cent of global sales) was slow to recognise the implications of micro-processor breakthroughs which greatly enhanced the power of desktop computers and encouraged companies to substitute networks of smaller machines for big, central processing units. And in an era of extremely rapid technological advance, where personal computer product development cycles can be as little as eight months, its cumbersome, centralised bureaucracy could not respond fast enough to market forces. It also seriously misjudged the economic outlook, expecting a continuation of its robust sales growth in the 1980s. When the US economy slowed down, it was left saddled with an extremely expensive cost base and a company tradition, dating from the days of the singing salesmen, of no redundancies. The Akers revolution involves replacing the centralised structure with a looser-knit federation of 13 businesses: nine in manufacturing and four marketing operations serving different regions of the globe. The idea is to make the operations more entrepreneurial by pushing power down the line. The businesses each have their own financial targets, have more freedom to set their own prices, and compete against rival IBM operations, while pay is being more closely tied to performance. The strategy also involves shifting the composition of IBM's business, making it less dependent on computer hardware, which as an industry the company expects to grow more slowly over the coming five years than software and services (in other words, providing solutions to computing problems). Third, the shake-up means sharply cutting IBM's bloated operating expenses. Industry observers say the aim is to cut sales, general and administrative expenses from about 33 per cent of revenues now to about 25 per cent by 1994 through measures such as job cuts and more efficient use of work space. So far the jury is out on both the cost-cutting and revenue-boosting efforts. The company now expects to shed 40,000 jobs this year through a huge employee buy-out programme, double what it expected at the start of the year. It is the company's largest annual reduction - about 12 per cent of the labour force - and means it has shed some 25 per cent of its workers since 1985. But some observers fear that the market is facing such severe competition that falling prices could outstrip the impact of this fat-shedding and force IBM into faster, more brutal job cuts. The problem is that the group's paternalistic tradition eschews forced redundancies. It is one of the most cherished parts of the group's inbred culture, with its laudable emphasis on 'respect for the individual'. Once a member of the IBM family, always a member. That policy is already under immense strain. Rival computer companies with similar ideals, such as Digital Equipment, have already been forced to abandon them. And at IBM 'no lay-offs' means that formerly high-flying salesmen might find themselves reassigned to much more menial tasks, albeit on their former salaries. What could prove crucial, but remains unclear, is how much freedom the 13 new entrepreneurial businesses will be given to set their own staffing levels. A recent internal company memo suggests they have been given greater powers to recommend job cuts, though these would still have to be approved by the group's four-person management committee. And the immediate outlook on the sales side of the picture is far from bright, because of industry-wide weak demand and excess manufacturing capacity which is putting severe pressure on prices. It is reckoned that IBM's gross profit margins on sales have dropped from 57 per cent three years ago to about 44 per cent now, and may fall to 40 per cent next year. In mainframes, still the company's bread and butter, IBM is now expecting a small drop in revenues for the year, despite the introduction in 1991 of its important new ES 9000 range, and rivals Hitachi of Japan and Amdahl of the US are offering buyers huge discounts. A much larger question hangs over the long-term future of the mainframe business. Some analysts argue that the global trend away from mainframes and towards smaller, cheaper networked systems will accelerate and simply erode the group's revenue base. Others maintain that the market for big machines will grow for the foreseeable future, albeit at a slow pace. IBM's hardware product range can boast some significant successes, such as its AS-400 mini-computers, which have been steadily gaining market share, and its RS/6000 work stations. Its software and services businesses are also enjoying good growth. But it still has particularly serious problems in personal computers, where barriers to entry are now extremely low and products have become commodity items. IBM has been hammered over the past two years by much fast-moving manufacturers such as Dell Computer, offering inexpensive machines through innovative sales channels. IBM sales in the US have fallen sharply,in part because of its relatively high prices and partly because buyers were waiting for an important roll-out of new IBM products this autumn. Personal computers accounted for two-thirds of the company's 6 percentage point drop in hardware gross profit margins during the third quarter. Yet IBM is now fighting back. Last month, as part of the entrepreneurial restructuring, it separated IBM PC from the rest of its personal systems business. The idea is for the Dollars 7bn turnover company to be as flexible and aggressive as its rivals. After a flurry of product launches in September, it yesterday rolled out some particularly important offerings in the market for low-cost personal computers, which it is calling ValuePoint. Customer reactions to these products in the final quarter of this year and the first half of next will provide an important indicator as to whether IBM really is becoming entrepreneurial or finding it impossibly hard to break free of its encrusted corporate culture. If it proves it can, the potential for profits growth over the medium term could be substantial. But success is far from certain. Above all, IBM needs to show that it has relearned the lesson which made it successful all those years ago, in the age of the singing salesmen - razor-sharp marketing.</p>

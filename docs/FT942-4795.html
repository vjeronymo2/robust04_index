			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / People: Non-executive directors Sir Marcus Fox, 66, Tory MP and chairman of the party's 1922 committee, has joined the board of Pubmaster, the pub retailing arm of the heavily-indebted Brent Walker group. Sir Marcus' appointment as a non-executive director is a further sign that one of Britain's biggest pub-owners is likely to be floated on the stock market over the next year or two. Last year it made operating profits of Pounds 11.1m on sales of Pounds 100m. Pubmaster chairman John Brackenbury, 58, said that Sir Marcus has an impressive track record in industry as well as in politics.</p>

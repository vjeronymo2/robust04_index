			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Guinness stays confident after first fall in 13 years GUINNESS, the brewing and spirits group, expects to make 'steady progress' this year after a 12 per cent slide in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 795m - its first setback for 13 years. Although there was little prospect of world market conditions easing, Mr Tony Greener, chairman and chief executive, said the group's brands were performing creditably and marketing expenditure was being increased. 'Our strategy for the future is one of organic growth, and we have demonstrated our ability to perform in this way through the recession,' Mr Greener said. Spirits profits had achieved organic growth of 6 per cent and beer 9 per cent in 1992. Group profits last year were hit by an exceptional charge of Pounds 125m: Pounds 77m for restructuring the Cruzcampo brewing business in Spain, and Pounds 48m for reorganising Scotch whisky production. Cruzcampo's profits declined by nearly 33 per cent to Pounds 41m as the Spanish beer market fell 4 per cent. Improvements in productivity, including a 15 per cent cut in the workforce over three years, are being accelerated. Diluted earnings per share of 27.8p were 11 per cent lower but a final dividend of 8.5p lifts the total payment to 11.85p, an increase of 10 per cent. The rise was not enough, however, to prevent Guinness shares falling 17p, to close yesterday at 468p. Spirits profits, before exceptional costs, improved 3 per cent to Pounds 769m on turnover 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.58bn. Overall, Scotch whisky volumes were flat but premium and deluxe brands increased sales. The Japanese market was affected by cutbacks in corporate entertainment but gains were made in the take-home trade. Profits were well ahead in the rest of the Asia Pacific region, and also improved in the US, South America, and most European markets. Brewing profits, before restructuring costs, rose 3 per cent to Pounds 252m on turnover of Pounds 1.75bn, 10 per cent higher. Total volumes were lower than in 1991 but the Guinness brand achieved significant growth in continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the Caribbean. Draught sales helped the brand gain 4 per cent of the UK beer market. The contribution from LVMH, in which Guinness has a 24 per cent stake, fell from Pounds 123m to Pounds 101m.

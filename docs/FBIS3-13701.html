			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 17 Mar (INA) -- Two Iraqi newspapers have  denounced the UN Security Council's unjust and arbitrary stand  toward Iraq, particularly the unjust resolutions it has issued  under pressure by the United States and other parties.    In their editorials today, the newspapers AL-'IRAQ and BABIL  noted that the Iraqi side has been very patient, wise, and  responsible in order to remove the covers intended to be the  cornerstone of the blockade conspiracy. They stressed that the  United States, through the UN Special Commission, deliberately  pushed escalation and maneuvering, refusing to admit that Iraq  has shown every form of cooperation, and that the unjust  blockade imposed on it is no longer justified.    AL-'IRAQ says: The Special Commission, which is fully aware  of Iraq's implementation of the clauses of Section C, has, many  times, used double standards that raised doubts and suspicions.  This was revealed by the foreign minister in his television  interview the day before yesterday, in which he said that the  Special Commission's chairman had signed official and documented  minutes of meetings in Baghdad that prove Iraq's commitment,  and, at the same time, made statements outside Iraq that  conflict with these minutes. He stressed that all this took  place in accordance with U.S. inspirations, whose motives and  objectives have been exposed.    The paper adds: Even stranger is that the UN Security  Council and the Special Commission premeditatedly imposed a news  blackout on Iraq's sincere stands and cooperation, and  misinterpret the paragraphs and statements that prove this.    The paper notes that the current approaches at the UN  Security Council prove the isolation of the United States and  its wicked efforts to maintain the blockade and to evade its  legal, moral, and political responsibilities toward Iraq.    The paper calls on the UN Security Council to behave in  accordance with its true task, namely, to maintain peace, to  remove injustice which is the result of the unfair and  irresponsible U.S. stands, and to take the only action that will  prove it is up to the responsibilities entrusted to it by the  international community, namely, to lift the blockade imposed on  the Iraqi people.    The newspaper BABIL says: During his meeting with the prime  minister and the ministers four days ago, President Saddam  Husayn defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi confrontation  with the enemies. He has also frankly explained the  premeditated objectives of America and those who revolve in its  orbit of maintaining the unjust blockade against Iraq, despite  the fact that it has fulfilled its obligations in accordance  with the unfair UN Security Council resolutions.    The paper touches on the role of the Iraqi will in achieving  victory over our enemies in our decisive battle, the battle of  lifting the blockade. It stresses that it is a comprehensive  economic, political, social, cultural, and moral battle in which  the efforts of good Iraqis must be pooled in all walks of life  and at all production sites.    The paper explains that Iraq's decisive determination to  lift  the comprehensive blockade will lead to the adoption of another  path that will open the doors of hope for our people and enable  them to embark on mighty revolutionary action, in light of the  international changes in favor of our just stand made possible  by our steadfastness and patience.</p>

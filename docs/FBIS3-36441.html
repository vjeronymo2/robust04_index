			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent A. Pishchayev; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Pishchayev] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's subtleties knew  no bounds today. At a meeting with electors in Moscow, he  warned that presidential elections will be held before the end  of parliament's two-year term in office, that is, this year.    The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] together, of  course, with its leader will come to power.    How can they not win if, as Vladimir Volfovich says, the  government has betrayed the interests not only of the Russians  but of all Slavs. Who do you think are the most inveterate  traitors?    [Video shows Zhirinovskiy addressing meeting] [Begin  Zhirinovskiy recording] These are the scoundrels in the current  Russian Government: Kozyrev, Chubays, and Shokhin. [end  recording]    [Pishchayev] At the same time, he was rude about Russia's  Choice, calling the faction Russia's Rejects. Regarding the  government in the Kremlin, he remarked that it is pandering to  the West which is testing on Serbia a method to destroy Russia.  Once it has destroyed the Serbs, Zhirinovskiy said, world  imperialism -- familiar vocabulary this -- wants to settle  Muslims on their land and encircle Russia with an Islamic cordon.    The LDPR leader also demanded that the United Nations cancel  its sanctions against Serbia. He compared Mitterrand to Hitler,  since the French president has proposed, in his words, bomb  strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.    Also today, Zhirinovskiy advised the Russian president not  to  sign a friendship treaty with Georgia but offer it gubernare  status within the Russian Federation.</p>

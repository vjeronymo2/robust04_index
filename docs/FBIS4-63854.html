			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 25 May TASS -- "Social aspects have become  decisive in the formation of the Russian Armed Forces," said  Major-General Vladimir Osadchy, one of head officials of the  main department for military budget and financing of the Russian  Defence Ministry. In an interview with ITAR-TASS Osadchy said  that funds allocated at present to the defence industry  automatically put servicemen in an unequal social position. The  military budget has been scheduled so that at least half of  servicemen will not be given pay in at the time envisaged by  law. Two or three months of existence without pay will enviably  worsen the situation among the military personnel and in  military garrisons, Osadchy said.    In his opinion, parliamentary hearings on social aspects of  the military reform scheduled in the State Duma on Wednesday [25  May] will help clarify the situation. The Defence Ministry does  not claim privileges in financing, taking into account budgetary  difficulties faced by the country. However, it is inadmissible  that electricity, fuel and food supplies be stopped to garrisons  and military canteens because of the lack of funds, Osdachy  said. The Defence Ministry must pay both for military hardware  and ammunition, while there are no funds to do so," Osadchy said.    The Duma committee for defence has repeatedly brought up the  subject of defence financing. However, constructive and  competent resolutions adopted by the committee do not always  meet the support of lawmakers, Osadchy said, adding that some  lawmakers use debates on the military budget for purposes which  have nothing to do with Russia's national interests.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: OLIVE OIL: AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TOO  </P> <P> A few years ago, polyunsaturated was the buzz word in health circles.  Researchers considered polyunsaturated oils the best substitutes for animal, or  saturated, fats, and supermarket shelves sagged under the weight of the new  heart elixir: safflower oil.  </P> <P> But that's all changed.  </P> <P> Monounsaturates are now the heart disease preventers of choice. One factor: the  news that polyunsaturates might be a cancer agent. And while polys do tend to  reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol, they also reduce  the high-density lipoproteins (HDL), or "good" cholesterol, which removes  cholesterol from the blood stream. (Lipoproteins are a sort of transport system  that is in charge of moving cholesterol throughout the body.)  </P> <P> The story changes when monos are substituted for saturated fats. According to  research collected by Dr. Scott Grundy at the University of Texas Southwestern  Medical Center at Dallas and Dr. Fred Mattson of the University of California  at San Diego, monounsaturates reduce LDL cholesterol and maintain and even  raise HDL levels. (It should be noted that both the Grundy and Mattson studies  were criticized because participants got their supplies of mono, poly and  saturated fats from liquid diets. Some wondered whether the results would be  the same if the subjects had eaten normally.)  </P> <P> But monounsaturates got a highly publicized scientific stamp of approval  anyway. Demand is up for olive, canola and, to some extent, peanut oil.  Safflower, corn and other polyunsaturated vegetable oils are gradually falling  from favor.  </P> <P> The trendiest of the monos is olive oil. More and more families are using olive  oil in their salad dressing. And instead of the traditional pat of butter, many  Americans drizzle their dinner rolls with olive oil. It's even appearing as the  primary fat in some baked goods.  </P> <P> One Italian study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.  earlier this year, showed that those who consumed large amounts of olive oil  had lower blood cholesterol levels (including LDL), declines in blood pressure  and drops in blood sugar compared to those people in Italian provinces with a  heavy meat and butter diet. The study was significant because the participants  surveyed consumed a normal diet and followed their usual living pattern.  </P> <P> Still, health experts warn against adding indiscriminate amounts of olive oil  to the diet. Since it contains the same number of calories as other fats, olive  oil should be used, whenever possible, instead of fats such as butter, corn  oil, lard and margarine, not on top of an already high-fat diet.  </P> <P> "Because saturated fats are the real culprits in the raising of (blood  cholesterol) levels," says Arlene Wanderman, director of the International  Olive Oil Council, "it's wise to substitute monounsaturated fats like olive oil  -- it's a good, healthy food. But I don't think any food is a panacea (to heart  disease). Sloshing it all over the place is not the answer."  </P> <P> "The key is that we should use all fats sparingly -- be they monounsaturated,  saturated or polyunsaturated," says Carolyn Prosak, registered dietitian and  spokesperson for the California Dietetic Assn. "Health recommendations say  monounsaturates should comprise 10 to 15%, saturates less than 10% and  polyunsaturates no more than 10%. Monos have a little better edge in the  balance of the total diet."  </P> <P> Prosak thinks olive and canola oils both fit into a balanced diet. It isn't  necessary to choose one over the other; instead, she recommends substituting  olive oil for animal fats in recipes when a strong flavor is desired and canola  oil when taste isn't as important -- such as baked goods and stir-fries. (This  allows the body's need for saturated fats to be met with other animal foods  such as meats and cheeses.)  </P> <P> "I don't even mind people using a small amount of butter for flavor," Prosak  said. "A small amount is fine. The whole idea is variety and keeping the total  amount low."  </P> <P> Sarah Schlessinger, co-author of "The Low Cholesterol Olive Oil Cookbook"  (Villard Books: $19.95), discovered the benefits of olive oil not long after  her husband had a heart attack. Her book offers recipes for using olive oil in  place of animal fats in a wide assortment of dishes, though she also emphasizes  that it is important to limit consumption of total fat, including  monounsaturates, to 30% of the day's total calories.  </P> <P> She suggests using olive oil in baking, stir-frying and, she says, "things that  you don't normally think of for olive oil" to achieve the cholesterol-lowering  benefit.  </P> <P> In her oven-fried chicken, for example, cornmeal and flour coat skinned chicken  pieces, and olive oil is lightly drizzled on before baking. Her rum-raisin  orange cake calls for a mild, light-flavored olive oil in place of the  traditional fat.  </P> <P> "I think that people are surprised to find that olive oil is even in these  dishes," she says.  </P></p>

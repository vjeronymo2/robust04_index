			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE AWAITS VERDICT ON OSCAR TICKETS  </P> <P> Call it the Case of the Disappointed Jurist. Or, the Case of the Confusing  Telephone Calls. Either way, here it is just six days to Oscar, and one of the  most famous judges in America -- "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner -- can't  seem to get in on the show.  </P> <P> All the retired Superior Court judge -- whose show is the basis of a running  gag in the front runner "Rain Man" -- wanted, it seems, was some tickets to  Wednesday's show. But, as is often the case of getting on the A list in  Hollywood, it's not a case of who you know, but who knows you.  </P> <P> When Oscars show producer Allan Carr was told earlier this week that he had a  call from a representative of Judge Wapner, Carr, who says he doesn't watch  much daytime TV, thought he had a legal problem on his hands.  </P> <P> "I asked, 'Why, are one of my couples having matrimonial problems?' I thought  he wanted to be a consultant in case of a domestic tiff over the weekend," Carr  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> But there was some confusion in Carr's office. An assistant to the producer was  told that Wapner had been so taken by Dustin Hoffman's repeated references to  him in "Rain Man," that he thought the Oscars might want him around to perform  in the event. Carr politely declined.  </P> <P> "My case rests on Judge Wapner," Carr said. "It's plain and simple. I don't  think he's a member of the Screen Actors Guild. I don't think he's been  nominated for anything."  </P> <P> But Eddy Jo Bernal, a publicist for Wapner's program, said that the judge  merely wanted tickets to attend the Oscars show -- not be in it. He had  mentioned it to a Warner Bros. representative at a recent television  convention.  </P> <P> "Somebody at Warner misinterpreted and went to Carr and asked if he could be on  the show," Bernal said. "That's not what the judge wanted at all. He's not a  star, he's a judge.  </P> <P> "He just wanted to be in the audience and he admires Dustin Hoffman's work."  </P> <P> As of Wednesday, Wapner still hadn't made the A list.  </P></p>

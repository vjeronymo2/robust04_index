			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAMB'S THEATRE EFFORT BETTER THAN THE SCRIPT  </P> <P> Mr. Toad is obsessed with cars. He likes to drive 'em and crash 'em. Not even  the fatherly Mr. Badger or Toad's buddies Ratty and Mole can do anything to  stop him.  </P> <P> Mr. Toad is a child's vision of what a frog should be -- stubborn, charming and  self-involved. And therein lies his appeal, as immortalized in the Kenneth  Grahame classic, "The Wind in the Willows."  </P> <P> Cute. Very cute. But cute can be deadly, if not handled with expert care. An  A.A. Milne adaptation of this work garnered raves in Los Angeles several years  ago.  </P> <P> But, sadly, Douglas Post's musical adaptation, playing here at Lamb's Players  Theatre through July 29, isn't likely to win raves from anyone.  </P> <P> Unless it's for the talent of the Lamb's Players team, which comes closer than  one could imagine to rising over the warts inherent in the script. With lesser  talent, this production could have been one giant croak.  </P> <P> It's a feat all the more remarkable for those familiar with the troubled  genesis of this production. Lamb's had been set to open "The Lion, the Witch  and the Wardrobe" -- much meatier fare -- two weeks ago, when they discovered,  days before opening night, that the Southern California rights to C.S. Lewis'  works had been obtained by somebody else.  </P> <P> The company gave itself two weeks to find an alternative suitable for its  woodsy, fantasy-world set, obtain the rights to the script and then do the rest  -- cast, costume, choreograph and open.  </P> <P> Under the skillful direction of Robert Smyth, the Lamb's artistic director, the  company dazzles from moment to moment even as the script, which meanders  mercilessly in the beginning, stops from time to time for songs, which, while  beautifully sung and orchestrated, are more than a tad silly.  </P> <P> As much as Lamb's meets the material head-on, the company does look a trifle  sheepish forging through lyrics like, "The Toad is back, the Toad is back, the  Toad is back."  </P> <P> The cast itself, however, is close to irreproachable. The mellifluous musical  accompaniment by music director Todd Neal brings out the best in a fine  ensemble of voices and often makes you forget the preciousness of the songs.  </P> <P> David Cochran Heath, his dark hair dyed blond, is an irresistible Toad, upper  class and childishly full of himself and his obsessions. Leigh Scarritt is a  memorable Mole, tiny and curved inwards like a frightened little animal, but  with remarkable dexterity -- she does a mean cartwheel -- and a sweet voice.  Deborah Gilmour Smyth provides strong support as the Rat, but without  establishing a clear personality for Ratty other than an Irish brogue. Luther  Hanson is spunky as Otter, Paul Devine weaselly as Weasel, Howard Bickle  doleful as William the Horse and Cynthia Peters equally charming as a Field  Mouse and jailer's daughter.  </P> <P> Pamela Turner's choreography keeps the songs moving, which helps diffuse much  of the score's essential inanity. The racing in place that accompanies the  first bumpy carriage ride Mr. Toad gives to Mole and Ratty, makes a static  vehicle come alive with breathless movement.  </P> <P> Christian Turner's stone-like set, dappled by Mike Buckley's delicate lighting,  admirably fits the fairy-tale forest theme. Jeanne Reith's Dickensian costumes  give the show a level of dignity that might have been compromised if the  company had tried to replicate animals by using animal costumes.  </P> <P> In this production of "The Wind in the Willows," Lamb's shows that it has a  talent for children's theater, one of San Diego County's sadly neglected forms;  the company invests itself in the material, without being condescending. If  they were handicapped here by a less than ideal script, they do everything they  can to compensate. The results, while often charming, are ultimately a  testament to the importance of the written word as the starting place of all  good theater.  </P> <P> Still, children's theater is something one hopes the company will try again.  </P> <P> This show is not recommended for children of all ages; because of a gunshot and  a few car crashes, children of five or six who tend to have difficulty  distinguishing reality from fantasy, may be frightened. But children 7 or over  may very well enjoy it and ask parents to buy the book which is on sale at the  theater during intermission -- along with copies of "The Lion, the Witch and  the Wardrobe," which, sadly, did not make it to the Lamb's stage this time  around.  </P> <P> 'THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"  </P> <P> Adapted with music by Douglas Post from the book by Kenneth Grahame. Director  is Robert Smyth. Musical direction and accompaniment by Todd Neal. Choreography  by Pamela Turner. Sets by Christian Turner. Costumes by Jeanne Reith. Lighting  by Mike Buckley. Stage manager is Lee Weldon. With Leigh Scarritt, Deborah  Gilmour Smyth, Luther Hanson, David Cochran Heath, Howard Bickle, Paul Devine,  Kate McConnell, Christine Nicholson, Cynthia Peters and Melanie Rey.

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Writ alleges cash dispenser security depends on staff THE FOUR banks and one building society expected to be named in legal proceedings alleging phantom withdrawals from cash dispensers rely on security systems which place too much reliance on the honesty of individual members of staff, according to the writ lodged with the High Court on Thursday. The writ questions the adequacy of the security systems of the banks - Barclays, Midland, TSB and Lloyds - and Nationwide building society. Instead of automatic updating of master keys by security modules, the five institutions are alleged to rely more on the honesty of their staff in keeping secret the keys that activate cash dispensers. The modules are responsible for encrypting and decrypting the messages which run dispensers. They comprise small computers in tamper-resistant boxes. Alarms go off and electronic information is destroyed if anyone tries to open them. With hardware security modules in place, nobody should be able to discover a customer's personal identify number (PIN), which has to be keyed into a cash dispenser after inserting a plastic card with its magnetic strip giving account details. It is claimed that the banks are using a much less secure system involving two members of staff, each possessing half the master key - a unique number - which activates the system. Security therefore would rely on the staff both keeping their part of the master key secret and not colluding to break into the system. Once inside, experts agree, it would be possible to learn customers' transaction details. It is known that UK banks are still considering whether to include a 'message authentication block' in the encrypted transaction message which passes from the dispenser to a bank's computer. This is a special set of codes which virtually guarantees the authenticity of any message sent over the system. A number of ways in which 'phantom transactions' could come about are emerging. One involves errors in the card management software, which could result in genuine cards and PINs being sent to customers with the wrong information encoded on the magnetic stripe. Another involves the banks' own testing procedures. Dummy banks and dummy accounts are frequently set up to test software developments. There are concerns that this category of a dispenser transaction may be run outside normal security measures. Finally, there are concerns that because banks' dispenser systems are linked, faults in one bank's software could create unpredictable errors elsewhere in the network. FOUR men will appear in court today in connection with the seizure of more than 200 forged bank cashpoint cards. They were arrested in Sydenham, south-east London, by officers from Scotland Yard's central cheque squad who recovered cards and computerised encoding equipment. The four, charged with conspiracy to defraud the central clearing banks, will appear before Greenwich magistrates.</p>

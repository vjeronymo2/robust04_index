			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / People: NatWest Markets combines its IT NatWest Markets has brought Tomasz Herbich, previously managing director for global trading technology at Bankers Trust, into a new role as director of information technology. The corporate and investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank has been formed out of many constituent parts, including County NatWest and NatWest's treasury department, hence also throwing together many different types of system. There were also three separate technology heads - variously looking after the front office, back office, and data and telecommunications. Now those three heads report to Herbich, whose task it is to co-ordinate and develop the group's IT capabilities both in London and abroad. 'I was very agreeably surprised as to how much importance NatWest's senior management attaches to technology,' says Herbich, who adds that the areas particularly targeted for systems development are equities, capital markets and treasury. Herbich, of Polish extraction but reared in Scotland, has degrees in operational research and management science. He has spent the past 16 years at Bankers Trust, partly in London, partly in New York. Bankers Trust's front office trading system REMOS, which has been sold on to a number of other banks, was Herbich's brainchild, first developed for foreign exchange in 1983. He had been at the US investment bank's headquarters since 1991, but wanted to return to the UK, since he was regularly commuting across the Atlantic to see his wife who had stayed in London.</p>

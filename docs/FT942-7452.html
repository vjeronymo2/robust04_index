			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Disposals lift ICI India result ICI India, the Indian subsidiary of the British chemicals group, has reported a 13-fold increase in annual pre-tax profits to Rs728m (Dollars 23m) for the year to March, due largely to a corporate restructuring which included the sale of its fertiliser business and a 49 per cent stake in its fibres operations. Profits included Rs538m of exceptional gains from the disposals and from the sale of property in Bombay. The sales also helped the company reduce its interest charges. Overall revenues fell to Rs8.8bn from Rs9.7bn because of the disposals but continuing operations saw revenues rise by 11 per cent and operating profits by 27 per cent. The company, which is 51 per cent owned by ICI, has been reorganised partly in response to the liberalisation of the Indian economy and partly because of the group restructuring in which pharmaceuticals were spun off into a new company called Zeneca. The fertilisers business was sold mainly because the group has also withdrawn from fertiliser manufacturing. ICI India said that following the disposals it was committed to expanding its operations, including paints, catalysts, polyurethanes, agrochemicals and rubber chemicals. The company is importing technology from other parts of the group, including new techniques of catalyst manufacture and of producing vehicle paint. It would also consider acquisitions.</p>

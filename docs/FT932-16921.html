			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Axa planning more funds for The Equitable AXA, the French insurance company, is planning to make another Dollars 300m capital injection in The Equitable, the large but troubled US life insurer, it was announced late yesterday in New York. Axa injected Dollars 1bn into the ailing insurance and financial services group in 1991, receiving a 49 per cent stake in The Equitable when the US group converted from mutual status to a shareholder-owned company last year. Axa's new investment comes as part of a Dollars 600m fund-raising exercise by The Equitable, designed to bolster the capital base of its life insurance subsidiaries. The US insurer said that it planned to sell this amount of convertible securities via a private placement. The nature of the convertible securities was not specified, but The Equitable said they would swap into about 25m shares of common stock after July 22 1994. 'Axa is expected to purchase 49 per cent of the convertible securities,' said The Equitable. The remaining securities, it added, were expected to go to institutional investors.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (4): Swiss sales fall again  -There is very little optimism among producers MACHINE tool builders in Switzerland hoped that they had seen the worst last year, but it was not to be. The performance of the country's largest export industry - and the world's third ranked machine tool exporter after Germany and Japan - slumped in 1991 following the boom years of the late 1980s. Swiss machine tool sales tumbled 10.7 per cent to an estimated SFr3.6bn and the all important exports fell slightly more to SFr3.2bn. So far this year, things are even worse. Machine tool exports in the first quarter plunged a staggering 21 per cent to SFr614.2m, according to the latest statistics from the Swiss Association of Machinery Manufacturers (VSM). 'Nobody is doing well,' says Mr Urs Bleuler, secretary-general of the VSM. He estimates that about half the companies in the industry are in loss, the rest making meagre profits. Mikron, the leading producer, reported a SFr90m loss last year compared with a SFr4.6m profit in 1990. In Decemeber, the group eliminated 40 of 650 jobs at its main production site in Biel (Bienne), having already put 270 on short time working earlier in the year. In March, Agie, the second largest group, said it would shed 120 jobs, mostly at its headquarters in Losone in southern Switzerland. The Agie group, which specialises in spark erosion technology, has been selling off loss-making subsidiaries and in the first half of last year suffered a slump in turnover from SFr192m to SFr145m. The one consolation is that international statistics indicate that the difficulties of the Swiss builders are mirrored in the other great machine tool producing countries: Japan and Germany. The main problem is that capital spending by the industry's three leading customer groups - machinery makers, automotive manufacturers and armaments companies - has slumped in the past year and, in the case of the armaments industry, in particular, the slump may be a structural one. The Swiss machine tool makers have some special problems; the eastern European and former Soviet Union markets were very important, but their orders have collapsed because of a lack of liquidity. For example, in the first quarter of this year, exports of Swiss machine tools to the Commonwealth of Independent States plunged by 73 per cent to only SFr14.9m. The all-important German market, which takes about a third of Swiss machine tool exports, has also turned down sharply in the first quarter. After a 17.6 per cent gain in sales to Germany last year to SFr1.04bn, there was a 19 per cent drop in the first quarter of this year to SFr203.2m. Swiss makers also have to contend with a new set of export control regulations introduced in February to try to prevent a repeat of the embarrassing revelations last year that a couple of Swiss companies supplied specialised machine tools to Iraq for use in that country's nuclear weapon development programme. 'We cannot close our eyes to the problems of trading with some countries,' Mr Bleuler says. 'But sometimes we know that our government applies export-control mechanisms more severely than, say, the US government does, especially in highly accurate machine tools.' Until a few months ago, the Swiss also chafed under the old COCOM regulations that were aimed at preventing transfers of high technology to the former Soviet Union and east European countries. Switzerland was not a member of COCOM but it followed their guidelines. 'COCOM would still be a big problem if the old Comecon countries had any money,' Mr Bleuler adds. The Swiss machine tool industry, like its counterparts in other countries, has had its difficulties adjusting to the upheavals caused by the widespread application of computer numerical controls in the past decade. However, as Swiss makers tend to specialise in high precision, high repeatability and special purpose machines, they have been less jolted than those in some countries, notably the US and the UK, that make more high volume, standard products. The fact that Switzerland has maintained its trade surplus in machine tools with Japan speaks for itself. Thus, the profile of the industry today is not vastly different from what it was 10 years ago, that is, a collection of small, entrepreneur-based, specialist companies. The vast majority of businesses employ about 100 people, with only a few having over 600 employees and only three having more than 1,200. The overall numbers have declined significantly - from 170 companies in 1980, employing 19,000 people, to only 115 today employing 13,000 - but that is a function of improved productivity and some rationalisation as well as fading fortunes, in some cases. Still, there have been some significant changes in the industry in recent years. George Fischer, a once-famous name in lathes, has sold out. Oerlikon Buhrle, once a major producer, now makes only specialised gear cutting machines. On the other hand, Mikron has tried to build up a diversified group through acquisitions, last year adding the Italian gear cutting maker, Cima, and the French specialised machine producer, Somex, to its interests. But suggestions similar to those heard in other countries that Swiss machine tool builders should join forces for marketing and distribution abroad are dismissed by the VMS as unrealistic - 'we feel there are a few well-defined fields where closer co-operation in distribution and service could be meaningful, but not a general arrangement.' As for the outlook, no-one seems to be very optimistic. The industry's order backlog had slid to only 4.8 months by the end of last year, down by 2.7 months since the end of 1990. Mr Theodor Fassler, head of the machine tools division of VMS and president of Mikron, said earlier this year that restructuring and capacity adjustments had at least led to decreased pressure on prices. However, he predicted that an upturn would not be felt until 1993.</p>

It is anticipated that a ``Cooperative Agreement'' will be awarded as a result of this announcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary goal of the proposed research is to further the understanding of the problems confronted in assessing the impact of comprehensive community change initiatives. These initiatives have several features that do not correspond to traditional assessment methods: (1) They rely on a complex interaction of components, (2) they are intended to produce impacts in several different spheres, (3) they are purposefully flexible and variable rather than standardized, (4) they saturate a community, affecting all members of the community, and (5) they involve contexts and systems that are in a continuous process of change. Given these difficulties, an examination is needed of how assessment of these initiatives can be improved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> A. Type of Application Requested <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ASPE has a long history of interest in comprehensive human services efforts and the methods of assessing the impact of such efforts. This includes an interest in service integration projects, as well as an interest in community-based human services reform. The office has funded assessments of individual projects and clearinghouses for information on comprehensive strategies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several private foundations have recently created initiatives that attempt to change human service and other systems in communities. These initiatives attempt to work across systems, involving the social services, the health care system, the schools, and economic and physical redevelopment. They are generally focused on one or more urban communities. Examples of foundation initiatives include several foundation-sponsored efforts such as the Annie E. Casey foundation's New Futures Initiative, the Pew Charitable Trust's Children's Initiative, and the Ford Foundation's Neighborhood and Family Initiative. Recent federal initiatives, such as the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Initiative, include similar features. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

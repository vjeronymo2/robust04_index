			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Meeting of NATO's Foreign </F> Ministers in Turkey"]    [Text] The foreign ministers of 16 member states of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, concluded its one-day  meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. At this meeting the NATO foreign  ministers discussed various issues faced by this treaty.    One of the most important issues which was discussed was  Russia's cooperation with NATO. Based on the final statement of  this meeting, NATO's foreign ministers agreed to have closer  ties with Russia. However, by announcing their (?definite terms  they) rejected some of Russia's demands, including having a  special status in return for the West's military coalition. The  Russian officials insist on having special relations with NATO  which reflect the situation of that country as a major power in  the world. To this end Moscow has called for the formation of a  consultative system on every issue which comes up urgently. In  addition, Moscow has called for cooperation among the members of  NATO in the former Warsaw and the Soviet republics. [sentence as  heard] This cooperation is carried out in the form of an  independent organization which is charged with common  politico-military cooperation to stop armed clashes. In return  NATO members have announced readiness for unofficial talks with  Russia. However, since they do not want all NATO operations to  be supervized by Russia they have opposed Moscow's proposal on  authorizing Russia to take part in NATO's internal talks.    Political analysts believe since Russia knows that the main  objective behind participation (?in the) peace plan, which has  been brought up by the United States, is to create a security  belt around Russia so as to make necessary preparations against  Russia's probable danger in case communists come to power again.  Although Russia considers this plan as against its national  security it is forced to join it to maintain its influence in  the East and in the former Soviet republics, for the East  European countries have voluntarily joined this plan, and even  if Russia opposes it these European countries will not change  their decisions. Therefore, Moscow, by taking part in the peace  plan, tries to push the programs of this plan toward a direction  which does not endanger Russia's interests at least.    The NATO foreign ministers too are quite aware of this  viewpoint. Hence by accepting some of Russia's demands they  oppose those proposals by Moscow which can create problems for  the future of the NATO.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 13 April (TANJUG) -- Vitaliy Churkin,  the Russian president's special envoy, arrived from Pale in  Belgrade late this afternoon, where he was received by Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic.    Their strictly confidential talks were held behind closed  doors but there is no doubt that the main reason for Churkin's  surprise visit to Belgrade is the newly created situation in  Bosnia following NATO air strikes on Serb positions around  Gorazde.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Berlin Scientists Develop Electrochemical Soil </F> Rehabilitation Process"]    [Text] VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 6  May 94 - To date, fine-grain soils, port-, clear-, or  galvanic muds could only be inadequately cleansed of heavy  metals and harmful organic substances at great cost. The  Institute for Technology and Environmental Protection of the EGA  (Development Company Adlersdorf mbH) in Berlin is currently  testing an alternative method, which was recently displayed at  the Hannover Fair. In the new method, the heavy metals and  harmful organic substances are removed from the soils and muds  electrokinetically.    In the process, an electrical field, which induces a fine  water flow in the soil capillaries, is generated by means of two  electrodes. Since the harmful substances dissolved in the ground  water are encased in a water envelope (hydrate shell), they  are--owing to the viscosity of the water filaments--moved along  with the flow until they reach, depending on their electrical  charge, either the cathode of the anode. Heavy metals like lead,  cadmium, and mercury, but also the harmful organic substances as  well, together with their water envelopes gather at the poles,  where they are then pumped off. The EGA researchers see  particular advantages in the new process in that it can be used  to cleanse the ground soils beneath developed areas as well.    Researchers at the Laboratory for Chemical Engineering in  Geneva (EIG) are developing a similar technique. There, the  mercury-containing sewage is caused to flow through an  electrochemical cell, where the positively charged mercury ions  gather at the cathode. The mercury is subsequently removed from  the cathode by heating in an evaporator with an internal  condenser, where the metal is recovered. The cathode can be used  repeatedly. Using this method, even small businesses can process  mercury-containing sewage economically and at little cost to the  point where the mercury residual concentration is five ppb.</p>

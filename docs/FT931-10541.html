			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Boost for leading pension managers STRONG performances by two leading fund management houses last year are likely to lead to further concentration of the management of Britain's occupational pension funds. Preliminary data shows that Gartmore and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management (PDFM) outperformed the median rate of return by at least 5 and 3 percentage points respectively. The other two of the biggest four active managers, Mercury and Schroder, are believed to have been some way behind but still close to the average. Gartmore, which now manages pension funds worth Pounds 10.5bn, after adding Pounds 1.8bn in new business last year, claims a median rate of return of 25.8 per cent for its client funds. Its pooled fund, Gartmore Long-Term Balanced, a unitised fund used by certain smaller clients, returned 29 per cent. A performance measurement company called Caps estimates that the median pension fund return in 1992 was 20.6 per cent, although this may be revised when more results are filed. According to Mr David Watts, head of pension funds at Gartmore, it was 'a most remarkable year' in which the managers added value in every area. The main elements included a heavy overseas exposure and, within that, an emphasis on dollar assets, which paid off handsomely in the final quarter. At PDFM, which manages about twice as much pension fund money as Gartmore, there was a good performance in UK equities and a profitable exposure to French bonds, said Mr Tony Dye, the company's investment strategist. But risks were reduced by a high (10 per cent to 11 per cent) investment in index-linked gilt-edged stock. Consultants say there was an unusually large spread between the best and the worst results last year. One fund with two management companies found there was a 9 per cent gap in performance between them. Pension fund management has become highly competitive and in recent years contracts have been gravitating towards a handful of successful investment houses. According to a consultant: 'These results will intensify the move towards the majors.' But it is performance over several years rather than a single year that counts. 'We are having to spend our time dampening down our clients' expectations,' said Mr Watts. Caps has published performance figures for the pooled funds of about 60 investment institutions, which also show a wide range of investment performance.  ---------------------------------         POOLED PENSION             FUNDS  ---------------------------------     (mixed incl property)      Returns* in 1992 (%)         (median 19.3)  ---------------------------------            TOP THREE  --------------------------------- Gartmore Long-term       29.0 Zurich Life              27.2 Nat Mutual Life          24.6  ---------------------------------          BOTTOM THREE  --------------------------------- Scottish Amicable        13.2 MIM                      12.2 Scottish Equitable A     11.9  ---------------------------------       Five-year returns        (% annualised)         (median 12.3)  ---------------------------------          TOP THREE  --------------------------------- National Mutual Life     15.6 Britannia Life           15.3 Zurich Life              14.9  ---------------------------------         BOTTOM THREE  --------------------------------- Scottish Amicable         9.5 Scottish Provident        9.1 NM AES                    9.0  --------------------------------- *gross income plus capital gains Source; Caps  ---------------------------------</p>

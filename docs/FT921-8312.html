			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Campaign Profile): A gentleman in a streetfighter's world MR DONALD DEWAR is a rare example of a politician who gives the profession a good name. That, of course, is what his more combative colleagues single out as his principal weakness. The gangling, 54-year-old shadow Scottish secretary is widely respected on both sides of the Commons for all-round integrity and scrupulous reasonableness. Perhaps, too much so. Such traits are unusual enough in the Commons. They are all the more so in the rough world of Scottish politics, where quiet diplomacy is often reinforced by the unspoken threat of a well-aimed kick. With his countrymen once again in turmoil over devolution and independence, Mr Dewar is arguably Labour's most embattled politician - after Mr Neil Kinnock himself. If the party fails to win the coming election it will be up to Mr Dewar to prevent a split in his party that could dash its chances of ever forming an administration in Westminster. With an iron grip on Scottish local government and 48 of the country's 72 parliamentary seats, it is a wonder that any Labour leader in Scotland will be able to justify being denied power by the very Act of Union the party is pledged to defend. It is after the election and not before that he may face his most serious political test. In recent weeks, however, Mr Dewar has suffered his toughest trial since the Scottish National party converted a 19,500 Labour majority into a 3,500 nationalist victory at the 1988 Govan by-election. With a general election likely for April 9, he has faced unaccustomed criticism for what was widely seen as a lacklustre performance in a televised debate on Scotland's mounting constitutional controversy. Days later an opinion poll showed a surge in nationalist support with a remarkable 50 per cent of Scots preferring outright independence to Labour's alternative plan for a Scottish parliament. On February 4 Mr Dewar acted to calm anxiety among Scottish MPs as they gathered for their regular monthly meeting in parliament. Before anyone could voice unease he defused the concern with a disarmingly contrite critique of his own performance and agreement that Labour should now sell its devolution policy under the more positive banner of 'home rule'. Furthermore, he accepted that he would devolve more campaigning roles to his troops. One MP commented afterwards: 'It was a typically robust performance by Donald and everyone went away satisfied.' But Mr Dewar's emollient style is beginning to worry a few. As one leftwing backbencher put it: 'Donald's a good Glasgow University debater, but he's no street-fighter.' Mr George Foulkes, a friend and admirer of Mr Dewar - like the vast majority of Scots Labour MPs - puts it more gently: 'He is sometimes too reasonable and tends to see the other side of arguments. That can be dangerous, especially so close to an election.' A scion of Glasgow's professional classes, Donald Campbell Dewar is a typical Scottish Labour laird and a prime example of the party's academicly-inclined, legally-trained oligarchy. The only child of a doctor, he was sent to that stiflingly conservative bulwark of respectability, the Glasgow Academy. At Glasgow University the 'Gannet', as he was nicknamed, leapt to prominence when he succeeded Mr John Smith as leader of the Labour club. It was here he first encountered his hero, the late Hugh Gaitskell. After qualifying as a lawyer he prised Aberdeen South from the Tories in 1966, completing his philosophical apprenticeship as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Tony Crosland, then president of the Board of Trade. An eight-year exile from the Commons ended in 1978 when he narrowly held Glasgow's Garscadden constituency at a by-election, in spite of a fierce challenge from the SNP. Today he has a 19,000 majority. Always a devolutionist, Mr Dewar's enthusiasm for Scottish culture has been fed by a passion for collecting well-bound volumes of 18th century Scots literature, so chaotically scattered round his home that it was once taken as evidence of a burglary. His ectomorphic form, vast appetite, rapid-fire speaking style and public gregariousness hides a self-deprecating personality and a manic preoccupation with work that prompt some to conclude that he is motivated more by some unexplained inner despair than a passion for social reform. 'Donald is never happier than when he is miserable,' is an observation that has become a cliche. If Mr Dewar's networking has proved crucial in keeping the potentially faction-ridden Scottish party united, so too has his extreme caution - which has led crueller critics to accuse him of being more calculating civil servant than vision-driven politician. In particular, they point to the Scottish Labour leadership's hovering too long on the fringes of the Scottish convention - the body that first brokered the current round of devolutionist thinking. Others say that Mr Dewar, and Mr Murray Elder, the Scottish regional secretary, have been over-zealous in their management of the party, confining strategic decision-making to an elite inner circle. Another Dewar virtue turned vice is his strong personal loyalty - an example is his support for less admired frontbench colleagues like Mr Tony Worthington - which is widely deemed to betray a lack of ruthlessness bordering on the unprofessional. But the most damaging charge in the radical atmosphere now prevailing in Scotland is that Mr Dewar is essentially an establishment figure, looking forward to playing Westminster's viceroy in its northern colony. It is a card the nationalists are certain to play. Mr Dewar is fond of saying that being Scottish secretary - with powers drawn from seven or eight English departments of state - is his greatest ambition. With Scotland in its current fever it would be politically much cannier, perhaps, to hint that he would prefer to crown his career as prime minister of a Scottish parliament - even, indeed, if that is not entirely true. It is typical of Mr Dewar's guileless honesty, if not his political nous, that he would not dream of doing so.</p>

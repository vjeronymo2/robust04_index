			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (3): Market hooked on hedging - Derivatives THE GOLD market is hooked on derivatives, and shows no signs of breaking away from its addiction. Gold miners are spoilt for choice for hedging instruments which allow them to lock in a guaranteed profit and achieve prices on their sales well above the market average. Among the hedging methods listed at last year's Financial Times gold conference were FDFs (fixed date forwards); SDFs (spot date forwards); CSOs (committed sale options); CPOs (committed purchase options); COs (compound options): Double Os (overnight options); KO options (knock-out options); CCSs (committed close-out sales); and SIPs (simulated inventory positions). This a la carte menu is changing all the time as the market changes. 'If we were to go into a bull market - a real bull run - there would be a suite of derivatives emerging appropriate to that bull run,' says one gold market analyst. However, the market is very far from a bull run,with general agreement in the industry that the plethora of hedging activity has been a factor in trapping the gold price in its relatively narrow trading range for the past two or three years in spite of events such as the Gulf war and the break-up of the Soviet Union. Every time there has been a spike in the price, a substantial part of the mining industry has sold gold forward by the tonne, putting a cap on the price. This has led to a situation today where some mines are achieving prices of Dollars 420 a troy ounce when the spot price is about Dollars 340. It would be hard to persuade any company not to maximise profit and minimalise risk. But the Catch 22 appears to be that the more the market hedges, the more pressure is placed on the price, and the more the mining companies can tell shareholders they were right to hedge. 'It becomes a vicious circle,' says an analyst, pointing out that six months ago mines were hedging when the price was at Dollars 360 a troy ounce - a level they would be only too happy to grab now. Hedging affects the gold market by helping marginal mines to stay in business. A substantial amount of world production has been protected as far out as 1996, and it is no accident that the biggest increase in hedging activity in the past year has been in the high cost South African mining sector. While the forward, gold loan and options markets have long been in existence, it was not until the mid-1980s that derivatives really took off, starting with the rise of the Australian gold industry. It made sense at a time of high interest rates to borrow bullion which was available in the local market rather than to borrow dollars to exploit the shallow, low cost, low grade deposits that the Australians wanted to bring on stream. The gold market took the lead from the money markets whose products were easily transferred because of the quasi-monetary characteristics of gold. The fact that gold is a contango market (the forward price is always at a premium to the spot) has been one of the factors attracting mining companies. There is so much gold available above ground that the market is unlikely to lapse into backwardation (where the forward price is at a discount to the spot price) for any long period. Most of the users of the derivatives tend to be on the supply side; on the demand side there has been a growing disenchantment by investors, while jewellery fabricators are simply not big enough to have the necessary credit lines. The lack of a counter balancing demand side to the equation adds to the capping effect on the market. At the current level of sophistication, a mining company can tell a bullion dealer the kind of hedging strategy it has in mind and ask for a tailor-made product, according to Ms Jessica Jacks, economist with RTZ, the world's biggest mining company. Declining interest rates, lowering contangos and a declining spot price will just generate another suite of more-appropriate hedging strategies. And in quiet market conditions there is plenty of time to devise fresh derivatives to tempt producers. Now producers have started to sell into a price decline, reflecting a view of prices which can best be described as realistic, but also a desire to continue using hedging policies. 'My feeling is that it's really a feature of the market that's going to hang around,' says one analyst. The changing strategy of the mining companies is reflected in a sharp fall in forward sales - from 249 tonnes in 1990 to 51 tonnes last year, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, which gives four reasons. Sales increased substantially in 1990 (year of the Gulf war); the market has been range bound, with low volatility; interest rates have fallen; and there has been a gradual change in attitude by some producers to forward sales. Gold loan repayments exceeded the demand for new loans last year, leaving a net repayment to the market of 11 tonnes. The trend has continued - on April 29 this year Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer, bought 11.7 tonnes of gold in order to pay off a gold loan early. Ms Jacks estimates that as much as 100 tonnes could be repaid this year. There is a full spectrum of philosophies in the mining industry - on the one hand Homestake which refuses to hedge, and on the other American Barrick or some of the Australian companies which almost 'monetarise' their gold before they've brought it out of the ground. As one analyst says: 'I don't know if it's right or wrong. All I know is it's there and if you ignore it you are not really analysing the full gold market.'</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Aldershot FC is wound up Aldershot Football Club, which has debts estimated at Pounds 1.2m, was compulsorily wound up in the High Court yesterday in spite of a plea that an unnamed rescuer was prepared to buy the club and pay off its immediate debts of Pounds 125,000. Mr Registrar Buckley made a winding-up order on a petition by the Inland Revenue, a creditor for Pounds 92,897 in unpaid tax and national insurance. Mr Mike Davey, the club's chairman, and Mr Colin Hancock, former chairman, said they would discuss the possibility of an appeal. Mr Davey said: 'We are still hoping to save the club.' The club survived three winding-up moves in the late 1980s. A petition to wind up Barnet Football Club was adjourned for six weeks yesterday to give the club time to pay off its debts. The court had been told that the club had paid Pounds 60,000 of the petitioning trade creditor's Pounds 193,000 debt and expected to pay the balance by April 10.</p>

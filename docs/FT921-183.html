			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Technology: MIT put in the picture BT has signed an agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab to research ways in which computers handle visual images. The agreement could earn MIT Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 290,000) a year for the next five years. This is the first agreement with a non-British university under BT's Strategic University Research Programme. Launched last year, the programme accounted for about half of the Pounds 3m that BT spent on university research last year. Under the agreement, MIT will develop tools that computers can use to 'see' and 'understand' images. The aim is to develop software systems that allow users to search databases of pictures on the basis of their visual content rather than written descriptions of what the images depict. As Alex Pentland, of MIT's vision and modelling group, puts it: 'Everything we have done with computers up to this point has been based on letters and numbers. This next step is to teach computers to understand what they see based on visual content rather than textual information.' Such a system might allow users to 'show' a photograph of someone to a computer and then ask it to retrieve all images that show the same person. The research fits in with BT's aim to develop visual telecommunications. The company has its own research team working on video communications, but this deals with more immediate problems, such as how to transmit telephone pictures. Earlier this month, BT announced that it plans to introduce a commercial videophone in the near future.</p>

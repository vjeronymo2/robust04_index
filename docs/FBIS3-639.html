The director of defense  information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, stated this today  while speaking with newsmen in Lagos.    Brig. Gen. Chijuka said Nigeria had always been an advocate  of peace in any conflict involving several African states. The  director explained that the Nigerian Army was a tested Army,  while the Cameroonian Army was not and could not even quell a  common unrest in their country.    On the claim by Cameroonians that they had sank two Nigerian  ships, Brig. Gen. Chijuka said the claim was the figment of the  Cameroonian imagination. The director said the presence of  Nigerian troops on the peninsula had stopped the activities of  Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians living there. He explained  that Nigeria has remained level-headed despite the age-long  provocation by the Cameroonian gendarmes.    Brig. Gen. Chijuka recalled that five Nigerian soldiers were  killed by the gendarmes while several others were wounded in  1991. Nigeria, he said, did not retaliate all along because of  its responsibility to the continent. He said the Nigerian  ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula is based on historical  factors and that over 90 percent of the inhabitants of the  peninsula were Efik-speaking Nigerians. Brig. Gen. Chijuka said  Nigeria's door was still opened for negotiations but cautioned  that the Nigerian Army would be there to protect the Nigerian  border, and when they come under any attack they would have no  choice but to defend themselves.    Meanwhile the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim,  has said that the Nigeria-Cameroon border problem would be  discussed later this week at the OAU ambassadorial level. He  was answering questions from newsmen in Maputo, Mozambique.</p>

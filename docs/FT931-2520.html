			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Cost of artificial joints is criticised A 'FASHION TRADE' in joint replacements is costing the National Health Service many millions of pounds each year, research in the British Medical Journal claims today. Manufacturers, say the researchers, encouraged surgeons to believe that 'new improved' expensive implants used to replace hips were better than conventional cheaper models. Yet they were sometimes less satisfactory. Health service implants are manufactured by about a dozen companies, many of them US-based. Although British prices have been lower than elsewhere in Europe and the US, they have risen recently. The researchers, from the John Radcliffe Hospital and Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, both in Oxford, and Birmingham Orthopaedic Hospital, claim that while a 'perfectly satisfactory' hip replacement could be marketed for about Pounds 100, prices in the UK vary from Pounds 250 to more than Pounds 1,000. Knee-replacement joints costing about Pounds 300 to manufacture were selling for between Pounds 700 and Pounds 1,500. About 40,000 hip-replacement operations a year are performed in Britain. Many hospitals, says the report, have stopped replacing joints this financial year because they have run out of money. The report says this is 'most unsatisfactory when cheaper hips are available and waiting lists are so long'. Long-term clinical results over 10 years showed that failure rates of some of the cheapest models on the market were less than 1 per cent a year.</p>

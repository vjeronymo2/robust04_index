			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- No new ambassador  to Russia was named after Anatol Taranu's recent resignation.  Alexandru Buruian, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, declared to  BASA that "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet nominated  any candidate to the post of ambassador to the Russian  Federation. Decisions of this type are first examined by state  leaders," he mentioned. Buruian affirmed that the views of the  future ambassador on the problem of the 14th Army's withdrawal  will not constitute a criterion of selection for the future  chief of the Moldovan diplomatic mission to Moscow. "The fact  that previously the Moldovan delegation at the negotiations was  headed by the ex-ambassador to Russia Anatol; scan was rather a  coincidence. In my opinion, the activity of the ambassador  could have been more efficient if he had not led the Moldovan  party at the negotiations. The activity of the ambassador to  Russia should involve all aspects of the Moldovan-Russian  relations, while the 14th Army problem is just one element of  these relations," stressed the Moldovan vice-minister of foreign  affairs.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Making the write impression Do you need to dash off a quick note to creditors, angry customers or your bank manager? Or do you have to phrase a tactful redundancy letter? CCA Software believes it can save small companies an average of eight man-hours a week with its new software package for writing letters quickly and correctly. The latter aspect is highlighted by CCA, which notes that sub-standard letters cost UK business millions of pounds a year in lost orders. CCA's Effective Letters package, with a database of 400 letters, aims to cover almost all the correspondence needs of companies. It is compatible with all leading word processing software. 'What we have set out to do is try to assist firms to fight back against the serious decline in the standards of correspondence,' says Mike Cowley, a CCA director. Effective Letters costs Pounds 29.95 plus VAT, with Pounds 1.50 postage and packaging. CCA hopes to bring out foreign language versions. CCA: UK, 061 480 9811.</p>

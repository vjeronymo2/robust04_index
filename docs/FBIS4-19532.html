[passage omitted]    So far, Geneva has officially applied to house the new WTO.  However, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told journalists  that he wants to prepare the Federal Government's application  for Bonn. If there are no reservations by the ministries  concerned, the cabinet could decide on Bonn's application for  the WTO headquarters before the summer recess, Rexrodt said. He  wants to announce the German application in a letter to  Sutherland in order to document Germany's interest in the WTO  seat for the preparatory committee.    As a former capital, Bonn meets all the requirements,  Rexrodt  said, promoting his proposal. It has the necessary  administrative and conference capacities, and most of the WTO  countries already have diplomatic missions in Bonn. What also  speaks in Bonn's favor is that no major international  organization has its seat in Germany at the moment, which has a  tradition of advocating free world trade and is one of the  largest trading nations in the world.    The Swiss delegation in Marrakesh was astonished at  Germany's  interest in the WTO seat. The Swiss Government is taking Bonn's  application, competing with Geneva, seriously. Experts say that  trying to keep the WTO in Geneva might prove expensive for  Switzerland. A new office building will also be needed in  Geneva, because the existing GATT headquarters will be too small  for the WTO. Sutherland wants to discuss conditions with the  competitors over the next few months. In accordance with its  share in world trade, Germany is paying some 12 percent toward  the cost of GATT and the future WTO. The new organization is to  start work as early as 1 January 1995.</p>

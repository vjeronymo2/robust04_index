			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Attention on rates THE MARKETS' focus this week will clearly be on the prospects for reductions in French and German interest rates, writes James Blitz. The 15 basis point cut in German money market rates on January 7 has eased tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism in the past ten days. The French franc briefly traded above FFr3.38 on Friday, nearly five centimes above its ERM floor. The Irish authorities have managed to cut money market rates without endangering the punt, and the Danish krone is - as yet - unscathed by the political crisis following Mr Poul Schluter's resignation. But there is a strong feeling in the market that the Bundesbank needs to ease policy again, either this Thursday or at its council meeting on February 4th, if tensions are not to return to the system. A factor affecting the Bundesbank's decisions will be the talks on a solidarity pact between the German government, opposition, employers and trade unions to finance the soaring cost of German unification. Members of Germany's ruling coalition government claim to have made 'huge progress' in finalising proposals, and plans will be presented to the parliamentary parties tomorrow. Attention will also focus on whether the Bank of France now reverses its recent rise in official interest rates, when it officially intervenes in the domestic market today and on Thursday. Short-dated interest rates are still at between 11 1/2 and 12 per cent, and commercial banks are under growing pressure to pass these rises onto the retail sector. The prospect of European interest rate cuts is certain to give the dollar a firm underpinning, despite narrow range trading last week. Mr Bill Clinton's inaugural speech as US President on Wednesday will be closely scrutinised for any indications its gives of plans to improve the country's economy with a fiscal stimulus.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Observer: Same old story It might be out of bounds and a soft target. But Kamlesh Bahl, who took over as boss of the Equal Opportunities Commission yesterday, has already fired off a stiff letter to one of the dustier corners of the British establishment which still discriminates quite openly against women. Ms Bahl says she was humiliated last week, when meeting a friend at the Oxford and Cambridge Club in London's Pall Mall, to discover that, as a woman, she had to wait downstairs for her male escort and, later, could only drink her coffee in a certain corner of the building. Sadly, says Ms Bahl, the EOC is powerless to do anything about private clubs, such as the Oxford and Cambridge, which still bar women from full membership.</p>

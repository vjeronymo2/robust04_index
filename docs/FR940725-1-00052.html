			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The JAA believes that requiring a continued flight capability would preclude the operation of single-engine airplanes. Also, the commenter believes that airplane size and stall speed provide characteristics that permit safe landings in the event of an inoperative engine for single-engine airplanes and smaller multiengine airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter points out that between the two extremes of the transport category airplane and the single-engine airplane lies the light twin-engine reciprocating airplanes and turbine engine airplanes, ranging from four seats to nine and from 4,000 to 12,500 pounds. The commenter notes that, for these types of airplanes, it would be burdensome to require compliance with full net flight path obstacle clearance. In the commenter's opinion, a safe forced landing becomes less satisfactory with increased takeoff weight, involving longer stopping distances even for the same landing speed. The commenter notes that the twin-engine airplanes have other significant adverse characteristics compared to single-engine airplanes. First, an engine failure is twice as probable; second, asymmetric power demands immediate pilot action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also points out that the inability to continue flight with one engine inoperative creates the following situation: the chance of a second engine failure is increased; a suitable site for an emergency landing is reduced; and the pilot resists the inevitable forced landing and tries to maintain flight. Training under more favorable conditions may have taught the pilot to expect success in those situations. In unfavorable conditions, attempts to maintain flight may lead to loss of airspeed at high asymmetric power and, commonly, loss of directional control that results in a stall/spin accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter advocates certification and operating criteria for multiengine airplanes that blend the performance requirements for a single-engine airplane and a transport category airplane. The commenter believes that the existing requirements accept a limited period of risk just before and just after liftoff, where engine failure may not be fully accounted for. The commenter believes that the application of WAT limits clearly accounts for actual conditions, although the climb gradient requirements are lower than the requirements of part 25/JAR 25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter proposes no distinction between reciprocating and turbine engines. In the commenter's opinion, the WAT criteria should be imposed, where applicable, as limitations through the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter does not believe that such proposals would involve costs disproportionate to the benefit. The commenter suggests that the comment from the Small Airplane Airworthiness Review Conference, held October 22&hyph;26, 1984, that such criteria would ``eliminate the certification of an entire class of airplanes,'' is an exaggeration. The proposals are achievable, in the commenter's view, by typical modern light twin-engine airplanes with realistic payloads, particularly the more significant executive/air taxi airplanes. The adoption of the WAT concept, in the commenter's opinion, would instill a greater awareness of performance consideration in pilots from an early stage of their training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also believes that the requirements on climb and handling qualities of the present &sect;&sect;23.65 and 23.67 are illogical and unreasonable. The commenter recommends using WAT criteria so that it applies equally to all airplane operations because it offers improved airplane capability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter points out that manufacturers of ``WAT type'' airplanes routinely determine performance under a wide range of conditions. The commenter also notes that flight manuals produced to the widely accepted General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) specification already contain performance data beyond the minimum requirements of part 23. In the commenter's opinion, additional testing or data scheduling create no additional costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the necessity of applying WAT criteria to other than transport and commuter airplanes, the commenter notes that present draft JAR 23 applies WAT limits only to piston-engine airplanes above 6,000 pounds and turbine-engine airplanes. The JAR Operations Study Group proposes applying WAT limits to all JAR 23 airplanes in commercial operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, the FAA studied the accident record of reciprocating engine-powered, multiengine part 23 airplanes of over 6,000 pounds maximum takeoff weight with a substantial fleet size. The FAA completed the study using the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident briefs and evaluated those statistics over the study period of the individual airplanes. The statistics show the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Over 100 accidents and 200 fatalities occurred due to engine failure during the study period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Forty-seven of the engine failure accidents occurred because the pilot failed to maintain flying speed and/or directional control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

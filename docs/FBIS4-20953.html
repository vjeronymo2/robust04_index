			<p>Traffickers   <F P=102>   PY2903192294 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 16 Mar 94 Section 2  p 1 </F>  <F P=103> PY2903192294 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz PRESENCIA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Cobija, 15 Mar (ANF) -- According to a "sincere and  painful confession" made by Colonel Mario Flores Alanez, the new  Pando Police Department commander who has become the terror of  drug traffickers and criminals in less than one month, the  passivity of officials has allowed drug traffickers to  infiltrate the Pando Police Department.    Commenting on recent counternarcotics operations in  Trinidad--joint forces operations that took everyone here by  surprise--Col. Flores said: "As I have reported to my  superiors, I must confess that our command did not offer any  guarantees. Drug traffickers were informed about our actions.  I have expressly requested the transfer and even discharge of  some officers charged with specific felonies."    According to the police chief, the infiltration of drug  traffickers has caused the failure of at least two operations in  recent weeks. In view of this situation, he was compelled to  make changes in the Police Intelligence Department. Only then  was he able to arrest eight drug distributors. Nevertheless,  and despite the adoption of strict measures, at the last minute  he almost lost his prisoners when some relatives and groups  hired by drug traffickers promoted a riot to try to free those  under arrest.    Police are looking into this riot against the police, which  was intended to look like a spontaneous action. Col. Flores  said that at first even the local civic committee was involved,  "but fortunately everything has been cleared up."    Based mainly on the testimony of those arrested, it has been  established that in Pando there is an organization operating in  different circles with the direct or indirect support of groups  in power that are acting knowingly or unknowingly.    The investigation started with the arrest of drug users who  identified the places where the merchandise was sold and drug  distributors. After their arrest, the latter in turn supplied  information on the drug distribution networks and the obtaining  of supplies from the country's interior. As a result, one of  the leaders of this group was arrested in Trinidad. He has been  identified as Desiderio Rodriguez, who two weeks ago transported  a cocaine shipment from Santa Cruz to Cochabamba.    Rodriguez reportedly supplied valuable information on drug  suppliers and drug trafficking financiers, among whom are  well-known people in the region. It has been learned that a  common fund was established to purchase drugs and "huge" profits  were distributed among the investors who pretend to ignore how  their money is illegally used.    The investigations in Pando will continue in greater depth  because it has been confirmed that a Special Antinarcotics Force  unit has been installed in Trinidad.</p>

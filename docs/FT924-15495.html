			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / 'We're fishermen, not bloody accountants' MOTION FROM SCARBOROUGH: (Tory MP John Sykes elected 1992) This conference congratulates the Danish people on their rejection of the Maastricht treaty and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to cease any further moves towards political and monetary union. MR DAVE BECK, a Con-servative member of North Yorkshire County Council, is in blunt and combative mood. 'Jacques Delors? I don't trust him. There is no froth and bubble here. We don't want strangers meddling in the affairs of this nation. The British people are saying enough is enough.' Mr Beck is the author of the Scarborough and Whitby Constituency Conservative Association's motion - approved unanimously on July 6 by the 18 members of the association's executive committee. Mr Beck says that Tory grassroots opinion - fuelled by the narrowness of the French referendum vote and the diplomatic shadow boxing with the Germans - is firmly behind him. 'The government can try and cajole and use the three-line whip but the people will not have Maastricht,' he declares. Such sentiment can easily flourish in a town like Scarborough, a quintessential northern resort with its mixture of fading Victorian elegance and fish and chips. Here people claim to have spent their history resisting foreign invasions. The pubs have names that include Albion, Britannia and Lord Nelson. Feelings have risen to the surface by the harbour, where the local fishing industry blames its decline on Europe. 'This is Europe,' spits Bob Walker, a fisherman and loyal Conservative supporter for 30 years, emerging from his trawler with two hefty files - the Eurolog book he has to fill in every time he fishes in EC waters. 'We're fishermen, not bloody accountants.' His view, shared widely by local fishermen, is to blame the distant EC bureaucracy - and the servility of the British government and navy - not just for stifling his work with paperwork and quotas but for discriminating in favour of non-British fishermen such as the Spaniards. 'We should police our own waters, govern ourselves,' says Mr Walker, for whom the word subsidiarity is an empty concept dreamed up by politicians. Some British fishermen are threatening to burn their EC log books outside the Tory conference next week. In the office of Mr Robert Ashman, the Conservative agent and secretary, on the first floor of the elegant Victorian building housing the Scarborough Conservative club, the portraits of Mr Major are outnumbered by those of Churchill and Mrs Thatcher. But Mr Ashman is no fanatical Euro-sceptic and is anxious to point out that not all local Conservatives are anti-European. 'Undoubtedly there are some who want nothing to do with Europe, but they are in a minority. The majority simply are worried by a sudden rush into Europe. There is no hard and fast anti-European attitude.' Downstairs in the bar, opinion among the elderly rank and file - many of whom had no knowledge of next week's motion - bears out his assessment. Mr Ron Meade declares himself 'all for Europe', as he downs a pint of local bitter.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] An unattributed article in the 3  February Paris daily LIBERATION quotes Rally for the Republic  (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac as stating to Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur that he "approves and supports without reservations the  government's course of action." Chirac was attempting to quell  his party's criticism of Balladur on the occasion of the  announcement of the prime minister's economic stimulation plan.  Nevertheless, the article contends that, given the presidential  election timetable, the truce between the two officials is  "fragile." The following issues may yet rekindle the "polemics"  between the Chirac and Balladur partisans.    Opinions are divided on Bosnia. While Pierre Lellouche,  Chirac's diplomatic adviser, thinks French troops should be  withdrawn from the area, others in the RPR advocate armed  intervention. Balladur's entourage is much more "prudent," for  the prime minister knows that President Francois Mitterrand is  reluctant to discuss a withdrawal publicly.    On Africa, Chirac opposed the devaluation of the CFA franc  which, he believes, stands in major contradiction with one of  the pillars of Gaullist policy and will provoke serious domestic  troubles in the countries involved.    Balladur was careful not to oppose Mitterrand's decision to  stop nuclear testing to avoid a confrontation with the  president. However, neo-Gaullists consider nuclear tests a  symbol of de Gaulle's strategy of deterrence.    When Chirac maintained in the past that Balladur's  government was called upon only to manage cohabitation because  important reforms could only be enacted after the presidential  elections, Balladur contradicted him, saying that his government  was elected to provide a "new breath" for the country. The RPR  now criticizes Balladur's stimulation plan as "insufficient,"  while the prime minister himself attempts to "put the brakes" on  any significant reforms to preserve his popularity. According to  the article, Chirac's "critical" support is designed to show  that Balladur "is decidedly unable to fill the presidential  function to which he aspires without saying so."    The European Parliament elections are a final bone of  contention. The prime minister flip-flopped in first agreeing to  head the list of the majority and then refusing to do so, for  fear that the elections would turn into a test for the  government. Similarly, Chirac first agreed to his own candidacy  and then rejected it when the RPR's partner, the Union for  French Democracy (UDF), refused to support it. In the end,  Balladur gave up, affirming that the issue depends on  negotiations between parties. However, the prime minister is  aware that the cohesion of his majority, and, hence, the  presidential race, are at stake.</p>

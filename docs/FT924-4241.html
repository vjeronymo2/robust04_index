			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Observer: Banking on Merchant bankers are always terribly discreet, so it's impossible to know whether Warburg's Sir David Scholey really has ruled himself out of the race for the governorship of the Bank of England by accepting a directorship of GEC. But that is what many may suppose. Given that a decision on the bank job is expected before the year-end, it would have been easy to delay his membership of the GEC board for a few more months. Perhaps he's playing hard to get, but Ladbroke's Paul Austin for one thinks that Scholey is no longer a contender. He stopped taking bets on the governorship stakes yesterday. Before the GEC announcement, Ladbroke had Scholey as four to five odds-on favourite, followed by Sir David Walker, Eddie George and Rodney Galpin. News of Galpin's early retirement from the Standard Chartered chairmanship is unlikely to increase his chances of being first at the Threadneedle St post, and Walker still looks the clear favourite over home-stable candidate Eddie George. Even so there could be some surprises in the final furlong. A couple of longshots which might be worth backing are Sir Christopher Hogg, boss of Courtaulds and Reuters, and Sir Jeremy Morse, who steps down from the chairmanship of Lloyds Bank in February. The problem is that, like Scholey perhaps, they might well not want the job in its present form.</p>

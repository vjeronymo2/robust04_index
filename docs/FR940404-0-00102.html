			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a general policy, the Bureau strives to locate inmates in institutions consistent with their security needs within reasonable proximity to a release residence. However, the Bureau's designation policy also allows for exceptions to be made, based upon management variables, e.g., institution capacity and individual inmate security needs. The generally lower flat rate fees for ITS calls should benefit such inmates. The regulations already contain provisions for the placement of collect calls or for calls at government expense in cases of compelling circumstances. See 28 CFR 540.105(d). The Bureau therefore finds no reason to adopt this commenter's recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. One inmate commenter objected to the proposed rule, claiming that the telephone installed in her housing unit was not accessible to wheelchair-bound or visually-impaired inmates. The Bureau assures this commenter that it is Bureau policy to make every institution accessible to disabled inmates, including the use of telephone equipment. Institution staff have now resolved this commenter's problem by adjusting the telephone location to permit access by the disabled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau notes that another commenter claiming various disabilities, visual and psychological, raised no objection to accessibility. As noted above, the Bureau is committed to making reasonable accommodations to meet the needs of all disabled inmates in providing telephone access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. Commenters objected that the proposed rule did not define terms such as ``emergency'' or ``rehabilitative goals.'' A commenter claimed that staff was not available to inmates on a twenty-four hour a day, seven-days a week basis. The Bureau wishes to assure this commenter that every Bureau facility is staffed on a twenty-four hour a day, seven-day a week basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for a definition of rehabilitative goals, the final rule does not include the term rehabilitation as a grounds for rejection of a telephone number from an inmate's telephone list. The Bureau notes, however, that while rehabilitation remains an important goal for the Bureau's management of inmates, a specific definition cannot be given because each situation is characterized by the facts and circumstances existing for a particular inmate. For example, an inmate's unit team will work with the inmate concerning areas of interest to that inmate in preparation for the inmate's own self-improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the definition of an emergency, this also must be predicated on the given situation, e.g., loss of contact with the family or death of a family member. See 28 CFR 540.101(e) and 540.105(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k. A commenter related an incident where she placed a collect call to a Senator's office from an institution where the ITS is not yet available and was asked for a return number, which she provided. The commenter alleged that she never received a return call and was subsequently informed by institution staff that she should no longer call the Senator's office collect. We are unable to address this complaint as it is unrelated to the proposed rule and is more properly addressed through the Administrative Remedy Program discussed previously. However, we note that, under the amended regulations, inmates may choose to submit telephone numbers for Senators and other elected officials on their telephone lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> l. A commenter objected that the proposed rule was unfair to inmates who were medically idle (i.e., unable to participate in a work assignment because of a medical condition). If a medically idle inmate is also an ``inmate without funds,'' as defined herein, then the final rule accommodates this comment, because all inmates without funds may make some collect calls or have the Bureau pay for the call in a compelling circumstance. See 28 CFR 540.105(b) and 540.105(d)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m. Former &sect;540.105 is removed because its provisions are now incorporated in other portions of the final rule or are no longer necessary, due to changes in the Bureau's discipline policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed by OMB pursuant to Executive Order 12866. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 28 CFR Parts 540 and 545  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prisoners. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the rulemaking authority vested in the Attorney General in 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and delegated to the Director, Bureau of Prisons in 28 CFR 0.96(p), parts 540 and 545 in subchapter C of 28 CFR, chapter V are amended as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

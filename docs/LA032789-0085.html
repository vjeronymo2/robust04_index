			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FALL FROM PALM SPRINGS BALCONY HOSPITALIZES STUDENT  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Simi Valley college student was in serious condition at a Palm  Springs hospital Sunday, recovering from head injuries suffered when she fell  from a hotel balcony during spring break revelry.  </P> <P> A nursing supervisor at Desert Hospital said Shelli Hoyt, a student at Moorpark  College, remained in the hospital's intensive care unit after undergoing  surgery. Her condition was reported as critical Saturday but had improved by  Sunday.  </P> <P> Palm Springs police said Hoyt fell from the second-floor balcony of her room at  the Dunes Hotel about 1:30 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Ray Ghrabety, a desk clerk at the hotel, said a security guard told Hoyt, who  had been drinking, not to sit on the balcony railing. But, he said, she did not  move.  </P> <P> "It was a straightforward accident, as far as we could tell," a police  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Two hours before the fall, police wearing riot gear had gone to the hotel to  break up a fistfight among about 15 young men, authorities said. The fight  spread throughout the hotel and police threatened to close it before the  disruption subsided.  </P> <P> Ghrabety said only about 15 guests remained Sunday afternoon at the 128-room  hotel. He said the hotel planned to hire several additional security guards for  next weekend, when college students celebrating spring break a week later are  expected to arrive.  </P> <P> Despite the fall and the death of a 22-year-old Santa Ana woman in a traffic  accident 2 days earlier, police consider the weeklong celebration by college  students to have been relatively quiet.  </P></p>

Trade with each of the partners is characterized by the  following data:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The trade regimes, the volumes and  conditions of mutual deliveries, and methods of tariff and  nontariff regulation were defined. The creation of Russian trade  representations in a number of states of the Commonwealth was  envisioned.    Agreement was reached with virtually all the CIS states on  employing a free trade regime. At the same time, however, an  export tariff on certain goods, as an exception to the free  trade regime, acted as a regulator of Russian export. Export  duties are imposed on the export from Russia of food, mineral  raw materials and fuel, ferrous and nonferrous metals,  chemicals, timber and pulp and paper goods, leather and textile  raw materials, aviation equipment, and weapons. Motor vehicles,  equipment, and other output are exported duty free. On the  whole, for most goods of Russian export on which export tariffs  were imposed, duties were from 10 to 30 percent of the level of  world prices for these goods.    The need to satisfy Russia's economic interests accounts for  the existence of duties on goods exported from Russia to the CIS  countries, since prices for many hard currency types of output  on Russia's domestic market are lower than world prices.  However, the decision was made to supply energy media from  Russia at prices oriented to world prices.    Tariff and nontariff regulation of Russia's trade relations  with the Commonwealth countries enabled trade exchange to be  normalized and balanced. But the crisis situation in the  economy, the drop in production, and the reorientation of  enterprises' economic ties to the distant abroad caused Russia's  trade turnover with the CIS states to continue to drop. The  trade volume in 1993 totaled only 50 percent of the 1991 level.    The mechanism used to supply state needs for the major types  of output and ensure mutual benefit in trade is a mechanism of  equivalent deliveries on a balanced basis, which is figured on  the basis of the price levels of the world market. In 1993,  using this mechanism the overall trade turnover with the CIS  countries totaled about 7 billion dollars.    In 1993 Russia had to regulate payment relations with the  CIS  states by instituting correspondent accounts of central  (national) banks in the Central Bank of Russia. This prevented  the uncontrolled release of circulating rubles into the Russian  market, which was a powerful source of inflation in Russia.  Payment-credit relations were also put in order and sums of  technical credits granted by Russia were converted to state  credits with liquidation conditions close to world conditions.    The debts of the CIS states owed to Russia which were  converted to a state debt totaled R2.3 trillion (roughly 5  billion U.S. dollars). And the possibility of paying off some of  the debt by transferring property rights (stock, securities, and  the like) to enterprises and objects which were of interest to  Russia was envisioned at the same time.    Questions related to allowing payment-accounts relations  between the states' enterprises is of definite significance in  Russia's economic ties with the CIS countries.    At the end of 1993, the overall debt of enterprises and  organizations of the CIS countries for goods supplied under  direct ties from Russia totaled about R3.5 trillion, and of that  roughly R1.5 trillion made up the debt to enterprises of  Russia's fuel and energy complex.    (Above based on Goskomstat [Committee for State  Statistics] of Russia data).    When the Issue Was Being Composed    The large debt of Ukraine and Belarus to Russia caused  a number of serious problems with deliveries of natural gas to  these republics. If the debts are not repaid in a very short  amount of time, a substantial reduction in these deliveries is  possible.   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-030C-02A>           Change in Proportions of Main Trade Partners in Russia's </FIG>     <H3>  Nonpayments Have Gone Beyond the Borders of Countries and  Encompass Enterprises Working Under Direct Ties </H3>   By the start of 1994, overall creditor debts at enterprises  of industry, construction, transport, and agriculture totaled  R47.0 trillion. That included R16.4 trillion or 35 percent  overdue. Debtor debts totaled R43.8 trillion, which included  R18.1 trillion or 41 percent overdue.    Accounts with enterprises of the Russian Federation  accounted  for the largest part of the overdue creditor debts, R16.0  trillion or 98 percent. Accounts with enterprises of the CIS and  the Baltic Region under direct ties accounted for R0.3 trillion  or 1.5 percent.    Overdue debtor debts under accounts between enterprises of  the Russian Federation came out at R16.5 trillion, or 91 percent  of its total amount. Overdue debts of enterprises located on the  territory of the CIS countries and the Baltic Region under  direct ties with enterprises of Russia totaled R0.6 trillion, or  3.4 percent.    The following data characterize the condition of  payment-accounts relations of enterprises and organizations of  industry, construction, transport, and agriculture of Russia  under direct ties with enterprises located on the territory of  the countries which are members of the CIS and the countries of  the Baltic Region:    Overdue Debts, (in billions of rubles)   Country             Debtor Debts                  Creditor Debts                       As of 1        As of 1        As of 1        As of 1                      October 1993   January 1994   October 1993   January 1994    Accounts of Russia's Enterprises with Enterprises of the CIS Countries and  the Baltics   Overall             479.7          619.5          224.5          252.9   Including with  Enterprises of  the Following  Countries:   Ukraine             172.3          208.5          95.8           96.5   Belarus             71.2           96.2           22.4           24.5   Uzbekistan          45.8           50.0           11.3           12.2   Kazakhstan          115.8          169.2          72.8           85.4   Georgia             6.1            2.7            1.3            5.6   Azerbaijan          7.7            11.7           3.0            4.8   Moldova             0.1            11.6           1.6            3.4   Kyrgyzstan          6.7            7.6            1.5            1.1   Tajikistan          8.0            11.6           4.0            2.8   Armenia             2.3            2.7            3.7            4.2   Turkmenistan        19.1           29.1           3.0            3.9   Latvia              8.7            11.7           1.7            3.6   Lithuania           4.7            4.1            1.6            4.2   Estonia             1.2            2.8            0.8            0.7</p>

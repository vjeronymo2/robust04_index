			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Tory jury still out over delicate balancing act IT WAS designed as the Budget which would demonstrate that the government had restored its grip on economic policy. Last night the government's supporters at Westminster suspended judgment on whether it would succeed. They knew Mr Norman Lamont had faced unpalatable choices. They were unsure if he had made the right ones. The toughest Budget for more than a decade - albeit with most of the pain deferred - was greeted publicly by Conservative MPs with a mixture of weary resignation and dutiful applause. Privately, their thoughts mirrored the behind-the-scenes debate between and Mr Lamont and Mr John Major which produced the final delicate balancing act between nurturing economic recovery and tackling the budget deficit. There was general relief that Mr Major had prevailed in insisting that the inevitable tax increases should bite only a year from now. There was agreement that Mr Lamont had been right to insist that the financial markets would not be satisfied with vague promises - that the increases had to be spelt out and in large part legislated for now. Some wanted more pain now. Others would have preferred less overall. But most thought that the balance had been struck as skilfully as possible in such difficult times. Yet few were confident that the foreign exchange dealers or the voters would agree with them. This, in the words of one member of the cabinet, was a 'time-will-tell-Budget'. Over the next few days Mr Lamont will sell the Budget for all he is worth. He is fighting for his political life. Last night the telephone lines between 11 Downing Street and the offices of leading newspaper editors were humming. The chancellor may have bracketed newspapers and sewage together in his Budget speech but he knows he needs support. He has probably enhanced his chances of holding on to the chancellorship. Most of November's decisions have been pre-empted. Few missed his deliberate decision to flaunt his Euro-sceptic credentials in the Budget speech. The 'soft' rebels against the Maastricht treaty who Mr Major needs to win back are in his chancellor's constituency. The prime minister's associates say he will wait until July before making any decision on cabinet reshuffles. Cabinet colleagues were supportive if grim-faced about Mr Lamont's efforts. They too believe that the government's first objective must be to show it is no longer simply a victim of events. But a scathing Commons attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dispelled any illusions that it would bring short-term popularity. Mr Smith's comment that it was a 'shameful Budget from a cynical party' was followed by the private admission of one minister that Mr Lamont had offered no more or less than an 'acknowledgment of the depressing reality'. Underlying the concern was the realisation that the government has reneged on the spirit, if not the letter, of its general election pledges. Back in 1981, when similar decisions had been made, the government could blame it on Labour's mismanagement during the 1970s. Now Lord Lawson - a Conservative former chancellor - is the only scapegoat. So general enthusiasm (some thought Mr Lamont should be tougher sooner) for the decision to defer the extension of valued added tax, the increase in National Insurance contributions and the reduction in mortgage interest relief was tempered by concern over the medium-term outlook. As ministers and Tory MPs studied the fine print they were hit by the realisation that two years of substantial tax increases will still leave a budget deficit of Pounds 30bn by the time of the next general election in 1997. There was no despair on the Tory back benches last night. The measures to help small businesses and exporters won genuine acclaim. But the party signalled that it would applaud Mr Lamont with conviction only when economic recovery became a reality. If the Budget heralds another false dawn, the fate of the chancellor - and of the government - will be altogether more precarious.</p>

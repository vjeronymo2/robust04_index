			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafi' al-Falahi: "Question to United Nations: </F> Who Violates UN Resolutions; 1,318 Days of Blockade; They Have  Blockaded Iraq and Reaped Frustration; They Will Lose"]    [Text] The enemies' lies, their feeble pretexts, and their  policies to dominate all peoples who respect their "bread" and  who preserve their dignity have fallen as tree leaves fall in  autumn when they are shaken by the wind. A total of 1,318 days  of the tyrannical blockade imposed on the Iraqi people has  passed, pulling away the masks and exposing the real faces  behind them. The roles of many of the "minor forces" have been  exposed. These forces have colluded with the "major powers" and  have dropped the world into a maelstrom of bribery, corruption,  intrigue, sabotage, and premeditated murder, thus turning the  days since 6 August 1990 to this day into phases soaked with the  blood of the Iraqi people and with their steadfastness in the  face of an unjust blockade. This blockade has blackened the  history of all those who claim to be civilized and humane and  who preach justice and the right of peoples to live honorably  and peacefully.    Since the enemies imposed their tyrannical blockade, the  Iraqi people have become accustomed to the "farcical review"  that takes place whenever the Security Council holds its  "sessions" to debate lifting the blockade imposed on their  country and to examine the provisions of the unjust resolutions.  In these sessions, the U.S. and British representatives  alternate roles ordinarily, and the other members tag behind,  one time with threats and another with inducements. The same  "cliche" that is announced by the Security Council every two  months is proclaimed anew, namely that Iraq defies Security  Council resolutions and international consensus and is  determined not to carry out its obligations! What follows is a  resolution to carry on with the blockade imposed on Iraq. As for  the Iraqi people's hardship: the sick who seek drugs and  children whom death snatches by the thousands because they  cannot find milk, medicine, or food to keep the ghost of death  away; as for the "unjust" resolutions that Iraq has implemented;  as for the facilities Iraq has offered, and the cooperation Iraq  has shown to all UN committees, including the "inspection  teams"--cooperation shown despite the "arrogance" and the  "disdain" displayed by many of these teams, which are often  supported by CIA officers, such as U.S. Intelligence Officer  David Kay, Karen Jansen, the woman who initiated the Department  of Agriculture crisis, her colleague, Mark Silver, and  others--as for all this, it has no place in the Security  Council's calculations, thanks to the power of the Americans and  the British who run this council and who do not see any ethical  or legal motive to lift the blockade against Iraq.    What is Iraq required to do in order to persuade the  Security  Council to lift the blockade?    The answer demands more than a pause to recall numerous  junctures of the course of Iraq's relations with the Security  Council and to underline the goals of the 30-state aggression  against Iraq and the ability of the Iraqi people to stand fast  and firm in their national battle.    To begin, one must say that U.S. domination of the UN  Security Council is the seat of the malady. This council, which  came into existence initially to be the refuge for every needy  and the supporter of every oppressed, has turned with time into  a mere caretaker of the U.S., Zionist, and imperialist  interests. This council waits for its resolutions to come from  the U.S. Department of State because it is an agency that  follows this department loyally. When the aggression against  Iraq started with the ill-reputed blockade Resolution 661 of 6  August 1990, the Security Council was declaring very explicitly  and openly its full alignment with the U.S.-Zionist scheme to  strike Iraq, to kill its people, and to destroy all that the  Iraqi people had accomplished economically, politically, and  scientifically. Perhaps what happened during the military  aggression against Iraq is the best proof of the ugly  exploitation of the Security Council which issued the official  resolution authorizing the aggression states to use all the  means of death, devastation, and destruction invented by their  sick minds to damage gravely 84 percent of Iraq's infrastructure  with 88.5 million kg of explosives dumped on Iraq during 1,008  hours of uninterrupted military aggression. Their main goal was  to destroy whatever pertains to life on Iraq's soil.  <H5>  What Do They Want? </H5>   Again, we return to the question: what do the Americans want  of Iraq and what does the Security Council want in order to lift  the blockade?    The facts assert that the United States has used the  Security  Council to implement its evil schemes from the time the blockade  was imposed and throughout the subsequent phases of aggression  that followed, and up to this day. Perhaps, a review of some of  what happened between the council and Iraq will clarify the  premeditated schemes against Iraq.    At the outset, they said that Iraq had to implement  Resolution 687 on the destruction of weapons and that the  Security Council would then implement what is required of it, as  shown by paragraph 22 of the said resolution which calls for  lifting the blockade against the Iraqi people as soon as it is  determined that Iraq has implemented the other paragraphs of the  resolution. Ambassador Rolf Ekeus came repeatedly to Iraq (as an  envoy of the UN secretary general and as chairman of the special  committee) to supervise personally Iraq's implementation of this  resolution. He acknowledged repeatedly in July 1993 Iraq's  implementation of 95 percent of the resolution. Ekeus also  asserted through the committees he supervises that Iraq is free  of plants that produce "chemical weapons" and that it has no  capability to produce "biological weapons." But what was  happening at the Security Council?    The council was listening to none of this. In every meeting  it held (every two months) to debate lifting the blockade  against Iraq, it extended the blockade, alleging that Iraq had  not adhered to the resolution. When they found that clinging to  the same cliche became laughable, they said that Iraq had to  implement Resolution 715 on future inspection and followup. To  create tension, last July they sent an inspection team led by  U.S. Intelligence Officer Mark Silver who sealed with red wax  two Iraqi plants that produce missiles within the permitted  range. They then proceeded to allege that Iraq rejects future  observation. At this point, the enemies' preparation to launch a  new aggression against Iraq had been completed. So, Foreign  Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf notified the Security Council  through a documented letter that Iraq does not reject the  principle of future inspection in accordance with Resolution 687  but that it awaits the Council's acknowledgment of its rights  that are stipulated in the same resolution, in paragraph 22  specifically. These rights are supposed to lead to lifting the  blockade against Iraq when it implements the provisions of this  resolution, and Iraq has done so.    Ekeus returned to Iraq to "contain the crisis" they  fabricated. He made statements in Baghdad before Arab and  foreign media, asserting his full conviction that Iraq had  adhered to Resolution 687 and saying that he would submit a  report to that effect to the Security Council so it would  consider lifting the blockade. But barely had Ekeus arrived in  Bahrain when he made statements contradicting what he had said  in Baghdad. So, the Security Council continued to reiterate the  same phrases about Iraq's failure to adhere to its resolutions,  thus supporting statements made by U.S. and British officials  (Clinton, Christopher, John Major, Douglas Hurd, and others).  <H5>  Fallen Goals </H5>   Meanwhile, Iraqi diplomacy moved along more than one axis to  explain the true nature of the matter and to expose the Security  Council's false allegations and its procrastination in  implementing what is required of it, considering that Iraq has  fulfilled all its obligations. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz  went again to the United Nations and explained in a detailed and  precise manner all that could possibly reflect the true picture  of the situation. "Specialized technical" Iraqi delegations did  the same. Thus, it was time to compel the Security Council to  welcome Iraq's approval of the resolution on future observation.  Ekeus came to Iraq again and said afterward: we have discussed  everything and nothing noteworthy is left. So, what should the  Security Council have done? Is it not its duty to issue a  resolution lifting the blockade?    What is the U.S. and British goal behind the continued  fabrication of crises between Iraq and the United Nations, and  what is the objective of their subsequent threat (and then  execution of the threat) to make their evil alliance strike Iraq  again (which it did in two repeat aggressions)?    The answer can be concluded by defining the U.S.-Zionist  objectives behind the 30-state aggression against Iraq:    First, the aggression sought to tell Iraq, and through it  the  Arab nation and all peoples aspiring for the independence of  their political and economic decisionmaking, that the  U.S.-Zionist-Western alliance is an alliance that possesses  enough power to deter whoever tries to deviate from this  alliance's policies and to stray from serving the  "U.S.-Zionist-Western" interests, which according to their  allegation guarantee world stability. These allegations have  been proved false beyond the shadow of a doubt, especially since  the aggression against Iraq and the subsequent U.S. unilateral  control of the world. This aggression has been followed by the  Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia issues, by the U.S.-drafted  Gaza-Jericho accords, and by the subsequent procrastination in  acknowledging the Palestinian people's rights.    Second, the U.S. political ruse has been exposed. The  Western  media has tried to promote this ruse, which is embodied in the  attempt to incite the Iraqi people against their national  leadership and to separate the Iraqi leadership from its people  during the "direct" military aggression, during the phase of  treason and treachery, and during the continued blockade.  Whoever acquaints himself with the dimensions of the destruction  that has hit the Iraqi people's homes and factories and all  their cultural and scientific accomplishments realizes without  any doubt that the Iraqi people are the target of all phases of  the aggression.    Third, the Iraqi people's realization that the blockade will  not be lifted by a resolution as long as the objectives of the  aggression remain unaccomplished has driven the enemies to  "employ their malice in all kinds of ways." From time to time,  they have confronted the world with new demands not mentioned in  Security Council resolutions. When they encounter an Iraq  standing fast in their faces, they begin to reiteterte, "Iraq  wants to test our resolve. It is still far from implementing the  Security Council resolutions." But the world has realized that  these allegations are false and illegitimate. What Iraq has not  agreed to is to be divided into three parts, which is what the  enemies want to do with central and southern Iraq now that  circumstances have helped them spread their control over  northern Iraq, where this control can never last. What Iraq has  not agreed to are the ill-reputed latitudes and longitudes, and  Iraq has the right to defend its soil and to protect its borders.    As our Leader President Saddam Husayn said in his historic  speech on occasion of the 73d anniversary of our valiant army,  the main reason that will lead to ending the blockade is that  the "deluded who are embroiled in treason and whose eyes have  been blinded by transgression imagine that lifting the blockade  against Iraq is a malicious political game or a lowly diplomatic  act which can be obstructed with bribery and with the illicit  spending of money. These people do not realize that the main  reason that will lead to ending the blockade is the Iraqi  people's steadfastness, their firm belief in their principles  and rights, their adherence to honor and virtue, and their  loyalty to their noble national, pan-Arab, and human goals."  <H5>  They Are Aware of Their Frustration </H5>   In an endeavor to discover the secret behind Iraq's  steadfastness and behind the failure of the objectives of the  aggression, the U.S. Department of Defense assigned Patrick  Clawson [name as transliterated], a strategic researcher, to  study the effects of the economic blockade on Iraq. Clawson's  conclusion was that Iraq has succeeded in achieving some sort of  economic stability without giving up its national pride. In an  endeavor to answer the question of how Iraq has been able to  accomplish this, Paul Lewis, a well-known U.S. journalist, said  in an article published in the NEW YORK [reference not verified]  some time ago that it is the Iraqi genius that has culminated  not only in digging a 565-km river but also in rebuilding all  that was destroyed and adding new structures and projects and,  moreover, in Iraq's ability to provide a security net for every  Iraqi family by distributing a reasonable amount of foodstuffs  that meet survival needs.    Is it reasonable that the international community should  continue to deal with a deep-rooted people such as the Iraqi  people in the poor manner the U.S. administration wants to  perpetuate?    The facts concluded from the actual developments that have  occurred from since the military aggression was launched against  Iraq to this day; our leadership's awareness of dimensions of  the ceaseless battle against the enemies; and this leadership's  constant educating of the people with what the various phases of  the aggression entail have strengthened the calm Iraqi logic,  turning it into a clear method which deals with the facts most  precisely and in a manner that serves Iraq's steadfastness. All  this has made the world realize that Iraq can never be a  meaningless figure. The legal justifications for a continued  blockade against Iraq have fallen. Here is France, which took  part in the alliance of aggression against Iraq, affirming these  days through a number of its officials, including Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, that Iraq has made great progress in  implementing UN resolutions. At the same time, French political  and information circles assert that France, along with a number  of Security Council members (China, Russia), does not want the  United Nations to invent new obstacles every time Iraq surpasses  an old obstacle. Numerous diplomats accuse the White House of  promoting these actions, which will inevitably encourage French  and European leaders to look for new horizons through which to  approach Iraq and its national issues, dealing with it at least  from the perspective of their national interests, which have  been harmed greatly by the blockade and the continued aggression  against Iraq.  <H5>  Blockade Will Not Last </H5>   Now, with the Security Council scheduled to debate the  continued blockade against Iraq in a couple of days, what more  can we say?    The truth is that even if U.S. policy manages to extend the  blockade for another period, the ultimate outcome will confirm  that the blockade has begun to narrow, to vanish, and to be  destroyed, especially since the world has realized that Iraq has  not stood idle throughout the past period of the unjust  blockade, which had been planned to kill Iraq's people with  starvation and disease, and since the world has also realized  that Iraq can do a lot to confront any new imperialist step that  adds another lock to the doors of the tyrannical blockade. The  doors of hope are as open to the Iraqi people today as they have  never been open in any of the 1,318 days of the blockade.  Through their action against the aggression and the continued  blockade, the Iraqi people can teach the enemies lesson after  lesson in the battle to end the tyrannical blockade and to  regain their distinguished role in life now that their country  has remained united and strong despite all the means of  treachery, aggression, and oppression used by the enemies  against this country. The milk embargo against Iraq's children;  the drug embargo against Iraq's patients, and the bread embargo  against Iraq's citizens will not last. All those who prevent the  Security Council from fulfilling its obligations to Iraq "will  reap the results of their ridiculous and malicious positions,"  as Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz asserted a few days ago.</p>

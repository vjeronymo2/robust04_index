			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] Government will temporarily suspend talks with the  National Democratic Front (NDF) if hostilities within the  communist party are not put to an end, a government negotiator  said yesterday.    The decision was reportedly made after the New People's Army  (NPA) claimed responsibility for the death of former leader  Leopoldo Mabilangan and after Luis Jalandoni NDF representative  to the talks and vice-chairman for international affairs, failed  to condemn the killing which was claimed by the NPA [New  People's Army] Melito Glor Command.    The negotiator, who requested anonymity, said the government  panel considered the killing of Mr. Mabilangan as a "step  backward" for the peace process.    In a statement, [former] Ambassador Howard Dee, chairman of  the government panel traced Mr. Mabilangan's death to the rift  within the communist movement and appealed to all factions "to  allow the spirit of The Hague Declaration to prevail within  their own movement and to commit themselves to a just and  peaceful resolution of the armed conflict."    The government negotiator said the panel believes violence  within the movement will affect the peace process in a negative  manner.    Another source disclosed the strong possibility the NDF will  further delay the resumption of the second round of exploratory  talks with government. The NDF's attempt to consolidate its  forces in the past had become even more impossible with the  death of the NPA Banahaw Command's former leader, he said,  adding the killing had also dampened the image of the movement,  while the government benefited from it.    He added, however, that the incident might affect the  success  of the government's amnesty program. "The NPA might have  finished Comrade Hector off in order to show others who are  planning to avail of the amnesty what the NPA can do to them,"  he said.    Meanwhile, President Ramos said Mr. Mabilangan's killers are  not qualified to apply for the government's amnesty program as  the act was plain "murder" and not done in furtherance of a  political goal.    Satur Ocampo, former chief NDF spokesman, defended the  military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, saying  the Melito Glor Command, which operates in Southern Tagalog and  is headed by Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal, had found Comrade  Hector guilty of crimes punishable by death.    The command has the right to dispense justice to the crimes  he committed against many people and the Ramos administration  has failed in this respect," he said.    Mr. Ocampo added the "people's court" has evidence of his  involvement in activities against the CPP, showing he was killed  in order to preserve the movement.    Mr. Ocampo said he was not surprised by the president's  pronouncement because "it has been a policy of government to  file common criminal charges to our brothers in the movement,  rather than charge them for political offenses. Government has  made members of the CPP suffer multiple layers of injustice  because of this practice."    He also revealed the decision of the "people's court" who  found Mabilangan guilty of crimes such as involvement in  kidnapping and other "anti-revolutionary activities" will be  reviewed by a higher court.    Mr. Ocampo said a CPP national court will be tasked to study  the decision of the NPA Southern Tagalog Regional Command.    "We will see to it that all the requirements for death  penalty were fulfilled. The leadership will check if the order  came with authority and if there was a failure in  implementation," Mr. Ocampo said.    Mabilangan's punishment will also have to be within the  standards of the International Humanitarian Law, he said.    "The NDF is a responsible political organization. We will  not tolerate injustice in our movement," he said.</p>

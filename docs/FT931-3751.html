			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: The components of recovery - The Bottom Line IF YOU go by headline figures alone, it was a good week for three UK makers of motor components. GKN, biggest of the three with annual sales of Pounds 2.53bn, increased pre-tax profits by 77 per cent to Pounds 121.8m. T &amp; N gained 56 per cent to Pounds 63m; BBA, 53 per cent to Pounds 47.4m. They all had a familiar theme: stringent cost-cutting had enabled more profit to be made out of sluggish sales. With the majority of their turnover being overseas, they had some insulation against the prolonged UK recession. It must be said that profits were recovering from a low base. With the new FRS3 accounting rules bringing past rationalisation costs above the line, GKN's 1991 pre-tax profit was reduced to a third of 1989's Pounds 206m peak. More ominously, none of them bounced back far enough to cover their dividend payments, which exceeded earnings per share for the second year running. GKN's earnings were not far off its 20.5p pay-out, but T &amp; N managed to cover only 55 per cent of its 10.85p dividend. All three have made little change to the payments in three years, inspiring relief among investors, who may have feared cuts, and consternation among observers who believe too much has been distributed. It would be wrong, however, to over-stress the comparability of the three stocks and, as the chart shows, the market has treated them very differently over the past six years. GKN is the only one to have recovered the ground lost when cyclical stocks were out of favour. Before the UK recession hit, its core businesses were settled, particularly driveline components and pallet hire. 'It had stopped mucking about,' said one analyst, whereas both T &amp; N and BBA had incomplete hands and kept acquiring. A related strength has been the much-admired GKN balance sheet. Net debt has nearly halved since December 1989. Its latest figure for debt-equity gearing was only 23 per cent, compared with 61 per cent for BBA and 45 per cent for T &amp; N - rising to 60 later this year when a German acquisition is brought in. At the other end of the scale T &amp; N has effected the biggest transformation from the least promising roots: in asbestos-ridden building materials. This has, however, been funded by a string of rights issues. The sheer weight of shares coupled with weak earnings has hit the price. Its 1987 issue - post the AE acquisition - was priced at 205p; its 1991 issue - post JPI in the US  -was only 140p. BBA comes in between. It has settled down since its 1991 rights issue, which eased the balance sheet after 14 deals in less than three years. Indeed it has made a virtue of being more of an industrial holding company than an auto engineer, playing down its dependence on any one market. With 35 per cent of sales derived from north America, it is the best placed to benefit from the recovery under way there. Although only BBA's share price made progress this week, all three stocks are trading near their 12-month highs. There is one big question that affects their prospects: how far will the continental European car market fall this year? Forecasts from the car makers make sobering reading. Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, recently said new car sales in western Europe were expected to fall from 13.4m to 12.3m this year, with Germany, Italy, France and Spain all in retreat. GKN is thought to have the most exposure to the continent - although T &amp; N is making a German acquisition just as that market dips. Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman and chief executive, said this week that any financial progress this year would again depend mainly on the group's ability to cut costs and improve productivity. That means more job losses - a pattern echoed elsewhere. If doubts creep in about the prospects for earnings growth, worries will also recur about dividends. Those who have trusted the dogged determination to maintain, characterised by Colin Hope at T &amp; N, have been rewarded in terms of yield. The companies, however, have dipped into their reserves and been hit through the tax system  -hence Sir David's call for ACT relief in the Budget.</p>

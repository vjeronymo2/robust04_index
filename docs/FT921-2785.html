			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Jobs: How Europe's bosses fare for company cars - Survey shows UK third to Ireland and Portugal in league for four-wheeled perks IF Daniel Goeudevert happens to be reading today, the Jobs column hopes he'll realise it has nothing personal against him. Even more so, it hopes he will accept that it has no bias in favour of Ferdinand Piech. The survey whose findings are about to be reported was made independently by a highly reputed organisation: the management consultancy arm of the worldwide Wyatt company. Before describing the findings, however, I'd better tell anyone else who may be reading the reasons for all the above pussy-footing. They are threefold. The Volkswagen group's management-board chairman Carl Hahn is due to retire, and the two gentlemen aforementioned are believed to be running wheel-to-wheel for the succession, which is expected to be decided on April 10. The part of the group currently headed by Daniel Goeudevert is the VW marque, whereas Ferdinand Piech is responsible for Audi. The survey in question focuses on the provision of company cars in 17 countries in Europe. It shows that Audi's 100 series of models continues to lead the European popularity league for management chariots - as it has done since at least 1988 - with the VW marque relatively nowhere. Even so, let's leave leadership contests aside for the moment and consider the survey, which Wyatt carries out every two years from its office in Brussels. The 1991-92 version is based on data from some 1,700 employers. The biggest national sample was Belgium's 277, and the smallest Finland's 53, the United Kingdom having 147. To anyone like the Jobs column - who having no company car, has only an onlooker's interest in same - the information in the study seems almost stupefyingly detailed. It includes, for instance, the pro-portions of companies in each land providing different sorts of staff with a variety of optional extras (given Britain's weather, its employers appear unduly generous if not lavish with sunroofs). But readers curious about such refinements will need to obtain the full report, priced Pounds 510, from Don McClune of Wyatt UK at 21 Tothill St, London SW1H 9LL; telephone 071-222 8033, fax 071-222 9182. My extracts are far more limited, the first being the table alongside. It shows the percentages of chief executives, various types of other directors, and two kinds of middle managers who enjoy a company car in each of the 17 countries. The ranking is based on the average provision across the whole lot, and by that measure the UK has fallen to third place from top in 1989-90. Whether its overall leadership will be restored by the latest budget in combination with the result of the impending election, we can only wait and see. But despite the increased taxation of recent years, Britain remains well ahead in one category. It is shown in the last column of the table: the award of four-wheeled perks to middle managers other than those in sales and marketing where a car is far more often a necessity of the job. Unlike the table's figures, the popularity ranking of types of car does not appear in the survey. I compile it from the companies' listings of their preferred models, giving four points to the type most often named, two to the second most frequent, and one to the third. Where each type stands in the league depends on the percentage of the total points it scores. In doing so, however, I take no account of detailed variants. My focus is solely on series such as Audi 100s, all of which are lumped together regardless of variances in engine, plushiness of trimmings and the like. In all, 50 series were mentioned in the latest survey compared with 61 two years before. To start at the top, the five most popular chief executives' cars were:  ----------------------------------- Make &amp; series of car   % of points  ----------------------------------- BMW 5                      19.3 Audi 100                   15.1 Volvo 700                   8.4 Mercedes 200                7.5 Saab 9000                   7.5  ----------------------------------- Moving down a notch to other directors, we find the top five were:  ----------------------------------- Audi 100                   12.5 Ford Scorpio/Granada       10.4 BMW 5                       8.5 Renault 25                  7.8 Opel Omega                  7.5  ----------------------------------- The middle managers' list was:  ----------------------------------- Peugeot 405                 9.2 Audi 100                    8.0 Ford Sierra                 8.0 Renault 21                  7.1 Opel Vectra                 6.7  ----------------------------------- (Opel Omegas and Vectras are equivalent to Vauxhall Carltons and Cavaliers.) For all management levels taken together, the top 10 were:  ----------------------------------- Audi 100                   11.9 Ford Scorpio/Granada        9.3 BMW 5                       8.2 Renault 25                  6.8 Opel Omega                  6.2 Volvo 700                   5.3 Mercedes 200                4.5 Peugeot 405                 4.1 Renault 21                  3.4 Ford Sierra                 3.2  ----------------------------------- Alas for Daniel Goeudevert, Volkswagen's best series was the Passat, ranked 28th with 0.7 per cent of the available points.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Feb 17 (AFP) -- President Boris Yeltsin has  returned to his dacha outside Moscow to recover from a cold  after briefly coming to Moscow to meet British Prime Minister  John Major, a spokesman said Thursday.    Yeltsin, 63, interrupted a week's rest on Tuesday [15  February] to meet with Major, but then returned Wednesday to his  residence in Zavidovo, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of  Moscow, where he was still resting Thursday, spokesman Dimitriy  Shevchenko told AFP.    "The president is suffering from a cold, nothing more," the  spokesman said, adding that any "political speculation" about  his health was "unpatriotic."    Yeltsin apparently caught cold on February 3, during an  official visit to Georgia. He rescheduled his budget statement  to parliament, originally due on Friday, for February 24.    His ill health came at a time of high diplomatic tensions  over NATO's threat to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they do not pull  back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by midnight GMT Sunday.  Russia opposes the ultimatum.    Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton tried unsuccessfully  for two days to reach Yeltsin at his dacha to discuss the  crisis. Washington blamed the failed communications on  "technical" problems. The two men finally talked on Friday.</p>

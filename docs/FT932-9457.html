			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong, Singapore advance to record highs THE NIKKEI average retreated 1.5 per cent in the absence of market-moving news as heavy sales of futures contracts and subsequent arbitrage activity fuelled a broad sell-off, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed 325.17 lower at 20,615.20, after moving between 20,416.12 and 20,939.87. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 26.89 at 1,608,94, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.19 to 1,244.41. Volume was estimated at 580m shares, compared with Tuesday's 696m. Declines overwhelmed rises by 796 to 284, with 110 issues unchanged. Brokers attributed the day's fall to technical dealings, resulting in the unwinding of long positions by arbitrageurs. Mr Norio Okutsu, a manager of futures and options trading at Nikko Securities, said the rapid selling of futures contracts carried over into the cash market. The Nikkei's decline accelerated further once investment trusts, individuals and dealers joined the selling spree and relinquished some of their shares, he added. An analyst at a UK securities company said some western-based investors sold shares on speculation that the dollar may strengthen further against the yen. Large-capital electrical issues moved into negative territory. Toshiba slipped Y25 to Y711 and Hitachi Y21 to Y890. Profit-taking pushed consumer electronics lower: Sony shed Y150 to Y4,780, TDK Y60 to Y3,940 and Pioneer Electronic Y20 to Y2,630. NEC receded Y20 to Y1,000, Fujitsu Y22 to Y760 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y17,000 to Y944,000. Securities firms also lost ground on profit-taking: Nomura was down Y50 to Y2,160, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,300 and Nikko Y40 to Y1,070. In contrast, Shionogi, the pharmaceutical company and the most active issue of the day, climbed Y60 to Y1,100. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 379.62 at 22,772.62 in volume of 24.3m shares. Roundup POLITICAL AND corporate developments helped some of the Pacific Rim markets to higher levels. HONG KONG punched through the 7,000 milestone for the first time on continued optimism after Tuesday's Sino-British agreement on land sales in the coming year. Mr Johathan Dennis of HG Asia said the agreement was seen by the market as further evidence that China did not want to undermine Hong Kong in the longer term. The Hang Seng index added 160.63, or 2.35 per cent, at 7,002.60 after Tuesday's 103-point rise. Turnover swelled to HKDollars 5.69bn from HKDollars 4.24bn. The index has climbed 25 per cent since October 7 when Governor Chris Patten unveiled the political reform proposals that sparked a bitter row with China and caused the market to dive. Cheung Kong topped the active list and rose 90 cents to HKDollars 28.20. Hongkong Land was also 90 cents stronger, at HKDollars 14.70. Henderson Land advanced HKDollars 1.30, or 6.4 per cent, to HKDollars 21.60 on news that it is considering spinning off its China operations for a separate listing. SINGAPORE also closed at a record high, with strong institutional demand taking the Straits Times Industrial index 34.54 ahead to 1,828.58. The market moved ahead strongly from the opening, led by demand for Sembawang Shipyard shares and warrants on news of its tentative agreement to help build a power plant in Suzhou in China. Sembawang shares and 1994 warrants each put on 70 cents at SDollars 12.60 and SDollars 6.80 respectively. AUSTRALIA saw the All Ordinaries index rise 8.3 to 1,695.7 in ADollars 417.35m turnover. News Corp, which announced a 133 per cent jump in net profits for the three months to end-March, appreciated 37 cents to ADollars 7.77. Westpac finished 11 cents weaker at ADollars 3.66, but there were worries that the stock would drop further after Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings agreed to sell its 10 per cent stake to Lend Lease at ADollars 3.50 a share. BANGKOK moved strongly ahead as gains by leading property groups and finance and brokerage companies spurred demand. The SET index advanced 15.30, or 1.8 per cent, to 865.65. JAKARTA ended higher across the board in active trade after foreigners bought blue chips and local investors sought speculative shares. The official index rose 0.86 per cent to a 10-month high of 319.12. TAIWAN moved forward in moderate trade on hopes of a cut in official interest rates. The weighted index gained 39.72 at 4,718.23. SEOUL was marginally lower in moderate trading in spite of institutional buying which clawed back much of an early loss. The stock index ended 1.28 easier at 700.08.</p>

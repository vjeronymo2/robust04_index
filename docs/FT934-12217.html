			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (5): Fresh confidence among army chiefs  -Security MORE than 300 people were killed and hundreds injured earlier this month in one of the fiercest battles of the 11-year war between Sri Lanka's armed forces and Tamil Tiger guerrillas. But political and military observers say what was unusual about the battle for Kilaly - a small guerrilla port on the edge of the Jaffna lagoon - was not the scale of the action but the fact that seven Sri Lankan army officers were killed in the fighting. Army officers, members of a once largely ceremonial force, have not been noted for leading from the front. But after nearly a year of inactivity following the deaths of several senior commanders in a land-mine explosion, there is now a new grit and determination at the top in Sri Lanka's 80,000-strong army. The country's senior military commanders, confident they have the country's troubled Eastern province under control, say they have at last been given the go-ahead to retake the rebel-held northern peninsula of Jaffna, from which they were expelled in humiliating circumstances in 1990. This confidence appears to be percolating down to even the most battle-weary of frontline officers. President D. B. Wijetunga - angered by earlier political prevarication, the assassination in May of President Ranasinghe Premadasa and the high cost of a war that has claimed 32,000 lives - has publicly vowed to crush terrorism. Not for him the policy of his predecessor who accomodated guerrillas in five-star hotels. Mr Wijetunga appears to believe it is not possible to negotiate with Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, the autocratic and militarily brilliant leader of the Tigers. 'There is no ethnic problem in the north, only terrorism,' says Mr Wijetunga. Defence Department officials refuse to say when the main offensive across the war-torn Jaffna peninsula - also home to about 600,000 Tamil civilians - is likely to be launched. But military commanders hint that it could come next year. The army has already started building up its strength. Ten thousand new recruits are under training and more are expected. The total complement may end up at about 100,000 men. The military plans to buy helicopter gunships, landing craft and fast patrol boats for the confrontation with an estimated 3,000-4,000 well-armed and trained guerrillas who have been fighting for an independent Tamil homeland. Part of the explanation for the more determined political will in Colombo, and the army's new confidence, may lie in the recent success the military has had in bringing an element of normality back to the country's troubled Eastern province. Less than three years ago, the province's two main cities of Trincomalee and Batticalore were in rebel hands and large tracts of the mixed Tamil, Moslem and Singhalese province were no-go areas to the army and the civil authorities. Today, most of the province is under government control, at least during the day, and many Tamil Tiger guerrillas based in the area appear to have fled north to the Jaffna peninsula. The government is planning to hold local elections in the Eastern province in February and, later in the year, a referendum on whether to merge with the country's northern province. If local elections are successful, tens of thousands of Sri Lankan troops could be released for duty in Jaffna. President Wijetunga, who is also Sri Lanka's finance minister, is intent on trying to catapult his country into the ranks of the newly industrialised nations by the beginning of the next century, and is only too well aware of the heavy economic toll the war is taking on a country where many still live below the poverty line. To finance soaring war costs the government has recently been forced to impose a special defence levy of 3 per cent on all transactions, operating in a manner similar to value added tax. This year, direct military expenditure is expected to total more than SLRs20bn - about 15 per cent of the budget - but at least the same amount again is spent on feeding and rehabilitating the war-torn civilian population in the north and east. Thousands of foreign investors have been frightened away by the fighting and many believe the number of tourist arrivals could climb to more than 1m within a few years if the war was ended. The economy of Jaffna, once the biggest supplier of fish and cash crops in Sri Lanka, is at a standstill and tourists no longer visit the East with its fabulous beaches. President Wijetunga appears to be willing to stake all on the attempt to recapture the Jaffna peninsula guerrilla stronghold by force in an attempt to bring the war to a swift conclusion. A brief glance at the map would seem to suggest that the army is in an excellent position to launch an offensive. It has a series of army-controlled zones ringing the peninsula: at Palaly in the north it controls Jaffna city's airport in a zone 20km wide and 5km deep; across a sunken bridge to the west of the city it controls a number of sizeable islands; and to the south-east it has cut off the peninsula from the Sri Lankan mainland by linking its Elephant Pass army base to the sea. But the war in the north is a classic guerrilla action, fought by the most tenacious and fanatical of men and women, as the recent battle of Kilaly showed. On the second day of the army advance from its base at Elephant pass, a carefully dug-in group of 1,000 guerrillas took the Sri Lankan forces by surprise and in bitter hand-to-hand fighting killed 118 soldiers. Hardcore guerrillas, led by a daring military strategist, may number little more than 5,000 throughout Sri Lanka, but they were able to defeat 120,000 Indian troops in the late 1980s. Every combatant carries a cyanide pill around the neck, which they swallow rather than allow themselves to be taken prisoner alive. There may be fewer guerrillas, and less well-trained, than when they pushed the Indians out and when they controlled much of the Eastern province, but they remain as ruthless and are still able to assassinate politicians and military commanders. There is some evidence they may no longer have such fierce support from the Tamil population in Jaffna. Creation of Tamil Eelam (the rebel's free state) is as far away as ever and some locals have dared to speak out against a guerrilla force, whose tax collecting ability at home and abroad, is legendary. But after a decade of indoctrination most ordinary Tamils in Jaffna still fear Sri Lanka's 'Singhalese Buddhist army' more. Even if Tamil civilians did not fight voluntarily they might be forced into battle on the side of the guerrillas. It is by no means certain that the Sri Lankan armed forces could march into Jaffna city without killing on the way tens of thousands of civilians in the densely-populated province. House-to-house fighting in the city could be even bloodier, and the question no one seems able to answer with confidence is whether the army yet has the numbers, ability and determination to retain control of the peninsula once it has marched in.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Timex workforce takes arguments back to court: The acrimonious background to today's appeal by the unions TIMEX had to sack its entire manual workforce to save the business after failing to reach agreement on settling an industrial dispute, Mr Peter Hall, UK president of the company, said yesterday. His decision sparked angry scenes outside the gates of the Dundee plant, with 5,000 marching through the town in support of the Timex workers last Saturday - 16 were arrested outside the plant on Monday in the worst picket-line violence for seven years. At the same time the company has been vigourosly pursuing its case through the courts. The Court of Session in Edinburgh should today hear an appeal by the trade unions against an interdict (injunction) banning mass picketing outside the Dundee plant. Inside the factory, on an industrial estate on the edge of the city, the newly hired labour force is assembling printed circuit boards and other products. 'Output is rising and productivity is increasing,' says Mr Hall. 'We will progressively strengthen the workforce as new contracts build up in the coming months.' The 200 newly hired manual workers have to run the gauntlet of about 150 sacked employees, most of them middle-aged women, as they arrived in two chartered double-decker buses each morning. At 7.40am yesterday there were ferocious shouts of 'scab' as the buses went through the gates, and staff arriving by car were jeered. Five weeks ago Mr Hall dismissed all 320 of Timex's hourly paid workers and pronounced the industrial dispute which had led to a 20-day strike over. But the demonstrators at the gate, whose ranks on Monday were swollen by protestors including members of Militant from other parts of Scotland, regard the issue as anything but dead. 'We're prepared to dig in for a long dispute,' says Mr Willie Lesslie deputy shop stewards' convener, outside the gates. 'From what we hear it's a complete shambles in there. Either they'll have to take us all back to get production going again, or Timex will have to close the plant.' The workers seem fairly sparse in the 150,000 sq ft plant but production is visibly under way. The main role of the Dundee plant - an offshoot of Timex, the unquoted US company whose main product is watches - is 'populating' or installing tiny components onto printed circuit boards, the basic building block of electronic products such as personal computers. Mr Hall arrived in 1991 from the south of England, where he had managed two engineering businesses which collapsed in the recession. He says he tried to improve performance by quarterly briefings. The workers already owned 10 per cent of Timex Electronics, the Scottish subsidiary company, through a share scheme. There was pro-fit-sharing and an employee director on the board. At the end of 1992 the 13 shop stewards elected a new convener and deputy convener, and two other members of the shop stewards' committee resigned. In Mr Hall's view 'the link I had had with the workforce was broken.' Outside the gates a man who has been sacked says: 'It's Hall that's created this trouble. This was a contented place until he arrived. It's been confrontation all along.' New problems arose because of 'degradation' of the order book for the early part of 1993. The unions demanded that the necessary cuts be spread by rotation, management insisted on making a single group of workers redundant. At the end of January most of the workforce went on strike. After 21 days the workers agreed to go back to work under protest, but rejected what Mr Hall calls a four-point peace plan which entailed job cuts without rotation, a one year pay freeze, reduced fringe benefits and an enhancement of the profit sharing scheme so that the employees would have enjoyed 50 per cent of the plant's profits. On February 17 Timex dismissed all the hourly paid workers, including 17 who worked through the dispute. He said he had been advised by lawyers that he had to sack all those who 'had an interest in the dispute'. Timex recruited 200 new workers, some of whom had previously had temporary jobs at the plant. He says production did not stop after the sackings because of the efforts of supervisors and other staff. The company is fortunate that this is normally a low season for electronics subcontracting, but business is expected to be strong in the second half of the year. Timex points out that under employment laws the dismissed employees will be eligible for rehiring three months after their sacking. It says it will consider that when the time comes. Many of those sacked had been with Timex for more than 20 years - some as many as 36.</p>

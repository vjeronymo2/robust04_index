He said: "I have an optimistic attitude toward the prospects  of exchanges between the Chinese and U.S. armed forces."

General Zhang Wannian said China and the United States are  two big countries which make an impact on the world. They have  common interests but also have differences. This an objective  fact. Either good or bad relations between China and the United  States will have a great impact on the peace and stability of  Asia and the world as a whole. Some differences between the two  sides can be settled through mutual visits, conversations, and  discussions between leaders of the two sides.    Zhang Wannian stressed that China pursues a national defense  policy of positive defense. The fact that China develops some  military equipment is entirely to meet the needs of defending  our own country and will never threaten others.    General Zhang Wannian told the guests that the whole party,  the whole armed forces, and all the people of China are  wholeheartedly carrying out economic construction in accordance  with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. China is full of confidence about attaining  her strategic goals.    Paul Cerjan said that the United States supports China's  modernization and supports a stable China because this is  conducive to the peace and stability of the region and the world  as a whole.    Lieutenant General Paul Cerjan said that U.S. Assistant  Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman also held that his visit to  China last year was a success and is looking forward to Deputy  Chief of General Staff Xu Huizi's visit to the United States.    Paul Cerjan said that U.S. military are very interested in  developing exchanges with the Chinese armed forces. Such  exchanges have restarted at present and are hoped to become more  and more in future.    Paul Cerjan and his party arrived in Beijing by invitation  on  15 January for an eight-day visit to China. This is the first  U.S. military delegation to visit China since Charles Freeman's  visit, assistant secretary of defense of the United States.

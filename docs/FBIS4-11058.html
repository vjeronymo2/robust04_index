			<p>BFN     [Text] Special Prosecutor for Terrorist Crimes Daniel  Espichan Tumay today categorically rejected any interference  from foreign organizations in judging Peruvian laws for fighting  against terrorism. In reference to the comments made by  President Alberto Fujimori, he said the demands of Amnesty  International will not be met.    [Begin recording] [Espichan] Why do we have to accept orders  from foreigners, from people who are not aware of our problems  or of what we have to do? I believe that here in Peru we have  very intelligent people, well educated people, who know the  problem of terrorism. We therefore do not have to accept any  indications from anyone. We are handling the situation  ourselves, and are winning this war. I therefore believe that  the instructions given by the president are correct.    [Unidentified reporter] Does the fact that they were not  allowed to meet with some officials mean abroad that something  was being hidden?    [Espichan] No, because the International Red Cross, which is  a very important world organization, is authorized by law to  visit the inmates held on charges of terrorism in Peru, and they  can give the necessary information to any international  organization that wants to verify the situation of the  terrorists.

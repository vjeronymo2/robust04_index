			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / EC 'ice-cream' men play crucial role CALLED the ice-cream men by their supporters, but lackeys of Germany by their opponents, the white-uniformed EC observers have played a crucial role in trying to monitor 15 ceasefires since arriving in Croatia last August, writes Judy Dempsey. The 170 unarmed monitors have worked indefatigably from their headquarters in Hotel 'I' in Zagreb. Their task initially was to supervise the implementation of ceasefires forged by the EC with the federal army, Croatia's national guard, and Serb and Croat paramilitary units. But, since September, they have been involved in setting up negotiations to secure the peaceful withdrawal of soldiers from federal army garrisons in Croatia. Above all, they have attempted to set up confidence-building measures.</p>
